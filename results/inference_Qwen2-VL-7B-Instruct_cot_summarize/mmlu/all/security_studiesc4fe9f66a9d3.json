Regarding this tension between R2P and notions of sovereignty, which of the following is not an accurate statement?\n\nA. In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security.\nB. In order to transcend the intervention-vs.-sovereignty debate, R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty.\nC. In order to facilitate the deployment of effective humanitarian intervention, the R2P approach redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty.\nD. The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens.\n"
