He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle\nC. Glycogenolysis in the liver\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues\n"

Glycogenolysis in the liver\n\nGlycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen ( (a storage form of glucose) into glucose in the liver. This process helps to maintain blood glucose levels by releasing glucose into the bloodstream when needed. After a meal, the liver stores excess glucose as glycogen, and during fasting or periods of low glucose availability, it releases glucose back into the bloodstream to maintain blood glucose levels within the reference range."
