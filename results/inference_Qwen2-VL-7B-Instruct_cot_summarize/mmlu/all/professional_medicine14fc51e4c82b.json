The symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico. He appears ill and lethargic and can barely answer questions. His temperature is 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae. Examination of the right upper extremity shows an erythematous, solid, tender mass on the underside of the upper extremity just above the elbow; the mass is draining blood and necrotic material. The most effective antibiotic for this patient\u2019s disorder will interfere with which of the following cellular processes or enzymes?\n\nA. DNA helicase\nB. Glucuronosyltransferase\nC. Proteasomal degradation\nD. Ribosomal assembly\n"

The most effective antibiotic for RMSF is doxycycline, which is a tetracycline antibiotic. Tetracyclines antibiotics interfere with the bacterial ribosomal assembly process, which is necessary for bacterial protein synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Ribosomal assembly."
