He then took them to the scene of the murder where they found the victim's body. By the next day, the man claimed that \"voices\" had ordered him to confess and he didn't act voluntarily. A physician verified that the man suffered from hallucinations that impaired his volitional abilities, preventing a voluntary confession. Will the court suppress the statements?\n\nA. Yes, he was insane and could not have given a voluntary confession.\nB. Yes, the police overreached by not having him mentally evaluated before questioning him.\nC. No, there was no police misconduct or overreaching, and as a result the confession is voluntary.\nD. No, a confession is admissible when accompanied by actions by the defendant that prove the truth of the statements.\n"

Yes, he was insane and could not have given a voluntary confession.\n\nThe man's claim that he was under the influence of voices and that these voices ordered him to confess indicates that he was not acting voluntarily. The physician's verification of his hallucinations and their impact on his volitional abilities further supports this claim. In many jurisdictions, a confession given while under the influence of hallucinations or other mental impairments may be considered involuntary and therefore inadmissible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, he was insane and could not have given a voluntary confession."
