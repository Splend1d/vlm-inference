B is perpendicular to the surface.\n\nMaxwell's equations, particularly Gauss's law for magnetism ( \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0\\) ( and the fact that the electric field inside a superconductor is zero ( \\(\\mathbf{E} = 0\\) under ideal conditions, imply that the magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) must be perpendicular to the surface of the superconductor. This is because the divergence of the magnetic field is zero everywhere, and since the electric field is zero inside the superconductor, the only way for the divergence to be zero is if the magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the surface."
