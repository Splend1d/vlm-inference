During finals at the end of the fall semester, the student was caught cheating. His chemistry professor saw him looking at a fellow student's exam paper and copying the answers to three multiple choice questions. The professor notified the honor committee, which immediately found an honor code violation and ordered that the student receive a failing grade in the course. In addition, in accordance with the rules of the university, the student's financial aid was terminated. The student filed a lawsuit seeking reinstatement of his financial aid. The student's only argument was that his due process rights were violated in that he did not receive a notice of, or a hearing on, the alleged honor code violation. Which of the following facts, if true, would be most helpful to the student?\n\nA. The university was in financial difficulties and could not meet its payroll expenses.\nB. The university did not re-allocate the student's financial aid to another deserving student.\nC. The university received support from the state.\nD. The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date.\n"

To strengthen this argument, the student would need evidence that he was not given an opportunity to present his case or to contest the charges against him.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The university was in financial difficulties and could not meet its payroll expenses.\n- This fact does not directly address the student's due process claim. It is irrelevant to the issue of whether the student was given a fair hearing.\n\nB. The university did not re-allocate the student's financial aid to another deserving student.\n- This fact is also irrelevant to the issue of due process. It does not address whether the student was given a fair hearing or the opportunity to contest the charges.\n\nC. The university received support from the state.\n- This fact is also irrelevant to the issue of due process. It does not address whether the student was given a fair hearing or the opportunity to contest the charges.\n\nD. The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date.\n- This fact directly addresses the student's due process claim. If the student was sent a letter advising him of the hearing date, it indicates that he was given an opportunity to attend the hearing and present his case, which would support his argument that his due process rights were not violated.\n\nTherefore, the fact that most helps the student's argument is:\n\nD. The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date."
