This is because a basis is defined as a linearly independent set of vectors that spans the vector space. Therefore, any linearly independent set of vectors must be contained within a basis that spans the vector space.\n\nStatement 2 is True. If \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\) are bases for the same vector space, then the number of vectors in each basis must be the same. This is because a basis is a minimal spanning set, and the dimension of the vector space is defined as the number of vectors in any basis. Therefore, if \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\) are both bases for the same vector space, they must have the same number of vectors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
