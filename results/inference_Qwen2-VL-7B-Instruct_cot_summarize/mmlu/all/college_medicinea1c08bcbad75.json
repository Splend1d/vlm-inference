At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher\u2019s observation?\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\nD.

Let's analyze each option in the context of the teacher's reward system:\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\n- This option suggests that the variable ratio schedule ( (giving stickers for tardiness) is creating strong responses and behavior that is resistant to extinction. However, this does not directly explain why performance on quizzes has increased significantly while tardiness has only decreased slightly.\n\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\n- This option suggests that the students are more motivated to perform well on quizzes than to show up on time. This could explain why performance on quizzes has increased significantly, but it does not explain why tardiness has only decreased slightly.\n\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\n- This option suggests that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule ( (giving stickers for tardiness) than to a continuous reinforcement schedule. This could explain why tardiness has only decreased slightly, but it does not explain why performance on quizzes has increased significantly.\n\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.\n- This option suggest that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule ( (giving stickers for tardiness) than to a variable-interval schedule. This could explain why tardiness has only decreased slightly, but it does not explain why performance on quizzes has increased significantly.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\n\nThis option suggests that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule ( (giving stickers for tardiness) than to a continuous reinforcement schedule. This that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule ( (giving stickers for tardiness) than to a continuous reinforcement schedule. This could explain why tardiness has only decreased slightly, but it does not explain why performance on quizzes has increased significantly."
