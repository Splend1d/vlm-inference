One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine if there is evidence in the passage that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia, we need to carefully analyze each option provided:\n\nA. They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols.\n- The passage mentions that the king sits in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. However, it does not specify the origin of these horses. While it might be plausible that the horses could have come from the Mongols, the passage does not provide direct evidence of this.\n\nB. The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow.\n- The passage mentions that people who profess the same religion as the king fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads as a way of greeting him. This is described as their way of greeting, but it does not explicitly mention the kow-tow, which is a specific Chinese greeting.\n\nC. The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\n- The passage states that the king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. It does not specify the origin of these gold and jewels, but it is plausible that they could have come from India, given the historical trade routes between India and Africa.\n\nD. The people in his court wore silk robes.\n- The passage mentions that all other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. This implies that silk robes were available in the region, but it does not explicitly state that they were imported from Asia.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most compelling evidence that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia is:\n\nC. The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\n\nThis option provides a plausible connection to trade with Asia, specifically India, given the historical trade routes and the nature of the goods mentioned."
