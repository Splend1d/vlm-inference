Fearing that the girl would beat out her daughter for the last cheerleading position, the mother decided to kill the girl. One night while the mother and her boyfriend were having dinner, the mother asked him to kill the girl. The mother handed her boyfriend a gun and gave him the home address where the girl lived. Unknown to the boyfriend, the mother gave him the wrong address. By mistake, the boyfriend went to the home of a family who lived across the street from the girl. The boyfriend rang the doorbell and a woman opened the door. The boyfriend asked the woman if her daughter was home. The woman called for her daughter to come to the front door. When she did so, the boyfriend shot and killed both the woman and her daughter. The mother should be found guilty for which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Conspiracy and voluntary manslaughter.\nB. Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.\nC. Solicitation and two counts of murder.\nD. Solicitation and attempted murder.\n"

Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of of murder.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the crimes:\n\n1. **Conspiracy**: The mother and her boyfriend had a mutual agreement to commit murder. The fact that the boyfriend went to the wrong address and killed the wrong people does not negate the conspiracy.\n\n2. **Attempteded Murder**: The boyfriend attempted to murder the girl by shooting at her home. Although he killed the wrong people, the attempt to murder the intended victim (the girl) is still considered an attempt.\n\n3. **Two Counts of Murder**: The boyfriend killed two people (the woman and her daughter. This counts as two separate murders.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- **A. Conspiracy and voluntary manslaughter**: Voluntary manslaughter typically involves a killing that is committed in the heat of passion after provocation. The mother's actions do not fit this description.\n- **C. Solicitation and two counts of of murder**: Solicitation involves encouraging someone else to commit a crime. The mother did not solicit the boyfriend to kill the girl, but rather asked him to kill her daughter. The boyfriend's actions were not solicited by the mother.\n- **D. Solicitation and attempted murder**: Solicitation is not applicable here because the mother did not solicit the boyfriend to kill the girl. The boyfriend's actions were not solicited by the mother."
