This is because the opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative she could have chosen. Since she chose to study, it means the benefit she gets from studying is greater than $8.\n\n2. **Option B: The opportunity cost of studying is $14, which is less than the benefit received from studying.**\n   - The opportunity cost of studying is the value of the next best alternative, which is $8 ( (babysittinging). Since the opportunity cost is $8, not $14, this option is incorrect.\n\n3. **Option C: Nancy is indifferent to both studying and mowing the lawn.**\n   - Nancy has chosen to study, which means she is not indifferent to studying. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n4. **Option D: Nancy's behavior is irrational, since babysittinging was clearly superior to all other options.**\n   - Nancy chose to study, which means she valued studying more than babysittinging. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. The benefit received from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.**"
