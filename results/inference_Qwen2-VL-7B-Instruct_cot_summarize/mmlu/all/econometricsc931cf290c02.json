(ii) and (iv) only.\n\nVariance decomposition analysis in the context of Vector Autoregressions (VARs is a method used to decompose the forecast error variance of a variable into the contributions of shocks to all the variables in the system. Here's a breakdown of the statements:\n\ni) Variance decompositions measure the impact of a unit shock to each of the variables on the VAR. This statement is incorrect. Variance decompositions do not measure the impact of a unit shock to each variable on the VAR. Instead, they decompose the forecast error variance of a variable into the contributions of shocks to all the variables in the system.\n\nii) Variance decompositions can be thought of as measuring the proportion of the forecast error variance that is attributable to each variable. This statement is correct. Variance decompositions do measure the proportion of the forecast error variance that is attributable to each variable.\n\niii) The ordering of the variables is important for calculating impulse responses but not variance decompositions. This statement is incorrect. The ordering of the variables is important for both impulse responses and variance decompositions.\n\niv) It is usual that most of the forecast error variance for a given variable is attributable to shocks to that variable. This statement is correct. In a well-specified VAR model, it is common for most of the forecast error variance for a given variable to be attributable to shocks to that variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. (ii) and (iv) only."
