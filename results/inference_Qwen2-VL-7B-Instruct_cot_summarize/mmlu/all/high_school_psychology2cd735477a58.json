All students who attend the Peddie School study Latin.\n2. Some students who study Latin also study calculus.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce that Jerome, being a student at the Peddie School, must study Latin. However, we cannot conclude that Jerome studies calculus or that he studies both calculus and Latin, as the premises do not provide enough information to make these conclusions. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
