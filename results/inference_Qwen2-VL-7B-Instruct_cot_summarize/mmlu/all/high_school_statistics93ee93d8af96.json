In the context of the tissue strength monitoring process, the null hypothesis is that the tissue strength is within specifications. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Halting the production process when sufficient customer complaints are received.\n- This is not a Type I error because customer complaints are not related to the statistical monitoring of tissue strength.\n\nB. Hal halt the production process when the tissue strength is below specifications.\n- This is the correct response to a Type I error because it means stopping the production process when the tissue strength is actually within specifications, which is a false rejection of the null hypothesis.\n\nC. Hal halt the production process when the tissue strength is within specifications.\n- This is not a Type I error because it is correctly following the process when the tissue strength is within specifications.\n\nD. Allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is below specifications.\n- This is not a Type I error because it is a Type II error, which is incorrectly accepting the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Hal halt the production process when the tissue strength is below specifications."
