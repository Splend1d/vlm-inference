Since the reaction is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ag}^+ + \\text{Cl}^- \\rightarrow \\text{AgCl} \\]\n\nThe m mole ratio of AgCl is 1:1, so the mass of AgCl is equal to the mass of Cl-. The m mole ratio of AgCl is 1:1, so the mass of AgCl is equal to the mass of Cl-. The mass of AgCl is 0.435 g.\n\nThe m mole ratio of AgCl is 1:1, so the mass of Cl- is equal to the mass of AgCl, which is 0.435 g.\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage of chlorine in the sample:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of chlorine} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Mass of Cl-}}{\\text{Mass of sample}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of chlorine} = \\left( \\frac{0.435 \\text{ g}}{2.35 \\text{ g}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of chlorine} = 0.184 \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of chlorine} = 18.40\\% \\]\n\nThe closest answer to 18.40% is:\n\nD. 18%"
