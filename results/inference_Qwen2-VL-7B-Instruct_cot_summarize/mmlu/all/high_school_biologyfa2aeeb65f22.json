At the beginning of the experiment, the axon is at rest and has a threshold measured at \u201370 mV at 37oC. The axon receives one stimulus that triggers one action potential in the axon. Subsequent stimuli are much stronger. Which of the following statements explains what happens when several strong stimuli are experienced by the axon?\n\nA. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201390 mV.\nB. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201350 mV.\nC. The strength of the action potential becomes greater.\nD. The frequency of the action potential increases.\n"

This is because the axon has already been depolarized by the first stimulus, and subsequent stimuli will require less depolarization to reach the threshold for an action potential."
