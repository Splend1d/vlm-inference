                    "text": "To determine the best description of the plans being changed, let's analyze the context and the information provided in the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses the Addison's Act, which was intended to address working-class aspirations post-World War I to prevent a revolution similar to the one in Russia. By 1920, the fear of revolution was receding, and the policy was considered extravagant. The Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, which was approved in September 1920, was then deferred by the Government's Housing Board due to budget constraints. In May 1921, the government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing program, reducing the housing target by half.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.\n- This option is somewhat related, but it focuses on welfare programs rather than specifically housing. The passage does mention the fear of revolution and the curtailment of the housing program, but it does not directly discuss welfare programs.\n\nB. Housing was a large part of the British budget.\n- This option is plausible, as the passage mentions the curtailment of the housing program and the reduction in the housing target. However, it does not directly address the specific reason for the change in plans.\n\nC. Workers were threatening communist revolution.\n- This option is directly related to the passage. The passage states that the fear of revolution was receding, and the policy was considered extravagant. This implies that the initial fear of a communist revolution was a significant factor in the initial conception of the Addison's Act.\n\nD. The government Housing Board wanted to build more houses.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. The passage mentions that the Housing Board deferred the scheme due to budget constraints and the curtailment of the housing program.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best description of the plans being changed is:\n\nC. Workers were threatening communist revolution."
