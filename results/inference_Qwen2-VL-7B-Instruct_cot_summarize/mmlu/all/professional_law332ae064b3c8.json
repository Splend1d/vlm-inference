After a few days of picketing, the school board seeks a temporary injunction in the state court to restrain further picketing of the school board. The school board insists that the teachers union has violated Section 101 of the city's picketing ordinance. Section 101 reads as follows:\"Section 101. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to public elementary and secondary schools without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. \"The court will most likely\n\nA. grant relief, because the teachers unionfailed to follow the procedure outlined in theordinance.\nB. grant relief, because the ordinance isconstitutional.\nC. deny relief, because the picketing ordinancewas unconstitutional on its face.\nD. deny relief, because the ordinance does notprovide procedural due process.\n"
