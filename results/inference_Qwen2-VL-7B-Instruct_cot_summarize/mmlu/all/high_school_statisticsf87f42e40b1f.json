Heartaid is more expensive than the currently used medication. The analysis will include a significance test with H0: Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective at preventing heart disease and HA: Heartaid is more effective than the current medication at preventing heart disease. Which of these would be a potential consequence of a Type II error?\n\nA. Patients will spend more money on Heartaid, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.\nB. Doctors will begin to prescribe Heartaid to patients, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.\nC. Patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.\nD. Researchers will calculate the wrong P-value, making their advice to doctors invalid.\n"

Patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.\n\nThis is because a Type II error would lead the study to conclude that there is no significant difference in effectiveness between Heartaid and the current medication, thus patients and doctors would continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective."
