The set \\( aH \\) consists of all elements of the form \\( ah \\) for \\( h \\) in \\( H \\), and \\( Ha \\) consists of all elements of the form \\( ha \\) for \\( h \\) in \\( H \\). Since \\( H \\) is a subgroup, it is closed under the group operation and inverses. Therefore, \\( aH \\) and \\( Ha \\) are both left cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\), and they have the same number of elements. This is a consequence of the fact that left cosets and right cosets of a subgroup have the same cardinality.\n\n### Statement 2\nIf \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) belong to \\( G \\), then \\( aH \\) and \\( Hb \\) are identical or disjoint.\n\nThis statement is also true. The sets \\( aH \\) and \\( Hb \\) are either identical or disjoint. This is because if \\( aH \\) and \\( Hb \\) intersect, then there exists an element \\( h' \\) in \\( H \\) such that \\( ah' = h'b \\). This implies \\( a = h'b^{-1}h' \\), which means \\( a \\) can be written as a product of elements from \\( H \\) and \\( H \\) ( (since \\( H \\) is a subgroup). This shows that \\( a \\) is in \\( H \\), and thus \\( aH \\) and \\( Hb \\) intersect. If they do not intersect, then they are disjoint.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
