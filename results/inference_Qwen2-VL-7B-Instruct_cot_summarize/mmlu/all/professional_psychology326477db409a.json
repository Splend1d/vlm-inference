Case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized\n\nCase studies are typically used to provide in-depth, detailed examination of a single case or phenomenon. They are not primarily used for attitude measurement, preferences, or satisfaction ( (A), nor are they used as pilot studies to identify variables that can be studied in other ways ( (C). They are indeed a detailed examination of a single case ( (D). However, the assumption that the case can be generalized is not a correct characteristic of case studies research. Case studies are often used to explore complex phenomena in depth and are not intended to be generalized to a broader population or context."
