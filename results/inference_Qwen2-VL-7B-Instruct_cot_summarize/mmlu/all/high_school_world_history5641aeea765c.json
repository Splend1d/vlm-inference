The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.\nOf Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone\u2014it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\n*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.\nThe description of Gilgamesh in the first paragraph of the passage most directly supports which of the following statements about ancient leaders?\n\nA. Ancient leaders were valued for their mastery of complicated legal codes.\nB. Ancient leaders were expected to be experts of animal husbandry.\nC. Ancient leaders were given divine origins to bolster their legitimacy.\nD. Ancient leaders were not judged on their appearances.\n"

                    "text": "To solve this logic reasoning problem, we need to carefully analyze the description of Gilgamesh provided in the first paragraph of the passage and determine which statement it most directly supports about ancient leaders.\n\nThe passage describes Gilgamesh as a king of Uruk who was given a perfect form by the gods. It mentions that the gods bestowed upon him various attributes such as glory, courage, and magnificence. The passage alsocribes divine origins to Gilgamesh, suggesting that his legitimacy was bolstered by his divine connection.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Ancient leaders were valued for their mastery of complicated legal codes.\n- The passage does not mention anything about legal codes or the mastery of legal systems. It focuses on the divine origins and attributes of Gilgamesh.\n\nB. Ancient leaders were expected to be experts of animal husbandry.\n- The passage does not mention anything about animal husbandry or the expertise of ancient leaders in this area. It is irrelevant to the description of Gilgamesh.\n\nC. Ancient leaders were given divine origins to bolster their legitimacy.\n- This option directly aligns with the passage. The description of Gilgamesh being given a perfect form by the gods and being made two-thirds god and one-third man clearly indicates that his legitimacy was bolstered by his divine origins.\n\nD. Ancient leaders were not judged on their appearances.\n- The passage does mention that Gilgamesh was given a perfect form, but it does not state that ancient leaders were not judged on their appearances. The focus is more on his divine origins and attributes rather than his appearance.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the statement that the description of Gilgamesh most directly supports is:\n\nC. Ancient leaders were given divine origins to bolster their legitimacy."
