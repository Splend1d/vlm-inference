All of these options.\n\nThe period of academic institutionalization can be assessed through various lenses, each of which highlights different aspects of the development and evolution of security studies and related fields. \n\nOption A points to the importation and exportation of strategic studies, which became a distinct academic specialty in the United States and was later adopted in Europe. This highlights the international diffusion of academic ideas and practices.\n\nOption B focuses on the role of think tanks in security studies, noting their tendency to produce narrow, technical problem-solving work that can be criticized for lacking broader theoretical depth and for succumbing to what is termed 'hectic empiricism'. This reflects a critique of the practical and theoretical aspects of think tank research.\n\nOption C highlights the development of peace research, particularly its critical branch, which was seen as separate from mainstream security studies. This indicates the existence of alternative academic traditions and the fragmentation of academic fields.\n\nTherefore, all of these options provide valuable insights into the period of academic institutionalization in security studies and related fields."
