The distance covered in this phase is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 24 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 1 \\, \\text{s} = 24 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nSince the body starts at the origin, its position at t = 1 second is 24 meters in the positive x direction.\n\n### Phase 2: Constant Acceleration (1 to 11 seconds\n\nFrom t = 1 to t = 11 seconds, the body experiences a constant acceleration of -6 meters per second squared in the negative x direction. We need to find the position at t = 11 seconds.\n\nFirst, we calculate the velocity at t = 1 second, which is the same as the initial velocity for the acceleration phase:\n\n\\[ v = 24 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nThe acceleration is given as:\n\n\\[ a = -6 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nThe time interval for this phase is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta t = 11 \\, \\text{s} - 1 \\, \\text{s} = 10 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nThe distance covered during this phase can be found using the equation of motion:\n\n\\[ s = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity ( (24 m/s)\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration (-6 m/s^2)\n- \\( t \\) is the time interval ( (10 s)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ s = 24 \\times 10 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (-6) \\times 10^2 \\]\n\\[ s = 240 - 300 \\]\n\\[ s = -60 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThis means the body moves 60 meters in the negative x direction from its position at t = 1 second.\n\n### Total Position at t = 11 seconds\n\nThe total distance covered by the body from t = 0 to t = 11 seconds is the sum of the distances covered in both phases:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Distance} = 24 \\, \\text{m} + (-60 \\, \\text{m}) = \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Distance} = -36 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the position of the body at t = 11 seconds is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. -36m} \\]"
