National campaigns can be conducted without incurring great expense.\n\nIn a single-member district electoral system, each district elects one representative. This system tends to favor major parties because they can more effectively organize and mobilize voters within a single district. Smaller parties or third parties may struggle to gain representation in such a system, as they often lack the resources to compete effectively in multiple districts. Therefore, national campaigns can be conducted without incurring great expense because the focus is on winning a single district rather than a nationwide effort."
