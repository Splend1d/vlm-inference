                    "text": "To determine which company's fuse is more likely to last at least 1 hour, we need to calculate the probability that a fuse from each company will last at least 60 minutes ( (1 hour).\n\nFirst, we'll standardize the time of 60 minutes for each company using the z-score formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{{X - \\mu}}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the time we're interested in (60 minutes, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean time, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFor Company I:\n\\[ z_I = \\frac{{60 - 50}}{10} = \\frac{{10}}{10} = 1 \\]\n\nFor Company II:\n\\[ z_{II} = \\frac{{60 - 55}}{5} = \\frac{5}{5} = 1 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a fuse lasts at least 60 minutes for each company. We can use the standard normal distribution table (or a calculator) to find the probability corresponding to a z-score of 1.\n\nThe probability that a standard normal variable \\( Z \\) is greater than 1 is approximately 0.1587.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a fuse from each company will last at least 1 hour is approximately 0.1587.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. For both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is 0.159"
