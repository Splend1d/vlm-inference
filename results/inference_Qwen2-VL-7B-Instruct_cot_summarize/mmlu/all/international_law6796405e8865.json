Fragmentation of international law concerns the possibility of different legal regimes apply the same rules of international law\nB. It is possible for several legal regimes (ie foreign investment law and human rights law) to exist and develop in isolation of each other, ultimately culminating in the production of divergent rules of international law\nC. Fragmentation is when States assume different interpretations of the same rule of international law\nD. Fragmentation is when States disagree to abide by a certain rule of international law\n"

This can lead to the creation of divergent rules of international law, which can undermine the coherence and predictability of international legal norms. This fragmentation can make it difficult for states to navigate the complex web of international laws and regulations, and can lead to inconsistencies and conflicts in international relations."
