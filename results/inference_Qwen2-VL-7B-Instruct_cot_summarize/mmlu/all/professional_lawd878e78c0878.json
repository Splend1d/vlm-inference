Soon thereafter, she had sex with her husband, who contracted the disease within a few days. The woman revealed the source to her husband, and he then sued the paramour for negligence in failing to tell the woman that he had the disease. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. What will the appellate court decide?\n\nA. There is a cause of action because one who transmits a sexually communicable disease is strictly liable to all who contracts it.\nB. There is no cause of action because the wife assumed the risk that the paramour had a sexually transmittable disease.\nC. There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\nD. There is no cause of action because the paramour's negligence was cut off by the wife's intervening negligence which became a superseding cause.\n"

There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\n\nIn this case, the appellate court would likely find that the paramour had a duty to use reasonable care to inform the woman about his venereal disease, given that he knew he had it and she did not. The fact that the woman later revealed the source of the disease to her husband does not negate the paramour's duty to inform her initially. Therefore, the paramour's failure to inform the woman about his disease constitutes negligence, and the wife's husband has a cause of action against the paramour for negligence."
