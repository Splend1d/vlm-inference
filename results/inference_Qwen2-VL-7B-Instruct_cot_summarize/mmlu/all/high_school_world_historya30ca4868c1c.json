It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nThe views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy\nD. Maintenance of large armies\n"

                    "text": "The excerpt from Tacitus' \"Germania\" describes the conflict between the Roman Empire and various Germanic tribes, specifically the Chamavi and Angrivarii, who drove out the Bructeri and Tencteri. The passage highlights the Roman's perspective on these events, emphasizing the Romans' desire for discord among their enemies and their belief in the benefits of such discord in maintaining their empire.\n\nLet's analyze each option in the context of Tacitus' views:\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples - The passage does not explicitly express disgust for the barbarian peoples. Instead, it focuses on the Romans' strategic advantage from discord among their enemies.\n\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks - While the passage does mention the conflict and the extermination of the Bructeri, it does not primarily focus on the Romans' concern about barbarian attacks. The main emphasis is on the Romans' strategic advantage from discord.\n\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy - The passage does not provide any information about the Stoicism or the behavior of the aristocracy. It is more focused on the Romans' strategic perspective on the conflict.\n\nD. Maintenance of large armies - The passage does not directly mention the maintenance of large armies. Instead, it focuses on the Romans' strategic advantage from discord among their enemies.\n\nGiven the context of the passage, the views expressed are best seen as evidence of the Romans' strategic advantage from discord among their enemies, which aligns with Tacitus' perspective on the conflict.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nD. Maintenance of large armies"
