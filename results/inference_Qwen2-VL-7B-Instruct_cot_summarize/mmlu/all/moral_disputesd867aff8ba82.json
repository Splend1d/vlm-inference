He acknowledges that the death penalty may sometimes prevent murder by deterring potential murderers from committing the crime. This is a recognition that the threat of the death penalty can have a deterrent effect.\n\nB. He also argues that the primary purpose of criminal law is to protect the innocent, which implies that the death penalty, as a severe and final punishment, is justified in cases where it is necessary to protect the lives of others.\n\nC. He further asserts that the severity and finality of the death penalty are appropriate to the seriousness and finality of murder, suggesting that the death penalty is a fitting punishment for the most serious crime.\n\nTherefore, all of these points are part of Van den Haag's argument."
