In the context of resolution, if a formula is satisfiable, there should not exist a proof of its unsatisfiability. This property is known as soundness.\n\n2. **Completeness**:\n   - A proof system is complete if every unsatisfiable formula has a proof in the system. In the context of resolution, if a formula is unsatisfiable, there should exist a proof of its unsatisfiability.\n\n3. **Succinctness**:\n   - A proof system is succinct if the length of the proof is polynomial in the length of the formula. This means that the proof is not excessively long relative to the size of the formula.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **I. It is a sound proof system in the sense that there does not exist a proof of the unsatisfiability of a satisfiable formula of propositional logic.**\n  - This is true. Resolution is a sound proof system because it cannot prove the unsatisfiability of a satisfiable formula.\n\n- **II. It is a complete proof system in the sense that there is a proof of unsatisfiability for every unsatisfiable formula of propositional logic.**\n  - This is also true. Resolution is a complete proof system because it can prove the unsatisfiability of every unsatisfiable formula.\n\n- **III. It is a succinct proof system in the sense that whenever an unsatisfiable formula F of propositional logic has a resolution proof, F also has a proof whose length is polynomial in the length of F.**\n  - This is also true. Resolution proofs are known to be polynomial in the size of the formula, making it a succinct proof system.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I and III only**"
