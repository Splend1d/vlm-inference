The farmer, because no privity of estate exists between the buyer and the farmer.\n\nIn this scenario, the covenants in the deed (seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances - are personal covenants, meaning they are only binding to the original parties involved in the transaction. These covenants do not run with the land, which means they do not transfer to subsequent owners unless specifically stated in the deed.\n\nThe buyer, who is later evicted by a woman because of paramount title, does not have a privity of estate with the farmer. Privity of estate refers to a direct relationship between the parties involved in a transaction, and since the buyer did not have a direct relationship with the farmer, the farmer is not liable for the covenants.\n\nTherefore, the buyer cannot sue the farmer for breach of covenants because there is no privity of estate between them."
