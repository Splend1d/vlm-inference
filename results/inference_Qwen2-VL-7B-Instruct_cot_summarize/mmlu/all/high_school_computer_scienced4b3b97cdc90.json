Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.\n\nA lossless transformation of a digital image does not alter the original pixel values in a way that would result in a loss of information. In the context of digital images, this means that the transformation should not change the pixel values in a way that would make it impossible to recover the original image from the transformed image.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality.\n- This is not a lossless transformation because compression typically involves discarding some information to reduce file size, which can result in a loss of image quality.\n\nB. Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image.\n- This is not a lossless transformation because averaging the RGB values results in a loss of of the original color information, which cannot be fully recovered.\n\nC. Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255.\n- This is a lossless transformation because it simply reverses the pixel values without altering the original information. The negative image can be perfectly recovered from the original image by applying the same transformation again.\n\nD. Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture.\n- This is not a lossless transformation because it involves moving pixel values from one location to another, which can result in a loss of of the original information if the pixel values are not exactly the same in both locations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
