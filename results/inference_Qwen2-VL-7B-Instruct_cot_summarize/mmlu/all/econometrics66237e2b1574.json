There is insufficient information given in the question to draw a conclusion about market efficiency.\n\nThe information provided does not give enough context to determine whether the results are indicative of market inefficiency. Factors such as sample size, the specific methodology used in the Jensen-type regression, and the statistical significance of the results would need to be considered. Additionally, the number of fund managers tested and the criteria for \"beating the market\" are not specified, which makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about market efficiency based on this information alone."
