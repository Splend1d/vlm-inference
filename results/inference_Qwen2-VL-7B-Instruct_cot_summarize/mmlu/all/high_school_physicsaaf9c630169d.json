This is due to the phenomenon of pitch perception and the Doppler effect. When the alarm is dropped, it is moving away from the student, causing the frequency of the sound wave to decrease. This is known as the Doppler effect, which states that the frequency of a wave appears to change for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. In this case, the student is stationary while the alarm is moving away from them, causing the perceived frequency to decrease."
