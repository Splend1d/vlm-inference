It emphasizes that the society is ripe for change and has been yearning for it restructuring due to internal processes of development. The passage also warns that any delay in perestroika could lead to serious crises.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **A. The problems that required perestroika were the fault of capitalist enemies of socialism**: This option suggests that the problems were caused by external enemies. However, the passage does not mention any external enemies or blame them for the problems. It focuses on internal processes.\n   - **B. The problems that required perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society**: This option alignss with the passage, which states that the society is ripe for change and has been yearning for it due to internal processes.\n   - **C. A socialist society could not work**: This option is too extreme and not supported by the passage. The passage does not suggest that a socialist society could not work at all, but rather that it needed restructuring.\n   - **D. A socialist society could not coexist with capitalism**: This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not discuss the coexistence of socialism and capitalism.\n\n4. **Conclude with a clear answer**: Based on the analysis, the correct inference from the passage is that Gorbachev believed the problems requiring perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society.\n\n**Final Answer: B. The problems that required perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society**."
