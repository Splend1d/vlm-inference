Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.\u2026 Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.\u2026 It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.\u2026 Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.\u2026 The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\n\u2014Geraldine Ferraro, Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address, July 19, 1984\nThe political ideas expressed by Ferraro in the passage above most directly reflect those of which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The political ideas expressed by Geraldine Ferraro in her 1984 vice presidential nomination acceptance address most directly reflect those of the New Dealers of the 1930s.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- **Colonial opponents of British taxation in the 1760s and 1770s**: This group was primarily concerned with the British imposition of taxes on the American colonies without representation. Ferraro's concerns about the rigging of the tax system and the increasing disparity between individual and corporate tax burdens are more aligned with the New Dealers' focus on economic equality and fairness.\n\n- **Abolitionist of the antebellum period**: These individuals were primarily concerned with the issue of slavery and the rights of African Americans. Ferraro's address does not focus on racial issues but rather on economic and social justice.\n\n- **Republicans of the 1920s**: The Republican Party of the 1920s was known for its conservative stance and opposition to government intervention in the economy. Ferraro's call for the rules of American life to work for all Americans again and her emphasis on fairness and equality are more aligned with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party.\n\n- **New Dealers of the 1930s**: This group was characterized by its support for government intervention in the economy to address the Great Depression and its focus on creating a more equitable society. Ferraro's emphasis on the need for rules to work for all Americans and her critique of the rigging of the tax system are consistent with the New Dealers' agenda.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. New Dealers of the 1930s"
