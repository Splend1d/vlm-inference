                    "text": "The angular momentum of a system is conserved if no external torque acts on the system. In this case, the platform is frictionless, so there is no friction to cause a torque. Therefore, the angular momentum of the man-platform system will be conserved.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The man catches a baseball thrown to him by a friend.\n- Catching a baseball involves a change in the linear momentum of the baseball, but it does not involve a change in the angular momentum of the man-platform system. Therefore, this option does not change the angular momentum.\n\nB. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body.\n- Throwing his arms out away from his body increases the moment of inertia of the system because the mass is now farther from the axis of rotation. This results in a decrease in angular velocity, but the angular momentum remains constant.\n\nC. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body, and then quickly brings his arms back to his side again.\n- This action involves a change in the moment of inertia of the system. Initially, the moment of inertia increases as the man throws his arms out, and then it decreases as he brings his arms back. Since angular momentum is conserved, the angular velocity will change accordingly.\n\nD. The man jumps straight up in the air and lands back on the platform.\n- Jumping straight up involves a change in the linear momentum of the man, but it does not involve a change in the angular momentum of the man-platform system. Therefore, this option does not change the angular momentum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
