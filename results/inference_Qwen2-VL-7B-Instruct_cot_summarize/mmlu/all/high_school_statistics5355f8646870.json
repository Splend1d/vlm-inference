Lack of blocking makes this a poorly designed study.\nC. The placebo effect is irrelevant in this type of study.\nD. This study was an experiment in which the subjects were used as their own controls.\n"

This design is known as a within-subjects or repeated measures design, where each subject serves as their own control."
