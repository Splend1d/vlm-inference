On September 15, a worldwide shortage of widgets caused a steep increase in the market price for widgets, so the seller decided not to deliver the widgets to the buyer. The seller sent a letter to the buyer, stating that the widgets would not be delivered. The buyer received the seller's letter on September 20. On October 15, the buyer filed suit against the seller for breach of contract. In determining the damages to which the buyer is entitled, which of the following would be taken as the market price of widgets?\n\nA. The market price on September 1.\nB. The market price on September 15.\nC. The market price on September 20.\nD. The market price on September 30.\n"

This is because the breach of contract occurred on September 15 when the seller decided not to deliver the widgets, and the buyer received notice of the breach on September 20. The market price on September 15 would reflect the price at which the buyer could have purchased the widgets if the seller had delivered them, thus representing the damages the buyer suffered due to the breach of contract."
