As the highway passes through this business district, there is a stretch where the highway is too narrow to satisfS' the safety standards for state roadways. Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking. As a consequence, the owner of the lounge brought suit for declarative relief against the city alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional. In all likelihood, will the plaintiff be successful in this cause of action?\n\nA. No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment.\nB. No, because the city's action was reasonable.\nC. Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. Yes, because responsible government officials cannot conduct or formulate their decisionmaking processes by means of coin flips.\n"

Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe plaintiff is likely to be successful in this cause of action because the city's decision to prohibit parking on one side of the street (in this case, the west side \u2014 appears to be arbitrary and discriminatory. The fact that the city council used a coin flip to decide which side of the street would be affected suggests a lack of rational basis for the decision. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that state laws and actions must be reasonable and not based on irrational or discriminatory criteria. The use of a coin flip to determine which side of the street would be affected suggests that the city's decision was not based on any rational or relevant criteria, thus violating the equal protection clause."
