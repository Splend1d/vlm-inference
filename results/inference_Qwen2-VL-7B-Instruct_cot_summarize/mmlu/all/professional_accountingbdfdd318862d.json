Most changes in accounting estimates are accounted for retrospectively.\n\nExplanation:\nChanges in accounting estimates are typically accounted for retrospectively, meaning that the financial statements for prior periods are restated to reflect the new estimate. This approach ensures that the financial statements are consistent and comparable over time.\n\nThe other statements are incorrect or misleading:\n\nB. Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in an estimate or a change in accounting principle occurred, the change should be considered a change in principle.\n- This statement is incorrect because it is not always possible to determine whether a change is due to an estimate or a principle. In such cases, the change should be accounted for in the period in which it is determined to be a change in principle.\n\nC. Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in accounting estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred, the change should be considered a change in estimate.\n- This statement is incorrect because it is not always possible to determine whether a change is due to an estimate or a principle.

The differentiation depends on the specific circumstances and the nature of the change."
