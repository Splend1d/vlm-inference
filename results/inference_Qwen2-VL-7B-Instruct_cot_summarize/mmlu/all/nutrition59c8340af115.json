Water is mostly absorbed by movement between the cells lining the gut (enterocytes) via tight junctions.\n\nThis statement accurately describes the process of water absorption in the small intestine. Water absorption occurs primarily through osmosis, facilitated by the movement of solutes across the enterocyte membrane, which is regulated by tight junctions proteins. This mechanism allows for the efficient absorption of water from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream.\n\nThe other statements are incorrect or incomplete:\n\nA. A \"flip-flop\" mechanism efficiently transports water directly across the enterocyte membrane.\n- This statement is incorrect because water transport in the small intestine is primarily facilitated by osmosis, not by a flip-flop mechanism.\n\nB. Water flows into the gut from the the mucosa, during digestion of starch and protein, in order to reduce luminal osmolality.\n- This statement is incorrect because water absorption occurs from the lumen to the blood stream, not the other way around.\n\nD. Dietary intake of water is always greater than water movement in the small intestine.\n- This statement is incorrect because the amount of water absorbed in the small intestine can vary depending on the individual's hydration status, dietary intake, and other factors."
