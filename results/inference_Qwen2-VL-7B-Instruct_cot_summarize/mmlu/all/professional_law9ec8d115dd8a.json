Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?\n\nA. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\nB. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\nC. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.\nD. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n"

The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.**\n  - This statement is accurate. The covenant against mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer. The builder's deed included the clause, but the buyer's deed did not.\n\n- **B. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.**\n  - This statement is accurate. The covenant against mobile homes was a restrictive covenant that ran with the land and could be enforced by any subsequent owner of a lot in the subdivision.\n\n- **C. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.**\n  - This statement is accurate. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes because the builder's deed included the clause, and the builder was the last person to have constructive notice of the covenant.\n\n- **D. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.**\n  - This statement is not accurate. The builder's deed included the clause against mobile homes, but the buyer's deed did not. Therefore, the buyer would not be in privity of estate with the builder regarding the covenant against mobile homes."
