                    "text": "To determine which reaction has the greatest decrease in entropy, we need to consider the changes in the number of moles of gas and solid phases in each reaction. A decrease in entropy typically occurs when the number of moles of gas decreases or the number of solid phases increases.\n\nLet's analyze each reaction:\n\nA. C(s) + CO2(g) \u2192 2 CO(g)\n- This reaction involves a solid (C(s) and a gas (CO2(g) reacting to form two gases (2 CO(g)). The number of moles of gas increases, so the entropy increases.\n\nB. 2 Na(s) + O2(g) \u2192 Na2O2(s)\n- This reaction involves two solids (2 Na(s) and O2(g) reacting to form one solid Na2O2(s). The number of moles of gas decreases, so the entropy decreases.\n\nC. CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n- This reaction involves one gas (CH4(g) and two gases ( 2 O2(g) reacting to form one gas ( CO2(g) and two liquids ( 2 H2O(l)). The number of moles of gas decreases, so the entropy decreases.\n\nD. 2 NI3(s) \u2192 3 I2(s) + N2(g)\n- This reaction involves two solids ( 2 NI3(s) reacting to form one solid ( 3 I2(s) and one gas N2(g). The number of moles of gas increases, so the entropy increases.\n\nComparinging the reactions, we see that reactions B and C both involve a decrease in the number of moles of gas. However, reaction C involves a larger decrease in the number of moles of gas ( from 3 moles of gas to 1 mole of gas, which results in a greater decrease in entropy.\n\nTherefore, the reaction expected to have the greatest decrease in entropy is:\n\nC. CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)"
