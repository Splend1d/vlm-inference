Androgen insensitivity\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a genetic disorder where the body does not respond to androgens hormones, leading to the development of female external genitalia but with no internal reproductive organs. This can result in a lack of menstruation and secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development and pubic hair growth. The absence of axillary hair is also consistent with AIS. The patient's refusal to undergo a pelvic or rectal examination does not change the diagnosis but does highlight the importance of obtaining a thorough history and physical examination to rule out other conditions."
