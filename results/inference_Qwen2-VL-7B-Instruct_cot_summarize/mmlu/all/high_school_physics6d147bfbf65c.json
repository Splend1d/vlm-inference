The gravitational force, because by F = GMm/r^2, the force of the table on the wood at that close range is sufficient to balance the force of the Earth on the wood.\n\nThe gravitational force is responsible for the interaction between the table and the wooden block because it is the force that holds objects together and keeps them from falling apart. The gravitational force is a fundamental force of nature that is responsible for the attraction between any two objects with mass. In this case, the gravitational force between the table and the wooden block is what keeps the block from falling off the table."
