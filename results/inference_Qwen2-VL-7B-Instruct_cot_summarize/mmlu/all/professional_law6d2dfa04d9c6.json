When the investor's title search revealed the above language in the grantee section of the deed to the woman, the investor refused to close the transaction. The contract was silent as to the woman's title obligation. The woman has sued the investor for specific performance. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\nB. The investor, because the woman's heirs did not join in the contract.\nC. The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.\nD. The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\n"

The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.\n\nIn this scenario, the investor's title search revealed a condition in the deed that restricts the woman's ability to transfer the land for 10 years. Since the contract was silent as to the woman's title obligation, the court would likely interpret the contract as not requiring the woman to provide marketable title. Therefore, the investor would be required to perform under the contract, and the woman would prevail."
