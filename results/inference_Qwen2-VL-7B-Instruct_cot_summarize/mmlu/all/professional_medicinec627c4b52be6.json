He does not think the symptoms are problematic, but his wife is concerned because he sometimes falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present. He also once fell asleep while driving at night and drove off the road, narrowly avoiding injury. His wife says that he has always snored loudly, and over the past year, he has had episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 105 kg (231 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2 . His pulse is 76/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/76 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. 24-Hour ambulatory ECG monitoring\nB. Multiple sleep latency test\nC. Polysomnography\nD. CT scan of the head\n"

PSG involves monitoring multiple physiological parameters during sleep, including brain activity, eye movements, muscle activity, and breathing patterns. PSG can detect episodes of apnea, hypopnea, and other sleep-related breathing disorders, as well as other sleep disorders such as restless legs syndrome and narcolepsy. PSG is the gold standard for diagnosing sleep disorders and is the most accurate test for confirming the diagnosis of OSA in this patient."
