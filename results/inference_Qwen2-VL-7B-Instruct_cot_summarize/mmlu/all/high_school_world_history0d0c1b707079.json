The passage by Otto von Bismarck discusses the insecurities and vulnerabilities faced by workers in Germany, particularly regarding their health, work, and old age. Bismarck highlights the lack of social safety nets and the inadequate help provided by the government for the poor.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes, a twentieth-century economist, is known for his theories on the role of government in the economy, particularly in maintaining aggregate demand and ensuring economic stability. Let's analyze each option in the context of Keynes's economic theories:\n\nA. **Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.**\n   - Keynes believed that government intervention was crucial to stabilize the economy and maintain aggregate demand. This aligns with his views on the role of government in providing social safety nets and ensuring economic stability.\n\nB. **Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers, but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances.**\n   - This option contradicts Keynes's general stance on government intervention. Keynes was a proponent of government intervention to stabilize the economy and ensure social welfare.\n\nC. **Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters.**\n   - This is also inconsistent with Keynes's views. He believed in government intervention to stabilize the economy and ensure social welfare, not to avoid it.\n\nD. **Keynes would advocate doing nothing because he felt poverty in rural areas was actually more severe than it was in cities.**\n   - This is not consistent with Keynes's economic theories. Keynes was a proponent of government intervention to stabilize the economy and ensure social welfare, not to avoid it.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis of each option, the most consistent with Keynes's economic theories is:\n\n**A. Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.**\n\nFinal answer: A. Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand."
