In other words, the value of the good is based on its relative position within the population.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Being at least six feet tall in a population where this is above average: This implies that being tall is valued because it is relatively rare. The value of being tall is based on its relative scarcity within the population.\n\nB. Having an IQ of at least 150 in a population where this is the average: This implies that having a high IQ is valued because it is relatively rare. The value of having a high IQ is based on its relative scarcity within the population.\n\nC. Being at least six feet tall in a population where this is the average: This implies that being tall is valued because it is relatively common. The value of being tall is not based on its relative scarcity within the population.\n\nD. All of the above: This option is incorrect because option C does not fit the definition of a positional good.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. being at least six feet tall in a population where this is above average"
