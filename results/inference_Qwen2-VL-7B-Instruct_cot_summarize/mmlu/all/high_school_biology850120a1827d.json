A vestigial organ is one that has lost most of its original function and function over evolutionary time, often becoming non-functional or serving a reduced or vestigial role.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The appendix can be surgically removed with no immediate ill effects.\n- This statement supports the idea that the appendix is vestigial because it implies that it has no essential function and can be removed without significant harm.\n\nB. The appendix might have been larger in fossil hominids.\n- This statement suggests that the appendix had a larger role in the past, which could imply that it was not completely vestigial but rather had a significant function in the past.\n\nC. The appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue.\n- This statement indicates that the appendix still has a functional role in the immune system, which directly contradicts the claim that it is completely vestigial.\n\nD. Individuals with a larger-than-average appendix leave fewer offspring than those with a below-average-sized appendix.\n- This statement suggests that the size of the appendix may have some impact on reproductive success, which could imply that it has some functional role.\n\nAmong these options, the statement that most detracts from the claim that the human appendix is a completely vestigial organ is:\n\nC. The appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue.\n\nThis statement directly contradicts the claim by suggesting that the appendix still serves a significant function in the immune system."
