Regression toward the mean is a statistical phenomenon where extreme values tend to move closer to the average over time. In this context, the most severely disturbed patients might show improvement simply because their initial condition was so extreme that it was likely to improve, regardless of the treatment. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. fails to take into account regression toward the mean"
