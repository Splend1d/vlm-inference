                    "text": "To determine what the poet means by \"what the world whispers,\" we need to analyze the context and the overall message of the poem. The poem is about the Sharpeville Massacre, a significant event in South Africa's history where police fired on a peaceful protest, resulting in the deaths of many unarmed black South Africans.\n\nThe phrase \"what the world whispers\" is likely referring to the indirect or subtle ways in which the world acknowledges or comments on South Africa's apartheid policies. The poet is suggesting that while the world may not openly condemn apartheid, it does recognize and discuss its existence and impact.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The world is too afraid of South Africa to oppose apartheid.\n- This option suggests a fear-based reason, which is not directly supported by the poem's context.\n\nB. The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination.\n- This option suggests a form of discrimination that is not directly related to the context of the Sharpeville Massacre.\n\nC. The world condemns South Africa\u2019s discrimination.\n- This option suggests a direct condemnation, which is not the focus of the poem.\n\nD. The world economy promotes South Africa\u2019s discrimination.\n- This option suggests an economic influence, which is not directly related to the poem's context.\n\nGiven the context of the poem, the most fitting interpretation is:\n\nC. The world condemns South Africa\u2019s discrimination.\n\nThe poet is using the phrase \"what the world whispers\" to imply that the world, while not openly condemning apartheid, does recognize and discuss its existence and impact.
