                    "text": "A major bank foreclosed on a consumer mortgage. After the property was sold at sheriff's sale for $50,000, the bank sent the consumer due notice of a deficiency still owing of $10,000. The original note, however, had limited bank's recourse to $50,000 or higher. There was no response and the bank entered a deficiency judgment for $10,000. When it started execution proceedings to collect the $10,000, the defendants entered a defense, arguing that the bank was limited to recourse of $50,000 or higher. The judgment for $10,000 was therefore void and unenforceable. Will the court allow enforcement of the deficiency judgment for $10,000?\n\nA. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because the limitation in the original note is voidable, due to the mortgagors' breach of the mortgage terms.\nB. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because advance notice to the mortgagors is all that is required to disregard a limitation in an original note.\nC. No, the court will preclude the entrance of the deficiency judgment because the limitation clause is still enforceable and is supported by public policy generally against deficiency judgments.\nD. No, the judgment will not be enforced because deficiency judgments have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n"

No, the court will preclude the entrance of the deficiency judgment because the limitation clause is still enforceable and is supported by public policy generally against deficiency judgments.\n\nIn the United States, there is a general policy against deficiency judgments, which are judgments that allow a lender to recover the difference between the amount owed on a mortgage and the the amount received from the sale of the property in a foreclosure. This policy is intended to protect consumers from being overcharged for the property they are forced to sell. Therefore, the court is likely to find that the deficiency judgment for $10,000 is void and unenforceable because the limitation clause in the original note is still enforceable and supported by public policy against deficiency judgments."
