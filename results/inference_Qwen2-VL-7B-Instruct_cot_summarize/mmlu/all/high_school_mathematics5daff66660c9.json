Therefore, March 1, 2011, is 28 days after February 1, 2011. \n\nTo find the day of the week for March 1, 2011, we can use the fact that each year, the day of the week for a given date shifts by one day. \n\nSince February 28, 2011, is a Friday, March 1, 2011, will be a Saturday. \n\nTherefore, April 1, 2011, will be a Sunday. \n\nSo, the answer is D. Saturday."
