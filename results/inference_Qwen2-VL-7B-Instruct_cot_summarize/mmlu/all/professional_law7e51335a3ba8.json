The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?\n\nA. No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.\nB. No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.\nC. Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.\nD. Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.\n"

Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.\n\nThe court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action. The employer's claim involves the same incident (the fall on ice near the loading dock of the building in State B) and the same defendant (the building owner in State C). The employer's claim is for negligence and the clerk's claim is also for negligence. Therefore, the employer's claim is directly related to the clerk's claim and the employer has a direct interest in the outcome of the clerk's action."
