It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nThe excerpt from Frederick Douglass is most clearly an example of which of the following developments in the mid-nineteenth century?\n\nA. The gradual replacement of indentured servants with African slaves\nB. The preservation of African culture through cultural adaptation\nC. Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery\nD. The success of abolitionists to sway majority public opinion\n"

                    "text": "To determine which development in the mid-nineteenth century the excerpt from Frederick Douglass most clearly exemplifies, let's analyze the content and context of the passage.\n\nThe passage highlights the advantages that slaveholders have over those opposing slavery, emphasizing their complete organization and the support they receive from various institutions, including state governments, church organizations, and the federal government's military and judicial systems. Douglass argues that the slaveholders' organization and the federal government's support for slavery create a significant advantage over those who oppose slavery.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The gradual replacement of indentured servants with African slaves\n- This option refers to the transition from one form of labor to another, which is not the primary focus of the passage.\n\nB. The preservation of African culture through cultural adaptation\n- This option is not relevant to the passage, which focuses on the organization and support for slavery rather than cultural preservation.\n\nC. Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery\n- This option aligns closely with the passage. Douglass points out that the federal government, including its military and judicial systems, is pledged to support and propagate slavery, indicating a significant influence of the South on the federal government.\n\nD. The success of abolitionist to sway majority public opinion\n- While the passage mentions the support of the federal government, it does not directly address the success of abolitionists in swaying public opinion.\n\nGiven the analysis, the excerpt most clearly exemplifies the development of Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery.\n\nFinal answer: C. Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery"
