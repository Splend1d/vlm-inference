If a threat posed by one group to another is military - particularly when linked to the defence of the historic homeland - armed response is required. At the intra-state level, many societal groups have no such means of armed protection and are compelled to employ non-military counter-measures.\nB. Intra-state collectives faced with a political or military threat to their identity will form their own militia or defensive force as a means of protection. This results in the establishment of quasi-states which may undermine the territorial integrity of the nation.\nC. Being aligned with the state, society has immediate and unequivocal access to the use of state forces (in the form of military retaliation) if there is a threat to societal security.\nD. Societal groups do not face military threats; being constituted by identity and social cohesion, military forces are not engaged against societal groups in any meaningful way.\n"

Being aligned with the state, society has immediate and unequivocal access to the use of state forces ( in the form of military retaliation) if there is a threat to societal security.\n\nThis statement is the most accurate in the context of the question. Societal identity can be defended militarily to the extent that the state, which is aligned with societal groups, has the authority and capability to use military force in response to threats to societal security. This can include threats posed by other groups, both within and outside the state, that could undermine the identity and cohesion of societal groups."
