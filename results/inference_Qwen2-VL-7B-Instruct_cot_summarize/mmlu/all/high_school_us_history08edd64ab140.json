They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.\"\nJohn Kerry, 1971\nThe conflict described above is most likely a result of which of the following doctrines?\n\nA. Imperialism\nB. Containment\nC. Big-stick diplomacy\nD. Isolationism\n"

This doctrine was a key aspect of the Cold War strategy of the United States, which aimed to prevent the spread of communism by containinging it within existing communist states and preventing it from expanding into non-communist countries. The passage describes a civil war in Vietnam, where the Vietnamese people were seeking liberation from colonial influence and were not enthusiastic about the American presence, which alignss with the idea of containing ing communism by preventing it from spreading to non-communist countries. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Containment."
