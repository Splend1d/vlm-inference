If multiple measurements are close to each other, they are considered precise.\n- **Accuracy**: This refers to how close the measurements are to the true value. If the measurements are close to the true value, they are considered accurate.\n\nGiven the true length of the block of wood is 1.010 cm, let's analyze the measurements:\n\n1. **Precision**: The measurements are 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. These measurements are not close to each other, indicating a lack of precision.\n2. **Accuracy**: The measurements are 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. These measurements are not close to the true value of 1.010 cm, indicating a lack of accuracy.\n\nSince the measurements are neither close to each other ( (l.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm) nor close to the true value ( ( 1.010 cm), the correct answer is:\n\nD. They are neither precise nor accurate."
