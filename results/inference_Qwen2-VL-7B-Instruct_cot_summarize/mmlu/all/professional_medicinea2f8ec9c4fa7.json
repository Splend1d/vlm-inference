The patient is confined to her home because of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with cor pulmonale. She was discharged 1 week ago from the hospital following 3 weeks of treatment for pneumonia that required intubation; her hospital stay was complicated by sepsis. She had a prolonged weaning program from intubation. Prior to discharge, the patient and her daughter met with you to review the patient's advance directive. During the discussion, the patient said, \"I'd rather die than be intubated again.\" At that time, both the patient and her daughter signed an addendum to that effect on the patient's advance directive. Today, the patient is dyspneic and is unable to complete a sentence. Vital signs are temperature 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 35/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 84% while the patient is breathing 4 L of oxygen. You ask the patient if she wishes to return to the hospital. She says, \"No, I want to die at home.\" Her daughter takes you aside and says, \"My mother doesn't know what she's saying. I insist that she be admitted to the hospital.\" After further discussion with the daughter regarding support available at home, which of the following is the most appropriate step?\n\nA. Admit the patient to the hospital\nB. Arrange for consultation with a home hospice team\nC. Consult with the hospital ethics committee\nD. Order a home continuous positive airway pressure machine and instruct the daughter in its use\n"
