A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920\nMoreland's description of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire is best seen as evidence for which of the following generalizations?\n\nA. Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire.\nB. Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.\nC. Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.\nD. The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.\n"

He mentions that the existence of separate states was often more of a question of words, and that a zamindar's ( (landowner's) position of dependence on the Mogul Empire could lead to claims of sovereignty by refusing to pay revenue. He also notes that there were various reasons for not paying revenue, including rebellion or practical independence due to the Mogul authorities' reluctance to undertake active measures of coercion.\n\n3. **Analyze each option:**\n   - **Option A:** \"Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire.\"\n     - Moreland's description does not mention anything about religious criteria for paying revenue. Therefore, this option is not supported by the text.\n\n   - **Option B:** \"Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.\"\n     - Moreland's description does not explicitly mention geographical differences influencing tax payment. However, it does mention specific regions (Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur, which could imply some geographical influence. This.\n\n   - **Option C:** \"Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.\"\n     - Moreland's description does not state that revenue collection was the only source of funds. It only discusses revenue collection in the context of the empire's overall operations.\n\n   - **Option D:** \"The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.\"\n     - Moreland's description specifically mentions that the situation in Rajputana was not typical, as it was an anomalous position. Therefore, this option is not supported by the text.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer:**\n   After analyzing each option, it is clear that the best generalization supported by Moreland's description is:\n\n   **Option B: Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.**"
