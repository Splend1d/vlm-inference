At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.\nB. No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the company\u00d5s promise was supported by consideration.\nD. Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.\n"

                    "text": "The builder is likely to prevail in this case. The key legal principle here is the concept of \"consideration,\" which is necessary for a modification of a contract to be enforceable. Consideration refers to something of value exchanged between the parties to the contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the builder informed the company of the steel price increase and the parties orally agreed to increase the project price to $100 million. This oral agreement constitutes a modification of the original contract. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time, indicating that the builder provided additional value by continuing to work under the new terms.\n\nThe company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. This refusal to pay the additional amount constitutes a breach of the oral agreement. Since the builder provided additional value by continuing to work under the new terms, the company's promise to pay the additional $1 million was supported by consideration.\n\nTherefore, the builder is likely to prevail because the company's promise to pay the additional $1 million was supported by consideration, and the oral agreement to modify the contract was enforceable.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. Yes, because the company's promise was supported by consideration."
