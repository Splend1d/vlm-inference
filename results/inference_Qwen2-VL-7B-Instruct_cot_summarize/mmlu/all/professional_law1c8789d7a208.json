The court will allow the records because they were kept in the ordinary course of business.\nB. The court will require a greater foundation to establish the reliability of the records.\nC.

Specifically, the records must be kept in the ordinary course of business and be authenticated by a person with knowledge of the records's content or creation. \n\nGiven that the defendant has testified that he kept the records on a regular business basis, the court may find that the records were kept in the ordinary course of business. However, the court may also require a greater foundation to establish the reliability of the records, such as through the testimony of a custodian or other qualified person who can attest to the authenticity and reliability of the records. \n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nB. The court will require a greater foundation to establish the reliability of the records."
