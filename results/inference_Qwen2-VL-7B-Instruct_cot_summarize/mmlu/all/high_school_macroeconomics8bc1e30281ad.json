Workers who have negotiated cost-of-living raises into their contracts.\nD. Renters of apartments who have signed a lease that holds rent constant for two years.\n\nAll of these groups are harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation. When inflation is unexpectedly high, the purchasing power of money decreases, which means that the value of of the money that borrowers have to repay on their loans decreases, making it easier for them to repay the loan. Similarly, savers who have put their money in long-term assets that pay a fixed interest rate will see their savings eroded by inflation, as the value of their savings decreases over time. Workers who have negotiated cost-of-living raises into their contracts will also see their wages eroded by inflation, as the value of their wages decreases over time. Finally, renters of apartments who have signed a lease that holds rent constant for two years will see their purchasing power eroded by inflation, as the value of their rent decreases over time."
