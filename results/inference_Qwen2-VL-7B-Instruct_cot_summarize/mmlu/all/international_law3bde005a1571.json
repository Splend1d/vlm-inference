This concept is often used in international law to distinguish between acts performed by a state in its sovereign capacity ( (jure imperii) and those performed in a private capacity ( (jure gestionis).\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity - This is correct. Acts jure gestionis are indeed those performed by a state or its agents in a private capacity.\n\nB. All purchases by the State are acts jure gestionis - This is incorrect. Purchases by the state are generally considered to be acts jure imperii, as they are typically performed in the state's sovereign capacity.\n\nC. All acts undertaken by State corporations are jure gestionis - This is incorrect. State corporations are considered to be acting in the state's sovereign capacity, not in a private capacity.\n\nD. All conduct undertaken by government officials in their free time is considered jus gestionis. - This is incorrect. Conduct by government officials in their free time is generally considered to be in the state's sovereign capacity, not in a private capacity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity."
