The higher the electronegativity, the stronger the bond between the hydrogen and the halogen atom, which generally will lead to a stronger acid.\n\n2. **Bond Strength**: The stronger the bond between hydrogen and the halogen, the more stable the molecule will be, and the more likely it is to release a proton (H+.\n\nLet's compare the electronegativities of the halogens involved:\n\n- **H2S**: Hydrogen ( (H) and S (S)\n- **HI**: Hydrogen ( (H) and iodine ( (I)\n- **HBr**: Hydrogen ( (H) and bromine (Br)\n- **H2O**: Hydrogen ( (H) and oxygen (O)\n\nThe electronegativity values are:\n- H: 2.1\n- I: 2.6\n- Br: 2.8\n- O: 3.5\n\nFrom this, we can see that oxygen (O) has the highest electronegativity, followed by bromine (Br, iodine (I), and hydrogen (H).\n\nGiven that the bond strength increases with increasing electronegativity, the bond between hydrogen and oxygen in H2O will be the strongest. Therefore, H2O should be the strongest acid among the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer: D. H2O**"
