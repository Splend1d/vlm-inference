For example, $\\frac{2}{3}$ is equivalent to $\\frac{4}{6}$ because both can be simplified to the same value. To find the number of unique fractions, we need to consider the simplification of these fractions.\n\nThe fractions that are equivalent and can be simplified to the same value are:\n\n- $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{4}{6}$\n- $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{6}{8}$\n\nSo, we have 2 unique fractions that are equivalent to each other.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2"
