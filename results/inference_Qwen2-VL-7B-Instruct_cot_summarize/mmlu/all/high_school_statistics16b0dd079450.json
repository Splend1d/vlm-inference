In this case, the survey found that 82% of the population uses grocery coupons with a margin of error of 3%. This means that the true percentage of the population using grocery coupons is likely to be within a certain range around the sample estimate.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Three percent of those surveyed refused to participate in the poll.\n- This option describes the refusal rate of the survey participants, not the margin of error.\n\nB. It would not be unexpected for 3% of the population to begin using coupons or stop using coupons.\n- This option suggests a change in the population behavior over time, which is not directly related to the margin of error.\n\nC. Between 395 and 425 of the 500 households surveyed responded that they used grocery coupons.\n- This option describes the number of households that responded, not the margin of error.\n\nD. It is likely that between 79% and 85% of the population use grocery coupons.\n- This option correctly describes the margin of error. The true percentage of the population using grocery coupons is likely to be between 79% and 85%, given the survey results and the margin of error of 3%.\n\nTherefore, the best description of what is meant by the poll having a margin of error of 3% is:\n\nD. It is likely that between 79% and 85% of the population use grocery coupons."
