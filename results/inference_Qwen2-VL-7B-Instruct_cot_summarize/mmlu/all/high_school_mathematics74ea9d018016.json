Since there are two such caps, the total volume of the solid cut out of the sphere is:\n\n\\[ V_{total} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} \\pi \\]\n\\[ V_{total} = \\frac{5}{3} \\pi \\]\n\nThis value is not listed among the options provided, which suggests there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options.
