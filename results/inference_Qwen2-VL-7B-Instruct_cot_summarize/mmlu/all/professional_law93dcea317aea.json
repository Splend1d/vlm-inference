At trial, the alleged cocaine no longer exists, and the only evidence that the substance sold was cocaine is the informant's testimony that it tasted like cocaine and gave her a cocaine-like sensation. The informant has no formal training in identifying controlled substances. Should the court admit the informant's opinion testimony that the substance was cocaine?\n\nA. No, because identification of a controlled substance requires an expert with formal training.\nB. No, because, without a quantity of the controlled substance for testing, opinion testimony is insufficient to make a prima facie case against the defendant.\nC. Yes, if the court determines that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine.\nD. Yes, provided there is evidence sufficient to support a jury finding that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine.\n"

Yes, provided there is evidence sufficient to support a jury finding that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine.\n\nIn legal terms, the admissibility of an informant's testimony regarding the identification of a controlled substance hinges on whether the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to make such an identification. The mere fact that the substance no longer exists and cannot be tested does not automatically render the informant's testimony inadmissible. Instead, the court must consider whether the informant has the necessary qualifications to identify the substance based on their knowledge and experience.\n\nTherefore, if the court determines that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine, the testimony should be admitted. This determination would typically involve evaluating the informant's background, training, and experience in identifying controlled substances."
