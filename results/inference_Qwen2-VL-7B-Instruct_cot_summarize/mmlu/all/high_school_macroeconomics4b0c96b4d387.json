Real GDP will remain unchanged.\n\nWhen the government increases spending by $12 million and raises tax collections by the same amount, the overall impact on real GDP in country Z will be neutral. This is because the increase in government spending will stimulate the economy, leading to an increase in real GDP. However, the increase in tax collections will reduce disposable income and consumer spending, which will offset the initial stimulus from government spending. Therefore, the net effect on real GDP will be zero."
