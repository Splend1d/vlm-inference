Because he conceives of laws in a pragmatic rather than a conceptual manner.\n\nAn empiricist is someone who believes that knowledge comes primarily from experience and observation. An \"naive empiricist\" is an empiricist who may not fully appreciate the complexities and nuances of the empirical world. Austin, the legal philosopher, is often described as a naive empiricist because he conceives of laws in a pragmatic rather than a conceptual manner. He believed that the meaning of a law is found in its practical effects, rather than in its abstract or conceptual content. This pragmatic approach to law has been criticized for not fully accounting for the conceptual and abstract aspects of legal systems."
