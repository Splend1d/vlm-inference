The gradient of the ReLU function is $1$ for $x \\geq 0$ and $0$ for $x < 0$. This statement is true.\n\n2. **The sigmoid gradient $\\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))\\le \\frac{1}{4}$ for all $x$:**\n   - The sigmoid function is defined as $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$. The derivative of the sigmoid function is $\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))$. The maximum value of $\\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))$ occurs when $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is the midpoint of the sigmoid function. At this point, $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $1-\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$, so the maximum value of the derivative is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. This statement is also also true.\n\n**Statement 2:**\n- The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient.\n\n1. **The sigmoid has a continuous gradient:**\n   - The derivative of the sigmoid function, $\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))$, is continuous everywhere because it is a product of two continuous functions. This statement is true.\n\n2. **The ReLU has a discontinuous gradient:**\n   - The gradient of the ReLU function is $1$ for $x \\geq 0$ and $0$ for $x < 0$. This gradient is discontinuous at $x = 0$ because the value jumps from $0$ to $1$ at that point. This statement is also also true.\n\nGiven the analysis, both statements are true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA. True, True"
