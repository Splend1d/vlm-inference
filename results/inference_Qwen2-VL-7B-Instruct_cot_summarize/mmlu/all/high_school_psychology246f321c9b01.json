If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then identical twins are more likely to share this attribute than are fraternal twins and other siblings.\n\nThis statement best states why the study of twins is significant to the field of behavioral genetics. Identical twins share 100% of their genetic material, while fraternal twins share approximately 50% of their genetic material. Therefore, if a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, identical twins are more likely to share this attribute than are fraternal twins or other siblings, making them a valuable tool for studying the genetic basis of behavior."
