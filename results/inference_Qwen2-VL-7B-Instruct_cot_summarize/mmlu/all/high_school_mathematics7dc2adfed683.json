Then Grady's speed is $1.6x$ miles per hour ( because he rides $60\\%$ faster than Noah.\n\nIn two hours, Noah would have ridden $2x$ miles, and Grady would have ridden $2 \\times 1.6x = 3.2x$ miles. We know that Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah, so we can set up the equation $3.2x = 2x + 12$.\n\nSolving this equation for $x$, we get:\n\n$3.2x - 2x = 12$\n\n$1.2x = 12$\n\n$x = \\frac{12}{1.2} = 10$\n\nSo, Noah rides at a speed of $10$ miles per hour. The answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
