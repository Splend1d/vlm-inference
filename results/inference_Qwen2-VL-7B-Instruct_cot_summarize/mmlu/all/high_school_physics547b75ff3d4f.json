Weight is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Weight} = \\text{mass} \\times \\text{gravity} \\]\n\nThe gravity on a planet is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gravity} = \\frac{G \\times M \\times Ip}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant ( (6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} )\n- \\( M \\) is the mass of the Earth\n- \\( Ip \\) is the mass of the planet\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the planet\n\nGiven that the mass and radius of the planet are each twice that of Earth, we can write:\n\n\\[ Ip = 2 \\times M \\]\n\\[ r = 2 \\times r_E \\]\n\nThe gravitational constant \\( G \\) and the mass of Earth \\( (E \\) are the same for both Earth and the planet, so they cancel out in the ratio of the gravities:\n\n\\[ \\frac{Gravity_{\\text{planet}}}{Gravity_{\\text{Earth}}} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\times 2 \\times E \\times Ip}{(2 \\times r_E)^2}}{\\frac{G \\times E}{r_E^2}} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\n\\[ \\frac{Gravity_{\\text{planet}}}{Gravity_{\\text{Earth}}} = \\frac{2 \\times 2}{(2)^2} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1 \\]\n\nThis means the gravity on the planet is the same as on Earth.\n\nSince the astronaut's mass remains the same, the weight on the planet will also be the same as on Earth:\n\n\\[ \\text{Weight}_{\\text{planet}} = \\text{Weight}_{\\text{Earth}} = 800 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 800 N"
