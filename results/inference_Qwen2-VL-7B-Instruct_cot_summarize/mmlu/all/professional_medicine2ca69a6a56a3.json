The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\nA. Atrial fibrillation\nB. Cor pulmonale\nC. Systemic hypertension\nD. Tricuspid valve regurgitation\n"

The presence of a systolic murmur, left ventricular prominence on chest x-ray, and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG all suggest that he may have a form of cardiomyopathy, likely hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM. HCM is a condition characterized by an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, which can lead to various complications.\n\nGiven the patient's history of pneumonia at age 3 years and the current cardiac findings, he is at greatest risk for developing:\n\nC. Systemic hypertension\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy can lead to increased blood pressure due to the thickened heart muscle, which can obstruct blood flow and cause the heart to work harder. This can result in systemic hypertension. Additionally, the patient's history of of pneumonia could have contributed to his being at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension, which can also lead to cor pulmonale ( (a condition where the right side of the heart becomes enlarged and weakened due to chronic lung disease). However, the presence of a systolic murmur and left ventricular prominence on chest x-ray are more indicative of left-sided heart disease, making systemic hypertension the most likely complication.\n\nA. Atrial fibrillation is a risk for patients with HCM, but it is less likely given the absence of atrial enlargement or other typical risk factors for atrial fibrillation.\n\nB. Cor pulmonale is a complication of chronic lung disease, and while the patient has a history of pneumonia, the current findings do not strongly suggest chronic lung disease.\n\nD. Tricuspid valve regurgitation is not the primary concern based on the patient's findings, as the murmur and chest x-ray findings are more indicative of left-sided heart disease.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C. Systemic hypertension."
