Yes, robbery does not require that the victim be subdued by force or be placed in fear.\n\nRobbery is typically defined as the unlawful taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force, and by putting the victim in fear. The key elements of robbery are the unlawful taking of property and the use of force or intimidation. In this case, the man took the female guest's purse and emptied it of her money and jewelry without her consent, which constitutes an unlawful taking. Additionally, the fact that the victim was unconscious and therefore unable to resist or put up any form of resistance does not negate the unlawful taking or the use of force or intimidation. Therefore, the man can be convicted of robbery."
