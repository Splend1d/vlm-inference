For the outcome 1, the larger number is 1. The probability of this outcome is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36} \\).\n2. For the outcome 2, the larger number is 2.

The probability of this outcome is \\( \\frac{3}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{36} \\).\n5.
