It involves several components, including:\n\nA. Organization Analysis: Examining the overall structure, goals, and resources of the organization.\nB. Task Analysis: Identifying the specific tasks and skills required to perform a job or task.\nC. Person Analysis: Assessing the skills, knowledge, and abilities of the individuals within the organization.\n\nProgram Design, on the other hand, is a separate phase that follows Needs Analysis. It involves designing and developing training programs to address the identified gaps. Therefore, Program Design is not part of the Needs Analysis process."
