Juxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine.\n\nJuxtamedullary nephrons are specialized nephrons found in the mammalian kidney that are responsible for producing concentrated urine. These nephrons are located near the medulla of the kidney and are responsible for the production of hyperosmotic urine, which is necessary for mammals to conserve water in environments with low water availability."
