The mother, an 18-year-old primigravid woman, smoked one pack of cigarettes daily throughout her pregnancy. She received prenatal care during most of the pregnancy. One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin. The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient is 50 cm (20 in; 50th percentile) long and weighs 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz; 50th percentile); head circumference is 35 cm (14 in; 50th percentile). The infant's vital signs now are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.8\u00b0F), pulse 150/min, and respirations 70/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Group B streptococcal sepsis\nB. Meconium aspiration syndrome\nC. Respiratory distress syndrome\nD. Transient tachypnea of newborn\n"

Meconium aspiration syndrome\n\nMeconium aspiration syndrome is a condition that occurs when a baby inhales meconium, which is a thick, greenish-black substance that is produced by the intestines during pregnancy. This can lead to respiratory distress, as the baby may have difficulty breathing due to the presence of meconium in the lungs. The symptoms of meconium aspiration syndrome can include respiratory distress, cyanosis, and a grunting or whistling sound when breathing. The presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid, as well as the symptoms described in the patient's case, are consistent with meconium aspiration syndrome."
