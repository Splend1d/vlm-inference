This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nLet's denote the length of the segment as \\( L = 10 \\). Points A and B divide the segment into three smaller segments, which we'll call \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). Without loss of generality, let's assume \\( a \\le b \\le c \\).\n\nThe possible lengths of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are:\n- \\( a \\) can range from 0 to \\( \\frac{L}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.33 \\)\n- \\( b \\) can range from \\( \\frac{L}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.33 \\) to \\( \\frac{2L}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67 \\)\n- \\( c \\) can range from \\( \\frac{2L}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67 \\) to \\( L = 10 \\)\n\nFor the three segments to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem:\n1. \\( a + b > c \\)\n2. \\( a + c > b \\)\n3. \\( b + c > a \\)\n\nLet's analyze the possible ranges for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):\n\n1. \\( a + b > c \\)\n   - For \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b \\) must be greater than \\( c \\).\n   - For \\( a = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.33 \\), \\( b \\) must be greater than \\( c \\).\n\n2. \\( a + c > b \\)\n   - For \\( a = 0 \\), \\( c \\) must be greater than \\( b \\).\n   - For \\( a = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.33 \\), \\( c \\) must be greater than \\( b \\).\n\n3. \\( b + c > a \\)\n   - For \\( b = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.33 \\), \\( c \\) must be greater than \\( a \\).\n   - For \\( b = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67 \\), \\( c \\) must be greater than \\( a \\).\n\nTo satisfy all three inequalities, \\( c \\) must be greater than \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and \\( b \\) must be greater than \\( a \\). This\n\nThe probability that the three segments can form a triangle is the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total possible outcomes. The total possible outcomes are the number of ways to choose \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) within their respective ranges.\n\nThe favorable outcomes are when \\( c \\) is greater than both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and \\( b \\) is greater than \\( a \\). This\n\nThe probability is:\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\\text{Total Possible Outcomes}} \\]\n\nThe total possible outcomes are the number of ways to choose \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) within their respective ranges.
