From the premises, we know:\n   - \\( U \\supset W \\)\n   - \\( W \\supset (X \\equiv \\neg Y) \\)\n   - \\( (X \\equiv \\neg Y) \\supset Z \\)\n   - \\( \\neg Z \\)\n\n2. Since \\( \\neg Z \\) is given, we can use the contrapositive of the third premise to infer \\( \\neg (X \\equiv \\neg Y \\).\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( (X \\equiv \\neg Y) \\supset Z \\) is \\( \\neg Z \\supset \\neg (X \\equiv \\neg Y \\).\n\n4. Now, we need to see if any of the options logically follow from the given premises.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( U \\supset Z \\)\n   - This is not a direct consequence.

We have \\( \\neg Z \\) and from the contrapositive of the third premise, we get \\( \\neg Z \\supset \\neg (X \\equiv \\neg Y \\), which directly implies \\( \\neg (X \\equiv \\neg Y \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\( \\neg (X \\equiv \\neg Y \\)"
