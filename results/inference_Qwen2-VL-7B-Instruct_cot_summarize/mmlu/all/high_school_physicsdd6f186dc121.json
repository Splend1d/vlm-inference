A charge moving along the direction of an electric field will experience a force, but a charge moving along the direction of a magnetic field will not experience a force.\n- This statement is false. A charge moving along the direction of an electric field will not experience a force because the force is perpendicular to the direction of motion. Similarly, a charge moving along the direction of a magnetic field will experience a force because the force is perpendicular to both the direction of motion and the magnetic field.\n\nB. All charges experience a force in an electric field, but only moving charges can experience a force in a magnetic field.\n- This statement is true. All charges experience a force in an electric field, and only moving charges can experience a force in a magnetic field.\n\nC. A positive charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a positive charge move perpendicular to a magnetic field.\n- This statement is false. A positive charge moves in the direction of an electric field experiences a force, but it move perpendicular to a magnetic field experiences a force.\n\nD. All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field.\n- This statement is false. All moving charges experience a force perpendicular to an electric field and parallel to a magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is:\n\nC. A positive charge move in the direction of an electric field; a positive charge move perpendicular to a magnetic field."
