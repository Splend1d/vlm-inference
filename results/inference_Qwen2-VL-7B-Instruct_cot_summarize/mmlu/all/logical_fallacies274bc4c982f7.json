This fallacy occurs when someone is judged based on the characteristics or actions of others who are associated with them, rather than evaluating them based on their own actions or characteristics.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Laudatory personality** - This fallacy occurs when someone is praised or given a positive label based on their actions or characteristics, which is not the case here.\n\nB. **Guilt by association** - This is the correct answer. It involves judging someone based on the actions or characteristics of the people they associate with, rather than evaluating them based on their own actions or characteristics.\n\nC. **Reprehensible personality** - This term does not describe a fallacy but rather refers to a negative trait or behavior.\n\nD. **Circular reasoning** - This fallacy involves reasoning in a circle, where the conclusion is included in the premise, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
