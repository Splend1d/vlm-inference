Marcus spent $3.25, so he used:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3.25}{0.25} = 13 \\text{ quarters} \\]\n\nIf one quarter operates the car wash for 60 seconds, then 13 quarters would operate the car wash for:\n\n\\[ 13 \\times 60 = 780 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTo convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:\n\n\\[ \\frac{780}{60} = 13 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it took Marcus 13 minutes to wash his car.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 13 minutes."
