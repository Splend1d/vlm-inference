                    "text": "To find the difference in the 13C NMR frequencies of benzene and chloroform on a 600 MHz spectrometer, we need to use the relationship between chemical shift ( (\u03b4) and the NMR frequency ( (\u03bd). The chemical shift is measured in parts per million ( (ppm), and the NMR frequency is measured in megahertz ( (MHz). The relationship between these two quantities is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\nu = \\frac{1000}{\\delta} \\]\n\nwhere \u03bd is the NMR frequency in MHz and \u03b4 is the chemical shift in ppm.\n\nFirst, we calculate the NMR frequency for benzene:\n\\[ \\nu_{benzene} = \\frac{1000}{128.4} \\approx 7.77 \\text{ MHz} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the NMR frequency for chloroform:\n\\[ \\nu_{chloroform} = \\frac{1000}{77.2} \\approx 12.98 \\text{ MHz} \\]\n\nThe difference in the NMR frequencies is:\n\\[ \\Delta\\nu = \\nu_{chloroform} - \\nu_{benzene} = 12.98 \\text{ MHz} - 7.77 \\text{ MHz} = 5.21 \\text{ MHz} \\]\n\nTo convert this difference to kHz, we multiply by 1000 (:\n\\[ \\Delta\\nu = 5.21 \\text{ MHz} \\times 1000 = 5210 \\text{ kHz} \\]\n\nThis value is not listed among the options provided. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the options. However, based on the calculation, the closest option to 5210 kHz is:\n\nA. 7.73 kHz\n\nThis is likely due to a rounding error in the calculation or the options provided. The correct answer based on the calculation would be 5210 kHz, which is not listed among the options."
