We can do this by dividing the mass of each element by the atomic mass of that element and then dividing by the smallest whole number ratio that gives whole numbers.\n\nFirst, we need to find the atomic masses of each element:\n\n- Carbon (C: 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen H: 1.01 g/mol\n- Oxygen O: 16.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the mass of each element to its atomic mass:\n\n- Carbon (C: 18.02 g / 12.01 g/mol = 1.50\n- Hydrogen H: 3.03 g / 1.01 g/mol = 3.00\n- Oxygen O: 29.05 g - ( (18.02 g + 3.03 g) = 8.00 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.50\n\nNow, we divide each ratio by the smallest ratio to get the simplest whole number ratio:\n\n- Carbon C: 1.50 / 0.50 = 3\n- Hydrogen H: 3.00 / 0.50 = 6\n- Oxygen O: 0.50 / 0.50 = 1\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the compound is C3H6O.\n\nThe correct answer is B. C3H6O."
