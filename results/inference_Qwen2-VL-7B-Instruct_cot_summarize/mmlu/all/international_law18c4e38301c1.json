Since there is no lis pendens rule in international law and all depends on the consent of the parties to a dispute, there is no priority or hierarchy among international courts and tribunals.\n\nIn international law, there is no lis pendens rule, which is a principle that determines which court or tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate a dispute when multiple courts or tribunals have been seized. Instead, the jurisdiction of of international courts and tribunals is based on the consent of the parties involved in the dispute. This means that the parties to a dispute must agree to the jurisdiction of of a particular court or tribunal for it to have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. Therefore, there is no inherent priority or hierarchy among international courts and tribunals."
