At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal. Is the evidence offered admissible?\n\nA. No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.\nB. No, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit.\nC. Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.\n"

Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nThe learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule allows for the admission of statements from a treatise or other published work that are relevant to a question of fact and are based on the author's knowledge or experience in the subject matter. In this case, the prosecutor is offering excerpts from a standard medical treatise to support the claim that the substance added to the resident's food is lethal. This is relevant to the question of whether the substance could result in death and is based on the author's knowledge and experience in the field of medicine. Therefore, the evidence is admissible under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule."
