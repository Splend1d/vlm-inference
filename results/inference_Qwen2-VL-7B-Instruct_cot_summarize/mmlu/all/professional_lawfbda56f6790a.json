The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the racetrack was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. After the racetrack was built and in operation for two years, the state legislature passed a bill requiring the racetrack to admit all senior citizens over the age of 65 for the discounted admission fee of 50 cents. This law is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\nB. unconstitutional, because it denies citizens under the age of 65 the equal protection of the law.\nC. unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\nD. unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.\n"

The bond agreement stipulated that at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt for the first five years. If the state legislature passes a law that requires the racetrack to admit all senior citizens for the discounted admission fee, it would reduce the revenue generated from admission charges, which would make it more difficult to repay the bond debt. This would be a breach of the bond agreement and would likely be considered unconstitutional."
