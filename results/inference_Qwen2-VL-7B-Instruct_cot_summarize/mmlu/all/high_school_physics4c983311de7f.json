The acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up and in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down.\n- This statement is incorrect. The acceleration vector for an ideal projectile is always downward due to gravity, which is constant and acts in the same direction throughout the flight.\n\nB. The speed at the top of the trajectory is zero.\n- This statement is incorrect. At the top of the trajectory, the vertical component of the velocity is zero, but the horizontal component remains constant. Therefore, the total speed is not zero.\n\nC. The object's total speed remains constant during the entire flight.\n- This statement is incorrect. The total speed of the projectile changes because the vertical component of of the velocity changes due to gravity.\n\nD. The vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down.\n- This statement is correct. The vertical component of the velocity decreases as the projectile moves upward due to gravity, and it increases as the projectile moves downward due to gravity.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nD. The vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down."
