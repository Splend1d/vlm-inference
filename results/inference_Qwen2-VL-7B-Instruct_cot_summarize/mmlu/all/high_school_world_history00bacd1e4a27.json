                    "text": "To determine the most common political significance of conflict between states to the rulers of early civilizations, let's analyze the given information and each option carefully.\n\nThe passage describes a ruler of Syria who spent many years as commander of his army, successfully overcame various lands, and captured their resources and inhabitants. The ruler's valor and success in battle were highly valued, and he was set at the head of his sons. The passage also also mentions a champion of Syria who challenged the ruler, but the ruler ultimately defeated him.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states.**\n   - This option suggests that victories provided legitimacy to the ruler. The passage indicates that the ruler's valor and success in battle were highly valued, which implies that victories could indeed grant legitimacy.\n\nB. **Victories against outsiders provided slaves whose labor sustained agricultural systems.**\n   - While the passage mentions capturing inhabitants and taking them captive, it does not explicitly state that these captives were used as slaves to sustain agricultural systems. The focus is more on the ruler's valor and the capture of resources and people, not specifically on slavery.\n\nC. **Victories against outsiders demonstrated the power of divinities over other gods.**\n   - The passage does not mention any divine or religious aspects related to the victories. It focuses on the ruler's military prowess and the capture of resources and people, not on divine power.\n\nD. **Victories against outsiders allowed leaders of states to incorporate the elites of the subjugated into the conquering power.**\n   - The passage does not mention the incorporation of elites from the subjugated states into the conquering power. The focus is more on the ruler's valor and the capture of resources and people, not on the incorporation of elites.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most common political significance of conflict between states to the rulers of early civilizations, as described in the passage, is:\n\n**A. Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states.**"
