Plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar, for it exercises judgment and provides language intake, whereas formal grammar study has been proved irrelevant.

The author argues that plentiful discursive experience is more effective in teaching grammar because it it exercises judgment and provides language intake, whereas formal grammar study has been proven irrelevant.\n\n3. **Analyze each option:**\n   - **Option A:** \"Using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar.\"\n     - This option aligns with the author's argument that plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar. It emphasizes the practical application of language in various situations.\n   - **Option B:** \"Good judgment can be improved by studying the rules of formal grammar.\"\n     - This option contradicts the author's argument. The author states that formal grammar study has been proved irrelevant.\n   - **Option C:** \"Analyzing and diagramming provide exercise in logical thinking.\"\n     - This option is not directly addressed in the passage. The passage focuses on the effectiveness of discursive experience over formal grammar study.\n   - **Option D:** \"Formal study of grammar improves writing ability.\"\n     - This option is also contradicted by the author's argument. The author argues that formal grammar study has been proved irrelevant.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer:**\n   The option that best captures the author's argument is Option A: \"Using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar.\"\n\nFinal answer: A."
