This means that MANOVA is better at detectingting differences between groups when the dependent variables are related to each other. This can lead to a greater protection against Type II errors ( which are errors of omission, where a true difference between groups is not detected. \n\nType I errors, which are errors of commission, where a difference between groups is detected when there is none, are not typically a concern when using MANOVA because the same alpha level is used for all dependent variables. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. usually offers greater protection against Type II error."
