The objection will be overruled because the question is not leading or misleading.\n\nIn the context of civil litigation, particularly during cross-examination, the court's role is to ensure that the trial proceeds fairly and efficiently. The question posed by the plaintiff's counsel, \"At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?\" is not considered misleading or leading. It is a direct and relevant inquiry into the witness's observations during the assault, which is pertinent to the plaintiff's case. Therefore, the court is likely to rule that the objection should be overruled, allowing the question to be asked, and proceed with the examination."
