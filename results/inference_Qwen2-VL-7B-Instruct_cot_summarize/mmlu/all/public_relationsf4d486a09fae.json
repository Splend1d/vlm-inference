Timothy Coombs identified four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies: ingratiation, downplaying, distancing, and nonexistence. Ingratiation involves trying to win the public's favor or approval, often by emphasizing positive aspects of the crisis or the organization's response. Downplaying involves minimizing the severity or impact of the crisis. Distancing involves creating a sense of distance between the organization and the crisis, often by shifting blame or responsibility. Nonexistence involves denying that the crisis exists or that it is a crisis at all. \n\nTherefore, ingratiation is not one of the four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by W. Timothy Coombs."
