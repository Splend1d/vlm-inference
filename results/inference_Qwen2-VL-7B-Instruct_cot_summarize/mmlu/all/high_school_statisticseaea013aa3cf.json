This implies that the sample mean is significantly greater than 3.5 cm.\n\nTo determine the correct statement about the confidence interval, we need to understand the relationship between the significance level and the confidence interval. The significance level (\u03b1 ( (5% in this case) is related to the confidence level ( (1 - \u03b1) in the following way:\n\n- A 5% significance level corresponds to a 95% confidence level ( (1 - 0.05 = 0.95).\n\nSince the null hypothesis was rejected at the 5% significance level, the confidence interval at the 95% confidence level would not include the specified mean length of 3.5 cm. This is because the rejection of the null hypothesis at the 5% level indicates that the sample mean is significantly different from 3.5 cm, and thus, the 95% confidence interval would not contain 3.5 cm.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nB. The specified mean length of 3.5 cm is not within a 90 percent confidence interval."
