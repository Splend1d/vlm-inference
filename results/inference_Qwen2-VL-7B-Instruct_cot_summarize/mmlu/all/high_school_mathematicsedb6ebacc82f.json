We can use the given information to find the amplitude and period of the sinusoidal function that models the water level, and then use that information to find the rate of change at noon.\n\nGiven:\n- High tide at 8 A.M., water level = 15 feet\n- Low tide 6 hours later at 2 P.M., water level = 3 feet\n\nFirst, let's find the amplitude and period of the sinusoidal function.\n\nAmplitude (A:\nThe amplitude is half the distance between the high and low tide levels. So, the amplitude is:\n\\[ A = \\frac{15 - 3}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\]\n\nPeriod (T:\nThe period is the time it takes for one complete cycle of the sinusoidal function. Since the water level changes from high to low and back to high in 12 hours ( (from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.), the period is:\n\\[ T = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we can write the sinusoidal equation for the water level, \\( h(t) \\), where \\( t \\) is the time in hours since 8 A.M.:\n\\[ h(t) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{T} t + \\phi\\right) + B \\]\n\nWhere \\( A \\) is the amplitude, \\( T \\) is the period, \\( \\phi \\) is the phase shift, and \\( B \\) is the vertical shift.\n\nSince the water level is at its highest at 8 A.M., the phase shift \\( \\phi \\) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
