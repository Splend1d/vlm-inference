Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nFermions are particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This principle is a consequence of their antisymmetric wave functions. Bosonsons, on the other hand, do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle and can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously, which is reflected in their symmetric wave functions."
