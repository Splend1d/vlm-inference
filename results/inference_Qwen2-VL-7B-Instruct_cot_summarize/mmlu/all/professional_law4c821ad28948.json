The contract provided that the closing would be 60 days after the contract was signed and that the seller would convey to the buyer a \"marketable title\" by a quitclaim deed at closing. The contract contained no other provisions regarding the title to be delivered to the buyer. A title search revealed that the land was subject to an unsatisfied $50,000 mortgage and a right-of-way easement over a portion of the land. The buyer now claims that the title is unmarketable and has refused to close. Is the buyer correct?\n\nA. No, because nothing under these facts renders title unmarketable.\nB. No, because the buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed. quitclaim deed.\nC. Yes, because the right-of-way easement makes the title unmarketable.\nD.

No, because nothing under these facts renders title unmarketable.\n\nIn real estate transactions, a \"marketable title\" typically means that the title is free from any encumbrances or defects that would prevent the buyer from freely using and transfer the property. In this case, the contract specifically states that the seller will convey a \"marketable title\" by a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed is a legal document that transfers ownership of property without any warranties or guarantees about the title's marketability.\n\nGiven that the contract explicitly states that the seller will convey a marketable title, the buyer is not entitled to refuse to close based on the existence of an unsatisfied mortgage or a right-of-way easement. The buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed, which means they are accepting the title as is, without any warranties or guarantees about its marketability.\n\nTherefore, the buyer is not correct in refusing to close based on the facts provided."
