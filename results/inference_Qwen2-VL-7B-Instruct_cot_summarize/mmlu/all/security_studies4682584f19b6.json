Perpetuation of violence against women in post-conflict society has devalued the claim that violence is more prevalent in militarized societies. Women were as protected by men in pre-war society as they were in post-war society.\nC. Case studies revealed that in certain military families, levels of violence were dependent on the degree of psychological damage inflicted during fighting, however this was variable and dependent on the individual not on gender basis.\nD. Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their \"protectors\" which may actually undermine liberal feminists' case of the \"right to fight\".\n"

Let's analyze each option in this context:\n\nA. This option highlights the ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women, suggesting that women may suffer violence from both the enemy and their protectors. This supports the argument for female soldiers to engage in peacekeeping work, particularly in post-conflict situations, as it could provide them with a safer environment and a sense of security.\n\nB. This option argues that violence against women in post-conflict societies is not more prevalent in militarized societies, and that women were equally protected by men in both pre-war and post-war societies. This perspective might undermine the argument for female soldiers in post-conflict situations, as it suggests that the presence of women in the military does not necessarily lead to increased protection for women.\n\nC. This option discusses the psychological damage inflicted on military families during fighting and its impact on levels of violence. While it does not directly address the role of biology, it does suggest that the psychological impact of conflict can influence violence, which could be relevant to understanding the role of biology in post-conflict gender security.\n\nD. This option discusses the ambiguity in the relationship between armed force and civilian women, suggesting that women may suffer violence from both the enemy and their protectors. This supports the argument for female soldiers to engage in peacekeeping work, particularly in post-conflict situations, as it could provide them with a safer environment and a sense of security.\n\nIn conclusion, the pragmatic implications of biology on post-conflict gender security are best represented by option A, as it directly addresses the role of female soldiers in providing a safer environment for women in post-conflict situations."
