For the defendant to be convicted of felony murder, there must be a causal link between the felony and the death. In this case, the defendant's gun was unloaded, and the victim's death was caused by the victim faintingng and falling backward, which was not directly related to the robbery. Therefore, there was not a sufficient connection between the victim's death and the robbery."
