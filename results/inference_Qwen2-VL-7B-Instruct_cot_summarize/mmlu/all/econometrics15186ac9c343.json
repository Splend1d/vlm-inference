Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion ( BIC are used to compare models, whereas Adjusted R-squared is a measure of the goodness of fit of a regression model. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n(ii) If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall.\n- This statement is true. Information criteria such as AIC and BIC penalize the addition of extra parameters. If the residual sum of squares (RSS falls, the information criterion will also fall because it is based on the RSS and the number of parameters.\n\n(iii) Akaiake's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion.\n- This statement is false. The Schwarz's Information Criterion ( BIC tends to favor models with fewer parameters compared to the AIC. Therefore, it is not always true that the AIC will lead to model orders that are at least as large as those of the BIC.\n\n(iv) Akaiake's information criterion is consistent.\n- This statement is false. The AIC is not a consistent estimator. Consistency in this context means that as the sample size increases, the estimator converges in probability to the true parameter value. The AIC does not have this property.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only"
