Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man's land. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The man, because the easement was extinguished.\nB. The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\nC. The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.\nD. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n"

The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n\nIn this scenario, the easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path and was promptly recorded. Since the easement was of public record when the purchaser acquired the house, the purchaser is likely to prevail in the lawsuit. The purchaser has a right to use the path as part of the easement, and the man's actions in erectinging a barricade would be considered as an interference with the purchaser's rights under the easement."
