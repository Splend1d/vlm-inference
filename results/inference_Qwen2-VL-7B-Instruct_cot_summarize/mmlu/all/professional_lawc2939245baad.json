Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of this land, the county leased most of it to a company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate luxury hotel \u0080\u0094complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina \u0080\u0094and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up management and operations bylaws for its new hotel, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The hotel announced that the least expensive room was $1,000 per night. Much of the population in the county cannot afford to stay at the new hotel. One resident who cannot afford to pay the hotel fees brings an action against the company, claiming that the high fees operate to discriminate against the poor, in violation of the constitutional right to equal protection. What is the most likely result of this action?\n\nA. The company will lose because social class constitutes a suspect classification under the equal protection clause.\nB. The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.\nC. The resident will win because all public rights cannot be limited to those who can afford them.\nD. The resident will win because discrimination against poor people violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The resident will win because discrimination against poor people violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no state shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" This clause prohibits states and local governments from discriminating against individuals based on factors such as race, national origin, religion, sex, or economic status. In this case, the high fees of the luxury hotel may be seen as discriminatory against individuals who cannot afford to pay them, potentially violating the equal protection clause.\n\nWhile the company's actions may be legally protected under certain circumstances, such as if the high fees are a result of the high cost of providing luxury services or if the fees are set by market forces, the resident's claim of discrimination against the poor is likely to be considered under the equal protection clause. The court would likely examine whether the high fees are a form of discrimination against individuals based on their economic status, which is a protected class under the Equal Protection Clause."
