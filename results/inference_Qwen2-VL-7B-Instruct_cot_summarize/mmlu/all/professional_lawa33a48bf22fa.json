The contract had a liquidated damages clause that provided for a deduction from the contract price for each day of delay in completing the bridge. The formula for the deductions from the contract price was based on how much traffic flow was turned away. The city tried to deduct the damages from the contract price. The contractor, however, pointed out that the city had not yet connected a road to the bridge so that there was no traffic flow and hence no damage to the city. Will the court uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city?\n\nA. No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.\nB. Yes, because the contract provision for liquidated damages has been breached and the city had no obligation to connect a road.\nC. Yes, because the bridge delays caused the city to delay finishing the road, thereby creating the need to enforce the provision for liquidated damages.\nD. No, because the city breached the contract by not connecting a road to the bridge.\n"

No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe liquidated damages clause in the contract was designed to penalize the contractor for delays in completing the bridge by deductinging a portion of the contract price for each day of delay. The clause was based on the traffic flow that would have been affected by the delay.\n\nHowever, the city's failure to connect a road to the bridge means that there was no traffic flow to be affected by the delay. Since there was no traffic flow, there were no damages suffered by the city due to the contractor's delay. Therefore, the purpose of the liquidated damages clause was frustrated because the damages that were supposed to be compensated for did not occur.\n\nThus, the court would likely not uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city because the conditions for the damages to be applicable ( i.e., the existence of traffic flow and the resulting damages - were not met due to the city's failure to perform its part of the contract."
