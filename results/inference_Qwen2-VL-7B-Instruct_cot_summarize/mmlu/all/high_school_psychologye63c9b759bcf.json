Classical conditioning involves pairing stimuli, and operant conditioning involves pairing a response with a stimulus.\nC. Operant conditioning is used to train organisms to perform specific acts, and classical conditioning is used to get organisms to stop performing specific acts.\nD. Classical conditioning is more difficult to use but more effective than operant conditioning.\n"
