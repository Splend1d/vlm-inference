                    "text": "A ventricular septal defect ( (VSD) is a heart defect that occurs when there is a hole in the wall ( septum that separates the right and left ventricles of the heart. This allows blood to shunt from the right ventricle to the left ventricle, bypassinging the lungs. \n\nGiven this information, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The percentage of oxygen in the left atrium would be lower.\n- This is incorrect. The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs, so its oxygen content would not be lower.\n\nB. The percentage of CO2 in the right ventricle would be higher.\n- This is incorrect. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, where CO2 is removed, so its CO2 content would not be higher.\n\nC. The percentage of oxygen in the right atrium would be lower.\n- This is incorrect. The right atrium receives deoxygenatedated blood from the body, so its oxygen content would not be lower.\n\nD. The percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle would be higher.\n- This is incorrect. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, where oxygen is added, so its oxygen content would not be higher.\n\nGiven the above analysis, none of the statements are correct. However, the correct understanding is that the oxygen content in the right ventricle would be higher due to the shunting of oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle would be higher."
