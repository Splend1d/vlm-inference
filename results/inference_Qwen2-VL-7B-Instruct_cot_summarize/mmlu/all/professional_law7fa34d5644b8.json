In the event that the furniture store brings suit against its employee (the truck driver) to recover for its losses, the furniture store will recover\n\nA. nothing, because the furniture store was primarily liable for the entire amount of damages.\nB. $12,500, because the employer and employee bear equal shares of responsibility for the plaintiff's injuries.\nC. $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident.\nD. $25,000, unless the furniture store was fully insured against such losses.\n"
