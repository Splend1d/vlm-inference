This can be done by using the OR (\\(\\lor\\)) and AND (\\(\\land\\)) connectives. We can express this as:\n\\[ (p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3 \\lor p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_4 \\lor p_1 \\land p_3 \\land p_4 \\lor p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4 \\]\n\n### Condition II: Exactly three of \\( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \\) are true.\n\nThis condition requires that exactly three variables are true. We can express this by using the AND (\\(\\land\\)) and OR (\\(\\lor\\)) connectives. We can express this as:\n\\[ (p_1 \\land p_2 \\land \\neg p_3 \\lor p_1 \\land \\neg p_2 \\land p_3 \\lor \\neg p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3 \\]\n\n### Condition III: An even number of \\( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \\) are true.\n\nThis condition requires that the number of true variables is even. We can express this by using the AND (\\(\\land\\)) and OR (\\(\\lor\\)) connectives. We can express this as:\n\\[ (p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4 \\lor p_1 \\land p_2 \\land \\neg p_3 \\land \\neg p_4 \\lor \\neg p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3 \\land \\neg p_4 \\lor \\neg p_1 \\land \\neg p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4 \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Condition I can be expressed using the given connectives.\n- Condition II can be expressed using the given connectives.\n- Condition III can be expressed using the given connectives.\n\nTherefore, all three conditions can be expressed using the given variables and connectives.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD.
