The federal government at the time was implementing a thaw in relations with the Cuban government. The U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba. A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council. Is the federal court likely to grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the state law was consistent with the federal law and with federal policy on Cuba.\nB. No, a state has the sovereign right to pass its own laws concerning its policies toward foreign countries.\nC. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it denies equal protection to citizens of other states.\nD. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.\n"

This conclusion is based on the principle of federal preemption, which occurs when a federal law or policy preempts or overrides state laws that conflict with it. In this case, the federal government was implementing a thaw in relations with Cuba, and the state law prohibiting the state's agencies from purchasing services or goods from companies doing business with Cuba directly conflicts with federal policy and law. Therefore, the state law is likely to be declared unconstitutional by the federal court."
