While he was watching television in his hotel room, a thief picked the lock on the hotel room door, entered, hit the traveler over the head, and stole his wallet. The traveler, who suffered a concussion, was hospitalized for three days. The lock on the hotel room door fully complied with a local ordinance that prescribed minimum security standards for hotel locks. If the injured traveler asserts a claim against the hotel for damages for his injury and loss of his wallet, the traveler will\n\nA. prevail, if the lock was defectively designed.\nB. prevail, because he was a business visitor on the hotel's property.\nC. not prevail, because the thief's act was an intervening cause.\nD. not prevail, if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock.\n"

If the intervening cause is independent of the defendant's conduct and is a natural and probable cause of the injury, it the defendant is not liable for the plaintiff's injury. In this case, the thief's act of picking the lock and entering the room is an intervening cause that caused the traveler's injury and loss of wallet. Therefore, the traveler will not prevail in his claim against the hotel."
