Perform alternative procedures to verify account balances.\n\nExplanation: Upon discovering that the accounts receivable confirmation process omitted material accounts, the CPA should take immediate steps to ensure the integrity of the financial statements. This includes performing alternative procedures to verify the account balances, such as reviewing sales records, customer correspondence, or other corroborative evidence. This action helps to mitigate the risk of material misstatements in the financial statements and ensures that the auditor's report is based on a thorough and accurate assessment of the accounts receivable balances."
