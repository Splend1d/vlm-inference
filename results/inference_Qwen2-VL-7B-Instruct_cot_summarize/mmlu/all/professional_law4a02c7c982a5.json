Among the purposes of the statute are the prevention of theft of boats in coastal waters and the protection of the rights of individual boat owners throughout the United States. Congress enacted the statute despite the fact that all states require boat owners to register their craft with the state department of motor vehicles. In addition, there is uncontradicted evidence that most stolen boats are kept or resold in the state in which the theft occurred. Nonetheless, an increasing number of boats are transported to other states and other countries for resale. Is the statute likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because most stolen boats remain within the state in which they were stolen.\nB. No, because the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.\n"

Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\n\nThe statute is likely to be held constitutional under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian Tribes. Congress can regulate activities that affect interstate commerce, even if the activities primarily occur within a single state. In this case, the transportation of stolen boats to other states and other countries for resale affects interstate commerce, and Congress could reasonably conclude that such activity impacts the rights of boat owners throughout the United States. Therefore, the statute is likely to be upheld as constitutional."
