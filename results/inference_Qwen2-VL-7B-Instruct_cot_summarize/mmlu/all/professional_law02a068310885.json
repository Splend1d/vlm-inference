The written contract entered included a \"payment clause,\" which provided that the videographer would be \"paid $10,000 for the filming and editing of a 60-minute video of the wedding and the reception. \" The man included in the contract a stipulation that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the videographer filmed and edited the 60-minute video, using high definition equipment, and presented it to the man. The videographer then submitted to the man an invoice statement in the amount of $15,000. Besides the $10,000 contract figure, the bill included a $5,000 charge for the use of the high definition equipment. Denying any additional liability, the man sent the videographer a check for $10,000. The videographer then brought suit against the man to recover the additional $5,000. Which of the following arguments would be most persuasive to support the videographer's contention that when the written contract was executed, the man agreed to pay the videographer $5,000 for use of the high definition equipment in addition to the $10,000 fee?\n\nA. According to the customary trade practice of the video industry, a $10,000 fee for filming and editing means $10,000 in addition to a supplemental charge if high definition equipment is used.\nB. An oral agreement to that effect, if provable, would only supplement, not contradict, the \"payment clause\" as written.\nC. Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document. \"\nD. Assuming arguendo that the written \"payment clause\" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.\n"

Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document.\"\n\nThis argument aligns with the Uniform Commercial Code ( (UCC), which governs contracts for the sale of goods and services. The UCC allows for the admission of extrinsic evidence to interpret the contract terms, provided that the evidence does not contradict the written terms. In this case, the videographer's claim that the man agreed to pay an additional $5,000 for the use of high definition equipment is not contradictory to the written contract, as it is a separate and additional charge. Therefore, extrinsic evidence supporting this claim would be admissible under the UCC.\n\nThe other arguments are less persuasive:\n\nA. This suggests that the customary trade practice of the video industry would imply an additional charge for high definition equipment, but this is not necessarily binding on the specific contract at hand.\nB. While an oral agreement could potentially support the videographer's claim, it is not as strong as the UCC's explicit provisions on the admissibility of extrinsic evidence.\nD. This argument about equitable considerations and the potential loss of $5,000 is less compelling because it does not directly address the admissibility of extrinsic evidence under the UCC.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
