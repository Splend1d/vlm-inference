                    "text": "To determine the best inference for why the King of Portugal insisted on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line, let's analyze the context and the treaty itself.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas was a 1494 agreement between Portugal and Spain ( (represented by the King of Portugal and the King and Queen of Castile, respectively) to divide the newly discovered lands outside Europe. The line was drawn to ensure that Portugal would have control over the lands east of the line, while Spain would have control over the lands west of the line.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Portuguese explorers were convinced that the route to the New World was easier traveled by going east.\n- This is not a valid reason because the New World was not known at the time of the treaty. The focus was on the lands already discovered and the potential for future discoveries.\n\nB. The Portuguese desired to continue the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land.\n- This is not a valid reason because the crusades were against Muslim powers in the Middle East, not against the lands discovered in the New World.\n\nC. The Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico.\n- This is not a valid reason because Mexico was not known at the time of the treaty. The focus was on the lands already discovered and the potential for future discoveries.\n\nD. The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa.\n- This is a valid reason because the Portuguese had already discovered the Cape of Good Hope and knew that it was possible to reach India by sailing eastward around Africa. This route would have allowed them to control the lands east of the demarcation line, which was the primary focus of the treaty.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best inference explaining the reason the King of Portugal insisted on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line is:\n\nD. The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa."
