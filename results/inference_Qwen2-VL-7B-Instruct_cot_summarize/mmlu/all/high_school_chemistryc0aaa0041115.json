We can do this by calculating the mole ratio of each element based on their percentages in the compound.\n\nGiven:\n- Carbon (C: 51.9%\n- Hydrogen H: 4.86%\n- Bromine Br: 43.2%\n\nFirst, we need to convert these percentages into moles. We'll assume a 100 g sample of the compound for simplicity.\n\n1. Calculate the moles of each element:\n   - Moles of C = ( (51.9 g C / 12.01 g/mol C) = 4.29 mol C\n   - Moles of H = ( (4.86 g H / 1.01 g/mol H) = 4.81 mol H\n   - Moles of Br = = ( (43.2 g Br / 80.91 g/mol Br) = 0.533 mol Br\n\n2. Divide each by the smallest number of moles to get the simplest whole number ratio:\n   - C: 4.29 mol / 0.533 mol = 8\n   - H: 4.81 mol / 0.533 mol = 9\n   - Br: 0.533 mol / 0.533 mol = 1\n\nSo, the simplest whole number ratio of C, H, and Br is 8:9:1.\n\nTherefore, the empirical formula of the compound is C8H9Br.\n\nThe correct answer is C. C8H9Br."
