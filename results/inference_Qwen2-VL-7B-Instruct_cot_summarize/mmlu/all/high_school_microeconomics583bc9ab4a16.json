In economics, the demand curve typically represents the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded. \n\nWhen marginal utility is constant, it means that the consumer is getting the same additional utility from each additional unit consumed. This would result in a horizontal demand curve, as the quantity demanded does not change with changes in price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Horizontal"
