                    "text": "C. The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis.\n\nExplanation: Net primary productivity (NPP) is the total amount of energy that is fixed by photosynthesis in a given area over a specific period of time. In terrestrial ecosystems, NPP is influenced by various factors, including temperature, light availability, and water availability. In the tropics, the high temperatures and high levels of solar radiation provide ideal conditions for photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Additionally, the high levels of solar radiation in the tropics can lead to higher levels of photosynthesis, which can increase NPP. Therefore, the availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis, which increases NPP."
