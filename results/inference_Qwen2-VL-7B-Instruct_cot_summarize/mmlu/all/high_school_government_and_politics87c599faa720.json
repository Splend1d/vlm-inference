When there is a strong front-runner in a state, people in that state are less likely to vote.\n- This statement suggests that the presence of a strong front-runner might decrease voter turnout. This is a plausible idea, as strong candidates can make elections seem less competitive and thus less compelling to voters.\n\nB. White-collar workers are more likely to vote than are blue-collar workers, with the exception of blue-collar workers who belong to unions.\n- This statement implies that white-collar workers have a higher likelihood of voting compared to blue-collar workers, except for those who are union members. This is a reasonable assertion, as union members might have more organized voting practices and higher engagement.\n\nC. Voters who are registered as independent are less likely to vote than those who are registered Democrats or Republicans.\n- This statement suggests that independent voters are less likely to vote compared to those who are registered as Democrats or Republicans. This is a common belief, as partisanship often influences voting behavior.\n\nD. There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees.\n- This statement claims that there is no difference in voting likelihood between individuals with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees. This is a controversial claim, as education level can be correlated with various factors that influence voting behavior, such as socioeconomic status and political affiliation.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that is false is:\n\nD. There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is D."
