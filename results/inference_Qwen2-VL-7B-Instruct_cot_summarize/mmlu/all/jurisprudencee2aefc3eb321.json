Because they are an expression of a capitalist economy and are unnecessary in a socialist society.\n\nIn a Marxist account of law, individual rights are often seen as expressions of the capitalist economy and are considered unnecessary in a socialist society. Marxists theory argues that the state is a tool of the ruling class to maintain their power and control over the economy. Therefore, individual rights are seen as a means of protecting the interests of the capitalist class rather than the interests of the working class."
