                    "text": "A 10-year-old girl decided to go sledding during a heavy snow and ice storm. She planned to go sledding down Hill Street, a steep and winding thoroughfare. Hill Street, which was located around the corner from the girl's home, was a popular sledding site because of its precipitous incline. The girl's parents had given her permission to sled down Hill Street. On the way to Hill Street, the girl met a classmate, who was 12, and asked if she wanted to join her. The classmate agreed, and the two girls walked to the top of Hill Street together. There, the youngsters mounted the sled. The girl was sitting in front and controlling the steering mechanism while the classmate was behind her. They started their descent at a relatively good speed. As they were about halfway down the road, they approached the intersection of Hill Street and Maple Drive. A driver, who was driving his car along Maple Drive, entered the intersection at the same time as the girls on the sled. When the classmate saw the driver's auto cross into their path, she shouted to the girl to fall off the sled. The girl became frightened and refused to jump off. Just before the sled collided with the car, the classmate pushed the girl off the sled. Her push caused the girl to fall and break her leg. The classmate couldn't get off the sled in time and was struck and injured by the driver's car. If the girl's parents, on behalf of their daughter, assert a claim against the classmate to recover damages for the girl's broken leg, will they prevail?\n\nA. No, if the classmate believed that the girl was in imminent peril when she pushed her off the sled.\nB. No, unless the classmate acted unreasonably when she pushed the girl off the sled.\nC. No, if the driver was driving negligently.\nD. No, because the classmate had the girl's implied consent to act in an emergency.\n"

To determine whether the girl's parents will prevail in their claim against the classmate, we need to consider the legal principles of consent, emergency situations, and negligence.\n\n### Legal Principles Involved:\n\n1. **Consent**: For the classmate to have implied consent to act in an emergency, there must be a clear indication that the girl consented to the classmate's actions in such a situation. This is often established through the context and the actions taken by the girl.\n\n2. **Emergency Situations**: In an emergency, individuals may take actions that would otherwise be considered unreasonable if not necessary to prevent harm. The classmate's actions must be judged based on whether they were reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n3. **Negligence**: The driver's actions must also be evaluated for negligence. If the driver was negligent, the classmate's actions might be seen as reasonable in response to the emergency.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Consent**: The classmate's push to get the girl off the sled was an action taken in an emergency situation. The girl's parents must demonstrate that the classmate had implied consent from the girl to act in such a manner. If the girl consented to the classmate's actions, the classmate's actions would be considered reasonable.\n\n- **Emergency Situations**: The classmate's actions were taken in response to an immediate threat ( the car entering the intersection. The classmate's actions was reasonable under the circumstances, as she was trying to prevent the girl from being hit by the car.\n\n- **Negligence**: The driver's actions must be evaluated for negligence. If the driver was negligent, the classmate's actions might be seen as reasonable in response to the emergency.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the context and the actions taken, the classmate's actions were reasonable under the circumstances. The girl's parents must demonstrate that the classmate did not have implied consent from the girl to act in such a manner. If the classmate believed that the girl was in imminent peril and acted reasonably to prevent harm, the classmate's actions would likely be considered reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. No, if the classmate believed that the girl was in imminent peril when she pushed her off the sled.**"
