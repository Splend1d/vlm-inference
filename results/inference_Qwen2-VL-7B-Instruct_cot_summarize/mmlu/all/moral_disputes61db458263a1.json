Heroin use was much higher among military personnel in Vietnam than it was among veterans who returned to the United States.\n- This option suggests that the availability of heroin was higher in Vietnam, leading to higher use among military personnel. This directly supports the claim that increased availability leads to increased use.\n\nB. The percentage of physicians who use psychoactive drugs is much higher than the general population.\n- This option indicates that physicians have higher use rates of psychoactive drugs compared to the general population. However, it does not directly address the relationship between availability and use. It does not directly address the relationship between availability and use.\n\nC. Alcohol abuse declines when the law restricts the times it can be legally sold.\n- This option suggests that restricting availability ( of alcohol leads to a decline in abuse. This is contrary to the claim that increased availability leads to increased use.\n\nD. all of the above.\n- This option is incorrect because option C contradicts the claim.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Heroin use was much higher among military personnel in Vietnam than it was among veterans who returned to the United States."
