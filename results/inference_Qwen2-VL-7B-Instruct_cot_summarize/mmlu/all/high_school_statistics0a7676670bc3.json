H0: p \u2264 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60\n\nThis setup is appropriate because it is a one-tailed test where the null hypothesis (H0) is that the proportion of visitors who shop at the store is 60% or less ( (p \u2264 0.60), and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that the proportion is greater than 60% ( (p > 0.60). This aligns with the claim that more than 60% of the visitors shop at the store."
