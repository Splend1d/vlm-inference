Fearing that students from the school might find the gun and get into trouble using it, the man put it in the trunk of his car. The man drove off, was lawfully stopped by a police officer for speeding, and allowed the officer to search his car and the trunk. During the search, the officer discovered the gun. The man was charged under a federal statute prohibiting the knowing possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Which of the following additional facts, if established, would be most helpful to the man's defense?\n\nA. He did not intend to use the gun for an unlawful purpose.\nB. He did not know about the federal statute.\nC. He was driving to the police station to give the gun to the authorities when the officer stopped his car.\nD. His previous conviction did not involve the use of a gun or other weapon.\n"

He was driving to the police station to give the gun to the authorities when the officer stopped his car.\n\nThis fact would provide that the man had a lawful intention to surrender the gun to the authorities, thereby negatinging the element of \"knowing possession\" required by the federal statute. If the court finds that the man was on his way to turn in the gun, it would be more likely to acquit him of the charge."
