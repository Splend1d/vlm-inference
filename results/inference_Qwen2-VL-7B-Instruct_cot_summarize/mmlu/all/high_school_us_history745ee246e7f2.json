The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business.\"\n\u2014The New York Times, October 15, 1905\nThe scenario described in the passage above is most directly reflected in the ideas of which of the following?\n\nA. Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nB. Equal Rights Amendment.\nC. Pure Food and Drug Act.\nD. Interstate Commerce Act.\n"

Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nThe passage discusses how economic necessity has led to significant social changes, particularly in the roles and behaviors of women in society. It mentions the economic necessity that has forced women out of the home and into the workforce, leading to new social phenomena such as women eating in public without being accompanied by men. This reflects the broader themes of economic necessity and social change that are central to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which aimed to eliminate discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nThe Equal Rights Amendment ( (B) is a proposed constitutional amendment in the United States that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. While it shares some themes with the passage, it is more focused on legal equality rather than the economic factors discussed.\n\nThe Pure Food and Drug Act ( (C) and the Interstate Commerce Act ( (D) are both federal laws that regulate specific industries and aspects of commerce, but they do not directly address the broader social changes or economic necessity as described in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Civil Rights Act of 1964."
