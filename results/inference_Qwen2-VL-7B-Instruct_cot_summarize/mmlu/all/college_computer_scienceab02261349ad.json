                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the implications of write-through and write-back policies on cache hit ratios and main memory operations.\n\n1. **Write-through policy**: Every write operation updates main memory. This means that every write operation results in a main memory operation, regardless of whether the data is already in the cache or not. This policy ensures that the cache and main memory are always synchronized, but it can lead to a higher number of main memory operations.\n\n2. **Write-back policy**: A write operation to a line found in the cache does not affect main memory until the line is evicted from the cache. This means that write-back reduces the number of main memory operations compared to write-through, as writes are deferred until eviction. However, this policy can lead to inconsistencies between the cache and main memory until eviction occurs.\n\nGiven that write-allocation is always used, we need to consider how this affects the hit ratio and main memory operations.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\nA. **Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. Write-back can lead to better hit ratios because it defers writes until eviction, reducing main memory operations. However, it does not guarantee a better hit ratio because the hit ratio depends on various factors including the cache size, block size, and the distribution of of data accesses.\n\nB. **Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back.**\n   - This is also not necessarily true. Write-through can lead to a higher number of main memory operations, which can degrade the hit ratio. However, it does not guarantee a worse hit ratio because the hit ratio depends on various factors including the cache size, block size, and the distribution of of data accesses.\n\nC. **The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. Write-back defers writes until eviction, which means that the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will be smaller for write-back compared to write-through.\n\nD. **The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-through than for write-back.**\n   - This is true. Write-through always results in a main memory operation for every write operation, whereas write-back defers writes until eviction, reducing the number of main memory operations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-through than for write-back.**"
