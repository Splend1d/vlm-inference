The 2:3 ratio means that for every 2 orbits of Neptune, Pluto completes 3 orbits. This resonance causes the two planets to maintain a stable orbit.\n\nB. **Kirkwood Gaps** - These are gaps in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They are caused by the gravitational perturbations from Jupiter, which are a result of the orbital resonances with the asteroids in the belt.\n\nC. **Gaps in Saturn's rings** - These gaps, such as the Cassini Division, are caused by the gravitational influence of Saturn's moons, particularly Prometheus and Epimetheus. These moons are in orbital resonances with the rings, causing the gaps.\n\nD. **Breaking of of small Jovian moons to form ring materials** - This is not directly caused by orbital resonance. The breaking of moons due to tidal forces is more related to the gravitational interactions between the moons and the planet, rather than orbital resonances.\n\nTherefore, the option that is NOT caused by orbital resonance is:\n\nD. Breaking of small Jovianian moons to form ring materials."
