I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. \"Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance.

Therefore, the power of acceptance created by the letter was terminated by the lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 18.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA. Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2."
