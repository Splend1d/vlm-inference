In order to sell lottery tickets directly to the public, the agency established outlets throughout the country, including in a particular state. The state levies a general tax on the gross receipts from all gaming operations within the state. The state seeks to tax the agency on the sales of lottery tickets from its outlets within the state. Must the agency pay the state gross receipts tax?\n\nA. No, because a federal agency may not pay any monies to a state without explicit federal statutory authorization to do so.\nB. No, because a state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.\nC. Yes, because it is a generally applicable tax that does not discriminate against the agency.\nD. Yes, because the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities.\n"

Yes, because it is a general applicable tax that does not discriminate against the agency.\n\nThe principle of \"general applicability\" means that the tax must be applied uniformly to all similarly situated taxpayers. In this case, the state's tax on gross receipts from all gaming operations within the state is a general tax that applies to all gaming operations, including those conducted by the federal agency. Since the agency is engaged in a commercial activity (selling lottery tickets) within the state, it is subject to the same tax as any other commercial entity operating within the state. Therefore, the agency must pay the state gross receipts tax."
