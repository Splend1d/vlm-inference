The movement was characterized by a desire for political and economic reform, particularly among farmers and laborers who felt disenfranchised by the existing political system. The Populists Party was formed in 1892 and advocated for a variety of reforms, including the direct election of senators, the regulation of railroads, and the establishment of a national bank.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Corruption in government\u2014especially as it related to big business\u2014energized the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments.\n\nThe Populist Movement was a response to what many saw as the corruption and power of big business and the political parties of the time. The movement sought to empower the people and reduce the influence of wealthy interests in government."
