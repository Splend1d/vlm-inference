The government spending multiplier is calculated as 1 / (1 - MPC, and the tax multiplier is calculated as -1 / MPC.\n\nGiven that the MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume) is 0.75, we can calculate the multipliers as follows:\n\nGovernment Spending Multiplier = 1 / (1 - 0.75 = 1 / 0.25 = 4\n\nTax Multiplier = -1 / 0.75 = -4 / 3 \u2248 -1.33\n\nSince the government spending multiplier is positive (4 and the tax multiplier is negative (-1.33), the overall effect on the economy is expansionary. The positive government spending multiplier indicates that the increase in government spending will lead to a larger increase in aggregate demand, while the negative tax multiplier indicates that the increase in taxes will lead to a smaller increase in aggregate demand. The net effect is an expansionary policy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. expansionary \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -3."
