Now, Congress, under intense lobbying pressure from the press, proposes to enact legislation forbidding any state from requiring journalists to reveal the sources of their news articles in civil suits. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument in support of this proposed law?\n\nA. Congress has the authority under the commerce clause to regulate the flow of news.\nB. Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land and take precedence over any conflicting state laws.\nC. Congress is essentially reaffirming the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nD. Under Article I, Section 8, Congress has the authority to secure to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\n"

Congress is essentially reaffirming the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThis argument is based on the First Amendment's protection of freedom of the press, which is a fundamental right that ensures the free flow of information and ideas. The proposed law would reinforce this right by preventing states from compelling journalists to disclose confidential sources in civil suits, thereby protecting the integrity of the news-gathering process and ensuring that journalists can continue to perform their duties without fear of legal repercussions for protecting their sources."
