                    "text": "As a result of the increasing northward movement of the population from a nearby city, a town enacted a zoning ordinance restricting present and future land use in the town to single family dwellings, except in the downtown commercial shopping area, and except for a small area in which multifamily dwellings not over 40 feet in height were permitted. In addition, all new construction or exterior modifications of existing buildings required prior approval of an aesthetic control board. The zoning ordinance defined the term \"family\" in the context of single family dwellings to mean only one or more persons related by marriage, blood, or adoption, thereby excluding unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single residence unit. The enabling legislation contained the following provision:\"This enactment is necessary to preserve the physical and social homogeneity of this community, and preserve and protect the quality of life of its citizens. \"A town resident owns a single family residence with five bedrooms. Prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance, the resident leased the premises on a month-to-month basis to a boyfriend and girlfriend and three other male law students. The five individuals are all unmarried and attend the nearby law school. The resident now brings suit to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance against himself. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance provision that prohibits unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single family residence?\n\nA. The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The zoning ordinance would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the resident's rights under the contract clause.\nD. The zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power.\n"

The zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power.\n\nThe police power of a state or local government is a broad authority granted to it preserve and protect the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of its citizens. Zoning ordinances are a common exercise of this power, and they are generally upheld as constitutional as long as they are rationally related to a legitimate public purpose.\n\nIn this case, the zoning ordinance provision that excludes unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single family dwelling is likely to be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power. The ordinance is intended to preserve the physical and social homogeneity of the community and protect the quality of life of its citizens, which are legitimate public purposes. The provision is rationally related to these purposes, as it helps to maintain the single family dwelling character of the town and preserve the social fabric of the community.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power."
