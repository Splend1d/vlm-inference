The contract has many clauses, including one that prohibits generally the assignment of the contract or any of its terms. The distributor assigns its right to receive the funds anyway. Will a court enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances?\n\nA. No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.\nB. No, a bar of assignment is an unconstitutional deprivation of due process.\nC. Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.\nD. Yes, a bar against the right to receive proceeds is a favored restriction unless otherwise stated.\n"

Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.\n\nIn contract law, a bar against assignment is generally enforceable unless it is specifically stated otherwise. However, the specific clause in this case prohibits the assignment of of the contract or any of its terms, which means that the distributor's right to receive the funds is also subject to this restriction. Therefore, a court would likely enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances."
