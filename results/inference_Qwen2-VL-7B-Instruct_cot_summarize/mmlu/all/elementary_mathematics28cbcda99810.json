Since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, we round up the ten thousands digit by 1.\n\nStarting with 836,527, we round up the 6 to a 7, making the number 837,527. However, since we're rounding to the nearest ten thousand, we look at the thousands digit again and see that it's 5, so we round up the ten thousands digit by 1.\n\nTherefore, the population rounded to the nearest ten thousand is 840,000.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 840,000."
