The agency is authorized to enter into and carry out such contracts or agreements as are necessary in the conduct of its business. An export company entered into a contract with the federal agency to transport a variety of goods to foreign countries. Thereafter, the federal agency suspended the export company pending an investigation into possible misuse of official inspection certificates relating to commodities exported to a foreign country. During an investigation relevant to the charge, the president of the export company presented information to the federal agency. Subsequently, the president was charged with violation of a federal statute that states:\"It is a felony for any person in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency to knowingly make a false statement. \"At the president's trial, the government presented evidence to show that he falsified bills of lading and embezzled over $500,000 of surplus commodities for export. The president testified that he did not know that he was dealing with a federal agency and, hence, the federal government would have jurisdiction over his company's export contract with the federal agency. As to the significance of the president's ignorance, the court should instruct the jury that it may convict the president\n\nA. if it finds that the president knew that he was doing business with a federal agency.\nB. if it finds that the president was aware that he might have been doing business with a federal agency.\nC. if a reasonable person would have been aware that he might have been doing business with a federal agency.\nD. even if there was no reason the president should have known that he was doing business with a federal agency.\n"

If a reasonable person would have been aware that he might have been doing business with a federal agency.\n\nIn the context of the federal statute, the key issue is whether the president of the export company was aware that he was dealing with a federal agency. The statute states that it is a felony for any person to knowingly make a false statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency. The president's ignorance of the federal agency's involvement does not absolve him of liability if it can be shown that a reasonable person in his position would have been aware of the federal agency's involvement.\n\nTherefore, the court should instruct the jury that they may convict the president if they find that a reasonable person in his position would have been aware that he might have been doing business with a federal agency. This instruction reflects the principle that ignorance of the law is not a defense, and it takes into account the reasonable person standard, which is often used in criminal law to determine whether a defendant should have known something."
