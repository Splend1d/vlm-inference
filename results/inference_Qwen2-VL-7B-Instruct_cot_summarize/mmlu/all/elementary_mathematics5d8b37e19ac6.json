A typical month has about 30 days. \n\nIf Rob uses 1 box of cat food every 5 days, we can calculate the number of boxes he uses in a month as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Boxes per month} = \\frac{\\text{Days in a month}}{\\text{Days per box}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Boxes per month} = \\frac{30}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Boxes per month} = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Rob uses 6 boxes of cat food per month.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 6 boxes."
