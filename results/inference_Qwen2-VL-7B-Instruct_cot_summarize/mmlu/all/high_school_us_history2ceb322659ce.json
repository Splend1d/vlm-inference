Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.\u2026 Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.\u2026 It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.\u2026 Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.\u2026 The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\n\u2014Geraldine Ferraro, Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address, July 19, 1984\nThe ideas expressed in the passage above would most directly have strengthened which of the following during the 1980s?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which of the given options would most directly have strengthened the ideas expressed in the passage, we need to analyze the content and context of the passage. The passage discusses issues such as tax policies, nuclear warheads, and the need for rules that work for all Americans. It also also mentions the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries, implying a historical perspective on the nation's goals.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Opposition to the administration's arms buildup**: The passage mentions the issue of nuclear warheads and questions whether young couples should bring children into a world with 50,000 nuclear warheads. This suggests a strong stance against the administration's arms buildup, as it is seen as a threat to the future of the nation.\n\nB. **Efforts to deregulate many industries**: The passage does not discuss deregulation or any specific industry reforms. It focuses more on tax policies and the general vision for the nation.\n\nC. **Efforts to reform the welfare system**: The passage does not mention welfare reform or any specific social policy reforms. It is more focused on broader issues like tax policies and nuclear warheads.\n\nD. **Support for the administration's cold war policies**: The passage criticizes the administration's policies, particularly the arms buildup, which implies opposition to the administration's cold war policies.\n\nGiven the passage's focus on the administration's arms buildup and the broader implications for the future of the nation, the most direct strengthening of the ideas expressed would be:\n\n**A. Opposition to the administration's arms buildup**"
