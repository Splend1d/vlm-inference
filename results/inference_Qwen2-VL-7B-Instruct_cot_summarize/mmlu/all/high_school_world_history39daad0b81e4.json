It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following conclusions about imperial treatment of \"barbarian\" (foreign) peoples in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage?\n\nA. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\nB.

                    "text": "To solve this logic reasoning problem, we need to carefully analyze the passage and determine which conclusion is most directly supported by the information provided.\n\nThe passage describes a historical event where the Chamavi and Angrivarii tribes entered the settlements of the Tencteri and Bructeri tribes, driving them out, and ultimately exterminated them with the help of neighboring tribes. The passage emphasizes the desire for discord among tribes and the favorable regard from heaven for this action. It also mentions that the tribes did not grudge the spectacle of the conflict and that more than sixty thousand fell before the eyes of the empire.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\n- This option aligns well with the passage, which describes the tribes driving each other out and ultimately exterminating them. The passage implies that the empire did not oppose this action, suggesting that it was encouraged.\n\nB. Empires welcomed migrations of barbarian peoples as sources of military manpower or economic productivity.\n- The passage does not mention any welcoming of migrations or the use of barbarian peoples as sources of manpower or productivity. It focuses on the conflict and extermination of tribes.\n\nC. Empires used military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence.\n- The passage does not mention the empire using military force against all neighboring tribes. It focuses on the internal conflict among tribes.\n\nD. Empires used religion to convert barbarian peoples so that they might become friendlier to the state.\n- The passage does not mention the use of religion or conversion efforts. It focuses on the conflict and extermination of tribes.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the conclusion most directly supported by the passage is:\n\nA. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\n\nFinal answer: A."
