She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28-week gestation. Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. The physician recommends administration of Rho\n\nA. immune globulin to the patient.

Formation of antibodies to RhD\n\nRhoGAM ( (Rh immune globulin) is a medication that is given to women who are Rh-negative and have been exposed to Rh-positive blood. This exposure can occur during pregnancy, delivery, or abortion. The medication is given to prevent the mother's immune system from forming antibodies against Rh-positive blood, which can cause problems for future pregnancies. In this case, the physician is recommending RhoGAM to prevent the formation of antibodies to RhD in the mother, which could lead to complications in future pregnancies."
