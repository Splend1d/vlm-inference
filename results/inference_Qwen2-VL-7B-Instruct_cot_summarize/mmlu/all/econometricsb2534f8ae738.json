(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nA standard GARCH(1,1) model is designed to capture several key features of financial asset return time-series, including:\n\ni) Fat tails in the return distribution: GARCH models are capable of capturing the leptokurtosis ( (fat tails) in financial return distributions, which is a common characteristic of financial data.\n\nii) Leverage effects: GARCH models can also account for the leverage effect, which is the phenomenon where negative returns shocks have a larger impact on volatility than positive return shocks of the same magnitude.\n\niii) Volatility clustering: GARCH models are specifically designed to capture volatility clustering, which is the tendency for high ( (volatility) periods to be followed by high volatility periods and low volatility periods to be followed by low volatility periods.\n\niv) Volatility affecting returns: While GARCH models do not explicitly model the direct effect of volatility on returns, they do capture the volatility dynamics that can indirectly affect returns distributions.\n\nTherefore, the GARCH(1,1) model can capture features i), ii), and iii) but not iv) directly."
