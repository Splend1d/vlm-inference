It was addressed to the manager. He read it, put it in a private drawer, and did not read it again. Later, he tried to sue the competitor for defamation as a result of the letter. Will the court likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, and on what grounds? Base your answer on the common law definition of defamation.\n\nA. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.\nB. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the language is not damaging to the manager's reputation.\nC. No, it will not dismiss because the circumstances show that all of the elements of defamation are all present.\nD. No, it will not dismiss because a plaintiff in a defamatory action has an absolute right to a jury trial to prove defamation.\n"

No, it will not dismiss because the circumstances show that all of the elements of defamation are all present.\n\nIn the context of defamation law, the key elements that must be present for a claim to succeed are:\n\n1. Publication: The statement must be communicated to at least one person other than the person defamed.\n2. Defamatory statement: The statement must be false and harmful to the plaintiff's reputation.\n3. Circumstances: The statement must be made under circumstances that support a reasonable inference of harm to the plaintiff's reputation.\n\nIn this case, the manager did not read the letter again after receiving it, which suggests that the letter was not published to a third party. Therefore, the court is likely to dismiss the case on the basis that the publication element is not met."
