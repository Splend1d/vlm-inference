Fermentation replenishes the NAD+ necessary for glycolysis to continue.\n\nFermentation is a metabolic process that occurs in the absence of oxygen and is primarily used by cells to generate energy. The end product of alcohol fermentation, ethanol, is a waste product for the yeast cells that produce it, but it serves as a means to regenerate the NAD+ ( needed for glycolysis to continue. NAD+ is a coenzyme that is used in the process of glycolysis to convert pyruvate into lactate or ethanol, and it is depleted during this process. Fermentation replenishes the NAD+ by converting pyruvate into ethanol and regenerating NAD+."
