In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.\nB. In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\nC. Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.\nD. When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.\n"

Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.\n\nIn the early stages of the formation of the solar system, the protoplanetary disk was spinning and the gravitational forces of the central protostar acted on the material within it. The heavier, denser materials, such as metals and rocks, were pulled towards the center of the nebula due to their greater gravitational attraction. This process is known as gravitational settling. On the other hand, lighter materials, such as hydrogen and helium, were less affected by gravity and remained in the outer regions of the nebula. Over time, this gravitational settling led to the formation of the inner planets, which are composed of denser materials, and the outer planets, which are composed of lighter materials."
