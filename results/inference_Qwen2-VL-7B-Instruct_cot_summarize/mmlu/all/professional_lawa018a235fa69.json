The following day, the gardener conveys the property to a landscaper; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the gardener executes an identical conveyance of the orchard to a friend. The friend gives the gardener a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper. The landscaper, however, records her deed on February 6. The friend then conveys his interest in the farm to an investor, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the friend. On February 5, the investor purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the landscaper and duly records the deed. Suppose that the jurisdiction in which the property is located has a pure race statute as their deed recordation law. Under these circumstances, which of the aforementioned parties would ultimately prevail?\n\nA. The investor.\nB. The landscaper.\nC. The friend.\nD. The gardener.\n"

Here's the reasoning based on the given facts and the principles of a pure race statute:\n\n1. **Conveyance to Gardener (** ( On February 1, the gardener conveys the orchard to the landscaper. The landscaper does not record the deed, but the gardener does.\n\n2. **Conveyance to Friend (** On February 2, the gardener conveys the orchard to a friend. The friend records the deed and gives the gardener a check for $100,000. The friend has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper but records the deed.\n\n3. **Conveyance to Investor (** On February 4, the friend conveys the orchard to an investor. The investor gives a purchase price of $115,000 and records the deed on February 5. The investor purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the landscaper.\n\n4. **Pure Race Statute** - The jurisdiction has a pure race statute, which means that the first deed recorded in the public records prevails over subsequent deeds.\n\nGiven these points, the investor's deed is recorded first on February 5, and the landscaper's deed is recorded second on February 6. According to the pure race statute, the first deed recorded prevails. Therefore, the investor's deed is the first recorded deed, and the investor would ultimately prevail in any dispute over ownership of the orchard.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The investor."
