Providing factual accounts in testimony explaining positions taken during the performance of any services provided to the client.\n\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, an accounting firm is generally prohibited from providing nonaudit services to an issuer audit client that could impair their independence. However, there are exceptions for certain nonaudit services, including providing factual accounts in testimony explaining positions taken during the performance of any services provided to the client. This exception allows the accounting firm to provide expert testimony that is based on the factual information gathered during the audit process, without impairing their independence."
