Economic development is often associated with improvements in living standards, access to healthcare, education, and other factors that contribute to higher life satisfaction. Therefore, this statement is likely true.\n\n2. **Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact.**\n   - This statement is also a bit more nuanced. While it is true that life events like marriage and divorce can significantly impact happiness in the short term, research has shown that the effects tend to diminish over time. However, the long-term impact can vary widely depending on the individual's circumstances and how they cope with the event. Therefore, this statement is generally generally true but not necessarily \"surprisingly little.\"\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. True, False"
