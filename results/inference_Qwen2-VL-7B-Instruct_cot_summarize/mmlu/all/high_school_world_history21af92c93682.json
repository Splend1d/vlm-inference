The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.\nIndonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955\nThe \"revolutions\" spoken of by Sukarno in the passage above most likely relate to which of the following causes?\n\nA. Gender equality\nB. Communism\nC. Decolonization\nD. Environmental conservation\n"

It focuses more on the need for peace and the upbuilding of countries.\n\n3. **Decolonization**: The passage mentions the need for peace and the upbuilding of countries, which aligns with the broader context of the Bandung Conference. The Bandung Conference was a meeting of 29 Asian and African countries that aimed to promote peace and cooperation among nations, particularly in the context of decolonization and the struggle against colonialism.\n\n4. **Environmental conservation**: The passage does not mention environmental conservation at all, making this an unlikely cause.\n\nGiven the context of the Bandung Conference and the broader historical context of the 1950s, the most likely cause of the \"revolutions\" spoken of by Sukarno is:\n\n**C. Decolonization**"
