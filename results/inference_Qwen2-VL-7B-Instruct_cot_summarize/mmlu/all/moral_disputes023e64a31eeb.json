Viewpoint-biased speech restrictions are those that favor or disfavor certain viewpoints or speakers, often based on their political, ideological, or other non-substantive reasons.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Those who value a strong right to privacy: Viewpoint-biased speech restrictions do not directly relate to privacy rights. Privacy rights are more about the protection of personal information and the control over how it is shared, not about the content or viewpoint of speech.\n\nB. Those who value strong protections for freedom of speech: Viewpoint-biased speech restrictions directly conflict with the principle of freedom of speech. They limit the ability of speakers to express their views without fear of censorship based on their viewpoint. Therefore, those who value strong protections for freedom of speech would find such restrictions troubling.\n\nC. Those who don't value strong protection for freedom of speech: For individuals who do not prioritize freedom of speech, viewpoint-biased restrictions might not be as concerning because they do not see the value in protecting all viewpoints equally.\n\nD. Those who value equal educational opportunity: While viewpoint-biased speech restrictions might indirectly affect educational opportunities by limiting access to diverse viewpoints, the primary focus of such restrictions is on speech, not education.\n\nGiven the analysis, the viewpoint-biased speech restriction would be most troubling to those who value strong protections for freedom of speech.\n\nFinal answer: B. those who value strong protections for freedom of speech"
