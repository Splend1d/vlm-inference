Because Aristotle believed that man is a 'social animal'\n\nAristotle's philosophy emphasizes the importance of community and social interaction, which aligns with the principles of communitarianism. Aristotle believed that humans are inherently social beings and that our nature is shaped by our relationships with others. This view is in contrast to Kant's philosophy, which places a greater emphasis on individual autonomy and the inherent dignity of the individual."
