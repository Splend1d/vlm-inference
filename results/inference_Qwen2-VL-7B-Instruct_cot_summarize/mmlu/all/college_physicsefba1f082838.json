These impurity levels can either be acceptor levels ( (which are created by adding a group III element like B, Al, or Ga) or donor levels ( (which are created by adding a group V element like As, P, or Sb).\n\n- **Group III elements (** ( (B, Al, Ga) create acceptor levels and are used to create p-type semiconductors.\n- **Group V elements.** ( (As, P, S) create donor levels and are used to create n-type semiconductors.\n\nGermanium is a group IV semiconductor. To create an n-type semiconductor in germanium, we need to add a group V element as a dopant.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. **As** - Arsenic is a group V element and can be used as a dopant to create an n-type semiconductor.\nB. **P** - Phosphorus is a group V element and can be used as a dopant to create an n-type semiconductor.\nC. **Sb** - Antimony is a group V element and can be used as a dopant to create an n-type semiconductor.\nD. **B** - Boron is a group III element and cannot be used as a dopant to create an n-type semiconductor.\n\nTherefore, the ion that CANNOT be used as a dopant in germanium to make an n-type semiconductor is:\n\n**D.
