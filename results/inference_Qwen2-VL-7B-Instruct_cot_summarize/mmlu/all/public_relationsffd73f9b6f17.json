Leitch and Neilson (2001).\n\nLeitch and Neilson (2001) argued that if an organization did not affect a public, there was no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications. This perspective is often referred to as the \"publics approach\" in public relations, which focuses on the organization's impact on specific publics rather than a broad, undifferentiated audience."
