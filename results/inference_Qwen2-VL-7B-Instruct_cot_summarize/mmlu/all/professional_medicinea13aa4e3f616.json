Polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation\n\nThe symptoms described in the patient, including fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on the hands and feet, are consistent with a cytokine storm, which is a rapid and excessive release of cytokines by immune cells. This can occur as a result of polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation, which is a common side effect of treatment with rabbit antithymocyte globulin. This treatment is used to suppress the immune system in patients with bone marrow failure, but it can also lead to an overreaction of the immune system, causing the symptoms described."
