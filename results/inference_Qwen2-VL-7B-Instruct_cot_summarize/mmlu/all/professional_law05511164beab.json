The mother objected on religious grounds. She claimed that it would be better for her son to die if that was his fate. The pediatrician sought an order from the state court. The mother was present with her lawyer at the court. In deciding whether it may issue such an order in face of all relevant constitutional defenses by the mother, which of the following must the state court consider?\n\nA. Whether medical treatment is necessary to save the baby's life.\nB. Whether the mother's refusal to authorize medical treatment is justified on the basis of current knowledge.\nC. Whether the hospital is owned and operated by the state.\nD. Whether the mother is a taxpayer of the state in which the court is located.\n"

Whether medical treatment is necessary to save the baby's life.\n\nThis is because the primary concern in such cases is the child's health and survival. The court must determine if the medical treatment is essential to prevent the child's death. If the treatment is deemed necessary, the court may issue an order compelling the mother to authorize it.\n\nThe other options are not directly relevant to the court's decision:\n\nB. Whether the mother's refusal to authorize medical treatment is justified on the basis of current knowledge.\n- This is a secondary consideration, as the court must first ensure that the treatment is necessary. If the treatment is deemed necessary, the court may then consider whether the mother's refusal is justified.\n\nC. Whether the hospital is owned and operated by the state.\n- This is not relevant to the court's decision, as the focus is on the child's health and the necessity of the treatment.\n\nD. Whether the mother is a taxpayer of the state in which the court is located.\n- This is also not relevant to the court's decision, as the focus is on the child's health and the necessity of the treatment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Whether medical treatment is necessary to save the baby's life."
