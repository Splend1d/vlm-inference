The condition for the intersection of a parabola and a line to be at only one point is that the quadratic equation formed by setting the two equations equal to each other has exactly one solution. This means the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be equal to zero.\n\nSetting $y_1 = y_2$, we get:\n\n\\[x^2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b\\]\n\nRearranging the equation to bring all terms to one side gives:\n\n\\[x^2 + 2x - 6x + 7 - b = 0\\]\n\n\\[x^2 - 4x + (7 - b = 0\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = 7 - b$. The discriminant $\\Delta$ of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. For the equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero:\n\n\\[\\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(7 - b) = 0\\]\n\n\\[16 - 28 + 4b = 0\\]\n\n\\[4b = 12\\]\n\n\\[g = 3\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ for which the parabola and the line intersect at only one point is $3$.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 3."
