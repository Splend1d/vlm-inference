The resultant amplitude, \\( D \\), is the sum of the amplitudes of the two waves, taking into account the phase difference between them. However, since the waves are of equal frequency and superimpose, the phase difference does not affect the amplitude of the resultant wave.\n\nGiven:\n- Amplitude of the first wave = 4 cm\n- Amplitude of the second wave = 6 cm\n\nThe resultant amplitude, \\( D \\), is the sum of these amplitudes:\n\\[ D = 4 \\, \\text{cm} + 6 \\, \\text{cm} = 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( D = 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\)"
