The more electroneegative the central atom, the stronger the acid. Additionally, the more electroneegative atoms bonded to the central atom, the stronger the acid.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. H2SeO3 < H2SO3 < HClO < HBrO\n- H2SeO3: Selenium ( (Se) is less electroneegative than sulfur ( (S), chlorine (Cl), and bromine (Br).\n- H2SO3: Sulfur (S) is less electronegative than chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br).\n- HClO: Chlorine (Cl) is less electroneegative than bromine (Br).\n- HBrO: Bromine (Br) is the least electroneegative.\n\nThis order is incorrect because it places H2SeO3 as the strongest acid, which is not the case.\n\nB. HClO < H2SeO3 < HBrO < H2SO3\n- HClO: Chlorine (Cl) is less electroneegative than bromine (Br) and sulfur (S).\n- H2SeO3: Selenium (Se) is less electroneegative than sulfur (S) and chlorine (Cl).\n- HBrO: Bromine (Br) is less electroneegative than chlorine (Cl).\n- H2SO3: Sulfur (S) is less electroneegative than chlorine (Cl).\n\nThis order is incorrect because it places H2SeO3 as the strongest acid, which is not the case.\n\nC. HBrO < HClO < H2SeO3 < H2SO3\n- HBrO: Bromine (Br) is less electroneegative than chlorine (Cl).\n- HClO: Chlorine (Cl) is less electroneegative than bromine (Br) and sulfur (S).\n- H2SeO3: Selenium (Se) is less electroneegative than sulfur (S) and chlorine (Cl).\n- H2SO3: Sulfur (S) is less electroneegative than chlorine (Cl).\n\nThis order is incorrect because it places H2SeO3 as the strongest acid, which is not the case.\n\nD. H2SO3 < H2SeO3 < HClO < HBrO\n- H2SO3: Sulfur (S) is less electronegative than chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br).\n- H2SeO3: Selenium (Se) is less electroneegative than sulfur (S) and chlorine (Cl).\n- HClO: Chlorine (Cl) is less electroneegative than bromine (Br).\n- HBrO: Bromine (Br) is the least electroneegative.\n\nThis order is correct because it places H2SO3 as the strongest acid, followed by H2SeO3, HClO, and HBrO.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of increasing acid strength is:\n\nD.
