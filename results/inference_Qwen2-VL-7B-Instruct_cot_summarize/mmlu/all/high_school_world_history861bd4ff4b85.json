It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n\u2014Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nWhich of the following reformers expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above?\n\nA. Ulrich Zwingli\nB. Sir Thomas More\nC. Erasmus\nD. John Wycliffe\n"

Ulrich Zwingli:**\n     - Zwingli was a Swiss reformer who also criticized the Roman Catholic Church and its practices.\n     - He also argued against the Pope's authority over spiritual matters and the temporal power.\n     - Zwingli also criticized the wealth and power of the clergy, similar to Luther.\n\n   - **B. Sir Thomas More:**\n     - More was a British humanist and statesman who was a critic of the Catholic Church.\n     - He was known for his critique of the Church's wealth and corruption.\n     - However, More was not as explicitly critical of the Pope's authority as Luther was.\n\n   - **C. Erasmus:**\n     - Erasmus was a Dutch humanist who was a critic of the Church's corruption and the abuse of power.\n     - He was known for his moderate critique and his was not as explicitly critical of the Pope's authority as Luther was.\n\n   - **D. John Wycliffe:**\n     - Wycliffe was an English theologian who was a critic of the Church's corruption and the abuse of power.\n     - He was known for his moderate critique and his was not as explicitly critical of the Pope's authority as Luther was.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Ulrich Zwingli's views were similar to Martin Luther's views in terms of criticizing the Roman Catholic Church's practices, the Pope's authority, and the wealth and power of the clergy.\n\nTherefore, the reformer who expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above is **A. Ulrich Zwingli**."
