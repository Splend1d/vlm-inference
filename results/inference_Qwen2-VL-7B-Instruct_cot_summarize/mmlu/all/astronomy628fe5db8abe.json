The distance between the Earth and the Sun is approximately 150 million kilometers (or 1.5 x 10^11 meters.\n2. The distance between the Earth and Altair is one million times greater than the distance between the Earth and the Sun.\n\nLet's calculate the distance between the Earth and Altair:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance between Earth and Altair} = 1,000,000 \\times \\text{Distance between Earth and Sun} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance between Earth and Altair} = 1,000,000 \\times 1.5 \\times 10^{11} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance between Earth and Altair} = 1.5 \\times 10^{14} \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance between the Earth and Altair is 1.5 x 10^14 meters.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 1.5 x 10^14 meters"
