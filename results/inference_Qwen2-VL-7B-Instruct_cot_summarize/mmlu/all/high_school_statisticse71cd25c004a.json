The exam is normed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 9. Only those who score in the top 15% on the test are invited back for further evaluation. Estrella received a 90 on the test. What was her percentile rank on the test, and did she qualify for further evaluation?\n\nA. 13.35; she didn't qualify.\nB. 54.38; she didn't qualify.\nC. 86.65; she qualified.\nD. 84.38; she didn't qualify.\n"

We can use a z-table or a calculator to find this. A z-score of 1.11 corresponds to a percentile rank of approximately 86.65%.\n\nSince only those in the top 15% are invited for further evaluation, and Estrella's percentile rank is 86.65%, she qualifies for further evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. 86.65; she qualified."
