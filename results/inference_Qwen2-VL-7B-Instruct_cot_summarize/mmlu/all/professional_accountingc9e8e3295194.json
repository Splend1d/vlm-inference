This is because the reporting status can significantly impact the auditor's independence and objectivity. An internal auditor who reports directly to the board of directors or audit committee is likely to have more independence and objectivity compared to one who reports to the owner-manager, who might have a vested interest in the audit results.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The reporting status of the internal auditor within the organization."
