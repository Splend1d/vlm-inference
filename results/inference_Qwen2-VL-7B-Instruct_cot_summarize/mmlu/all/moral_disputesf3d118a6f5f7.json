The duty to keep promises: This is a well-known prima facie duty in Ross's ethical theory, which emphasizes the importance of keeping promises as a fundamental moral obligation.\n\nB. The duty not to harm others: This is also a prima facie duty discussed by Ross. It is one of the core duties that he emphasizes, as it is a fundamental moral obligation to refrain from causing harm to others.\n\nC. The duty to protect our natural environment: While this is an important ethical consideration, it is not explicitly mentioned as a prima facie duty by Ross. Ross's theory primarily focuses on interpersonal duties rather than environmental protection.\n\nD. The duty of nonmaleficence: This is a prima facie duty discussed by Ross. It refers to the duty not to do harm, which is a central aspect of Ross's ethical theory.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that is not a prima facie duty discussed by Ross is:\n\nC. The duty to protect our natural environment"
