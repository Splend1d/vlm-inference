                    "text": "To determine the pKa of the weak acid, we can use the relationship between pH, pKa, and the dissociation constant (Ka of the acid. The dissociation constant Ka can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ Ka = [H^+][A^-] \\]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+), and [A^-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (A^-).\n\nThe pH is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by the equation:\n\n\\[ pH = -\\log[H^+] \\]\n\nGiven that the pH is 4.26, we can calculate [H+] as:\n\n\\[ [H^+] = 10^{-pH} = 10^{-4.26} \\]\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between pH, pKa, and Ka to find pKa:\n\n\\[ pH = pKa + \\log\\left(\\frac{{A^-}{[HA]}\\right) \\]\n\nSince the acid is monoprotic, the concentration of the conjugate base [A^-] is equal to the concentration of the acid [HA] at equilibrium. Therefore, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 1, and the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ pH = pKa \\]\n\nSo, the pKa of the weak acid is equal to the pH, which is 4.26.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 4.26"
