Excluding a relevant variable from a linear regression model.\n\nMis-specification of functional form refers to using a model that does not accurately capture the true relationship between the variables. This can happen when the functional form of the model is incorrect, such as using a linear model when the true relationship is non-linear, or when a relevant variable is omitted from the model.\n\nIn option D, excluding a relevant variable from a linear regression model does not necessarily mean that the functional form of the model is incorrect. It could simply mean that the model is missing an important variable that should be included. This is not an example of mis-specification of functional form."
