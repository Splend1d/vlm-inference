This is because the total momentum is conserved.\n2. **Time of Collision**: The time of collision is the same for both carts since they collide simultaneously.\n3. **Change in Kinetic Energy**: The kinetic energy of each cart changes due to the collision. The change in kinetic energy is equal and opposite for both carts because the total kinetic energy is conserved.\n\n### Collision B: A ball sticks to a rigid rod, which begins to rotate about the combined center of mass\n\n1. **Torque**: The torque exerteded by the ball on the rod is equal and opposite to the torque exerteded by the rod on the ball. This is because the net torque is zero ( (the ball and the rod are rigid and the center of mass is stationary).\n2. **Time of Collision**: The time of collision is the same for both the ball and the rod since they collide simultaneously.\n3. **Change in Angular Momentum**: The angular momentum of the system (ball + rod) changes due to the collision. The change in angular momentum is equal and opposite for the ball and the rod because the total angular momentum is conserved.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct statement is:\n\n**C. Collision A: each cart experiences the same force, time of collision, and change in kinetic energy. Collision B: the ball and the rod each experience the same torque, time of collision, and change in angular momentum.**\n\nThis statement accurately reflects the physics of of both collisions."
