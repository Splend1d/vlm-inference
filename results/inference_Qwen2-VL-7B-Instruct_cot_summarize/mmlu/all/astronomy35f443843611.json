Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, has a dense atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen with significant amounts of methane and other hydrocarbons. Its atmosphere is thick enough to support a variety of surface features and processes.\n\nB. Titan is the only outer solar system moon with evidence for recent geologic activity\n- This statement is also true. Titan exhibits a variety of geologic features, including dunes, lakes, and mountains, which are indicative of recent geological activity. This activity is driven by the moon's internal heat and the presence of liquid hydrocarbons on its surface.\n\nC. Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons\n- This statement is true. Titan's atmosphere is indeed composed mostly of hydrocarbons, with nitrogen being the dominant component. Methane and other hydrocarbons are also present in significant quantities.\n\nD. A and D\n- This statement is true. Both A and C are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A and D."
