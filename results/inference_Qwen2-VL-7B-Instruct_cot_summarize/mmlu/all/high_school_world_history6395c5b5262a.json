Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now.

                    "text": "To determine the correct political outcome described by the publication of the first passage, we need to analyze the content and context of the passage by Olympe de Gouge and compare it with the provided options.\n\nThe passage by Olympe de Gouge, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" was written in 1791 during the French Revolution. It calls for women's rights and challenges the status quo of women's rights at that time. The passage emphasizes the need for women to discover their rights and to oppose the unjust treatment of women by men.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. French women, like Jews, Protestants, and freed blacks, attained political equality after only a short delay.\n- This option suggests that French women gained political equality soon after the publication of the passage. However, the passage itself does not provide any information about the political equality of women, Jews, Protestants, or freed blacks. It focuses specifically on women's rights.\n\nB. French women quickly gained the right to vote, but not to hold political office.\n- This option suggests that French women gained the right to vote but not to hold political office. However, the passage does not provide any information about the right to vote or political office. It focuses on the rights of women.\n\nC. French women found their status even lower than it had been before the French Revolution.\n- This option suggests that French women's status worsened after the French Revolution. However, the passage does not provide any information about the status of women before the French Revolution. It focuses on the rights of women.\n\nD. French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century.\n- This option suggest that French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century. This passage does not provide any information about the political rights of women after the French Revolution. it focuses on the rights of women.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the options directly describe the political outcomes described by the passage. However, the passage does suggest that women's rights were not fully achieved at the time of its publication. Therefore, the most fitting option is:\n\nD. French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century.\n\nFinal answer: D. French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century."
