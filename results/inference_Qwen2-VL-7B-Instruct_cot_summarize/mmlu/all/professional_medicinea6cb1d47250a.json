If the alpha is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, which of the following is the most likely result?\n\nA. Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence\nB.

There is an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings.\n\nWhen the alpha level is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, the threshold for statistical significance becomes more stringent. This means that the study will require a larger effect size to achieve statistical significance. As a result, the likelihood of obtaining statistically significant findings increases because the study is more sensitive to detecting true differences between the groups. This is because a lower alpha level reduces the chance of a Type I error ( (false positive), but it also increases the chance of a Type II error ( (false negative), which is not the case here."
