Harm arguments typically argue that certain behaviors or practices are morally wrong because they cause harm to individuals or society.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. If a practice is riskier than the alternatives, then that practice is moral, prudent, or otherwise to be pursued.\n- This option suggests that a riskier practice is morally acceptable or prudent. This is not a problematic assumption because it is not necessarily true that riskier practices are morally acceptable or prudent.\n\nB. If a practice is risker than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided.\n- This option suggests that a riskier practice is immoral, imprudent, or to be avoided. This is a problematic assumption because it is not necessarily true that riskier practices are immoral, imprudent, or to be avoided.\n\nC. If a practice is safer than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided.\n- This option suggest that a safer practice is immoral, imprudent, or to be avoided. This is not a problematic assumption because it is not necessarily true that safer practices are immoral, imprudent, or to be avoided.\n\nD. none of the above\n- This option suggests that none of the above is a problematic assumption. However, option B is clearly problematic.\n\nGiven the analysis, the problematic \"hidden assumption\" of harm arguments against homosexuality is best represented by option B.\n\nFinal answer: B. If a practice is risker than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided."
