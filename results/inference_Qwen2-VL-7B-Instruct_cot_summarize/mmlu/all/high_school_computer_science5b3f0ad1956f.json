Since each value can be represented by a binary number, we need to find the number of bits required to represent 256 different values.\n\nThe number of bits required to represent 256 different values is given by the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^n \\geq 256 \\).\n\nWe can calculate this as follows:\n\n1. \\( 2^8 = 256 \\)\n2. \\( 2^9 = 512 \\)\n\nSince \\( 2^8 \\) is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 256, we need 8 bits to represent each of the red, green, and blue components.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bits needed to represent a color in the RGB model is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 24"
