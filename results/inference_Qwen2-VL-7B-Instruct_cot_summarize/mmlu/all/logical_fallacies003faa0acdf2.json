Every term must be used twice--no more and no less.\n- This is not a test of the validity of a conditional syllogism. It is a rule for categorical syllogisms, which deal with categorical propositions (All A are B, No A are B, etc.\n\nB. If one premise is negative, the conclusion must be negative.\n- This is not a test of the validity of a conditional syllogism. It pertains to the validity of categorical syllogisms, not conditional syllogisms.\n\nC.

It pertains to the structure of categorical syllogisms, not conditional syllogisms.\n\nNone of the given options directly test the validity of a conditional syllogism.
