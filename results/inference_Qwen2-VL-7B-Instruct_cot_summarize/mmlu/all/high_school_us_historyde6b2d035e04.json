This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us. And we will not fail.\n\u2014Jimmy Carter, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1980\nWhich of the following has some of its roots in the conditions discussed by Jimmy Carter in this passage?\n\nA. The War on Terror\nB. High unemployment\nC. Tensions with China\nD. High budget deficits\n"

It does not have its roots in the conditions discussed by Jimmy Carter in 1980.\n\nB. **High unemployment:** While high unemployment can be a result of economic changes and political instability, it is not directly mentioned or implied in Carter's passage. It is not a direct consequence of the conditions he described.\n\nC. **Tensions with China:** The passage does not mention any specific tensions with China. It focuses on the Soviet Union and the Middle East, not China.\n\nD. **High budget deficits:** The passage does not discuss budget deficits. It is more focused on military power, oil dependence, and political and social changes in developing nations.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the options directly align with the conditions discussed by Jimmy Carter in his 1980 State of the Union Address. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**None of the above**"
