Ross uses the analogy of emotions to illustrate this concept. Just as emotions can sometimes lead us to act in ways that are not in line with our moral principles, prima facie duties can sometimes lead us to act in ways that are not in line with our stronger moral principles. However, just as we can override our emotions with reason, we can also override prima facie duties with stronger moral principles."
