The nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the grant:\n\n1. **To my nephew and my niece for the life of of my nephew:** This means the nephew has a life estate, which means he has the right to use and enjoy the property for his lifetime. When the nephew dies, the property passes to the niece.\n\n2. **Then to my gardener:** This indicates that after the death of the nephew, the property passes to the gardener. This is a vested remainder, meaning the gardener has a definite right to the property that will vest (or take effect) at the death of the nephew.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Option A incorrectly states that the nephew and niece are joint tenants in fee simple defeasible, which is not the case. Joint tenancy in fee simple defeasible would imply that the property would pass to the survivor upon the death of one tenant, which is not described here.\n- Option B incorrectly states that the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, which is not the case. The niece does not have a life estate pur autre vie; she has a life estate that starts after the nephew's death.\n- Option C incorrectly states that the nephew and niece are tenants in common for the life of the first of them to die, which is not the case. The nephew and niece do not have a tenancy in common; they have a life estate that starts at the same time.\n- Option C also incorrectly states that the gardener has an executory interest, which is not the case. The gardener has a vested remainder, not an executory interest."
