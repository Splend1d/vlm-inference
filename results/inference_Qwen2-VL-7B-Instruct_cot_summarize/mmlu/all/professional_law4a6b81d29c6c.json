Her job responsibilities included preparing new course outlines, proofreading and grading student homework assignments. The bar review course agreed to pay the graduate a starting salary of $2,500 a month. Three months later, the graduate was approached by the regional director of the bar review course, who handed her a newly published 60-page booklet entitled \"Employment Manual. \" He instructed the graduate to read the manual and indicated that it contained important information concerning company policy considerations and employee benefits. When the graduate returned home that evening, she started to read the manual. After reading about 30 pages, the graduate became tired and went to sleep. She never got around to reading the rest of the manual. Six months later, the graduate received a termination notice from the bar review course. The notice indicated that the graduate was being fired for insubordination because she had complained about the poor quality of the bar review course's materials and refused to work overtime grading papers. Following her dismissal, the graduate brought suit against the bar review course for breach of contract. Which of the following, if true and provable, would furnish the bar review course with its best defense?\n\nA. All other bar review course employees worked overtime whenever requested to do so.\nB. When the graduate accepted employment with the bar review course, the company never made any promises regarding job security or duration of employment.\nC. The materials in the bar review course had recently been reviewed by the American Bar Association's Committee on Legal Education and had received \"high acclaim. \"\nD. The second page of the bar review course manual contained a paragraph stating that all policies, guidelines and employee benefits are \"purely gratuitous and not intended to create any ongoing contractual obligation. \"\n"

The second page of the bar review course manual contained a paragraph stating that all policies, guidelines, and employee benefits are \"purely gratuitous and not intended to create any ongoing contractual obligation.\"\n\nThis defense is based on the principle of \"intentional disclaimer,\" which is a legal concept that allows a party to disclaim the creation of a contract or the formation of an ongoing relationship. By including a disclaimer in the employment manual, the bar review course explicitly stated that the employment relationship was not intended to create any ongoing contractual obligations or benefits. This would serve as a strong defense against the claim of breach of contract, as the court would likely find that the employment relationship was not intended to be a legally binding contract.\n\nThe other options do not provide a strong defense against the claim of breach of contract. Option A pertains to the work habits of other employees, which is irrelevant to the specific terms of the employment contract. Option B simply states that the company never made promises regarding job security or duration of employment, which is not a defense against the claim of breach of contract. Option C, while potentially relevant to the quality of the materials, does not address the core issue of the creation of a contractual obligation."
