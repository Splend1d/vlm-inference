Leading questions are those that suggest the answer the witness should give, but they are not generally restricted to adverse witnesses. The trial court should not sustain the objections to leading questions because the plaintiff is entitled to ask leading questions of their own witness. However, the court may sustain objections to impeachment questions if they are improper or irrelevant."
