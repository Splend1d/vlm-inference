We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nWhich of the following regulatory laws was passed as a result of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which regulatory law was passed as a result of Upton Sinclair's book \"The Jungle,\" we need to identify the key themes and issues raised in the book and then match them with the regulatory laws that were enacted in response to those issues.\n\n1. **Context of \"The Jungle\"**:\n   - Upton Sinclair's book \"The Jungle\" was published in 1906 and exposed the harsh and unsanitary conditions in the meatpacking industry in the United States.\n   - The book was a powerful critique of the industrialization and the lack of regulation in the food industry, leading to public outrage and demands for reform.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Regulatory Laws**:\n   - **A. The Clayton Antitrust Act**: Passed in 1914, this act was aimed at breaking up monopolies and preventing anti-competitive practices. While it was a significant piece of legislation, it was not directly a response to the issues raised in \"The Jungle.\"\n   - **B. The Hepburn Act**: Passed in 1905, this act regulated the interstate transportation of goods by railroads. It was not related to the issues raised in \"The Jungle.\"\n   - **C. The Sherman Antitrust Act**: Passed in 1890, this act was the first federal antitrust law in the United States. It was aimed at preventing monopolies and promoting competition. It was not specifically a response to \"The Jungle.\"\n   - **D. The Pure Food and Drug Act**: Passed in 1906, this act was a direct response to the public outrage over the unsanitary conditions and fraudulent practices in the food industry, as highlighted in \"The Jungle.\"\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Pure Food and Drug Act was passed in 1906, directly in response to the issues raised in Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The Pure Food and Drug Act**"
