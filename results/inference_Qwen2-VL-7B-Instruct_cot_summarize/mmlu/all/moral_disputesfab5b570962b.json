However, the objection to Wellman's response is not about utilitarian principles but rather about the potential harm of excluding people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state.\n\n2. **Option B: Wellman himself is an immigrant.**\n   - This option introduces personal information about Wellman but does not directly address the core of the objection to his response. The objection is about the sufficiency of Wellman's response, not about his personal background.\n\n3. **Option C: Excluding people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state is still potentially harmful.**\n   - This option directly addresses the core of the objection. The objection is that Wellman's response is insufficient because it still allows for potentially harmful exclusion of people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state.\n\n4. **Option D: The concept of \"export justice\" is internally contradictory.**\n   - This option suggests that the concept of \"export justice\" is logically flawed. However, the objection is not about the internal consistency of the concept but about its sufficiency in addressing the harm caused by exclusion.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. excluding people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state is still potentially harmful.**"
