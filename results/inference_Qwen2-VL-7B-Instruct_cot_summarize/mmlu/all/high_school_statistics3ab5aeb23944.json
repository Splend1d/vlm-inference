The area to the left of z = -2.4 is approximately 0.0082, which means the probability of a resistor having a resistance less than 188 ohms is about 0.0082.\n\nTo find the probability of a resistor having a resistance greater than 188 ohms, we subtract this value from 1:\n\n\\[ P(X > 188) = 1 - P(X < 188) = 1 - 0.0082 = 0.9918 \\]\n\nThis value is not listed among the options provided ( A. 0.07, B. 0.12, C. 0.50, D. 0.93. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. However, based on the calculation, the closest option to the calculated probability is:\n\nD. 0.93"
