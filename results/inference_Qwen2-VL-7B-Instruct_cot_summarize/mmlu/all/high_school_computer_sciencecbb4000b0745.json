The bank is considering two options: a single line where the customer at the front waits for the next available teller, or separate lines for each teller. The bank decides to use a computer simulation of these two options to determine the average wait time for customers. Which of the following is NOT true about the bank's plan?\n\nA. The bank can incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, in the simulation.\nB. The bank can use the simulation to investigate these two options without causing inconvenience for customers.\nC. The bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results.\nD.

The bank can indeed use a computer simulation to model different scenarios and incorporate various factors such as the number of tellers. The simulation can be designed to avoid causing inconvenience for customers by simulating different conditions without the need for actual customer data. Based on the simulation results, the bank can consider new alternatives and make informed decisions about which option to implement."
