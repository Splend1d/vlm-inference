We know that $A_0 + B_0 = 30$.\n\nOn Day 5, the number of ants of Species A is $A_5 = A_0 \\cdot 2^5 = 32A_0$ and the number of ants of Species B is $B_5 = B_0 \\cdot 3^5 = 243B_0$. We know that $A_5 + B_5 = 3281$, so we have the equation $32A_0 + 243B_0 = 3281$.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations. First, we can express $B_0$ in terms of $A_0$ from the first equation: $B_0 = 30 - A_0$.\n\nSubstituting $B_0$ into the second equation: $32A_0 + 243(30 - A_0) = 3281$.\n\nSimplify the equation: $32A_0 + 7290 - 243A_0 = 3281$.\n\nCombine like terms: $-211A_0 = -4009$.\n\nDivide both sides by $-211$: $A_0 = \\frac{-4009}{-211} = 19$.\n\nSo, the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is $A_5 = 32A_0 = 32 \\cdot 19 = 608$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{608}$."
