                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, low hepcidin.\n\nIn the context of iron deficiency, low ferritin levels indicate a lack of stored iron. High serum transferrin receptors suggest that the body is actively trying to absorb iron, which is consistent with iron deficiency. Low hepcidin levels are also associated with iron deficiency, as hepcidin is a protein that regulates iron absorption and storage. \n\nHowever, in the presence of a severe infection, ferritin levels can be elevated due to the body's response to the infection, which can mask the true iron deficiency. Therefore, the combination of low ferritin and high serum transferrin receptors is indicative of iron deficiency in the presence of infection."
