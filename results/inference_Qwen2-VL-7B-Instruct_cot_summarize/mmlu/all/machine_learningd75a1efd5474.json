It is used to convert the output of of a linear model into a probability distribution over predicted output classes. This is particularly useful in classification problems where the goal is to predict one of several possible classes. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 2: The temperature of a nonuniform softmax distribution affects its entropy.**\n\nThe temperature parameter in the softmax function is often referred to as the \"temperature\" or \"inverse temperature.\" It controls the \"sharpness\" of the distribution. A higher temperature results in a more uniform distribution, while a lower temperature results in a more peaked distribution. Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness in a probability distribution. Therefore, the temperature of a softmax distribution does indeed affect its entropy. As the temperature increases, the entropy of the distribution decreases, and vice versa. This statement is also true.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. True, True**"
