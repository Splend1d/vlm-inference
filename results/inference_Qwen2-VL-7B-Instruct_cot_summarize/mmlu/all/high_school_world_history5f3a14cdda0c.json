The Industrial Revolution\n\nThe passage describes conditions of child labor and the struggle for survival, which are indicative of the harsh realities faced by workers families during the Industrial Revolution. The reference to \"factories\" and the need for children to work due to \"necessity\" align with the historical context of the Industrial Revolution, where child labor was common and wages were often insufficient to meet basic needs."
