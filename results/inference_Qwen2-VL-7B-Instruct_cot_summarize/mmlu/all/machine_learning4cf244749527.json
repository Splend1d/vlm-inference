Shattering means that for any possible labeling of these points ( (e.g., positive or negative), there exists a geometric object in the set that can separate the points according to this labeling.\n\nRectangles in the 2D plane can shatter a set of 5 points because rectangles can be positioned and oriented in such a way that they can separate any 5 points into any desired configuration. For example, consider 5 points arranged in a way that they cannot be separated by a single axis-aligned rectangle. However, by allowing non-axis-aligned rectangles, we can always find a rectangle that can separate these points according to any labeling.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\n### Statement 2: The VC-dimension of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 is infinite.\n\nThe VC-dimension of a classifier is related to its complexity and generalization ability. The k-Nearest Neighbour ( (k-NN) classifier is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. When k = 1, the classifier simply classifies a point based on the label of the nearest neighbor in the training set.\n\nThe VC-dimension of a classifier is the maximum number of points that can be shattered by the classifier. For the k-NN classifier with k = 1, it can shatter any finite set of points because for any finite set of points, there exists a configuration where the nearest neighbor for each point is different. However, the VC-dimension is not infinite because there is a limit to the number of points that can be shattered by a finite set of points.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is False.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is:\nC. True, False"
