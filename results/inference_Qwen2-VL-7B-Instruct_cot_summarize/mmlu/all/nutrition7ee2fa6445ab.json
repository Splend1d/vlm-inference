Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nThis statement is correct because replacing saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids can help reduce triglyceride levels in the blood. However, it's important to note that the effects of dietary fat on blood lipids can be complex and depend on various factors, including the type and amount of fat consumed, as well as other dietary components and lifestyle factors."
