He admitted to killing her, but asserted that he lacked the intent to murder, due to his suffering from a personality disorder complicated by two days of drinking alcohol heavily. The trial judge instructed the jury that \"the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.\" The judge did not tell them that they had a choice or could infer another conclusion; they were told only that the law presumed it. The accused was convicted of depraved heart murder and sentenced to 100 years in prison. On appeal, the appellant argued that the court took the fact-finding task of determining criminal intent out of the jury's hands by in effect ordering them to find intent. The jury could have felt that they were being told that they had no other choice. The state supreme court affirmed the conviction, but the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. Will the Court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder.\nB. Yes, because the wording in effect caused the defendant to be a witness against himself by having him intend everything that he did.\nC. No, because the defendant could raise an argument to rebut the permissible inference created by the jury instruction.\nD. No, because the instruction was only a presumption that the jury did not have to consider in its deliberations.\n"

                    "text": "The United States Supreme Court is likely to reverse the conviction. \n\nThe key issue here is the clarity and potential misunderstanding of the jury instruction. The instruction given by the trial judge, \"the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts,\" could be interpreted by the jury as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder. This is because the instruction does not explicitly state that the jury has a choice or can infer another conclusion. Instead, it presents the presumption as an absolute rule, which could lead the jury to believe that they have no other choice but to find intent.\n\nGiven this interpretation, the instruction could have been viewed by the jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder, which is a critical element of the depraved heart murder charge. This interpretation alignings with the argument made by the defendant on appeal, and it is likely to be supported by the Supreme Court.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is:\n\nA. Yes, because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder."
