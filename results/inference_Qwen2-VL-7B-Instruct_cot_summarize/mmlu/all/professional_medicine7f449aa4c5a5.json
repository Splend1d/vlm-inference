Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration\nB. Triple screening for MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations\nC. Ultrasonography\nD.

Ultrasound can help determine the gestational age, check for the number of fetuses, and look for any structural abnormalities. If there are any concerns, further testing such as triple screening or amniocentesis may be recommended."
