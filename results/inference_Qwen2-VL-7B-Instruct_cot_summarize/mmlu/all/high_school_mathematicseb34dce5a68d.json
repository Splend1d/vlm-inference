So, we want to roll three prime numbers and three composite numbers.\nThe probability of rolling a prime number on a 6-sided die is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of rolling a composite number is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 6 to show prime numbers is $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$.\nThe probability of any specific combination of three prime numbers and three composite numbers is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{1}{64}$.\nSo, the probability of rolling three prime numbers and three composite numbers is $20 \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{20}{64} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{B}}$."
