MERRF results from a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production. When an affected male and a normal female reproduce, which of the following best predicts the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring?\n\nA. None of the offspring will be affected\nB. All males and no females will be affected\nC. Half of males and half of females will be affected\nD. One-fourth of the offspring will be affected\n"

This means that the mutation is passed from the mother to her offspring, but not from the father to his offspring. Therefore, if an affected male and a normal female reproduce, all of the offspring will be affected because they will inherit the mutation from their mother.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. All males and no females will be affected"
