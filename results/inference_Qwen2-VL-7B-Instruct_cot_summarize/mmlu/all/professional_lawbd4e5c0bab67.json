Because of this increased work load, the Court has complained that it is unable to properly review all of its cases. As a consequence, Congress formed a committee to conduct a study on improving the functioning and operation of the Court. Based on the committee's recommendations, Congress enacted a statute dividing the Court into two panels. One panel would be assigned to handle criminal cases exclusively, while the other panel would handle all non-criminal matters. Each panel would be composed of four associate justices and a chief justice. According to the new law, the decisions of each panel would be final and not reviewable by any other court or judiciary. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute?\n\nA. The statute contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.\nB. The statute does not fall within the enumerated powers of Congress and is not necessary and proper for the effectuation of those powers.\nC. Based on the doctrine ofjudicial supremacy, Congress does not have authority to legislate with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\nD. Based on the separate sovereignty doctrine, Congress does not have authority to interfere with the procedural machinery of the Supreme Court.\n"

The statute contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.\n\nThis argument is the strongest because the U.S. Constitution explicitly states that there shall be one Supreme Court. By dividing the Supreme Court into two panels, the statute directly contradicts this constitutional provision. The Constitution establishes the Supreme Court as the highest court in the land, and any legislation that alters its structure or function without constitutional authority would be unconstitutional."
