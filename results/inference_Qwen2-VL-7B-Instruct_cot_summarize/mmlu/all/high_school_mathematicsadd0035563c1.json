However, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ directly from the original system. Let's multiply the first equation by 892 and the second equation by 889 to align the coefficients of $y$:\n\n1. $892(888x + 889y) = 892(890)$\n2. $889(891x + 892y) = 889(893)$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n1. $789136x + 789138y = 7891360$\n2. $789139x + 789136y = 7891357$\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $x$:\n\n$(789136x + 789138y) - ( (789139x + 789136y) = 7891360 - 7891357$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$-3x + 2y = 3$\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. $x + y = 1$\n2. $-3x + 2y = 3$\n\nLet's solve this system. Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of $y$:\n\n1. $2x + 2y = 2$\n\nNow, add this to the second equation:\n\n$(-3x + 2y) + ( (2x + 2y) = 3 + 2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$-x + 4y = 5$\n\nNow, let's solve for $y$:\n\n$4y = 5 + x$\n\n$y = \\frac{5 + x}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute $y$ back into the equation $x + y = 1$:\n\n$x + \\frac{5 + x}{4} = 1$\n\nMultiply everything by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n$4x + 5 + x = 4$\n\nSubtract $5$ from both sides:\n\n$4x + y = -1$\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. $x + y = 1$\n2. $4x + y = -1$\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n$(4x + y) - ( (x + y) = -1 - 1$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$3x = -2$\n\n$x = -\\frac{2}{3}$\n\nNow, substitute $x$ back into the equation $x + y = 1$:\n\n$-\\frac{2}{3} + y = 1$\n\n$y = 1 + \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n$y = \\frac{3}{3} + \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n$y = \\frac{5}{3}$\n\nNow, we can find $x - y$:\n\n$x - y = -\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{5}{3}$\n\n$x - y = -\\frac{7}{3}$\n\nThe value of $x - y$ is not listed among the options provided (A. 1, B. -3, C. -1, D. 3). It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct value of $x - y$ is $-\\frac{7}{3}$, which is not listed among the given options."
