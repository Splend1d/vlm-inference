                    "text": "The elastic clause, also known as the \"necessary and proper clause,\" allows Congress to make all laws that are \"necessary and proper\" for carrying out its enumerated powers. This clause is found in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nLet's analyze each option to determine which best illustrates the use of the elastic clause:\n\nA. The Supreme Court allows a lower court ruling to stand by refusing to hear an appeal.\n- This scenario involves the Supreme Court's role in the judicial system, not Congress's legislative powers. Therefore, it does not illustrate the use of the elastic clause.\n\nB. A congressional committee prevents the full chamber from voting on legislation by delaying its report.\n- This scenario involves a procedural delay within Congress, which is a part of the legislative process but does not necessarily involve the use of the elastic clause to expand legislative powers.\n\nC. Congress passes legislation establishing a national speed limit.\n- This scenario involves Congress exercising its enumerated power to regulate interstate commerce. The elastic clause is not directly applicable here because the legislation is within the scope of Congress's enumerated powers.\n\nD. A member of the House of Representatives introduces a bill to increase federal income tax rates.\n- This scenario involves a member of Congress introducing a bill, which is a part of the legislative process. However, it does not necessarily involve the use of the elastic clause to expand legislative powers.\n\nNone of the options directly illustrate the use of the elastic clause. The elastic clause is typically used when Congress needs to expand its powers beyond the enumerated powers to achieve a broader legislative goal. However, none of the options provided clearly demonstrate this expansion of powers.\n\nGiven the options, none of them best illustrate the use of the elastic clause."
