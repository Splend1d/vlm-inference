Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I.

He mentions the necessity of placing agriculture on a new technical basis and bringing it up to the level of socialist industry.\n\n2. **Analyze the policies of Joseph Stalin:**\n   - **Collectivization:** This policy involved the consolidation of small peasant farms into large collective farms, which was a significant part of Stalin's efforts to industrialize the country by integrating agriculture into the socialist economy.\n   - **Persecution of the better-off peasants:** This refers to the systematic persecution and repression of wealthy peasants, which was part of the collectivization process to eliminate opposition to the industrialization drive.\n   - **The Berlin Blockade:** This was a political and economic blockade imposed by the Soviet Union on West Berlin from June 24, 1948, to May 12, 1949, during the Cold War. It was not directly related to Lenin's concerns about industrialization and agriculture.\n   - **The five-year plans:** These were a series of economic plans implemented by Stalin to rapidly industrialize the Soviet Union, focusing on heavy industry and agriculture.\n\n3. **Match the policies with the problem:**\n   - Collectivization and persecution of the better-off peasants were directly related to Lenin's concern about placing agriculture on a new technical basis and bringing it up to the level of socialist industry.\n   - The Berlin Blockade was not related to Lenin's concerns about industrialization and agriculture.\n\nTherefore, the policy of Joseph Stalin that was NOT used to correct the problem cited by Lenin is:\n\n**C. The Berlin Blockade**"
