This fallacy assumes that the popularity of an idea or action is a valid reason for its correctness or desirability.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Saying someone should do something because he or she dislikes someone else.\n- This describes an appeal to emotion, not popularity.\n\nB. Saying someone should do something to be better liked by others.\n- This describes an appeal to popularity, as it suggests doing something to gain favor with others.\n\nC. Saying someone should do something because it will make him or her feel good.\n- This describes an appeal to emotion, not popularity.\n\nD. Saying someone should accept an idea because of the source of the idea.\n- This describes an appeal to authority, not popularity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. saying someone should do something to be better liked by others"
