                    "text": "To determine which statements are true regarding a deposition in a civil suit, we need to understand the legal principles governing depositions.\n\n1. **A deposition of a person against whom another person contemplates filing an action may be compelled by the party contemplating the action, without leave of court, before the action is filed.**\n   - This statement is generally true. In many jurisdictions, a party who intends to file a lawsuit can take a deposition of a potential defendant without the court's permission before the lawsuit is filed. This is known as a \"pre-action discovery\" or \"discovery before suit.\"\n\n2. **A deposition of the defendant in an action may be taken by the plaintiff without service of a subpoena on the defendant.**\n   - This statement is false. In most jurisdictions, a plaintiff cannot take a deposition of the defendant without serving a subpoena on the defendant. The plaintiff must follow the procedural rules for obtaining a deposition, which typically involve serving a subpoena on the defendant.\n\n3. **A deposition may be taken even though all the testimony secured by it will be inadmissible at the trial.**\n   - This statement is generally true. The admissibility of evidence at trial is separate from the admissibility of evidence obtained during discovery. A deposition can be taken even if the testimony is inadmissible at trial, as long as it is relevant and material to the case.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. II and III only.**"
