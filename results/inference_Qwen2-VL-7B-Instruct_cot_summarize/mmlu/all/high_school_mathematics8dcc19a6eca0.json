                    "text": " First, let's find the $x$- and $y$-intercepts of the graph of $y=f(x)$.\n\nThe $x$-intercepts are the solutions to the equation $f(x)=0$, which is equivalent to solving the equation $\\frac{(x-2)^2-9}{3}=0$. This simplifies to $(x-2)^2-9=0$, or $(x-2)^2=9$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $x-2=\\pm3$, so $x=2\\pm3$. Therefore, the $x$-intercepts are $x=-1$ and $x=5$.\n\nThe $y$-intercept is the value of $f(x)$ when $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into the equation $f(x)$, we get $f(0)=\\frac{(0-2)^2-9}{3}=\\frac{4-9}{3}=-\\frac{5}{3}$. So the $y$-intercept is $y=-\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nNow, we can plot the points $(-1,0)$, $(5,0)$, and $(0,-\\frac{5}{3})$ on the coordinate plane. These points form a triangle with base $6$ (from $-1$ to $5$ on the $x$-axis) and height $\\frac{5}{3}$ (from $0$ to $-\\frac{5}{3}$ on the $y$-axis). The area of a triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$, so the area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = 5$. Therefore, the area of the polygon formed by connecting the $x$- and $y$-intercepts is $5$. The answer is: $A$"
