Acetylcholine will not be degraded in the synaptic cleft.\n\nAcetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is released from the presynaptic membrane and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane. It is then degraded by enzymes in the synaptic cleft. If a chemical agent denatures all enzymes in the synaptic cleft, it will prevent the degradation of acetylcholine, leading to its accumulation in the synaptic cleft."
