One hundred men undergo biopsy procedures; 90 are found to have prostate cancer, and five are found to have chronic prostatitis.

Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen\nC. Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population\nD.

The total number of people with the disease is the number of men who have prostate cancer.\n\nTherefore, the necessary information to calculate the sensitivity of the test is:\n\nB. Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen\n\nThis information is not needed to calculate the sensitivity, as it is not related to the true positives.
