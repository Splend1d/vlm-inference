The uncle knew that the teen had five license suspensions, several negligence lawsuits against him, multiple DUIs, and that he was an inveterate alcoholic. The teenager got into an accident while driving the car and was seriously injured. He filed a negligent entrustment claim against the uncle, claiming he owed him a duty not to give control of the vehicle to him. The uncle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, asserting that there was no tort for first-party negligent entrustment. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, will the court likely affirm the lower court decision?\n\nA. Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\nB. Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\nC. No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n"

No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n\nThe court is likely to reverse the lower court's decision and allow the case to proceed to trial. The doctrine of first-party negligent entrustment allows a person who is injured while being driven by an incompetent operator to sue the person who loaned the vehicle, even if the injured person is the one who received the loan. This is because the entrustor has a duty to exercise reasonable care in selecting the person to whom the vehicle is loaned, and in this case, the entrustor knew that the teenager was incapable of driving a car safely."
