The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C. Abbott, historian, Napoleon at St. Helena, 1855\nWhich of the following features of the French empire under Napoleon does Abbott seem most impressed with?\n\nA. Napoleon's secret police\nB. Napoleon's domestic reforms\nC. Napoleon's suppression of women's rights\nD. Napoleon's military tactics\n"

Abbott emphasizes that Napoleon's conversations are \"replete with intensest interest\" and cover topics such as \"morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race.\" Abbott also suggests that these conversations would \"invigorate\" any mind that engages with them.\n\nGiven this information, the passage does not focus on specific administrative or military actions but rather on the intellectual and philosophical depth of Napoleon's discussions. Therefore, the most impressed feature would be related to Napoleon's intellectual and conversational abilities rather than specific actions or policies.\n\nThus, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nD. Napoleon's military tactics"
