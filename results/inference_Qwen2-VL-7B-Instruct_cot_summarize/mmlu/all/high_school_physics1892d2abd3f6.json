The magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person.\n\nWhen two objects interact with each other, the forces they exert on each other are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. This is known as Newton's's third law of motion. \n\nLet's denote the mass of the heavier person as \\( m \\) and the mass of the lighter person as \\( al \\). The force exerteded by the heavier person on the lighter person is \\( F \\). According to Newton's's third law, the force exerteded by the lighter person on the heavier person is also \\( F \\).\n\nThe acceleration of an object is given by the formula \\( a = \\frac{F}{m} \\), where \\( F \\) is the force acting on the object and \\( m \\) is the mass of the object.\n\nFor the heavier person, the acceleration \\( a_h \\) is:\n\\[ a_h = \\frac{F}{100} \\]\n\nFor the lighter person, the acceleration \\( a_l \\) is:\n\\[ a_l = \\frac{F}{50} \\]\n\nTo compare the accelerations, we can divide the acceleration of the lighter person by the acceleration of the heavier person:\n\\[ \\frac{a_l}{a_h} = \\frac{\\frac{F}{50}}{\\frac{F}{100}} = \\frac{100}{50} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person."
