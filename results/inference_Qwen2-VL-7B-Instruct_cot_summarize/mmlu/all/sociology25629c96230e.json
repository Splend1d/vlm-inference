Glass ceiling\n\nThe glass ceiling is a metaphor for an invisible barrier that prevents women from advancing to higher positions in an organization. It suggests that despite qualifications and performance, women may face persistent barriers that prevent them from achieving higher ranks. In Giselle's case, despite her high honors and rapid advancement, she has not been promoted to a higher position, which alignss with the concept of the glass ceiling."
