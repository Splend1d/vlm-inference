She immediately contacted the seller and asked about the quality of the coin. The seller assured her that the coin was in mint condition. The collector then agreed to purchase the coin for $10,000. The contract stipulated that delivery would be \"F. O. B. at the collector's establishment,\" with payment to be made one week after delivery. The seller stated that the coin would be shipped out at the end of the week. When the collector received the coin, she noticed that the coin had a large scratch across the face. Nonetheless, the collector accepted delivery. Two weeks later, the collector sold the coin to another collector for $12,000. The collector has refused to pay anything to the seller. The seller brought a breach of contract action against the collector, who, in turn, has filed a counterclaim against the seller. Who is most likely to prevail, and in what amount?\n\nA. The collector is entitled to nominal damages, because the coin was received in a damaged condition.\nB. Neither party should prevail, because the risk of loss was on the seller, but the collector did not incur any loss, since she sold the coin for a profit.\nC. The seller is entitled to $10,000, because the collector accepted delivery of the coin.\nD. The seller is entitled to $12,000, because the collector's resale constituted a conversion.\n"

                    "text": "In this scenario, the most likely outcome is that the seller is entitled to $10,000, because the collector accepted delivery of the the coin. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **F.O.B. at the Collector's Establishment**: This means that the seller is responsible for delivering the coin to the collector's establishment. The risk of loss is on the seller until the coin is delivered to the collector's establishment.\n\n2. **Collector's Acceptance**: The collector accepted delivery of the coin, which means the risk of loss transferred to the collector. The collector is now responsible for any damages or losses to the coin.\n\n3. **Scratch on the Coin**: The coin arrived with a large scratch across the face. This indicates that the coin was damaged during the shipping process, which is the seller's responsibility under the F.O.B. terms.\n\n4. **Collector's Resale**: The collector then resold the coin for $12,000. This does not affect the original contract between the seller and the collector. The resale is a separate transaction and does not impact the original agreement.\n\nGiven these points, the collector is not entitled to any damages because the risk of loss transferred to them when they accepted delivery. The seller is entitled to the original purchase price of $10,000, as they delivered the coin to the collector's establishment and the collector accepted it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The seller is entitled to $10,000, because the collector accepted delivery of of the coin."
