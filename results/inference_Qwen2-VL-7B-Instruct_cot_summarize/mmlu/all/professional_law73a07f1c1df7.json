The clause, set in fine print on the reverse side of the multi-paged, mass-printed, form lease, was a comprehensive, legalistic waiver in which the tenant gave up virtually all of her rights and remedies against the landlord. She responded that the clause was unconscionable and should not be enforced. What will the court most likely rule with respect to the exculpatory clause?\n\nA. This is not a contract for the sale of goods \u0080\u0093 unconscionability is not available with respect to an agreement not covered by the UCC.\nB. The exculpatory clause must be enforced because the tenant voluntarily signed the lease and agreed to its terms instead of choosing another place to live.\nC. The clause is unenforceable because it discriminates against women who are unable to provide their own security.\nD. The clause is unenforceable because the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive.\n"

The clause is unenforceable because the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive.\n\nIn the United States, courts generally apply the doctrine of unconscionability to determine whether an exculpatory clause in a lease agreement is enforceable. Unconscionability refers to a situation where the terms of a contract are so one-sided or oppressive that they are unfair to one of the parties. Factors that courts consider in determining unconscionability include:\n\n1. The relative bargaining power of the parties.\n2. The clarity and comprehensibility of the terms.\n3. Whether the terms are oppressive or one-sided.\n4. Whether the terms are negotiated or imposed by one party.\n\nIn this case, the tenant was a female tenant who repeatedly asked her landlord to make repairs necessary for her security, but the landlord ignored her. The tenant was later robbed and beaten by an intruder. She sued the landlord for negligence in causing her injuries. The landlord relied on an exculpatory clause in the lease. The clause, set in fine print on the reverse side of the multi-paged, mass-print, form lease, was a comprehensive, legalistic waiver in which the tenant gave up virtually all of her rights and remedies against the landlord.\n\nGiven that the tenant was a female tenant who repeatedly asked her landlord to make repairs necessary for her security, but the landlord ignored her, and the tenant was later robbed and beaten by an intruder, the court is likely to find that the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive. Therefore, the court will most likely rule that the clause is unenforceable."
