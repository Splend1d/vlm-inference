On the first day of trial, the air-conditioning malfunctioned in the courtroom, so the judge directed that the selection of the jurors take place in his chambers. Because of the large number of potential jurors, the judge directed that only one lawyer for the prosecution and one for the defense participate in the jury selection process. The defendant remained in the courtroom during the questioning of the jurors. Once the jury was selected, the trial was postponed until the next day, when the air-conditioning was again working. Did the court's jury selection process violate the defendant's federal constitutional rights?\n\nA. No, because a defendant's confrontation rights are limited to witnesses rather than jurors.\nB. No, because there was good cause to conduct jury selection outside the defendant's presence.\nC. Yes, because excluding the defendant undercut the presumption of innocence.\nD. Yes, because jury selection is a critical stage at which a defendant is entitled to be present.\n"

Yes, because jury selection is a critical stage at which a defendant is entitled to be present.\n\nThe defendant's right to be present during jury selection is a fundamental aspect of a fair trial. This right is enshrined in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right to a public trial by an impartial jury. The presence of the defendant during jury selection is crucial because it allows the defendant to observe the process and potentially challenge any potential biases or conflicts of interest among the jurors. The absence of the defendant during this critical stage could undermine the presumption of innocence and the fairness of the trial."
