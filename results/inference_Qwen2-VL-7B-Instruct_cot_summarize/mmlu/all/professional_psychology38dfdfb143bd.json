It suggests that children's misbehavior can be driven by underlying psychological needs or conflicts, such as seeking attention, power, or revenge. This alignss with the psychologist's emphasis on understanding the goal of misbehavior and the use of appropriate consequences, which are key components of psychodynamic therapy."
