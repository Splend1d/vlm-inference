Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, he received an offer of his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser sued for specific performance on the basis that the oral understanding, along with the written offer and the check, constituted an enforceable agreement. Will the purchaser likely prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.\nB. No, because the offer was not accepted \u0080\u0094 prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\nC. Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.\nD. No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.\n"

Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.\n\nIn this scenario, the oral agreement, the written offer, and the check for the down payment all indicate that there was a meeting of the minds between the buyer and seller. The fact that the seller received a higher offer from another party and then called off the deal does not necessarily mean that the agreement was not enforceable. The seller's decision to accept a higher offer does not negate the enforceability of the original agreement, especially since the seller did not deposit the check or sign the offer form, which would have made the agreement more definitive.\n\nTherefore, the purchaser is likely to prevail in their lawsuit for specific performance based on the evidence of a meeting of the minds and the consideration provided through the written offer and the check."
