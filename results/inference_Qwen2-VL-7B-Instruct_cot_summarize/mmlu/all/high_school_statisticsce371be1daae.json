While properly designed experiments can strongly suggest cause-and-effect relationships, a complete census is the only way of establishing such a relationship.\n- This statement is incorrect. While a complete census can provide comprehensive data, it does not necessarily establish cause-and-effect relationships. Experiments are specifically designed to test cause-and-effect relationships.\n\nB. If properly designed, observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments.\n- This statement is incorrect. Observational studies can suggest associations but do not establish cause-and-effect relationships as strongly as experiments, which control for variables.\n\nC. Controlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies.\n- This statement is correct. Observational studies can identify potential associations, but controlled experiments are needed to establish cause-and-effect relationships by controlling for confounding variables.\n\nD. A useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is to increase the sample size.\n- This statement is correct. Increasing the sample size can help reduce bias by providing more data points, which can lead to more reliable results.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the true statements are:\n\nC. Controlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies.\nD. A useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is to increase the sample size.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC and D."
