This year, she will make two times the amount of soup she made last year, which means she will make \\(32 \\times 2 = 64\\) servings of soup this year.\n\nSince each serving is one cup, and there are 4 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total servings into gallons by dividing the total servings by 4.\n\nSo, \\(64 \\div 4 = 16\\) gallons.\n\nTherefore, Chesa will make 16 gallons of soup this year.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 16."
