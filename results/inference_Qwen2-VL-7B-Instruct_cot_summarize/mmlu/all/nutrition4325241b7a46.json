Because they respond more rapidly to changes in iron levels in the diet.\nB. Because blood haemoglobin levels can also respond to a variety of other factors and insults, such as lead poisoning, chronic disease, etc.\nC. Because the specific iron indices can be measured more accurately and easily.\nD. Because haemoglobin levels vary with subject age, and between the sexes.\n"

Because blood haemoglobin levels can also respond to a variety of other factors and insults, such as lead poisoning, chronic disease, etc.\n\nBlood haemoglobin levels are influenced by many factors beyond iron status, including chronic diseases, lead poisoning, and other health conditions. This makes them less reliable as a standalone indicator of iron status. In contrast, indices like serum ferritin and transferrin receptors are more specific to iron status and less affected by these other factors."
