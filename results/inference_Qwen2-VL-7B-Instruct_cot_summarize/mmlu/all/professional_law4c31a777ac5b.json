It is unenforceable, because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration.\n\nIn the United States, contracts for the payment of money must generally be in writing to be enforceable, unless they fall under an exception to the Statute of Frauds. The Statute of Frauds is a legal principle that requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, the promise to pay a bonus is not a contract for the sale of goods or services, but rather a promise to pay money. Therefore, it is unenforceable unless it was in writing.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. It is enforceable, because the employee conferred a material benefit on the employer by negotiating the lucrative contract.\n- This is incorrect because the employee's negotiation of the contract does not constitute legally sufficient consideration for the promise to pay the bonus.\n\nB. it is enforceable, because the employer was morally obligated to pay the bonus.\n- This is incorrect because moral obligations do not create enforceable contracts in the legal sense.\n\nD. it is unenforceable, because it was not in writing.\n- This is incorrect because the promise to pay a bonus is not a contract for the sale of goods or services, but rather a promise to pay money. Therefore, it is unenforceable unless it was in writing."
