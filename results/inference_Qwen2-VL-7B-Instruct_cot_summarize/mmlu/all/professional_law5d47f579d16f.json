They had relied on a business attorney in establishing the business. After the business failed, the plaintiff and the defendant disagreed about their respective obligations. At trial, both have hired new counsel. The plaintiff calls the business attorney to testify to representations the defendant made in meetings she had with the plaintiff and the business attorney. The defendant objects to the business attorney's testimony, invoking the attorney-client privilege. Should the court uphold the defendant's privilege claim?\n\nA. No, because the business attorney's professional relationship with the plaintiff and the defendant has ended.\nB. No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\nC. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may block disclosure of statements made during such meetings.\nD. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may claim the privilege on behalf of the partnership.\n"

No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\n\nThe attorney-client privilege generally applies to communications between a client and their attorney, regardless of whether the client is an individual or a business entity. In this case, the business attorney had a professional relationship with both the plaintiff and the defendant, and the privilege applies to communications made during the establishment of the partnership. The fact that the business failed and the parties now disagree about their obligations does not negate the existence of the attorney-client relationship at the time of the communications. Therefore, the court should not uphold the defendant's privilege claim based on the attorney-client privilege."
