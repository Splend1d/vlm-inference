In order to use a \u03c72 procedure, the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5.\n   - This statement is true. The \u03c72 test assumes that the expected frequency in each cell is at least 5. This is a common rule of thumb to ensure the \u03c72 approximation is valid.\n\n ii. In order to use \u03c72 procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom.\n   - This statement is false. The degrees of freedom for a \u03c72 test in a two-way table are calculated as ( (number of rows - 1) * ( (number of columns - 1). For a 2 \u00d7 2 table, the degrees of freedom would be ( (2 - 1) * ( (2 - 1) = 1.\n\n iii. In a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3.\n   - This statement is true. For a 4 \u00d7 2 table, the degrees of freedom would be ( (4 - 1) * ( (2 - 1) = 3.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. I and III only"
