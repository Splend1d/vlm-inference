The demand curve would shift up increasing the equilibrium interest rate.\n\nWhen more Americans save for retirement, they are putting more money into savings accounts and other financial instruments that pay interest. This means that the demand for loanable funds (i.e., the funds that banks and other financial institutions lend out to individuals and businesses) increases, as these savings are now available for lending. As a result, the demand curve for loanable funds shifts up, leading to an increase in the equilibrium interest rate."
