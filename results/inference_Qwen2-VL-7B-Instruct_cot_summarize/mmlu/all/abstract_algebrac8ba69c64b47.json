For a linear transformation \\( T \\) to be injective, it must be the case that \\( \\dim(\\ker(T)) = 0 \\). However, if \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) < 1 \\), it implies that \\( \\dim(V) \\) is a non-negative integer and \\( \\dim(W) \\) is a non-negative integer less than 1. This is a contradiction because the dimension of a vector space must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n### Statement 2\nLet \\( \\dim(V) = n \\) and suppose that \\( T: V \\rightarrow V \\) is linear. If \\( T \\) is injective, then it is a bijection.\n\nThis statement is true. If \\( T \\) is a linear transformation from \\( V \\) to \\( V \\) and \\( T \\) is injective, then it must also be surjective as well. This is because for any \\( v \\in V \\), there exists a \\( w \\in V \\) such that \\( T(w) = v \\). Since \\( T \\) is linear, it must be the case that \\( \\dim(\\ker(T)) = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( T \\) is a bijection.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
