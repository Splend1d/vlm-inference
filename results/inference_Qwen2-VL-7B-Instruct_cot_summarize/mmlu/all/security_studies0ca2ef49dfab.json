HM pays insufficient attention to the role of the labourer, instead focusing on the capitalist as the source of power and most important actor. HM can also allude to capitalist power structures, to the detriment of supporting the human security of workers.\nB. HM too often accuses capitalism of acting solely in self-serving ways, and explains everything in terms of class struggle, to the detriment of wider analysis. Some versions of HM claim to have uncovered objective laws of history which are widely disputed in their accuracy.\nC. HM is inevitably reductionist and oversimplifies the complexities of capitalism, recognising only its negative aspects and harmful effects.\nD. All of these options.\n"
