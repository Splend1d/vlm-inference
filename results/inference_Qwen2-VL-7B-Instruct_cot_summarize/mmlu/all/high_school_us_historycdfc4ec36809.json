We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nPolitical discord during the Vietnam War most closely resembled the political dissensions during which of the following?\n\nA.

During World War II, the United States faced internal debates over the extent of its involvement in the war, the role of the military, and the impact of the war on the economy and society. These debates were often intense and polarized, much like the political divisions during the Vietnam War.\n\nIn contrast, the Spanish-American War and the Mexican War were characterized by more straightforward military conflicts with less internal political discord. World War I, while involving significant political divisions, was not as closely tied to the internal political discourse of the United States as the Vietnam War was.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. World War II"
