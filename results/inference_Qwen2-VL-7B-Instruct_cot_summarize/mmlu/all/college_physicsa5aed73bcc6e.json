In this case, the resolving power is given by:\n\nR = \u03bb / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the light and \u0394\u03bb is the width of the slit.\n\nWe are given that the two wavelengths of light that the spectrometer can just barely resolve are 500 nm and 502 nm. Therefore, the width of the slit is:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = 502 nm - 500 nm = 2 nm\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation for resolving power:\n\nR = 500 nm / 2 nm = 250\n\nTherefore, the resolving power of the spectrometer is 250, which corresponds to option B."
