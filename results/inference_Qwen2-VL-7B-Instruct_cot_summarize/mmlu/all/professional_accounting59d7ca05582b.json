The 50,000 units sold are assumed to be the most recent purchases first. So, we start with the most recent purchase and work backwards.\n2. The most recent purchase is from 1/23, which is 40,000 units at $17 each.\n3. The next purchase is from 1/20, which is 30,000 units at $15 each.\n\nSince we only need to cover 50,000 units, we use the 40,000 units from 1/23 and the remaining 10,000 units from 1/20.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost:\n\n- Cost of 40,000 units from 1/23: 40,000 units * $17 = $680,000\n- Cost of 10,000 units from 1/20: 10,000 units * $15 = $150,000\n\nTotal cost of goods sold (COGS = $680,000 + $150,000 = $830,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $830,000"
