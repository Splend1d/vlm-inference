A 90% confidence interval estimate for the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is reported to be -0.197 \u00b1 0.081. Which is a proper conclusion?\n\nA. The interval is invalid because probabilities cannot be negative.\nB. The interval is invalid because it does not contain zero.\nC. Subaru owners are approximately 19.7% more satisfied with their drive systems than are Toyota owners.\nD. We are 90% confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278 and -0.116.\n"
