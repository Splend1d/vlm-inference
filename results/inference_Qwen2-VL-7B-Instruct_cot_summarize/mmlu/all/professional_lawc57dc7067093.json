One evening, the consumer was driving along a city street when he saw the traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, he quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed because of a defect in the brake mechanism. The consumer then swerved to avoid hitting a bus that was crossing the intersection at a right angle to him. As a result of the swerve, the consumer's car rode up on the sidewalk and overturned, pinning a pedestrian. Both the consumer and the pedestrian were severely injured. If the consumer asserts a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability in tort, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car.\nB. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\nC. No, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up.\nD. No, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it.\n"

No, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up.\n\nIn a strict liability case, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant ( (in this case, the car dealer) was at fault for the injury. The plaintiff must also show that the defendant's actions or failure to act caused the injury. However, in strict liability cases, the plaintiff is not required to prove negligence on the part of the defendant. Instead, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions or failure to act caused the injury.\n\nIn this case, the consumer's injury was caused by the failure of the brake mechanism, which was a defect present when the consumer purchased the car. The consumer's speeding up and swerving to avoid hitting a bus were not the cause of the injury. Therefore, the consumer's actions were not a contributing factor to his own injury."
