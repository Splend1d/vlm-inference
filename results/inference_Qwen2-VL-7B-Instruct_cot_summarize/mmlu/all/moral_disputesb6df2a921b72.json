The ability of people to pursue their own projects - This is a fundamental concern for liberal egalitarians as it supports individual autonomy and freedom.\n\nB. Equal opportunity - This is also central to liberal egalitarianism, as it aims to ensure that everyone has an equal chance to succeed.\n\nC. Freedom of speech - While important, freedom of speech is more closely associated with liberal democracy rather than specifically liberal egalitarianism. Liberal egalitarians focus more on equality and justice rather than the absolute freedom of speech.\n\nD. Keeping actual inequalities as small as possible - This is a core concern for liberal egalitarians, as they strive to reduce inequalities in society.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that is not a concern for all liberal egalitarians according to Carens is:\n\nC. Freedom of speech"
