He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Bed rest\nB. Regular activity\nC. X-rays of the spine\nD. MRI of the spine\n"

If the x-rays are normal, then the pain is likely due to muscle strain or other soft tissue injury. In this case, the patient should be advised to rest, use heat or ice, and take over-the-counter pain medication as needed. Regular activity should be avoided until the pain has resolved."
