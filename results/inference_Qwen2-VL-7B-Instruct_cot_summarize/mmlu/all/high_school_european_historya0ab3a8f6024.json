Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.\nIsabella Beeton, Book of Household Management, 1861\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Beeton believed that\n\nA. women held considerable power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life\nB. women were denied power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life\nC. women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life\nD. women were denied power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life\n"

The passage emphasizes the importance of a woman's knowledge of household duties and how it affects the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family. \n\nLet's break down the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage starts by comparing the role of a commander of an army to that of a mistress of the house, suggesting that both have significant responsibilities.\n2. It states that the mistress of the house's spirit is seen throughout the establishment and that her intelligence and thoroughness in performing her duties will influence her domestics.\n3. The passage then highlights that knowledge of household duties is particularly important for women, as it is dependent on these duties for the family's happiness, comfort, and well-being.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that Beeton believed women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life"
