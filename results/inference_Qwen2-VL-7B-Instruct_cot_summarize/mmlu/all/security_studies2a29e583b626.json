Here's a brief explanation of each option:\n\nA. **Elites create negative inducement for non-support of the regime. Redistribution as a means of denial to the power structure in the form of \"elite disenfranchisement\" which may include diversion of resources, disarmament and denial of access to commercial activity routes.**\n   - This option suggests that elites might use negative incentives to discourage opposition to the regime. This could involve redistributing resources away from the elite, disarming them, or denying them access to commercial activity routes. This strategy aims to weaken the elite's ability to resist the regime.\n\nB. **Lacking infrastructural capacity and wider social legitimacy, weak state elites are often forced to rely on coercive power. However, a key dilemma is that the instruments of violence can be a threat to the regime require the deliberate undermining of armed forces.**\n   - This option highlights the dilemma faced by weak state elites who rely on coercive power. The use of violence can be counterproductive as it can undermine the regime's legitimacy. The option suggests that elites might need to undermine their own armed forces to avoid this dilemma.\n\nC. **Elites attempt to foster a new politics of identity in which ethnic consciousness is superseded by ideologies orientated around the myth of the regime.**\n   - This option suggests that elites might try to create a new political identity that supersedes ethnic consciousness. This could involve promoting ideologies that are centered around the regime's myth, which can help to consolidate the regime's power and control.\n\nD. **Weak states have cultivated international sponsorship and have initiated processes of democratic reform so as to gain popular legitimacy internally whilst bolster bolster its international legitimacy externally.**\n   - This option suggest that weak states might seek international sponsorship and initiate democratic reforms to gain legitimacy both internally and externally. This strategy aims to strengthen the regime's power and control by gaining support from international actors and promoting democratic reforms that can increase the regime's legitimacy.\n\nIn conclusion, the options provided describe various strategies that elites might employ to maintain their power and control over a society. These strategies include creating negative inducements for non-support of the regime, relying on coercive power, fostering a new politics of identity, and seeking international sponsorship and democratic reforms."
