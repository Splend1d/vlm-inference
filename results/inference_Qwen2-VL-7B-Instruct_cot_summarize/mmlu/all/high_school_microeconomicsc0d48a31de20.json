Public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that once a good is provided, it cannot be excluded from use by others and its consumption by one person does not reduce its availability to others. By providing public goods, the government ensures that everyone benefits from them, regardless of whether they contribute to their provision. This helps to overcome the free rider problem, as individuals are less likely to avoid contributing to the provision of public goods if they know that they will still benefit from them."
