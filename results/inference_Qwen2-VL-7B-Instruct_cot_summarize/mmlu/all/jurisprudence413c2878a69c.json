Because any definition of punishment should be value-neutral.\n\nIt is important to separate the concept of punishment from its justification because any definition of punishment should be value-neutral. This means that the definition should not be influenced by moral or ethical considerations, but rather should focus on the nature of the act itself. By separating the concept of punishment from its justification, we can more objectively evaluate the effectiveness and fairness of different forms of punishment."
