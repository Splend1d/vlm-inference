L <= T <= M <= R.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Left Sum ( (L)**: The left sum is the sum of the areas of the rectangles formed by the left endpoints of each subinterval. Since the function is increasing and concave up, the left endpoints will underestimate the area under the curve. Therefore, L will be less than the actual area under the curve.\n\n2. **Right Sum ( (R)**: The right sum is the sum of the areas of the rectangles formed by the right endpoints of each subinterval. Since the function is increasing and concave up, the right endpoints will overestimate the area under the curve. Therefore, R will be greater than the actual area under the curve.\n\n3. **Midpoint Sum ( (M)**: The midpoint sum is the sum of the areas of the rectangles formed by the midpoints of each subinterval. Since the function is increasing and concave up, the midpoint sum will be closer to the actual area under the curve than either the left or right sums. Therefore, M will be between L and R.\n\n4. **Trapezoid Sum ( (T)**: The trapezoid sum is the sum of the areas of the trapezoids formed by the function and the x-axis. Since the function is increasing and concave up, the trapezoid sum will be closer to the actual area under the curve than either the left or right sums. Therefore, T will be between M and R.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\nL < M < T < R\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. L <= T <= M <= R."
