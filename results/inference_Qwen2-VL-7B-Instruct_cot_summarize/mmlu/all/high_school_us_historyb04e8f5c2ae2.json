The cartoon seems to be criticizing Andrew Carnegie for his actions and decisions, particularly in relation to his wealth and business practices.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. \"Carnegie was able to give away a great deal of money only because he violated his workers\u2019 rights.\"\n- This option suggests that Carnegie's philanthropy was a result of his mistreatment of his workers. This aligns with the idea that Carnegie's wealth was built on exploiting his workers, which could be seen as a criticism of his actions.\n\nB. \"Carnegie did not give enough of his considerable fortune to charity.\"\n- This option focuses on the amount of money Carnegie gave to charity, which is not directly related to the criticism of his business practices or treatment of workers.\n\nC. \"Carnegie was dividing his attention and was therefore not as successful in either of his main endeavors.\"\n- This option suggests that Carnegie's lack of focus led to his failure in both business and philanthropy. This is not directly related to the criticism of his business practices.\n\nD. \"Carnegie's ruthless business practices were causing him to lose touch with his working-class origins.\"\n- This option suggests that Carnegie's ruthless business practices led him to lose touch with his working-class origins. This align with the idea that Carnegie's wealth was built on exploiting his workers, which could be seen as a criticism of his actions.\n\nGiven the context and the core message of the cartoon, the criticism of Andrew Carnegie seems to focus on his business practices and how they led to his wealth, which align with option A and D.\n\nHowever, option D more directly addresses the criticism of Carnegie's ruthless business practices, which is more aligned with the spirit of the cartoon.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best represents the criticism of Andrew Carnegie found in the cartoon is:\n\nD. Carnegie's ruthless business practices were causing him to lose touch with his working-class origins."
