When we found the last Summer that we were likely to get no Assistance from the Government, some Volunteers went out at our own Expense, determined to drive our Enemies from our Borders; & when we came near to the great Island, we understood that a Number of their Warriors had gone out against our Frontiers. Upon this we returned and came up with them and fought with them at the Munfey Hill where we lost some of our Men & killed some of their Warriors & thereby saved our Frontiers from this Story in another Expedition. But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter.\"\n\u2014\"Apology of the Paxton Boys\" (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: \"apology\" in this context should be read as an explanation, not an admission of guilt or regret.)\nWhich of the following events from either earlier or later in the colonial period can best be seen as being part of a continuity with the events described in the passage above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which event best represents a continuity with the events described in the passage above, we need to analyze the context and core of the passage. The passage discusses the actions of the Paxton Boys, a group of Pennsylvania settlers who were involved in a conflict with Native Americans in the late 1760. The Paxton Boys' actions were motivated by a perceived threat from Native Americans and their desire to protect their frontier lands.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. The expulsion of Anne Hutchinson from Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n- This event occurred in the early 1630s and involved Puritan leaders who were unhappy with Anne Hutchinson's religious views. It does not relate to frontier conflicts or the defense of land against Native American threats.\n\nB. Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\n- This event took place in 1676 and was a rebellion by Virginia colonists against the Virginia government. It was driven by economic grievances and land disputes, not by frontier conflicts or threats from Native Americans.\n\nC. The Boston Tea Party.\n- This occurred in 1773 and was a protest against British taxation policies. It was not related to frontier conflicts or threats from Native Americans.\n\nD. The trial of John Peter Zenger.\n- This occurred in 1735 and was a legal case that challenged the British government's right to censor colonial newspapers. it was not related to frontier conflicts or threats from Native Americans.\n\nGiven the context of the passage, the best option that represents a continuity with the events described is:\n\nB. Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\n\nThis event involved frontier conflicts and land disputes, which aligns with the Paxton Boys' motivations and actions."
