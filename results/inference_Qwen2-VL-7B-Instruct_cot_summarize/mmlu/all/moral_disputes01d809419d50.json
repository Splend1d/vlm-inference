The key point is that the action itself is morally permissible, even though it results in an undesirable outcome.\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\nA. The action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible.\n- This option alignss well with the doctrine of double effect. It suggests that the action itself is morally permissible, regardless of the consequences.\n\nB. The action, only because of its effects, is morally permissible.\n- This option contradicts the doctrine of double effect. The action is not morally permissible because of its effects; rather, it is morally permissible despite the effects.\n\nC. No actual person would ever endorse that action.\n- This option is irrelevant to the doctrine of double effect. The endorsement of an action by an actual person does not determine its moral permissibility.\n\nD. The action is valuable because of its relationship to things that are intrinsically valuable.\n- This option is also not directly related to the doctrine of double effect. It focuses on the value of the action in relation to other intrinsically valuable things, which is not the central point of the doctrine.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible."
