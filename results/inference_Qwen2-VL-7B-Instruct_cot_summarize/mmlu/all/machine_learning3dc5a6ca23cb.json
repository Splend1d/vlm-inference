Support vector machines ( (SVMs) do not output a probability distribution over the possible labels. Instead, they output a decision function ( a hyperplane in the feature space that separates the classes. The decision is made based on the distance of of the input example to the hyperplane, not on a probability distribution.\n\nStatement 2: \"We would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\"\n- This statement is also false. The support vectors are the data points that lie on the margin of or are closest to the decision boundary. When moving from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels, the decision boundary changes, and thus the support vectors may change as well. The higher order polynomial kernels can lead to more complex decision boundaries, which may result in different support vectors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
