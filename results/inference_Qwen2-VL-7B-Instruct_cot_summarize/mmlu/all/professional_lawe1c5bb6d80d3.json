                    "text": "A write-in candidate is a Mexican-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Mexican voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager, decides to mail to every registered Mexican voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native Mexican people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following, if established, sets forth the strongest constitutional argument supporting the election official's interpretation of the statute?\n\nA. Voter turnout among registered Mexican American voters who lack proficiency in English has been less than 1% of the entire state total in recent elections.\nB. A state statute requires that each voting booth be equipped with an ink pen to facilitate the writing in of votes.\nC. Since large numbers of write-in votes generally increase the time needed to count all votes, it is necessary to cast such votes in a uniform manner.\nD. The potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which of the following options sets forth the strongest constitutional argument supporting the election official's interpretation of the state statute, we need to analyze the context and the nature of the argument. The election official's interpretation is that write-in stickers do not comply with the state statute because it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Voter turnout among registered Mexican American voters who lack proficiency in English has been less than 1% of the entire state total in recent elections.\n- This option provides statistical evidence about voter turnout but does not directly address the legality or constitutionality of the state statute.\n\nB. A state statute requires that each voting booth be equipped with an ink pen to facilitate the write-in of of votes.\n- This option directly supports the election official's interpretation by stating that the state statute explicitly requires voters to write in their votes using ink pens. This aligns with the official's argument that write-in stickers do not comply with the statute.\n\nC. Since large numbers of write-in votes generally increase the time needed to count all votes, it is necessary to cast such votes in a uniform manner.\n- This option discusses the practical implications of write-in votes but does not address the legality or constitutionality of the state statute.\n\nD. The potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers.\n- This option raises concerns about potential voting fraud but does not directly support the election official's interpretation of the state statute.\n\nGiven the context, the strongest constitutional argument supporting the election official's interpretation of the state statute is:\n\nB. A state statute requires that each voting booth be equipped with an ink pen to facilitate the write-in of of votes.\n\nThis option directly supports the official's interpretation by referencing the explicit requirement in the state statute, thereby providing a clear and direct constitutional argument."
