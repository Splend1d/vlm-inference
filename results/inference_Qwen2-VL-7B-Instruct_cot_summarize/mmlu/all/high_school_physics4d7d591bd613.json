The net force acting on the object is the sum of the three forces, which is 3 * 4 N = 12 N.\n\nThe acceleration of the object can be calculated using Newton's second law, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma. Rearranging this equation to solve for acceleration gives a = F/m.\n\nSubstituting the values of the net force and the mass of the object into the equation to find the acceleration:\n\na = F/m = 12 N / 2 kg = 6 m/s^2.\n\nTherefore, the possible accelerations of the object are 0 m/s^2, 2 m/s^2, and 4 m/s^2. The acceleration of the object cannot be 8 m/s^2."
