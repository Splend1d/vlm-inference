A new partnership of nations has begun. And we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective\u2014a new world order\u2014can emerge; a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony.\n\u2014President George Herbert Walker Bush, Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, September 11, 1990\nPresident Bush's \"new world order\" most directly resembles which of the following?\n\nA. The Monroe Doctrine\nB. Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\"\nC. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points\nD. Containment policy toward the Soviet Union\n"

It was a policy of the United States to keep European powers out of the Western Hemisphere. It was not about promoting cooperation among nations but rather about asserting American dominance in the region.\n\n2. **Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\"**: This was a policy of the United States to use military force to protect its interests and to promote its values. It was about assertive and aggressive foreign policy, not about promoting cooperation.\n\n3. **Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points**: These were a set of principles for a lasting peace after World War I. They included ideas like self-determination, open diplomacy, and the reduction of national armaments. They were about creating a more just and cooperative international system, which alignss with President Bush's vision of a new world order.\n\n4. **Containment policy toward the Soviet Union**: This was a policy of the United States to prevent the spread of communism. It was about containment and not about promoting cooperation among nations.\n\nGiven the context of President Bush's speech, which emphasizes cooperation, justice, and peace among nations, the most fitting option is:\n\n**C. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points**\n\nThese principles align with the idea of a new era of cooperation and justice, which is the essence of President Bush's \"new world order.\""
