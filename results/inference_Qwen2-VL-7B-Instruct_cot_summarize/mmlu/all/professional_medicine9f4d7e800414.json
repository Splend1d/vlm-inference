X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation. Physical examination today shows no abnormalities. A 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\nB. Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nC. Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nD. Osmotic diuretic\n"

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\n\nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, inhibit the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is involved in the reabsorption of bicarbonate in the proximal tubule of the kidney. This leads to an increase in the excretion of bicarbonate and a decrease in the reabsorption of calcium, which can help reduce the risk of recurrent calcium stone formation."
