This is because the connectedness of A and C implies that B cannot be split into two nonempty open sets, as any such split would also split A or C, which contradicts their connectedness.\n\n### Statement II: If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\n- **Compactness**: A topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover.\n- **Implication**: Compactness is not necessarily preserved under subsets. For example, consider the space \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with the usual topology, and let \\(A = [0, 1]\\), \\(B = [0, 0.5]\\), and \\(C = [0, 1]\\). Here, \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are compact, but \\(B\\) is not compact because it can be covered by an infinite open cover without a finite subcover.\n\n### Statement III: If A and C are Hausdoror, then B is Hausdoror.\n- **Hausdoror Property**: A topological space is Hausdoror if for any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open sets containing each point.\n- **Implication**: The Hausdoror property is not necessarily preserved under subsets. For example, consider the space \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with the usual topology, and let \\(A = [0, 1]\\), \\(B = [0, 0.5]\\), and \\(C = [0, 1]\\). Here, \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are Hausdoror, but \\(B\\) is not Hausdoror because it cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Statement I is true because the connectedness of A and C implies the connectedness of B.\n- Statement II is false because compactness is not necessarily preserved under subsets.\n- Statement III is false because the Hausdoror property is not necessarily preserved under subsets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. I and III only**"
