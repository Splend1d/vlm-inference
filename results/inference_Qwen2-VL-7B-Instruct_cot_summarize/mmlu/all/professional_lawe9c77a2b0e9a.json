The son's succeeding, because the son's conveyance of his life estate to the friend divested the contingent remainder of his heirs.\n\nIn Shelley's Case, the rule established that a life tenant cannot convey the reversion or remainder interest to a third party. However, if the life tenant conveys their interest to a third party, the remainder interest is divested, and the third party can then sue for specific performance of the contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the son conveyed his life estate to the friend, which divested the contingent remainder interest of his heirs. Therefore, the friend can now sue for specific performance of the real estate contract, and the son's heirs do not need to join in the transaction to convey marketable title."
