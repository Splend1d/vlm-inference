This opening allows air to bypass the upper airway and enter the lungs. It is typically performed when a patient needs to breathe through a tube or ventilator for an extended period of time. The tracheostomy helps to maintain an open airway and allows the patient to breathe more easily. It can also be used to aid in weaning patients from a ventilator by gradually reducing the amount of support needed from the ventilator."
