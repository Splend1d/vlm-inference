The man's and the nephew's lots were in an unimproved natural state. The son, however, had lived for 10 years in a house that he had built on his property. In 2009, the man planted trees and shrubbery on his land along the boundary of the nephew's lot. In 2010, the nephew, in preparation for building a house on his lot, carefully excavated an area eight feet deep for the purpose of building a basement. The side of the excavation closest to the man \u0080\u0094 nephew boundary suddenly collapsed, and a quantity of the man's soil, trees, and shrubbery fell into the hole. The nephew hauled away the debris. In an appropriate action by the man against the nephew to recover for the damage to his land, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The nephew, if he was conducting the excavation work non-negligently.\nB. The nephew, because he was under no duty to support the man's land in its improved state.\nC. The man, because a landowner is entitled to support of his land in its natural condition.\nD. The man, because a landowner has an absolute right to have his land supported by the neighboring land.\n"

The nephew, if he was conducting the excavation work non-negligently.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle of comparative negligence, which is often applied in cases involving landowner disputes. Comparative negligence allows courts to consider the actions of both parties in determining liability and damages. If the nephew was conducting the excavation work non-negligently, he would likely be held responsible for the damage to the man's land. However, if the nephew was found to have acted negligently, he would be liable for the damages."
