On cross- examination of the pedestrian's physician, the defendant's attorney asked him whether or not the pedestrian had told him that the leg that she claimed was injured had been permanently stiff as a result of a former field hockey injury the pedestrian suffered in high school. Upon objection by the pedestrian's attorney, the trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. sustain the objection, as violative of the physician-patient privilege.\nC. overrule the objection, as a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\nD. overrule the objection, as a statement against interest.\n"
