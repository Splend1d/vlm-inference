The least common denominator (LCD for 2 and 5 is 10.\n\nConverting each fraction to have a denominator of 10:\n- For the tomato soup: \\( \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{10} \\)\n- For the chicken noodle soup: \\( \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{4}{10} \\)\n\nNow, adding these fractions:\n\\[ \\frac{5}{10} + \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{9}{10} \\]\n\nTherefore, 9/10 of the cans of soup in Rolando\u2019s cupboard are either tomato or chicken noodle soup.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 10-Jul"
