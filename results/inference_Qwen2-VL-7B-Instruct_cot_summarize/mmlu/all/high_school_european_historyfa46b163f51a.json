The Chartists movement was characterized by demands for political reform, including universal male suffrage, and was often associated with radical political ideas.\n\nThe passage also also mentions the political reaction led by Klemens von Metternich, who was the Austrian Chancellor and Foreign Minister during the early 19th century. Metternich was known for his conservative policies and his efforts to suppress liberal and nationalist movements in Europe.\n\nGiven this context, the political reaction led by Metternich that occurred as a result of the Chartist movement, the French Revolution, and other liberal movements would be one that opposed these liberal and radical ideas.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Liberalism - This is a political ideology that supports individual rights, democracy, and free markets. It is not the correct answer because Metternich was against liberal ideas.\n\nB. Radicalism - This is a political ideology that advocates for rapid and fundamental social and political change. This is a possible answer because Metternich was against radical ideas.\n\nC. Nationalism - This is a political ideology that emphasizes national identity and the unity of of a nation. This is not the correct answer because Metternich was against nationalist movements.\n\nD. Conservatism - This is a political ideology that supports the maintenance of traditional social and political institutions and values. This is the correct answer because Metternich was known for his conservative policies.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Conservatism"
