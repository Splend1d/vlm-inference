Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Apple:\n- Cost: Apples are generally inexpensive, especially when bought in bulk.\n- Nutritional value: Apples are rich in fiber, vitamins (such as vitamin C), and antioxidants. They are also low in calories.\n\nB. Slice of bread:\n- Cost: Bread can vary in price, but it is generally affordable.\n- Nutritional value: Bread is a good source of carbohydrates and some vitamins and minerals, but it is often high in calories and can be low in fiber and other nutrients.\n\nC. Cheese burger:\n- Cost: Cheese burgers can be relatively inexpensive, especially when bought at fast-food restaurants.\n- Nutritional value: Cheese burgers are high in calories, primarily from fats and carbohydrates. They are also low in fiber and other essential nutrients.\n\nD. Broccoli:\n- Cost: Broccoli is relatively inexpensive and widely available.\n- Nutritional value: Broccoli is a very nutritious vegetable, rich in vitamins (such as vitamin C and K), minerals, and fiber. It is also low in calories.\n\nBased on this analysis, broccoli appears to be the cheapest and most nutritious option in terms of price per calorie. It is rich in essential nutrients and low in calories, making it a good choice for those looking to maximize nutritional value for their money.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Broccoli."
