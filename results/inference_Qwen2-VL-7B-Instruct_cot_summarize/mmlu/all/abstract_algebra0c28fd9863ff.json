Since the order of the group is 42, the possible values for \\( n_7 \\) are 1 and 6. If \\( n_7 = 1 \\), then there is a unique ( and hence normal - sylow 7-subgroup. If \\( n_7 = 6 \\), then there are 6 such subgroups, but they are not necessarily normal.\n\nTherefore, it is possible for a group of order 42 to have a normal subgroup of order 7, but it is not guaranteed. This statement is not universally true for all groups of order 42.\n\n### Statement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nFor a group of order 42, the number of sylow 8-subgroups (\\( n_8 \\)) must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 8. Since the order of the group is 42, the possible values for \\( n_8 \\) are 1 and 5. If \\( n_8 = 1 \\), then there is a unique - and hence normal - sylow 8-subgroup. If \\( n_8 = 5 \\), then there are 5 such subgroups, but they are not necessarily normal.\n\nTherefore, it is possible for a group of order 42 to have a normal subgroup of order 8, but it is not guaranteed. This statement is not universally true for all groups of order 42.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are not universally true for all groups of order 42. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
