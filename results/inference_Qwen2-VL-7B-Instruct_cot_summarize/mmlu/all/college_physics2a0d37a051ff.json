Lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal primarily the nuclear structure of the sample.\n- This statement is incorrect. Lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal primarily the electronic transitions within atoms and molecules, not the nuclear structure.\n\nB. The wavelengths identified in an absorption spectrum of an element are among those in its emission spectrum.\n- This statement is correct. Absorption and emission spectra are complementary. The wavelengths that are absorbed by an element are the same as those that it emits.\n\nC. Absorption spectra can be used to determine which elements are present in distant stars.\n- This statement is correct. Absorption spectra can be used to identify the elements present in distant stars by analyzing the specific wavelengths that are absorbed.\n\nD. Spectral analysis can be used to identify the composition of galactic dust.\n- This statement is correct. Spectral analysis of galactic dust can reveal the composition of the dust particles by identifying the characteristic wavelengths of the elements present in the dust.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct is:\n\nA. Lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet region of the spectrum reveal primarily the nuclear structure of the sample."
