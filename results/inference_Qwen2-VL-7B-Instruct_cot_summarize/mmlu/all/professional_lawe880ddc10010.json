One week later, the purchasing agent received a telephone call from the vice president of the dressmaking company, who informed her that the dressmaking company's sales representative had made an error in calculating the contract price. As a result, the vice president said that unless the women's clothing store agreed to pay an additional $15,000, the garments would not be delivered. If the purchasing agent should have known that the dressmaking company's original price term of $75,000 was in error, but agreed to the contract anyway, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.\nB. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.\nC. There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.\nD. There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\n"

There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Enforceable Contract at the Original Price Term (**\n   - An enforceable contract requires mutual assent, which means both parties must agree to the terms. The original price term of $75,000 was agreed upon by both parties, and there was no indication that the purchasing agent was unaware of the potential error.\n\n2. **Mistake as a Ground for Voiding Contract**\n   - A mistake can be a ground for voiding contract if it is a mutual mistake. However, in this case, the mistake was unilateral, meaning only one party (the sales representative) was unaware of the error. This does not meet the criteria for mutual mistake.\n\n3. **Mutuality of Assent**\n   - Mutuality of assent is a requirement for a valid contract. Both parties must agree to the terms. The purchasing agent agreed to the original price term, and there was no indication that the agreement was not mutual.\n\n4. **Voidable Contract**\n   - A voidable contract is one that can be avoided by one of the parties. In this scenario, the purchasing agent should have known that the original price term was in error but agreed to it anyway. This means the contract is voidable because the purchasing agent could have avoided it if they had known the mistake.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that there was a voidable contract because the purchasing agent should have known of the error."
