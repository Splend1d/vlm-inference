A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to randomly choose families and include all drivers in each of these families in the sample.\nC.

A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to randomly choose families and include all drivers in each of these families in the sample.\n\nThis option describes a reasonable sampling method because it involves selecting families randomly, which can help ensure that the sample is representative of the population of drivers in the city. By including all drivers in each chosen family, the sample size can be manageable and the cost of data collection can be reduced.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using a list of all AAA members in the city may not be representative of all drivers in the city, as not all drivers are members of AAA.\n\nOption C is incorrect because randomness in choosing a sample is important to ensure that the sample is representative of the population. Even with a very large sample size, bias can still occur if the sample is not randomly selected.\n\nOption D is incorrect because option B is a true statement."
