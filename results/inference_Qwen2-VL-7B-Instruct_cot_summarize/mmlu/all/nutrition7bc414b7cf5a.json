Lactase persistence refers to the ability to produce lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose, into adulthood. \n\n- Lactase persistence is common in populations that traditionally consume large amounts of milk, such as Europeans and Northern Europeans.\n- In contrast, lactase non-persistence is more common in populations that traditionally consume less milk, such as East Asians and Africans.\n\nBased on this information, the approximate percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide is:\n\nB. 70%-75%"
