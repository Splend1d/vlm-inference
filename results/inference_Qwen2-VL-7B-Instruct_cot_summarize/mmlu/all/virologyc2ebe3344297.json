We disturb forests where they quietly exist as a zoonosis\n\nEmerging viruses like Zika and Ebola are often linked to human activities that disturb natural habitats, such as deforestation and urbanization. These activities can bring humans into contact with animals that carry the viruses, allowing the viruses to spread from animals to humans. Additionally, climate change and other environmental factors can also contribute to the emergence and spread of of these viruses."
