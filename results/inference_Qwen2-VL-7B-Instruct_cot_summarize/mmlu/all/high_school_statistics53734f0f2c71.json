We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\n\nThis statement is based on the given data and the concept of confidence intervals. The average donation is $155, and the standard deviation is $32. To calculate the confidence interval, we would typically use the formula for a confidence interval for the mean, which involves the sample mean, the standard deviation, and the sample size. However, without specific calculations, we can infer that the confidence interval is likely to be based on the standard error of of the mean ( (SE), which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (n). \n\nGiven the standard deviation of $32 and a sample size of 100, the standard error of the mean ( (SE) would be approximately $32 / \u221a100 = $32 / 10 = $3.2. For a 95% confidence interval, we would use a z-score of approximately 1.96 ( (for a two-tailed test). \n\nThe confidence interval would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sample Mean} \\pm (z \\times \\text{SE} \\]\n\n\\[ $155 \\pm 1.96 \\times $3.2 \\]\n\n\\[ $155 \\pm $6.2728 \\]\n\n\\[ $148.7272 to $161.2728 \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, this gives us the interval from $149 to $161. \n\nTherefore, the most appropriate statement is C, as it correctly reflects the confidence interval for the average donation in November."
