The net charge has not changed.\n\nWhen the circuit is initially disconnected, the light bulb is not lit, and there is no current flowing through the circuit. This means that the charge on the circuit elements (such as the battery and the light bulb) is balanced, and there is no net charge accumulation.\n\nWhen the circuit is connected and the light bulb lights, the current flows through the circuit, but the net charge on the circuit elements remains the same. The current flowing through the circuit is a result of the difference in electric potential between the battery and the light bulb, but this does not change the overall charge on the circuit elements.\n\nTherefore, after the light bulb has been lit for a few moments, the net charge residing on the circuit elements has not changed."
