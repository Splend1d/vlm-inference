                    "text": "When a small meteor collides with an artificial satellite in orbit, the satellite's speed increases by 1%. Since the satellite's orbit is circular and the collision does not change the instantaneous direction of the satellite's velocity, the satellite will continue to orbit in a circular path but with a larger radius.\n\nThe reason for this is that the increase in speed results in a larger circumference for the new circular orbit. The circumference of a circle is given by \\(C = 2\\pi r\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle. If the speed increases, the circumference increases, and thus the radius must also increase to maintain the new, larger circumference.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius."
