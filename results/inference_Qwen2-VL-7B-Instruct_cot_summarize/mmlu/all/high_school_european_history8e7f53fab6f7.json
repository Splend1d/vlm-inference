It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nAccording to Huizinga, Erasmus's legacy was more significant than that of earlier humanists because\n\nA. he had more support from the Church\nB. he wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses, unlike his predecessors\nC. he wrote exclusively about religious matters\nD. he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had\n"

The focus is on his broader influence and the accessibility of his work.\n\n2. **Option B: He wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses, unlike his predecessors**\n   - The passage states that Erasmus wrote in Latin, which was the language of the educated classes at the time. It does not mention that he wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses. This option is incorrect.\n\n3. **Option C: He wrote exclusively about religious matters**\n   - The passage does not indicate that Erasmus wrote exclusively about religious matters. It mentions that he wrote about the spirit of antiquity and the use of Latin for writing, but it does not specify that he wrote exclusively about religious matters. This is incorrect.\n\n4. **Option D: He valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had**\n   - The passage emphasizes that Erasmus introduced the classic spirit to the people, not just the educated classes. It mentions that he familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanist had reached with the spirit of antiquity. This is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. He valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had**"
