His works, particularly \"Summa Theologica,\" focus on the nature of God, the soul, and the relationship between faith and reason. \n\nHowever, if we interpret the options in a broader philosophical context, Aquinas might be seen as supporting the idea that operations ( (such as actions or activities) are necessary for the fulfillment of desires or pleasures. This is because he believed in the teleological view, which posits that everything in the universe has a purpose or end ( (telos).\n\nGiven this interpretation, the most fitting option would be:\n\nB. pleasure exists for the sake of operation.\n\nThis aligns with Aquinas's belief in the teleological nature of the universe, where operations ( such as actions or activities) are necessary for the fulfillment of desires or pleasures."
