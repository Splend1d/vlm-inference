The discount amount is:\n\n\\[ 20\\% \\times \\$325.00 = 0.20 \\times \\$325.00 = \\$65.00 \\]\n\nSo, the price after the first discount is:\n\n\\[ \\$325.00 - \\$65.00 = \\$260.00 \\]\n\nThen, in December, the coat is marked down by an additional 10%. The discount amount is:\n\n\\[ 10\\% \\times \\$260.00 = 0.10 \\times \\$260.00 = \\$26.00 \\]\n\nSo, the price after the second discount is:\n\n\\[ \\$260.00 - \\$26.00 = \\$234.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the Christmas shopper in December would pay:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\$234.00} \\]\n\nThis matches option B."
