The results of electoral college voting tend to distort the winner's margin of victory, when compared with the popular vote for president.\n\nThe electoral college system in the United States is unique in that it each state, regardless of population, gets a certain number of electoral votes based on the number of representatives and senators they have in Congress. This means that a candidate can win the presidency with a majority of electoral votes even if they do not receive the majority of the popular vote. This can lead to situations where the candidate with the most votes nationwide does not win the presidency, which is what is meant by the \"distortion\" of the winner's margin of victory."
