Discouraged people who have given up looking for jobs.\n\nThe official unemployment rate, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( (BLS) in the United States, does not include individuals who are not actively seeking employment but have given up looking for work. These individuals are considered \"discouraged workers\" and are not counted as unemployed in the official statistics. This exclusion can lead to an understatement of the true unemployment level, as it does not fully capture the number of people who are out of work."
