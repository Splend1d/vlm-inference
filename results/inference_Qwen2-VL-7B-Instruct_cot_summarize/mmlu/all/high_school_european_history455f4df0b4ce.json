Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .\nYou must know that I am not content with the Courtier unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .\nI wish our Courtier to guard against getting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who do not deserve it.\n\u2014From Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, 1528\nWhich of the following themes of the Renaissance era is the above writing most connected to?\n\nA. Secularism\nB. Individualism\nC. Humanism\nD. Perspective\n"
