Closure: For all \\( x, h \\in aH \\), \\( (x \\cdot y \\in aH \\) for all \\( x, y \\in aH \\).\n  2. Identity: \\( e \\in aH \\).\n  3. Inverses: For all \\( h \\in aH \\), \\( h^{-1} \\in aH \\).\n\n- **If a is in H:** If \\( a \\in H \\), then \\( aH = Ha \\) ( which is a subgroup of G because H is a subgroup of G.\n\n- **If a is not in H:** If \\( a \\not\\in H \\), then \\( aH \\) is not a subgroup of G because itH does not contain the identity element of G ( (e.e., \\( e \\not\\in aH \\)).\n\nThus, \\( aH \\) is a subgroup of G if and only if \\( a \\) is in H.\n\n### Statement 2\n\"If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G then \\( aH = bH \\) if and only if \\( ab \\) is in H.\"\n\n- **If \\( aH = bH \\):** This means that every element in \\( aH \\) is also in \\( bH \\) and vice versa. This implies that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are related in a way that \\( a \\) can be expressed as \\( b \\cdot h \\) for some \\( h \\in H \\). Thus, \\( a = b \\cdot h \\) implies \\( a^{-1} = h \\cdot b^{-1} \\).\n\n- **If \\( ab \\) is in H:** This means \\( ab \\) is an element of H. This implies that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are related in a way that their product is in H.\n\nHowever, \\( aH = bH \\) does not necessarily imply \\( ab \\) is in H. For example, consider \\( H = \\{ e \\} \\) ( the trivial subgroup, and \\( a = b \\). Then \\( aH = bH \\) but \\( ab = a \\) is not in H.\n\nThus, \\( aH = bH \\) does not necessarily imply \\( ab \\) is in H.\n\n### Conclusion\nStatement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is False.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
