A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following contributed the LEAST to the health and hunger problems faced by the French people in the seventeenth century?\n\nA. Low-productivity agricultural practices\nB. Adverse weather\nC. Low taxes on the peasants and middle class\nD. Poor transportation\n"

However, it can be inferred that poor weather could contribute to low agricultural productivity, which would exacerbate hunger problems.\n\n3. **Low taxes on the peasants and middle class**: The report does not provide any information about taxes or their impact on the health and hunger problems. It focuses more on the lack of food and the desperate measures taken by the people.\n\n4. **Poor transportation**: The report does not mention any issues related to transportation. It focuses on the local conditions and the immediate lack of food and resources.\n\nGiven the information provided, the option that contributed the LEAST to the health and hunger problems faced by the French people in the seventeenth century is:\n\n**C. Low taxes on the peasants and middle class**\n\nThis option is not mentioned in the report and does not seem to be directly related to the described conditions of famine and hunger."
