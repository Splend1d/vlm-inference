                    "text": "To find the value of the investment after 10 years, we need to integrate the rate of change of the investment with respect to time. The rate of change of the investment is given by the function 320*e^(0.08t). Integrating this with respect to t, we get:\n\n\u222b320*e^(0.08t) dt = 320/(0.08) * e^(0.08t) + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find the value of C, we use the initial condition that the investment is $4000 when t = 0. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n320/(0.08) * e^(0.08*0) + C = 4000\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4000 = 4000 + C\n\nTherefore, C = 0. Now we can plug in t = 10 to find the value of the investment after 10 years:\n\n320/(0.08) * e^(0.08*10) = 4000 * e^(0.8)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that e^(0.8) is approximately 2.22554. Plugging this value in, we get:\n\n4000 * 2.22554 = $8,902\n\nTherefore, the value of the investment after 10 years is approximately $8,902, which corresponds to option B."
