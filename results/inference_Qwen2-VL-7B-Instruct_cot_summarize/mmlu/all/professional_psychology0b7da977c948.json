Let's analyze each option to determine which one is generally true:\n\nA. **Job satisfaction is not highly correlated with job performance**: This statement is generally true. Job satisfaction and job performance are often considered separate constructs. While there can be some overlap, they are not highly correlated. Factors that contribute to job satisfaction, such as work environment, relationships with colleagues, and personal growth opportunities, do not necessarily align with performance metrics like productivity or efficiency.\n\nB. **Job satisfaction seems to increase considerably with an increase in wages**: This statement is not generally true. While higher wages can contribute to job satisfaction, it is not a strong predictor. Other factors such as job security, work-life balance, and opportunities for personal growth are often more significant determinants of job satisfaction.\n\nC. **Job satisfaction is higher in groups that do not have to assume responsibility**: This statement is generally false. Job satisfaction is often higher in groups where individuals have a sense of responsibility and autonomy. People tend to feel more engaged and satisfied when they have control over their work and can make decisions that impact their job.\n\nD. **Job satisfaction tends to decrease steadily as tenure on a job increases**: This statement is generally false. While it is common for job satisfaction to decrease over time due to factors like familiarity with the job, burnout, or lack of growth opportunities, it is not a steady decrease. Many people find long-term jobs satisfying and fulfilling, especially if they have opportunities for advancement or personal growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the most generally true statement is:\n\n**A. is not highly correlated with job performance**"
