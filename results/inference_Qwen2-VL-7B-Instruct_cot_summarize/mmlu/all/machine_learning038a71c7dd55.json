                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement individually:\n\n**Statement 1:**\nThe kernel density estimator is equivalent to performing kernel regression with the value Yi = 1/n at each point Xi in the original data set.\n\n- **Kernel Density Estimation (** Kernel density estimation (is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It uses a kernel function to smooth out the data points and estimate the density at different points in the space.\n- **Kernel Regression:** Kernel regression is a non-parametric technique for regression analysis. It uses a kernel function to smooth out the data points and estimate the regression function at different points in the space.\n\nWhile both kernel density estimation and kernel regression use kernels, they are fundamentally different techniques. Kernel density estimation is used for estimating the probability density function, whereas kernel regression is used for estimating the regression function. Therefore, the statement is not true.\n\n**Statement 2:**\nThe depth of a learned decision tree can be larger than the number of training examples used to create the tree.\n\n- **Decision Trees:** In machine learning, decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The depth of a decision tree refers to the number of nodes from the root node to the leaf node.\n- **Depth Limitations:** In practice, the depth of a decision tree is often limited to prevent overfittingting. However, it is possible to construct a decision tree with a depth greater than the number of training examples if the tree is grown without pruning. This can happen if the tree is allowed to grow until it reaches a maximum depth or a stopping criterion is not met.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nC. True, False"
