This fallacy is often committed by attacking the person making the argument rather than the argument itself.\n\nLet's analyze each option to determine which best fits this description:\n\nA. **Assertinging an argumentative opponent has taken an easily defeated position, which the opponent has not really taken, defeating the position, and acting as if you've done significant damage to that person's overall argument.**\n   - This option describes attacking an argument by ignoring or dismissing the refutation of that argument. It fits the definition of the fallacy of ignorance of refutation.\n\nB. **Causing confusion during refutation because of a real or feigned lack of the ability to engage in refutation.**\n   - This option describes a lack of ability to engage in refutation, which is not the same as attacking the argument by ignoring its refutation.\n\nC. **Characterize an opposing argument in such a way to make it or its consequences appear to be ridiculous.**\n   - This option describes attacking the argument by making it or its consequences appear ridiculous, which is a form of ad hominem or strawman fallacy, not ignorance of refutation.\n\nD. **Arguing an action should be taken based only on the need to be loyal to someone or to a group.**\n   - This option describes an appeal to loyalty or group affiliation, which is an appeal to emotion rather than attacking the argument by ignoring its refutation.\n\nTherefore, the option that best fits the fallacy of ignorance of refutation is:\n\n**A. asserting an argumentative opponent has taken an easily defeated position, which the opponent has not really taken, defeating the position, and acting as if you've done significant damage to that person's overall argument.**"
