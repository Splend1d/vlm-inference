During the past 3 days, she also has noticed a change in her voice and has had increased pain with swallowing. She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began. Medical history is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are temperature 40.0\u00b0C (104.0\u00b0F), pulse 130/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 102/66 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination of the oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There is a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is noted. Palpation of the neck discloses enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\nA. Incision and drainage\nB. Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy\nC. Oral nystatin therapy\nD. Salt water gargle\n"

Incision and drainage\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including a sore throat, fever, change in voice, increased pain with swallowing, and trismus, along with the examination findings of erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate, suggest a possible streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis. The presence of a white exudate on the right tonsil supports this diagnosis. The enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes are also consistent with the regional lymphadenopathy often seen with streptococcal infections.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most appropriate initial management would be to start antibiotic therapy. The choice of antibiotic would depend on the local resistance patterns and the patient's history of antibiotic use. However, the most immediate and appropriate intervention is to perform incision and drainage of any abscesses or pus collections that may have formed, which can help alleviate the pain and swelling.\n\nIntravenous methylprednisolone therapy ( (B) is not typically indicated for streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis, as it is more commonly used for conditions like rheumatic fever or severe allergic reactions. Oral nystatin therapy ( (C) is used for fungal infections of the mouth and throat, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Salt water gargles ( (D) can provide symptomatic relief but are not a substitute for antibiotic therapy or incision and drainage.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate management is to perform incision and drainage of any abscesses or pus collections, followed by appropriate antibiotic therapy."
