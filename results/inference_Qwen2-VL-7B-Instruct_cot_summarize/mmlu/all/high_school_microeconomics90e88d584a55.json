P or wage rate of labor < MRP of labor and with one additional unit of labor, wage rate > MRP.\n\nThis statement refers to the concept of marginal revenue product ( (MRP) and marginal factor cost ( (MFC) in microeconomics. The MRP of labor is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more unit of labor, while the MFC of labor is the additional cost of hiring one more unit of labor. The optimal level of labor input is achieved when the MRP of labor equals the MFC of labor. If the wage rate of labor is less than the MRP of labor, hiring more labor will increase the firm's profits. If the wage rate of labor is greater than the MRP of labor, hiring more labor will decrease the firm's profits. Therefore, the firm should hire labor up to the point where the wage rate of labor equals the MRP of labor."
