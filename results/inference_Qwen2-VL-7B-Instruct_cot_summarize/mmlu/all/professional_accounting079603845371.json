                    "text": "The doctrine of substantial performance is a legal principle that allows a party to accept a contractually required service even if there are minor deviations from the contract terms, provided the work is substantially performed. Let's analyze each option to determine which one correctly illustrates this doctrine:\n\nA. Blair ordered a dozen blue chairs from Kyle but Kyle delivered a dozen red chairs.\n- This scenario involves a complete failure to meet the contract terms, as Kyle delivered the wrong color of chairs. This does not illustrate substantial performance.\n\nB. Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on.\n- Leslie completed the painting of the room, which is the main task, but failed to perform a minor additional task (putting back the electrical outlet covers. This scenario involves a minor deviation from the contract terms, which could potentially illustrate substantial performance if the main task was substantially performed.\n\nC. A contract required hair styling to be done to Toby's satisfaction but Toby was in good faith dissatisfied with the completed result.\n- Toby's dissatisfaction with the result does not necessarily mean that the hair styling was not substantially performed. Toby's dissatisfaction could be due to personal preferences or other factors unrelated to substantial performance.\n\nD. A dentist competently completed the extraction of Lee's tooth but mistakenly pulled the wrong one.\n- The dentist completed the extraction competently, but the mistake of pulling the wrong tooth does not necessarily mean the extraction was not substantially performed. The mistake is a deviation from the specific task, but the main task of extraction was competently done.\n\nGiven the analysis, option B best illustrates the doctrine of substantial performance because Leslie completed the main task (painting the room, and the minor deviation (not putting back the electrical outlet covers is not a substantial failure to perform the main task.\n\nFinal answer: B. Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on."
