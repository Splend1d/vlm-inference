While walking home in the increasing darkness, Lizette notices that she can no longer distinguish the colors of objects. Which of the following best explains why Lizette cannot see color in dim light?\n\nA. Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nB. Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nC. Cones, which are specialized for black and white vision, require a small amount of light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in color, require greater amounts of light for vision.\nD. The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.\n"

Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- Cones are responsible for color vision and are more sensitive to light. They require more light to function, which means they are less effective in dim light conditions.\n- Rods, on the other hand, are responsible for black and white vision and are more sensitive to low light conditions. They allow for vision in dim light.\n\nTherefore, when it is dark, cones are less effective, and rods become more active, allowing for vision in black, white, and gray but not in color."
