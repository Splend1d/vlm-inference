In return, the owner promised to pay the gardener $2,400 upon completion of the job. Since a golf tournament was scheduled for the weekend of April 20 \u0080\u009421, the gardener agreed to replace all the sprinkler heads no later than April 19. Before accepting the job, the gardener had inspected the golf course and determined that 240 sprinkler heads had to be replaced. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 new sprinkler heads on the first six holes of the 18-hole golf course. That afternoon, however, the owner learned that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so he notified the gardener to discontinue the job. The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period. Also, the gardener's application for unemployment compensation was rejected at the same time. Which of the following statements, if found to be true, would provide the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener?\n\nA. The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt onApril 12.\nB. The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.\nC. The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.\nD. Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.\n"

Bankruptcy can be a valid reason for discharge under certain conditions, such as the inability to perform the contract due to financial incapacity. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12.**\n   - This statement directly addresses the gardener's financial incapacity, which is a critical factor in determining whether the gardener can fulfill the contract. Bankruptcy typically means the person is unable to pay their debts, which could include the obligation to complete the sprinkler installation.\n\nB. **The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.**\n   - While this indicates the progress made by the gardener, it does not provide a legal basis for discharge. The completion of the work is a matter of performance, not financial incapacity.\n\nC. **The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.**\n   - The form of the contract ( whether written or oral - does not provide grounds for discharge. Oral agreements can be legally binding, and the owner's grounds for discharge should be related to the gardener's ability to perform the contract, not the form of the agreement.\n\nD. **Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.**\n   - This the gardener refused to replace defective sprinkler heads, this could be grounds for breach of contract, but it does not directly address the gardener's financial incapacity.\n\nGiven the context and the legal implications, the most relevant statement that provides legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener is:\n\n**A. The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12.**\n\nThis statement directly addresses the gardener's financial incapacity, which is a critical factor in determining whether the gardener can fulfill the contract."
