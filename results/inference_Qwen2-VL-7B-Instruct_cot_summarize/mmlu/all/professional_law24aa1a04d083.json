The action turned on the scope of the work covered by the contract. The contractor and the homeowner were the only witnesses at the bench trial, and they strongly disagreed about the scope of the work. At the end of the trial, the judge stated findings of fact on the record but never issued a written opinion. Neither party objected to the findings. The judge found in favor of the homeowner, and the contractor appealed. Is the appellate court likely to overturn the findings?\n\nA. No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.\nB. No, because the contractor failed to object to the findings when the judge stated them in open court.\nC. Yes, because a judge must set forth findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum of decision.\nD. Yes, because there were disputed issues of fact at trial.\n"

No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### A. No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.\nThis option is the most accurate. The principle of \"due regard\" means that the appellate court should not lightly overturn findings of fact made by the trial judge, especially when the judge has had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and assess their credibility. In this case, the judge made findings of fact on the record, and neither party objected. This suggests that the judge's findings were based on a thorough examination of the witnesses and the evidence presented.\n\n#### B. No, because the contractor failed to object to the findings when the judge stated them in open court.\nThis option is incorrect because the failure to object does not automatically mean that the findings are unreviewable. The appellate court can still consider the findings if they are supported by the evidence and the judge's opportunity to observe the witnesses.\n\n#### C. Yes, because a judge must set forth findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum of decision.\nThis option is incorrect because the requirement for a written opinion or memorandum of decision applies to the issuance of a written opinion or memorandum, not to the making of findings of fact on the record. The judge's opportunity to observe the witnesses and the evidence presented still supports the findings.\n\n#### D. Yes, because there were disputed issues of fact at trial.\nThis option is incorrect because the presence of disputed issues of fact does not necessarily mean that the findings are unreviewable. The appellate court can still review the findings if they are supported by the evidence and the judge's opportunity to observe the witnesses.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is A, as it correctly reflects the principle that the appellate court should give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility."
