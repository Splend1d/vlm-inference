The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor \"only when expressly accepted by the distributor.\" For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.\nB. No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.\nC. Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.\nD. Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.\n"

Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Negotiated Agreement**: The parties initially agreed that orders would be \"expressly accepted by the distributor.\" This indicates that the distributor had discretion over whether to accept orders.\n\n2. **Course of Performance**: Over the next two years, the distributor consistently filled the retailer's orders. This consistent behavior establishes a course of performance that can be considered as a binding agreement between the parties.\n\n3. **Third Year's Incident**: In the third year, the distributor refused to fill an order, citing the retailer's claim of overcharging. However, the distributor's refusal to fill the order does not negate the established course of dealing.\n\n4. **Legal Principle**: In contract law, a course of dealing can create a binding obligation even if the initial agreement is ambiguous. The consistent practice of filling orders over a period of time can be seen as a binding agreement, especially when the distributor has not previously refused to fill orders.\n\nGiven these points, the retailer's practice of overcharging customers does not excuse the distributor's obligation to fill the order, as the course of dealing has already established a binding agreement. Therefore, the retailer is likely to prevail in a breach of contract lawsuit against the distributor."
