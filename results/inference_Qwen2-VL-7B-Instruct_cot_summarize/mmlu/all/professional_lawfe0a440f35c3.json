Testimony concerning subsequent repairs to the truck paid for by the truck truck company where they have stipulated to ownership.\n\nThis evidence is relevant to the plaintiff's claim of damages and is directly related to the accident. It is also likely to be admissible because it is a direct consequence of the accident and the truck company's involvement.\n\nThe other options are less likely to be admitted:\n\nB. Color pictures of a plastic surgeon operating on the plaintiff showing the incision and bloody surgical tools.\n- This evidence is more likely to be considered as hearsay or irrelevant to the case, as it does not directly relate to the accident or the plaintiff's injuries.\n\nC. Testimony from the plaintiff's boss concerning the amount of time she has missed work, when payroll records had already been admitted as evidence of the plaintiff's lost wages.\n- This evidence is likely to be considered as redundant, as payroll records have already been admitted to prove lost wages.\n\nD. Testimony of a surprise witness to the accident when the court is willing to grant the truck truck company a continuance to prepare for crossexamination.\n- This evidence is likely to be considered as prejudicial or irrelevant, as it may be seen as an attempt to introduce new evidence at the last minute."
