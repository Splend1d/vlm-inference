Most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives.\n\nThis statement is consistent with current research findings that suggest a gender gap in household responsibilities, where men are less likely to share equally in housework and childcare when their wives are employed outside the home. This highlights a persistent imbalance in domestic responsibilities, which is a significant area of focus in studies of gender roles and the workplace."
