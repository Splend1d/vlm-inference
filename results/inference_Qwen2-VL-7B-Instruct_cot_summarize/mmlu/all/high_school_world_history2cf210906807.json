The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nWhich of the following historical developments from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. most inspired the instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph to boycott foreign cloth?\n\nA. The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires\nB. The development of joint-stock companies\nC. The importation of food crops from the New World\nD. The African slave trade\n"

This is a call for self-sufficiency and the promotion of domestic production over foreign imports. This is a direct reference to the Swadeshi movement, which was a key part of the Indian independence movement.\n\nThe Swadeshi movement was a response to the economic policies of the British colonial government, which encouraged the importation of goods and discouraged the production of domestic goods. The movement aimed to promote the use of Indian-made goods and to reduce the country's dependence on foreign imports.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires - This is not relevant to the context of the Swadeshi movement, which was primarily a response to British colonial policies.\n\nB. The development of joint-stock companies - while this was a significant economic development, it does not directly relate to the specific call to boycott foreign cloth and promote domestic production.\n\nC. The importation of food crops from the New World - This is also related to the economic policies of the British colonial government, which encouraged the importation of goods and discouraged the production of domestic goods. This is relevant to the context of the Swadeshi movement.\n\nD. The African slave trade - This is not relevant to the context of the Swadeshi movement, which was primarily a response to British colonial policies.\n\nGiven the context and the specific call to boycott foreign cloth, the most relevant historical development from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. that inspired the instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph is:\n\nC. The importation of food crops from the New World"
