Let's analyze the growth rate of \\( f(N) \\).\n\nThe recurrence relation suggests that \\( f(N) \\) grows linearly with \\( N \\) and logarithmically with \\( N \\). Specifically, the growth is dominated by the sum of logarithms of \\( N \\).\n\nTo find the upper bound, we can use the fact that the sum of logarithms grows slower than a polynomial of \\( N \\). The sum of logarithms of \\( N \\) is \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\log k \\), which is \\( O(n \\log n) \\) as \\( n \\) grows.\n\nTherefore, the best upper bound for \\( f(N) \\) is:\n\n\\[ O(N \\log N) \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\( O(N \\log N) \\)"
