Until now, the patient's postoperative course had been unremarkable and he has been treated with low-dose morphine for pain control. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and diet. Vital signs now are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 80/min and regular, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling. The left lower extremity and foot appear pale. Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse, a weak popliteal pulse, and a cool, pulseless foot. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\nA. Bedside compartment pressure measurements\nB. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity\nC. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy\nD. Intraoperative angiography\n"

Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity\n\nDoppler ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to assess blood flow in the arteries and veins of the lower extremities. It can help to identify any blockages or narrowing of the arteries, which could be causing the decreased blood flow to the foot. This would be a good initial step to determine the cause of the decreased blood flow and pain in the foot."
