Specifically, we need to find the minimum number of yes/no questions required to uniquely identify any number in this range.\n\nMary can use a binary search strategy to minimize the number of questions. Here's how the strategy works:\n\n1. **Divide the range in half**: Start by asking a question that divides the range in half. For example, if Bob has written down a number between 1 and 1,000, Mary can ask if the number is less than 500 ( (Is the number less than 500?).\n\n2. **Continue dividing**: Based on Bob's answer, Mary can further divide the remaining range in half. If Bob says \"yes,\" Mary now knows the number is between 1 and 500. If Bob says \"no,\" the number is between 501 and 1,000.\n\n3. **Repeat the process**: Continue asking questions that divide the remaining range in half until Mary has identified the number.\n\nLet's calculate the number of questions required:\n\n- The first question divides the range into 2 parts.\n- The second question divides the remaining range into 2 parts.\n- The third question divides the remaining range into 2 parts.\n- ...\n- The \\(n\\)th question divides the remaining range into 2 parts.\n\nThis process continues until the range is reduced to 1. The number of questions required is the smallest integer \\(n\\) such that \\(2^n \\geq 1,000\\).\n\nWe can calculate this as follows:\n- \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n- \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n- \\(2^5 = 32\\)\n- \\(2^6 = 64\\)\n- \\(2^7 = 128\\)\n- \\(2^8 = 256\\)\n- \\(2^9 = 512\\)\n- \\(2^{10} = 1024\\)\n\nSince \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 1,000, Mary will need 10 questions in the worst case to identify the number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 10"
