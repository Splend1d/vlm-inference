Midterm elections typically have lower voter turnout compared to presidential elections, which are more high-profile and often attract more voters.\n\nB. **Voters lacking party affiliation tend to vote less regularly than those with strong party affiliation.**\n   - This statement is also generally true. Voters with strong party affiliations tend to vote more regularly because they have a clear preference and are more likely to be motivated by party loyalty.\n\nC. **Young adults are less likely to vote than senior citizens.**\n   - This statement is generally true. Young adults often have lower voter turnout compared to senior citizens, who are more likely to vote due to a longer history of voting and a stronger sense of civic duty.\n\nD. **Individuals are more likely to vote when they believe they know which candidate will win an election.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. While some individuals might be more motivated to vote if they believe they can influence the outcome, many people vote for a variety of reasons, including personal beliefs, party affiliation, and civic duty, regardless of their confidence in the outcome.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is least true is:\n\n**D. Individuals are more likely to vote when they believe they know which candidate will win an election.**"
