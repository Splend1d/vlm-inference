It hinges on whether an action directly causes death or merely fails to prevent it.

Passive euthanasia, on the other hand, involves withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, allowing death to occur naturally.\n\nTherefore, the morally relevant distinction here is:\n\nC. active/passive euthanasia"
