I have neither the desire nor the authority to judge today's generation for the unspeakable crimes committed by the generation of Hitler.\nBut we may\u2014and we must\u2014hold it responsible, not for the past, but for the way it remembers the past. And for what it does with the memory of the past. In remembering, you will help your own people vanquish the ghosts that hover over its history. Remember: a community that does not come to terms with the dead will continue to traumatize the living.\nWe remember Auschwitz and all that it symbolizes because we believe that, in spite of the past and its horrors, the world is worthy of salvation; and salvation, like redemption, can be found only in memory.\nElie Wiesel, \"Reflections of a Survivor,\" 1987\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Wiesel asserted that remembering the Holocaust\n\nA. was necessary for the German people to become reconciled to their own history\nB. hindered the healing process for the German people\nC. would ensure that it never occurred again\nD. would allow the Jews to forgive the German people\n"

Elie Wiesel emphasizes that remembering the Holocaust is crucial for the German people to come to terms with their history and to help their own people vanquish the ghosts that hover over its history.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"was necessary for the German people to become reconciled to their own history\" - This aligns with the passage, as Wiesel suggests that remembering the Holocaust helps the German people come to terms with their history.\n   - **Option B**: \"hinder hinder the healing process for the German people\" - This is not supported by the passage. Wiesel does not suggest that remembering the Holocaust hinders the healing process.\n   - **Option C**: \"would ensure that it never occurred again\" - The passage does not mention anything about ensuring that the Holocaust never occurs again. It focuses on the importance of remembering it.\n   - **Option D**: \"would allow the Jews to forgive the German people\" - While the passage mentions the importance of remembering the Holocaust for the German people, it does not directly address the forgiveness aspect in relation to the Jews.\n\n4. **Conclude with a clear answer**: Based on the analysis, the most accurate inference from the passage is that remembering the Holocaust was necessary for the German people to become reconciled to their own history.\n\n**Final Answer**: A. was necessary for the German people to become reconc reconciled to their own history"
