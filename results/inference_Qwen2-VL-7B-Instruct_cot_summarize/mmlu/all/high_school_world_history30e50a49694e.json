Let her not refuse to perform domestic duties whether easy or difficult. That which must be done, let her finish completely, tidily, and systematically, When a woman follows such rules as these, then she may be said to be industrious.\nLet a woman be correct in manner and upright in character in order to serve her husband. Let her live in purity and quietness of spirit, and attend to her own affairs. Let her love not gossip and silly laughter. Let her cleanse and purify and arrange in order the wine and the food for the offerings to the ancestors. When a woman observes such principles as these, then she may be said to continue ancestral worship.\nNo woman who observes these three fundamentals of life has ever had a bad reputation or has fallen into disgrace. If a woman fail to observe them, how can her name be honored; how can she but bring disgrace upon herself?\"\n\u00a9 The East Asian Library and the Gest Collection, Princeton University.\nBan Zhao, Lessons for a Woman, ca. 80 C.E.\nWhich theme in the passage was common in patriarchal ancient societies?\n\nA.

It discusses three key areas:\n1. **Industriousness**: This involves performing domestic duties diligently and systematically.\n2. **Ancestral worship**: This involves living in purity and quietness, attending to her own affairs, and performing rituals correctly.\n3. **Purity**: This involves not gossiping or silly laughter, and maintaining a clean and orderly environment.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The importance of attending to the affairs of others**: This is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. The focus is on the woman's own actions and reputation, not on her responsibilities towards others.\n\nB. **The importance of ancestor worship**: This is mentioned as one of the three key areas, but it is not the central theme. The passage emphasizes the woman's personal conduct and reputation.\n\nC. **The importance of systematically arranging wine**: This is not a central theme. The passage does not focus on the arrangement of wine but rather on the woman's overall behavior and reputation.\n\nD. **The importance of female purity**: This is a central theme. The passage repeatedly emphasizes the importance of purity in a woman's character and actions, which is a common theme in patriarchal societies.\n\nGiven this analysis, the theme common in patriarchal ancient societies as described in the passage is:\n\n**D. The importance of female purity**."
