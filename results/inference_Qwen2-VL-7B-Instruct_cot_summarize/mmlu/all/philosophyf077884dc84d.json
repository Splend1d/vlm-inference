By apprehending general principles, and then inferring the prima facie rightness of of particular acts.\n\nPrima facie duties are moral obligations that are initially considered to be binding, but which may be overridden by other duties in certain circumstances. Ross argues that we learn about these duties by first understanding general moral principles and then applying these principles to specific situations to determine whether a particular act is prima facie right or wrong."
