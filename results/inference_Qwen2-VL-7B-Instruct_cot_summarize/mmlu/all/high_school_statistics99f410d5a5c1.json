About 95% of polls conducted in this way will give a sample proportion within 3.2 percentage points of the actual proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing.\n\nThis interpretation is based on the concept of a confidence interval. The margin of error (\u00b13.2% at a 95% level of confidence means that if we were to conduct many more polls using the same method, about 95% of those polls would produce results that fall within the range of 43% \u00b1 3.2%. This range is known as the confidence interval, which gives us an estimate of the uncertainty around the sample proportion."
