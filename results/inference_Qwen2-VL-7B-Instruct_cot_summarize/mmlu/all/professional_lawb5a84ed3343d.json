She telephoned a roofer to inquire about having the necessary repairs done to her roof. The roofer agreed to finish the work within 30 days, and the homeowner promised to pay$10,000. Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. The performance of the roofer would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the homeowner.\nB. The performance by the homeowner would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the roofer.\nC. The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be constructive concurrent conditions.\nD. The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.\n"

The performance by the homeowner would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the roofer.\n\nThis is because the homeowner's payment is contingent upon the roofer completing the repair work within the specified time frame. The homeowner's payment is an implied condition subsequent to the roofer's performance, meaning that the homeowner's obligation to pay is dependent on the roofer's completion of the work."
