A boy and a girl, both 12-year-old youngsters at the bonanza, were looking at each other's cards when they were approached by a 32-year-old collector. The collector asked the boy and girl if he could look through their baseball cards. The boy and girl nodded affirmatively. As the collector was flipping through the boy's cards, he found a 1948 card featuring Branch Rickey, the former owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The collector, who knew the card was worth more than $500, offered the boy 50 cents for the card. The boy thought the card had very little value because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player. The boy accepted the 50 cents and gave the Rickey baseball card to the collector. The next day the boy found out that the baseball card was worth$600. If the boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit, will the boy prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.\nB. Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\nC. No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.\nD. No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.\n"

No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.\n\nThe boy's claim against the collector would likely fail because the collector did not make any false representations of fact. The collector did not mislead the boy about the value of the card or the boy's ownership of it. The boy's assertion that the card was worth very little because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player does not constitute a false representation of fact. The boy accepted the 50 cents based on his own assessment of the card's value, not because of any misrepresentation by the collector."
