Hold the copper penny with crucible tongs, and heat strongly in the flame of a Bunsen burner.\n\nThis method is straightforward and requires minimal preparation. The copper penny can be held securely with crucible tongs, and the flame of a Bunsen burner is sufficient to heat the penny to the point where it will oxidize and turn black. The other methods involve more complex procedures, such as using an oxyacetylene torch for higher temperatures, grinding the penny into small particles, or dissolving the penny in acid and precipitating the hydroxide, which are more time-consuming and potentially hazardous."
