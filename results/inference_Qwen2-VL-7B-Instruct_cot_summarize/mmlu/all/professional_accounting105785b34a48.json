Maintain redundant systems for instant availability to assure the flow of transactions\n\nIn an e-commerce environment, where the IT system must be available on a continuous basis, the emphasis will be placed on maintaining redundant systems. This is because redundancy ensures that if one system fails, another system can take over immediately, minimizing downtime and ensuring that transactions can continue uninterrupted. This is crucial for e-commerce businesses, as downtime can lead to lost sales and customer dissatisfaction."
