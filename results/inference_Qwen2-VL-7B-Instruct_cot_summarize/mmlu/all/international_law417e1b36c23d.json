The conduct of any State organs shall be considered an act of that State, provided that it is intra vires.\n\nUnder international law, the acts of State organs are generally attributed to the State, provided that they are within the scope of the State's authority ( (i.e., intra vires). This principle is known as the doctrine of state responsibility. Acts that are ultra vires ( (i.e., beyond the scope of the State's authority) are not generally considered as acts of the State and may not give rise to international responsibility."
