From a US perspective, it is common to regard the main voice of security to be external. The question of what should or what should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security.\n- This statement highlights the difference in how security is conceptualized and prioritized. In the US, security is often seen as an external threat, focusing on external issues and how to respond to them. This contrasts with the European perspective, which may consider security issues from a broader, more internal and systemic viewpoint.\n\nB. The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.\n- This statement suggests that the European approach to theorizing is rooted in a hegemonic form of knowledge, emphasizing the understanding of causal mechanisms and their impact on the material world. This contrasts with the US approach, which may not necessarily prioritize causal mechanisms in the same way.\n\nC. The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.\n- This statement points out the difference in how knowledge is applied to policy. In the US, political science tends to focus on problem-solving and finding solutions to policy issues, while in Europe, critical studies may focus on analyzing and critiquing policy from a more critical perspective.\n\nD. Theorize has parallel theoretical forms of knowledge based on empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships.\n- This statement suggests that there are parallel theoretical forms of knowledge that are based on empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships. This implies that both sides of the Atlantic may share a common understanding of the importance of empirical evidence and cause-and-effect relationships in theorizing.\n\nIn summary, the differences in theorize on both sides of the Atlantic can be understood through the way security is conceptualized, the approach to knowledge and causal mechanisms, the relationship to policy, and the use of empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships."
