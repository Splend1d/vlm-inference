When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.\n\u2014Hymns excerpted and adapted from the Rig Veda, oldest surviving literary work, India, 1500\u20131000 BCE\nWhich of the following statements is supported by the information in the passage above?\n\nA. The caste system was a purely social construct that reflected its time period.\nB. The caste system was encouraged by regional princes to reinforce social stability.\nC. The caste system reinforced Indian identity in the face of Muslim invaders.\nD. The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras.\n"

This division is said to have been done during the performance of a sacrifice, and the resulting castes are associated with different aspects of the sacrifice and its offerings.\n\nGiven this information, the statement that is supported by the passage is:\n\nD. The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras.\n\nThis statement aligns with the passage's description of the caste system as a fundamental aspect of Hinduism, which is integral to the religion and has been a part of Hindu society for a long time."
