The recognition of foreign judgments is dependent on the existence of appropriate bilateral or multilateral treaties.\n\nForeign judgments are generally recognized and enforced in accordance with the principles of international law and the specific provisions of international treaties or agreements. These treaties often establish the conditions under which foreign judgments can be recognized and enforced within a particular jurisdiction. Without such treaties, the enforcement of foreign judgments may be subject to the discretion of the courts based on the principle of comity, which involves mutual respect and consideration between courts."
