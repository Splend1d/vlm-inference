                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement individually:\n\nStatement 1: PCA and Spectral Clustering (such as Andrew Ng\u2019s) perform eigendecomposition on two different matrices. However, the size of these two matrices are the same.\n\n- PCA ( (Principal Component Analysis) performs eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix or the correlation matrix of the data. The size of these matrices is \\( n \\times n \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of samples and \\( d \\) is the number of features.\n\n- Spectral Clustering, on the other hand, performs eigendecomposition on the graph Laplacian matrix. The size of this matrix is \\( n \\times n \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of samples and \\( d \\) is the number of features.\n\n- Both matrices are of the same size, \\( n \\times n \\).\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2: Since classification is a special case of regression, logistic regression is a special case of linear regression.\n\n- Logistic regression is a type of regression used for classification problems, where the output is binary or categorical. It is not a special case of linear regression. Linear regression is used for predicting a continuous outcome, while logistic regression is used for predicting a binary outcome.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is False.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. True, False"
