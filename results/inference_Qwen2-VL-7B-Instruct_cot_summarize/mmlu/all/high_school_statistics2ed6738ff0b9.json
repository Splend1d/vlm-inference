The probability of a Type II error does not depend on the probability of a Type I error.\n- This statement is incorrect. The probability of a Type II error ( (\u03b2) and the probability of a Type I error ( (\u03b1) are related in hypothesis testing. Specifically, \u03b2 depends on the sample size, the effect size, and the significance level \u03b1. Therefore, they are not independent.\n\nB. In conducting a hypothesis test, it is possible to simultaneously make both a Type I and a Type II error.\n- This statement is incorrect. In hypothesis testing, it is not possible to simultaneously make both a Type I and a Type II error. A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, while a Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly not rejected. These are mutually exclusive events.\n\nC. A Type II error will result if one incorrectly assumes the data are normally distributed.\n- This statement is incorrect. A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly not rejected, which is unrelated to the assumption about the distribution of the data. The assumption about the distribution affects the power of the test but not the Type II error directly.\n\nD. When you choose a significance level \u03b1, you're setting the probability of a Type I error to exactly \u03b1.\n- This statement is correct. The significance level \u03b1 is the threshold for the probability of a Type I error. When you set \u03b1, you are setting the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nD. When you choose a significance level \u03b1, you're setting the probability of a Type I error to exactly \u03b1."
