General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties.\n\nIn the hierarchy of sources of international law, General Principles of Law are considered to have the highest authority. These principles are derived from the legal reasoning and practices of states and are considered to be universally applicable. They are used to interpret and fill gaps in treaties and customary international law.\n\nTreaties and customary international law are also important sources of international law, but they are subject to the interpretation and application of General Principles of Law."
