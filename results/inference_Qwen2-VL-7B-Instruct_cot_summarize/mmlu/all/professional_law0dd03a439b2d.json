Later that same day, he approached a victim and, brandishing a knife, told her to accompany him or he would stab her. He led the victim to his car and then ordered her to disrobe. As the victim was removing her pantyhose, she kicked the defendant in the head, temporarily dazing him. The victim then safely ran from the car. The defendant is arrested and charged with the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape.\nB. A defendant attended a wedding reception at a hotel, where he drank several vodka daiquiris. Following the reception, the defendant engaged in a violent argument with the hotel's parking lot attendant. The defendant took a tire iron from his car and threw it at the attendant. The tire iron missed the attendant and hit a victim as he was entering the hotel. The defendant is arrested and charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.\nC. A defendant had been drinking liquor all evening at a bar with three of his buddies. An undercover detective overheard the defendant and his buddies plot to rob the bar after closing hours. When the defendant attempted to draw a gun from his coat, he was quickly disarmed and placed under arrest by the detective. The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery.\nD. At his law school graduation party, a defendant drank two six-packs of beer. Around midnight, the defendant was approached by a girl, who asked him to drive her home. Although the girl was only 15 years old, she had the appearance of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The defendant, who had had his eye on the girl all night, quickly agreed, and he showed her the way to his car. Once inside, they engaged in sexual intercourse. The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant is subsequently arrested and charged with statutory rape.\n"

The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant, who is 15 years old, is below the age of of consent. Therefore, regardless of the defendant's intoxication, his actions would still constitute statutory rape, and his intoxication would not negate his criminal culpability for this specific crime."
