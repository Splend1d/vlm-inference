It is an exothermic process due to the release of energy as an electron is liberated from the Coulombic attraction holding it to the nucleus.\nB. The entropy of the system increases due to the separation of the electron from its atom.\nC. Energy contained in the light can be used to overcome the Coulombic attraction between electrons and the nucleus.\nD. The products of the ionization are at a lower energy state than the reactants.\n"

Energy contained in the light can be used to overcome the Coulombic attraction between electrons and the nucleus.\n\nDuring photoelectron spectroscopy, light is used to excite electrons in an atom. The energy of the light is absorbed by the atom, which can be used to overcome the Coulombic attraction between the electrons and the nucleus, causing ionization. This process is not thermodynamically favored because it requires energy input, but it can occur if the energy of the light is sufficient."
