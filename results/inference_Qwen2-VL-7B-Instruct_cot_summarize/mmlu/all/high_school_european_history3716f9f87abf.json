Your Committee object to the words Household Suffrage since under any honest definition of the words\u2014they would exclude a large majority of the men of these kingdoms\u2014and because they have become reasonably obnoxious to the political portion of the working people.\n\u2014Excerpt of a letter from British social reformer Francis Place, written in 1842\nThe primary goal of the Chartist movement was which of the following?\n\nA.

It also mentions that the Chartist movement has become \"reasonably obnoxious to the political portion of the working people.\"\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the Chartist movement was primarily concerned with political and social issues affecting the working class. The mention of \"Household Suffrage\" and the exclusion of a large majority of men from this suffrage suggests that the movement was focused on extending voting rights to all men, not just those who were considered \"working men.\"\n\nGiven this context, the primary goal of the Chartist movement was:\n\nB. Universal male suffrage"
