In many cases, phenotype is not merely determined by genotype, but by the environment as well.\n\nThis option highlights the complexity of the relationship between genotype ( (the genetic makeup) and phenotype ( (the observable characteristics) in living organisms. The environment plays a significant role in shaping the phenotype, which can influence the effectiveness of skeletal structures in mammals. \n\nFor example, the forelimbs of horses, whales, and bats have evolved to serve different functions based on their environments. Horses have evolved strong, sturdy limbs for running, whales have evolved streamlined bodies for swimming, and bats have evolved wings for flight. These adaptations are influenced by the environmental pressures each species faces, such as terrain, climate, and the need for efficient movement or flight.\n\nTherefore, the actual forelimbs of these mammals may not seem to be optimally arranged because the environment has played a significant role in shaping their structure and function, leading to adaptations that may not be the most efficient from a purely genetic standpoint."
