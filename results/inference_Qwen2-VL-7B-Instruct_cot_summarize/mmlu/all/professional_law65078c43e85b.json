Her friends warned her against wearing such valuable jewelry because they feared she would be an easy target for muggers. In order to persuade the woman not to wear her expensive jewelry in the park, her friend decided to play a practical joke. One morning, the friend dressed like a man and hid in an area of the park that she knew the woman customarily walked through. As the woman was strolling through the park with her dog that morning, the friend jumped out from behind the bush brandishing a toy pistol and grabbed the woman's diamond necklace from her neck. Startled, the woman became hysterical and began to plead for her life. The friend then removed her male garb, handed the necklace back to the woman and said, \"I just wanted to frighten you to teach you a lesson. \"If the friend is subsequently prosecuted, she should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Battery.\nB. Assault.\nC. Robbery.\nD. No crime.\n"

                    "text": "The friend's actions can be analyzed based on the legal definitions of the crimes listed:\n\nA. **Battery**: This crime involves the intentional and unlawful application of force or violence to another person. The friend did not apply force or violence to the woman; she merely frightened her.\n\nB. **Assault**: Assault involves the intentional and unlawful threat of imminent harm. The friend did not threaten imminent harm; she merely frightened the woman.\n\nC. **Robbery**: Robbery involves the use or threat of force or violence to obtain property from another person. The friend did not use or threaten force or violence to obtain the necklace; she merely frightened the woman.\n\nD. **No crime**: This option suggests that the friend did not commit any crime. However, the friend's actions do not fit neatly into any of the listed crimes, but they do involve an illegal act.\n\nGiven the context, the friend's actions can be considered as a form of **assault**. Assault is the unlawful threat of imminent harm, and the friend's actions certainly involved an unlawful threat to the woman's safety.\n\nTherefore, the friend should be found guilty of **assault**. \n\n**Final Answer: B. Assault.**"
