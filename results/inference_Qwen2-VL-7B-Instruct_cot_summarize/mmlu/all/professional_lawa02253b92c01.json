A church in a city located in the state wanted to acquire larger facilities for its school. The city's school board proposed a new state law that would authorize it to sell a vacant public school building, at a price below its fair market value, to the church for use as its school. If enacted, would this law be constitutional?\n\nA. No, because a statute specially authorizing the sale of the building without competitive bidding would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nC. Yes, because surplus government property is not subject to the limitations imposed by the establishment clause as incorporated into the establishment clause as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. Yes, because the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church.\n"

Yes, because surplus government property is not subject to the limitations imposed by the establishment clause as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the government from establishing a religion or favoringing one religion over another. However, the clause does not apply to the actions of private parties or to the use of government property by private parties. \n\nIn this case, the sale of the vacant public school building to the church for use as its school would not be considered an establishment of religion because the property is surplus government property. The sale would not be a government action but rather a private transaction between the city's school board and the church. Therefore, the sale would not violate the Establishment Clause.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law does not violate the equal protection clause since it is not a discriminatory law.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the transfer of the building to the church would not constitute an establishment of religion since it is not a government action.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church since it is not a government action."
