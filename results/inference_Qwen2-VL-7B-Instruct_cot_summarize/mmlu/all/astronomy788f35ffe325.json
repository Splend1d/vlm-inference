The mass distribution in the solar nebula was as follows:\n\n1. **Light gases (H He)**: These are the most abundant elements in the solar nebula, comprising about 99.9% of its mass. Hydrogen (H and helium (He) are the most abundant elements in the universe.\n\n2. **Hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3)**: These are the next most abundant components, making up about 0.1% of the nebula's mass. These compounds include water (H2O, methane CH4, and ammonia NH3.\n\n3. **Metals**: These are the heavy elements that make up the rocky planets and asteroids. They are less abundant than hydrogen and hydrogen compounds but more abundant than rocks.\n\n4. **Rocks**: These are the solid materials that make up the terrestrial planets. They are the least abundant component of the solar nebula.\n\nSo, the correct order from highest to lowest percentage of mass in the solar nebula is:\n\n1. Light gases (H He)\n2. Hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3)\n3. Metals\n4. Rocks"
