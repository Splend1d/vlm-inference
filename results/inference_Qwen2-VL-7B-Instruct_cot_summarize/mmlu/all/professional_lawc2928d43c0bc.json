The man has \u00d2Beware of Dogs\u00d3 signs clearly posted around a fenced-in yard where he keeps the dogs. The man\u00d5s next-door neighbor frequently walks past the man\u00d5s house and knows about the dogs\u00d5 ferocity. One summer day, the neighbor entered the man\u00d5s fenced-in yard to retrieve a snow shovel that the man had borrowed during the past winter. The neighbor was attacked by one of the dogs and was severely injured. In a suit against the man, is the neighbor likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor knew that the man had dan-gerous dogs in the yard.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing when he entered the man\u00d5s property.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor was an invitee for the pur-pose of retrieving the shovel.\nD. Yes, because the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

Yes, because the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\n\nIn this scenario, the man is engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by keeping four trained German shepherd dogs that are potentially dangerous and could cause harm to others. The fact that the neighbor knew about the dogs' ferocity and the \"Beware of Dogs\" sign does not negate the man's liability. The neighbor was an invitee for the purpose of retrieving the shovel, which means the man had a duty to ensure the safety of the invitee. The neighbor's injury was caused by the man's abnormally dangerous activity, and therefore, the neighbor is likely to prevail in the suit against the man."
