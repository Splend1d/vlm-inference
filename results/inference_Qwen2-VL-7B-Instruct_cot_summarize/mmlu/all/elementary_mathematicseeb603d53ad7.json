Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector.\n\nGiven that there are 7 desks in total, we can start by placing Kim in the first position (since there are no seats to the left of the first desk.\n\nLet's denote the desks as follows, starting from the left:\n1. Kim\n2. Hector\n3. Tonya\n4. Desk 4\n5. Desk 5\n6. Desk 6\n7. Desk 7\n\nNow, let's analyze the positions based on the given information:\n\n- Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim. Since Kim is in the first position, Hector is in the third position.\n- Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector. Since Hector is in the third position, Tonya is in the sixth position.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many seats to the left of Tonya Kim sits. Since Tonya is in the sixth position and Kim is in the first position, Kim sits 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 5"
