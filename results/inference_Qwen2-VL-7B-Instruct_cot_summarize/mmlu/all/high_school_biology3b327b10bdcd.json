Which of the following correctly states which phase of cellular respiration harvests the most energy and the correct explanation why?\n\nA. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.\nB. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively.\nC. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\nD. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2.\n"

The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\n\nExplanation: During oxidative phosphorylation, the energy released from the oxidation of NADH and FADH is used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient is then used by ATP synthase to generate ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process is highly efficient and can produce up to 30 ATPs per NADH and 2 ATPs per FADH2, making it the phase of cellular respiration that harvests the most energy."
