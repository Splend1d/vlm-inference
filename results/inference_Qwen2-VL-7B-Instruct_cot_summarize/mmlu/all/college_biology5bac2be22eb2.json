The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\n\nThe gray crescent is a region of the amphibian zygote that contains a high concentration of yolk and other nutrients. When the first cleavage plane is manipulated so that the gray crescent is contained in only one of the two blastomeres, that blastomere will receive a higher nutrient supply. This blastomere will grow in size more quickly and will have a higher chance of developing into a complete embryo, albeit smaller than a normal embryo due to the reduced nutrient supply. The other blastomere, without the gray crescent, will receive less nutrients and will likely develop into a smaller embryo or may not develop properly at all."
