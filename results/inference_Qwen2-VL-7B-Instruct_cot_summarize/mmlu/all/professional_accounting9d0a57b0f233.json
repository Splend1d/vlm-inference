Since the expected award is $70,000, which is over $20,000, we apply the 40% contingency fee on the excess amount:\n\\[ \\text{Contingency Fee} = (70,000 - 20,000 \\times 0.40 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Contingency Fee} = 50,000 \\times 0.40 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Contingency Fee} = 20,000 \\]\n\nThe total expected value to Smith is the sum of the retainer fee, the expected award, and the contingency fee:\n\\[ \\text{Total Expected Value} = \\text{Retainer Fee} + \\text{Expected Award} + \\text{Contingency Fee} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Expected Value} = 20,000 + 70,000 + 20,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Expected Value} = 110,000 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation does not account for the out-of-pocket expenditures of $15,000. We need to subtract this from the total expected value:\n\\[ \\text{Adjusted Expected Value} = \\text{Total Expected Value} - \\text{Out-of-Pocket Expenditures} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Adjusted Expected Value} = 110,000 - 15,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Adjusted Expected Value} = 95,000 \\]\n\nNone of the provided options match the calculated adjusted expected value of $95,000.
