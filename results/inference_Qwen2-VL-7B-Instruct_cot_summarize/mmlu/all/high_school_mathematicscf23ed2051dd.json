                    "text": " Let's denote the width of the rectangle as $w$ and the length as $l$. According to the problem, the length is twice the width, so we can write $l = 2w$.\n\nThe diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the width and length. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of of the diagonal is equal to the sum of the squares of the width and length. So we can write the equation as $l^2 + w^2 = (^2$.\n\nSubstituting $l = 2w$ into the equation, we get $(2w)^2 + w^2 = (^2$, which simplifies to $4w^2 + w^2 = 5^2$, or $5w^2 = 25$.\n\nSolving for $w$, we get $w^2 = 5$, so $w = \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nSubstitute $w = \\sqrt{5}$ into $l = 2w$, we get $l = 2\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width, so the area of this rectangle is $l \\times w = 2\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 2 \\times 5 = 10$.\n\nHowever, it seems there's a mistake in the calculation.
