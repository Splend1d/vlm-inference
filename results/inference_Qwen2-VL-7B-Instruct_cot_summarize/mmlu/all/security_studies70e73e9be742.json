Within the context of state collapse, elites deliberately engender disorder for the pursuit of commercial activities and the exploitation of neo-liberal globalized shadow markets which would not otherwise be permissible in normal conditions. Warlord politics represented a new form of regime security forced upon weak state elites.\nB. Warlord politics represented the entrenchment of traditional patterns of redistributive networks within society but maintained by alternative political sources. Assistance derived from superpowers was superseded by US hegemonic endorsement at the end of the Cold War.\nC. Warlord politics in response to the rapid global changes inaugurated by the end of the Cold War and by globalization, was a temporary aberration in the normal function of the state and was reflective of the immediate need to secure infrastructural survival.\nD. Warlord politics was a new phenomenon which represented the opportunistic exploitation of hollowed out state institutions and fragmented armed forces. Commercial activities accumulated in a shadow economy facilitated by the end of the Cold War, not of strategic design.\n"

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent withdrawal of superpower support led to a vacuum in power and resources, which allowed for the emergence of warlord politics. This was not a new phenomenon, but rather a continuation of traditional patterns of power and control within society, but now maintained by alternative political sources. The end of the Cold War also led to the entrenchment of traditional patterns of redistributive networks within society, but these were now maintained by alternative political sources, such as warlords and other non-state actors. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
