Close to the top of the mountain, the friend fell off of his ski lift, and sustained injuries. The young man then decided he had had enough of skiing, but his friend called out, \"...you have to help! You have to call someone! I cant walk and it is your fault I am up here!\" The man did not respond and went home. His friend froze to death with no help ever coming to him. The people on the lift behind them both heard and saw everything, and the prosecutors office investigated the incident as a possible negligent homicide. What is the most likely decision of the prosecutor?\n\nA. The prosecutor will not file charges because the two men were not related to each other in a way that might create a duty, nor was there a special relationship that would create a duty.\nB. The prosecutor will not file charges because the man broke no laws when he walked away and it does not matter what the relationship was between them.\nC. The prosecutor will file charges because there are eyewitnesses who will testify to the young man's callous behavior to his friend.\nD. The prosecutor will file charges because their friendship was a special relationship that created a legal duty for the man to act.\n"

The prosecutor will file charges because their friendship was a special relationship that created a legal duty for the man to act.\n\nIn this scenario, the relationship between the two men can be considered a special relationship, which typically includes a duty of care to act reasonably to prevent harm to the other person. The fact that the young man called his friend to go skiing and was aware of the friend's injuries suggests that he had a duty to take reasonable steps to help his friend, especially given the friend's inability to walk. The prosecutor would likely consider the lack of response and the subsequent death as a failure to fulfill this duty, leading to charges of negligent homicide."
