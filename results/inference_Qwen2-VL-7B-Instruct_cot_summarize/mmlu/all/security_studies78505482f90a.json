The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.\nB. Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.\nC. Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.\nD. Neither Critical Security Studies nor the Copenhagen School account for the changing nature of society and its impact on the construction of security.\n"

Instead, it emphasizes the importance of understanding the social, political, and economic factors that shape security. It does not consider security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach, but rather as a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that is influenced by various social and political factors."
