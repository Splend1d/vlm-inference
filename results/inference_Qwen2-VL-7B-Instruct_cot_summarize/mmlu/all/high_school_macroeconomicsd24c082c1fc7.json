Higher spending, higher taxes, and lower the discount rate.\n\nTo fight a recessionary gap while avoiding large budget deficits, fiscal and monetary policymakers can use a combination of higher spending, higher taxes, and lowering the discount rate. This approach can help stimulate the economy without creating a large budget deficit.\n\nHigher spending can increase aggregate demand and boost economic growth. Higher taxes can help reduce the budget deficit and prevent the government from borrowing too much money. Loweringing the discount rate can increase the money supply and encourage borrowing and investment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
