Program evaluation questions are often identified through the needs of a program\u2019s staff and stakeholders, while traditional research questions are identified by researchers using previous, existing research.\n- This statement is true. Program evaluation is often driven by the needs and goals of the program itself, whereas traditional research questions are typically derived from existing literature and theoretical frameworks.\n\nB. Program evaluation uses unique quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect data. These methods are different from those that are used in traditional research.\n- This statement is true. Program evaluation often employs a variety of methods, including surveys, interviews, and observations, which may differ from the methods used in traditional research, such as experiments and controlled studies.\n\nC. Traditional research and program evaluation have different aims. Traditional research aims to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation aims to collect information important for timely decision-making.\n- This statement is true. Traditional research is often focused on advancing scientific knowledge and understanding, whereas program evaluation is geared towards informing and improving the effectiveness of specific programs.\n\nD. Both traditional research and program evaluation may incorporate rigorous and systematic ways of collecting data in order to address their aims.\n- This statement is true. Both traditional research and program evaluation use systematic and rigorous methods to collect data, ensuring that the findings are reliable and valid.\n\nUpon careful analysis, all the statements provided are true about the differences between traditional research and program evaluation. Therefore, there is no statement that is NOT true.\n\nFinal answer: None of the statements are NOT true."
