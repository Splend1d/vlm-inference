We can use the GDP deflator to do this. The GDP deflator for the United States in 1950 was around 10.5 ( and in 2011 it was around 1.0.\n   - The inflation rate from 1950 to 2011 can be calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Inflation Rate} = \\frac{\\text{GDP Deflator in 2011}}{\\text{GDP Deflator in 1950}} - 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Inflation Rate} = \\frac{1.0}{10.5} - 1 \\approx 0.09524 - 1 = -0.9048\n     \\]\n     This means the GDP per capita in 1950 needs to be adjusted for a 90.48% decrease in purchasing power due to inflation.\n\n3. **Adjust for PPP (**:\n   - The purchasing power parity (PPP) adjustment is not typically applied to GDP per capita in the same way as inflation. However, if we assume that the PPP adjustment is minimal or negligible for this context, we can focus on the inflation adjustment.\n\n4. **Calculate the adjusted GDP per capita in 2011 prices**:\n   - The adjusted GDP per capita in 2011 prices would be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Adjusted GDP per capita} = \\text{Nominal GDP per capita in 1950} \\times ( \\text{Inflation Rate}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Adjusted GDP per capita} = 3000 \\times 0.9048 \\approx 2714.4\n     \\]\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. About $3k\n- B. About $8k\n- C. About $15k\n- D. About $30k\n\nThe closest answer is:\n\n**B. About $8k**"
