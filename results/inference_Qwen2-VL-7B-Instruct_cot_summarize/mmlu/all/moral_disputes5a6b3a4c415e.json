This implies that the emotional response is a reflection of the moral stance on the issue.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Shows conclusively that reproductive cloning is always wrong.\n- This option is too absolute. While the feeling of repugnance might suggest a moral concern, it does not conclusively prove that cloning is always wrong. It could be a personal opinion rather than a universal moral stance.\n\nB. Shows conclusively that reproductive cloning is sometimes wrong.\n- This option is also too absolute. The feeling of repugnance does not necessarily mean that cloning is wrong sometimes; it could be a blanket condemnation.\n\nC. Has nothing to do with the morality of cloning.\n- This option is incorrect. The feeling of repugnance is directly related to the moral stance on cloning.\n\nD. Is a sign that something is wrong with reproductive cloning.\n- This option alignss with the idea that the emotional response indicates a moral concern. It suggests that the feeling of repugnance is a sign that cloning might be morally problematic.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nD. Is a sign that something is wrong with reproductive cloning."
