While undergoing an ECG, the patient says that he feels the chest pain returning. The most appropriate immediate treatment is a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action?\n\nA. Increases cAMP concentration\nB. Increases nitric oxide concentration\nC. Inhibits potassium flux\nD. Inhibits sodium flux\n"

Nitroglycerin is a drug that increases nitric oxide concentration and is commonly used to treat chest pain associated with angina pectoris. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, which can help to reduce the workload on the heart and relieve chest pain. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Increases nitric oxide concentration."
