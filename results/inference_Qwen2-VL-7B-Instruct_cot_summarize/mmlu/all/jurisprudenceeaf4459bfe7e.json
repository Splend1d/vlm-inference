                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the core of the will theory of rights and then analyze each option to determine which one formulates the interest theory without assuming the correlativity of rights and duties.\n\n### Background Information:\n- **Will Theory of Rights**: Assumes that the enforcement of Y's duty requires the exercise of will by X. It relies on the correlativity of rights and duties.\n- **Interest Theory**: Focuses on the recognition and protection of interests rather than the correlativity of rights and duties.\n\n### Analysis of Each Option:\n\n**A. Regarding X's interest as directly related to Y's duty.**\n- This option suggests that X's interest is directly tied to Y's duty. This implies a correlativity between rights and duties, which is not what the interest theory aims to avoid.\n\n**B. Accept that conferring right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized.**\n- This option suggests that conferring a right means recognizing the interest represented by that right. This still implies a correlativity between the right and the interest, which is not the interest theory's goal.\n\n**C. Treat an interest as the exercise of choice.**\n- This option suggests treating an interest as the exercise of choice. This does not necessarily imply a correlativity between rights and duties. It focuses on the exercise of choice rather than the enforcement of duties.\n\n**D. Assert that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties - only when they are actually imposed.**\n- This option suggests that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties. This implies that the recognition of interests leads to the imposition of duties, which is a form of correlativity between rights and duties.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe option that succeeds in formulating the interest theory without assuming the correlativity of rights and duties is:\n\n**C. Treat an interest as the exercise of choice.**\n\nThis option focuses on the exercise of choice rather than the enforcement of duties, aligning with the interest theory's goal of avoiding the correlativity of rights and duties."
