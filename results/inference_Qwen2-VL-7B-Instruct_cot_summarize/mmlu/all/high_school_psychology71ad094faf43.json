Schachter-Singer\n\nThe Schachter-Singer theory suggests that emotions are the result of the interaction between physiological arousal and cognitive labeling. In Antoinette's case, the initial physiological arousal (her heart racing and shrieking) is followed by cognitive labeling (recognizing that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas. This cognitive labeling helps to explain why she experiences happiness despite the initial physiological response."
