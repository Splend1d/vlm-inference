The land conveyed to the woman fronted on a public highway. The land retained by the man was landlocked. One year later, the man died intestate, leaving a cousin as his only heir. The cousin visited the man's land for the first time and discovered that it had no access to a public highway. A neighbor who owned adjoining land fronting on the public highway offered to sell the cousin a right to cross the neighbor's land for access to the highway. Although the neighbor's price was reasonable, the cousin rejected the offer. The woman has refused to allow the cousin to cross her land for access to the public highway even though the woman's land is still vacant. The cousin has sued the woman, seeking access across the woman's land to the public highway. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The cousin, based on necessity.\nB. The cousin, because the woman's land is still vacant.\nC. The woman, because the cousin could obtain an alternative access to the highway from the neighbor.\nD. The woman, because the man failed to reserve an easement in his deed to the woman.\n"

The key legal principle here is the doctrine of necessity, which allows a landowner to cross another's land for the purpose of gaining access to a public highway when there is no other reasonable alternative.\n\nHere are the reasons why the cousin is likely to prevail:\n\n1. **Necessity**: The cousin needs access to the public highway to use the land conveyed to them by the man. The land conveyed to the woman is landlocked, and the cousin has no other reasonable means of accessing the highway. The cousin's need for access is a compelling reason to grant the right of way.\n\n2. **Recorded of Deed**: The woman promptly recorded the deed, which means that the conveyance of the eastern half of the tract to the woman is valid and enforceable. However, this does not preclude the cousin from seeking access to the public highway.\n\n3. **Public Interest**: Allowing the cousin to access the public highway through the woman's land serves the public interest by ensuring that the land is accessible and potentially usable for development or other purposes.\n\n4. **Reasonable Alternative**: The cousin could have obtained an alternative access to the highway from the neighbor, but this does not negate the necessity of the right of way across the woman's land. The neighbor's offer was reasonable, but the cousin's rejection of the offer does not absolve the woman of her obligation to grant access.\n\n5. **Reserve of Easement**: The man's deed to the woman did not reserve an easement for the cousin. However, this does not necessarily mean that the woman has the right to deny access. The necessity of the access outweighs the lack of a reserved easement.\n\nGiven these points, the cousin is likely to prevail in their lawsuit based on the necessity of access to the public highway."
