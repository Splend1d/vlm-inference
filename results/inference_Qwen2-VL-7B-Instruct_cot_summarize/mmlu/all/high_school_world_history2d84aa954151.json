Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.\nIbn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185\nThe first passage tends to support which of the following traditional historical assumptions?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which traditional historical assumption the first passage tends to support, we need to carefully analyze the content and context of the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses the views of some theorists in the Middle Ages regarding the concept of jihad and the obligations of Muslim rulers. It mentions that most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. It also states that the Bahr al-Fava'id insists on the duty of a Muslim ruler to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and that making peace with the infidel would be worse than death for such a ruler.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the passage supports the idea that many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent, as they were expected to continue the jihad until all the world was under the sway of Islam.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. That the majority of Muslims were more peaceful than Christians during the crusading era - This is not supported by the passage. The passage does not compare the peacefulness of Muslims and Christians.\n\nB. That most Muslims were interested only in protecting their own territory during the crusading era - This passage does not support this idea. The passage emphasizes the duty to spread Islam and does not focus on protecting territory.\n\nC. That many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent - This is supported by the passage, as it emphasizes the duty to continue the jihad until all the world was under the sway of Islam.\n\nD. That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era - This is also supported by the passage, as it emphasizes the duty to continue the jihad until all the world was under the sway of Islam.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\nC. That many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent"
