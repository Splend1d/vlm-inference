As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&\u2026\nXXXVI. We have but one simple method of delivering our sentiments, namely, we must bring men to particulars and their regular series and order, and they must for a while renounce their notions, and begin to form an acquaintance with things.\"\nFrancis Bacon, English philosopher and essayist, Novum Organum, 1620\nBy the 1800s, the method of empirical reasoning reflected in the passage had undergone which of the following changes?\n\nA.

It had weakened to the point of irrelevance.**\n     - This option suggests that the method had lost its relevance. However, the passage does not provide any information about the decline or irrelevance of the method by the 1800s.\n   - **B. it had become a core principle of European culture.**\n     - This option suggests that the method had become a fundamental part of European culture. The passage does not provide any information about the cultural impact of the method by the 1800s.\n   - **C. it had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable to those such as Bacon who had pioneered it.**\n     - This option suggests that the method had been altered so much that it would be unrecognizable to Bacon. The passage does not provide any information about the method being altered beyond recognition.\n   - **D. it had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle of life.**\n     - This option suggest that the method had stagnated and people were searching for a new organizing principle. The passage does not provide any information about the stagnation of the method or the search for a new organizing principle.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the options provided in the question directly align with the information given in the passage. The passage does not provide enough information to conclude that the method had weakened, become a core principle, been altered beyond recognition, or stagnated to the point of people searching for a new organizing principle.\n\nGiven the lack of direct information in the passage, the most reasonable conclusion is that none of the provided options accurately reflect the changes in the method of empirical reasoning by the 1800s.\n\n**Final Answer: None of the options provided in the question directly align with the information given in the passage.**"
