This conclusion is based on the following legal principles:\n\n1. **Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship**: The conveyance to the friend and the co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship means that the friend and the co-worker each own half of the 30-acre tract of land. When one joint tenant dies, the surviving joint tenant automatically inherits the deceased tenant's share of the property.\n\n2. **Title Theory of Mortgages**: The jurisdiction recognizes a title theory of mortgages, which means that the mortgage is attached to the title of the property. In other words, the mortgage is a lien on the property itself, not just on the proceeds of the loan.\n\n3. **Death of the Friend**: The friend died intestate, leaving his uncle as his only heir. At the time of the friend's death, the indebtedness had not been paid to the bank. Since the friend and the co-worker were joint tenants with right of survivorship, the co-worker automatically inherited the friend's share of the property.\n\nGiven these points, the co-worker now owns the entire 30-acre tract of land, free and clear of the mortgage. The mortgage was attached to the title of of the property, not to the proceeds of the loan. Therefore, the co-worker's share of the property is subject to the mortgage, but the entire property is vested in the co-worker.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. in the co-worker, free and clear of the mortgage."
