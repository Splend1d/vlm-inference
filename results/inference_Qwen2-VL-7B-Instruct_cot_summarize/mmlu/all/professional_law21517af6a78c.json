According to the law, every hospital in the state would receive $5,000 annually for each cancer patient who was admitted to that hospital, and whose period of hospitalization exceeded one week. Although this bill was initially opposed by several churches and other organizations, the state's legislature re-drafted the bill in a compromise effort to appease the opposition. In its final re-draft, the bill provided that the $5,000 annual subsidy \"would not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. \"Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the state statute?\n\nA. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states plenary power over the allocation of their public funds.\nB. Public subsidies in hospitals are privileges rather than rights and, therefore, are not entitlements protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.\nD. The statute promotes a compelling state interest in advancing the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry.\n"

The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.\n\nThis argument is the strongest because it directly addresses the constitutional principles involved. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects fundamental rights, and the statute in question does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right. Instead, it limits funding based on the hospital's performance on a specific criterion (not providing abortions. This limitation is rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in improving the health care of cancer patients, which is a compelling state interest.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Tenth Amendment does not directly address the constitutionality of state statutes regarding the allocation of public funds.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the funding limitation does not necessarily mean that the subsidies are privileges rather than rights. The due process clause is still relevant in determining whether the limitation is constitutional.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the statute may promote a compelling state interest, it does not directly address the constitutional principles involved in the case."
