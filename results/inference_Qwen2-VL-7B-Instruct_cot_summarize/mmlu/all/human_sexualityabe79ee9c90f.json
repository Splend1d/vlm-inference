Bruce likely participated in more female-typical play than Chuck.\n\nThis answer is based on the understanding that gender-typical play patterns can vary significantly between boys and girls. Historically, male-typical play has often been associated with activities that involve physical aggression, competition, and roughhousing, while female-typical play has been associated with activities that involve cooperation, nurturing, and emotional expression. Given that Bruce is a homosexual man, it is reasonable to infer that he may have engaged in more female-typical play as a child, which is often associated with a greater likelihood of developing interests and behaviors that align with the female gender role."
