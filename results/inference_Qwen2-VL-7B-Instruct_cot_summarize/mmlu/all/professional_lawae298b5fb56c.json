The driver believes that the pedestrian was crossing the street illegally and is therefore responsible for the accident. The driver seeks an attorney's advice on how best to respond to the action.

File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and defense of contributory negligence and move for judgment on the pleadings.\n\nThis approach allows the driver to assert the contributory negligence defense and potentially reduce the damages awarded against them. Additionally, the driver can file a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries, if they believe that the pedestrian's negligence also contributed to their injuries.\n\nOption C is not appropriate because the driver is a citizen of a foreign country, not necessarily a citizen of State B, and therefore personal jurisdiction may still exist.\n\nOption D is not appropriate because the driver is a U.S. citizen, and subject-matter jurisdiction is not an issue in this case.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to file an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and a counterclaim for negligence, and then move for judgment on the pleadings."
