When she stands up suddenly, she becomes light-headed and has to steady herself for approximately 1 to 2 minutes before she is able to walk. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, a diuretic, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent, and an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Her pulse is 55/min. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg in the right arm and 70/50 mm Hg in the left arm while supine; her blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg in the right arm and 50/30 mm Hg in the left arm immediately after standing. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia. Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery with no evidence of occlusion. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Cardiac stress scintigraphy\nB. Adjusting her medication regimen\nC. Warfarin therapy\nD. Transesophageal echocardiography\n"

Adjust her medication regimen\n\nThe patient's symptoms of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure when standing up) suggest that her medications may be causing her to become hypotensive. The blood pressure readings taken while she is standing are significantly lower than when she is lying down, which is consistent with orthostatic hypotension. The patient's medications include a diuretic, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitor, all of which can cause hypotension. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to adjust her medication regimen to reduce the risk of further hypotension."
