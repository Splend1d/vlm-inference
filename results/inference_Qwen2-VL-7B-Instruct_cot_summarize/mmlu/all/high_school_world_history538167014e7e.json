A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nNkrumah's argument in the passage most clearly supports which of the following ideologies?\n\nA. Pan-Africanism\nB. Communism\nC. African socialism\nD. Neocolonialism\n"

Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Avoiding disunity and create a political union**:\n   - This suggests a focus on unity and cooperation among African states.\n\n2. **Project the African personality and command respect**:\n   - This implies a desire for African states to be recognized and respected on the global stage.\n\n3. **Evidences of callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers**:\n   - This highlights the need for African states to stand together against external powers.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Pan-Africanism**:\n   - This ideology emphasizes unity and cooperation among African states, which alignss with Nkrumah's call for a political union to avoid disunity.\n\nB. **Communism**:\n   - This ideology is based on class struggle and the eventual overthrow of capitalism. Nkrumah's focus on unity and respect for African independence does not align with the class-based approach of communism.\n\nC. **African socialism**:\n   - This ideology combines elements of socialism with African cultural and political traditions. While it may involve unity, it does not specifically focus on the political union and respect for African independence as prominently as Pan-Africanism.\n\nD. **Neocolonialism**:\n   - This ideology refers to the continued influence of former colonial powers over newly independent nations. Nkrumah's argument is about unity and respect for African independence, which is more aligned with Pan-Africanism than neocolonialism.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, the ideology that most clearly supports Nkrumah's argument is:\n\n**A. Pan-Africanism**"
