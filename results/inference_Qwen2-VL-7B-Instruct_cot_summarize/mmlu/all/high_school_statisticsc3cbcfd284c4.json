The student conducts a survey of 50 randomly sampled boys and 40 randomly selected girls, and asks them to report the number of contacts. Which of the following is true about this situation?\n\nA. Because the population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met, the student shoulduse a two-sample t-test.\nB. Because the sample sizes are different, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.\nC. Because the sample sizes are both greater than 30, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.\nD. Because the shape of the population distribution is not known, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.\n"
