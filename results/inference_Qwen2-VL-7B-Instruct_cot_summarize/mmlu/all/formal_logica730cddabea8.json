J \u2228 L\n3. ~K / L\n\nLet's break down the expressions:\n\n1. J \u2261 ~K: This is a biconditional (equivalence) statement, which means J is true if and only if ~K is true.\n2. J \u2228 L: This is a disjunction (or statement), which means J or L is true.\n3. ~K / L: This is a conditional (if-then) statement, which means if ~K is true, then L is true.\n\nNow, let's construct the truth table for these expressions:\n\n| J | K | ~K | ~K / L | J \u2228 L | J \u2261 ~K |\n|---|---|----|--------|-------|--------|\n| T | T | F  | T      | T     | F      |\n| T | F | T  | F      | T     | T      |\n| F | T | F  | T      | F     | F      |\n| F | F | T  | T      | F     | F      |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth table:\n\n1. For the first row (J = T, K = T:\n   - ~K = F\n   - ~K / L = T ( (since ~K is false, the conditional is true regardless of the value of L)\n   - J \u2228 L = T ( (since J is true, the disjunction is true regardless of the value of L)\n   - J \u2261 ~K = F ( (since J is true and ~K is false, the biconditional is false)\n\n2. For the second row J = T, K = F:\n   - ~K = T\n   - ~K / L = T ( (since ~K is true, the conditional is true regardless of the value of L)\n   - J \u2228 L = T  ( (since J is true, the disjunction is true regardless of the value of L)\n   - J \u2261 ~K = T  ( (since J is true and ~K is true, the biconditional is true)\n\n3. For the third row J = F, K = T:\n   - ~K = F\n   - ~K / L = T  ( (since ~K is false, the conditional is true regardless of the value of L)\n   - J \u2228 L = F  ( (since J is false, the disjunction is false regardless of the value of L)\n   - J \u2261 ~K = F  ( (since J is false and ~K is false, the biconditional is true)\n\n4. For the fourth row J = F, K = F:\n   - ~K = T\n   - ~K / L = T  ( (since ~K is true, the conditional is true regardless of the value of L)\n   - J \u2228 L = F  ( (since J is false, the disjunction is false regardless of the value of L)\n   - J \u2261 ~K = F  ( (since J is false and ~K is true, the biconditional is false)\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the argument is invalid because there is a counterexample where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. The counterexample is when J is true, K is false, and L is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false"
