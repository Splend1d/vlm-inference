For any matrix \\( A \\), the trace of \\( A^2 \\) is the sum of the squares of the entries of \\( A \\). Since squares of real numbers are nonnegative, the sum of these squares is also nonnegative. Therefore, the trace of \\( A^2 \\) is indeed nonnegative.\n\n### Statement II: If \\( A^2 = A \\), then the trace of \\( A \\) is nonnegative.\n\nIf \\( A^2 = A \\), then \\( A \\) is a projection matrix. For a projection matrix, the trace is equal to the dimension of the space it is projecting onto. Since the dimension of a space is always nonnegative, the trace of \\( A \\) is nonnegative.\n\n### Statement III: The trace of \\( AB \\) is the product of the traces of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nThis statement is not generally true in general. The trace of the product of two matrices \\( AB \\) is not equal to the product of their individual traces. The trace of \\( AB \\) is the sum of the products of the corresponding diagonal entries of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), which is not generally equal to the product of the individual traces.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Statement I is true.\n- Statement II is true.\n- Statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I and II only"
