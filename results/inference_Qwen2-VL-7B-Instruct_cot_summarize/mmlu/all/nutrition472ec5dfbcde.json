The requirement for dietary protein is for individual amino acids, not simply the total amount of protein in the diet.\nC. All dietary proteins have the same amino acid content and composition.\nD. For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\n"
