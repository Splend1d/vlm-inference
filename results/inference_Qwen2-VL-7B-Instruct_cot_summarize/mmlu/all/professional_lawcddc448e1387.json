The motorcyclist was injured and brought suit against the driver of the car and the driver of the truck. The jury returned a verdict finding that the motorcyclist's injuries were caused by negligence on the part of all three of the parties. The jury assigned 55 percent of the fault for the motorcyclist's injuries to the motorcyclist, 25 percent to the driver of the car, and 20 percent to the driver of the truck. The jury found that the amount of the motorcyclist's injuries was$100,000. The motorcyclist enforces the judgment against the driver of the car and collects $45,000 from the driver of the car. If the driver of the car then brings an action against the driver of the truck for contribution, the driver of the car should\n\nA. recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the driver of the truck.\nB. recover $27,000.\nC. recover $20,000.\nD. recover $15,000.\n"

The motorcyclist's injuries were $100,000.\n3. The driver of the car was assigned 25% of the fault, which means the driver of the car is responsible for 25% of the $100,000 in damages.\n4. The driver of the car collected $45,000 from the driver of the truck.\n5. The driver of the car should recover the remaining 25% of the $100,000 in damages, which is $25,000.\n6. However, the driver of the car has already collected $45,000 from the driver of the truck, so the driver of the car should recover the difference between the $25,000 they are entitled to and the $45,000 they have already collected.\n7. The difference is $20,000.\n\nTherefore, the driver of the car should recover $20,000. The correct answer is C."
