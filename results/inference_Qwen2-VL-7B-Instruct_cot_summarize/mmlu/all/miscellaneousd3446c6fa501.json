Honolulu remains on Hawaii-Aleutian Time (HST.\n\n3. **Calculating the Time Difference**: \n   - New York is 1 hour ahead of EST during EDT.\n   - Honolulu is 10 hours behind EST during HST.\n\n   Therefore, the total time difference between New York and Honolulu during daylight-saving time is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ hours ( (Honolulu) } + 1 \\text{ hour ( (New York ahead of EST) } = 11 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert Noon in New York to Honolulu Time**:\n   - Noon in New York is 12:00 PM EST.\n   - Adding 11 hours to 12:00 PM EST gives us:\n   \\[\n   12:00 \\text{ PM EST } + 11 \\text{ hours } = 1:00 \\text{ AM HST}\n   \\]\n\nSo, when it's noon in New York during daylight-saving time, it is 1:00 AM in Honolulu.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 6:00 AM"
