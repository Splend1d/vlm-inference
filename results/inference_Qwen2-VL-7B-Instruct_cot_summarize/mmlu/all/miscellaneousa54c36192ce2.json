Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. More women start smoking this year than men who have quit.\n- This could explain why the total amount of tobacco sold increased, as more women starting smoking would contribute to the overall sales.\n\nB. People who continue to smoke consume more tobacco than in previous years.\n- This could also explain why the total amount of tobacco sold increased, as increased consumption per smoker would lead to higher sales.\n\nC. The number of people who started smoking grass or taking snuff this year is more than the number who have given up smoking.\n- This could also explain why the total amount of tobacco sold increased, as the introduction of new tobacco products could attract new smokers.\n\nD. More cigarettes produced in the U.S. are exported to other countries this year than last year.\n- This does not directly explain why the total amount of tobacco sold increased in the U.S. It only explains the exportation of tobacco products, which does not affect the domestic sales.\n\nTherefore, the option that does not explain the phenomenon is:\n\nD. More cigarettes produced in the U.S. are exported to other countries this year than last year.\n\nFinal answer: D."
