He was permitted to borrow law books and legal treatises to take home for his own personal use. One afternoon, the law student was preparing a brief in the firm's law library when he noticed a book lying on the conference table. Making sure no one was watching him, he took the book and placed it in his briefcase. He planned to take the book home that night with the intention of not returning it. If the law student is subsequently charged with larceny of the book, which of the following claims, if true, would LEAST aid him in his defense?\n\nA. The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.\nB. He intended to return the book after reading it.\nC. The law firm had given him possession of the book.\nD. The law firm had given him custody of the book.\n"

Larceny typically involves the unauthorized taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. **The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.**\n   - This claim suggests that the law student took the book as a means to secure his unpaid salary. If true, it could argue that the student had a legitimate reason for taking the book, and it might be considered a defense against larceny.\n\nB. **He intended to return the book after reading it.**\n   - This claim indicates that the student had the intention to return the book after reading it. If true, it could argue that the student did not intend to permanently deprive the law firm of the book, which is a key element of larceny.\n\nC. **The law firm had given him possession of the book.**\n   - This claim suggests that the law firm had given the student possession of the book. If true, it could argue that the student had the right to the book, and it might be considered a defense against larceny.\n\nD. **The law firm had given him custody of the book.**\n   - This claim indicates that the law firm had given the student custody of the book. If true, it could argue that the student had the right to the book while it was in his custody, and it might be considered a defense against larceny.\n\nGiven these analyses, the claim that would least aid the law student in his defense is:\n\n**B. He intended to return the book after reading it.**\n\nThis claim does not address the key element of larceny, which is the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. The other claims either suggest a legitimate reason for taking the book or argue that the student had the right to the book, which could be considered defenses against larceny."
