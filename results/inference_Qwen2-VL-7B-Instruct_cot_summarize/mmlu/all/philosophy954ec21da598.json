Peter Singer is known for his work in moral philosophy, particularly in the areas of utilitarianism and bioethics.\n\n1. **Identify the Principle**: The principle in question is likely related to utilitarianism, which is a moral theory that suggests actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, and wrong as they tend to produce the opposite of happiness.\n\n2. **Understand the Versions**: There are typically two versions of utilitarianism:\n   - **Weak Version**: This version focuses on the consequences of actions for individuals, often emphasizing personal happiness or well-being.\n   - **Strong Version**: This version extends the focus to include the well-being of all sentient beings, not just humans.\n\n3. **Singer's Views**: Peter Singer is known for his strong commitment to animal rights and the ethical treatment of all sentient beings. He is often associated with the strong version of utilitarianism, which prioritizes the well-being of all sentient beings.\n\nGiven this background, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **A. he considers the stronger version to be correct.**\n  - This alignss with Singer's known views on utilitarianism, where he emphasizes the well-being of all sentient beings.\n\n- **B. he consider the weaker version to be correct.**\n  - This is less likely, as Singer's work and views are more aligned with the strong version.\n\n- **C. he ends up rejecting them both.**\n  - This is unlikely, as Singer's views are well-known for their strong commitment to utilitarian principles.\n\n- **D. he claims that they are equivalent.**\n  - This is also unlikely, as Singer's views are more aligned with the strong version of utilitarianism, which prioritizes the well-being of all sentient beings.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate option is:\n\n**A. he consider the the stronger version to be correct.**"
