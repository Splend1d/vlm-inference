The theory of securitization lacks coherence in terms of its employment as a tool for analytical studies in security.\n\nThis is not a criticism of securitization but rather a statement of fact about the theory itself. The theory of securitization is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been applied in various ways by different scholars and practitioners. While it has been widely adopted in security studies, it has also been criticized for its lack of coherence and for being overly abstract and difficult to apply in practice."
