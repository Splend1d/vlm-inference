The first derivative of the position equation gives us the velocity, and the second derivative gives us the acceleration.\n\nThe position equation is:\n\nx = 2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25\n\nFirst, find the first derivative (dx/dt (velocity):\n\ndx/dt = 6.0t^2 + 4.0\n\nNow, find the secondnd derivative (d^2x/dt^2 (acceleration):\n\nd^2x/dt^2 = 12.0t\n\nNow, plug in t = 1.50 s into the acceleration equation:\n\nd^2x/dt^2 = 12.0 * 1.50 = 18.0 m/s^2\n\nSo, the acceleration of the object at t = 1.50 s is 18.0 m/s^2.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 18 m/s^2."
