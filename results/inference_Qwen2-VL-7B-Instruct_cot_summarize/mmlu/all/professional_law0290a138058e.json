The painter declared, \"I knew they should have reinforced the standing wall better than they did! It is all their fault!\" It turned out that he was referring to co-workers employed by the same construction company. The owner filed suit for damages against the construction business. He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company's objection to the admission of the painter's statements?\n\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\nD. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.\n"

Hearsay is a statement made outside the presence of the declarant that is offered in court to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the painter's statement is being offered to prove that the co-workers were negligent, which is hearsay. The statement is also not being offered to prove the painter's own knowledge or belief, but rather to prove the negligence of the co-workers. Therefore, the statement is inadmissible as hearsay unless it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule."
