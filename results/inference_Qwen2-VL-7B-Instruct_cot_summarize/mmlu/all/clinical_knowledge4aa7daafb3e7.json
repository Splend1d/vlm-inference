Generally, cannulas are designed to remain in place for a specific period to allow for the administration of fluids, medications, or nutrition. Here are the typical durations for different types of cannulas:\n\n- **IV Cannulas (** ( Typically remain in place for 24-48 hours.\n- **Central Venous Catheters (** ( Can remain in place for several days to weeks, depending on the specific indication and patient condition.\n- **Arterial Cannulas** ( Can remain in place for several days to weeks, depending on the specific indication and patient condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 48 hours."
