Malthus was correct in concluding that population growth will outstrip food production growth, we need to evaluate the historical context and the current state of food production and population growth.\n\n1. **Historical Context and Current State:**\n   - **Technological and Institutional Innovations:** Over the past few centuries, significant advancements in agriculture, including the Green Revolution, have led to increased crop yields and improved food distribution systems. These innovations have helped to keep food supplies in line with population growth.\n   - **Population Growth:** While population growth has continued, it has not led to widespread famines due to these technological and institutional improvements.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option:**\n   - **Option A:** This suggests that technological and institutional innovations have permitted food supplies to more than keep pace with population growth. This alignss with the historical and current reality.\n   - **Option B:** This implies that population has not overwhelmed food supplies due to widespread famines. This is not accurate as famines have been mitigated by technological and institutional improvements.\n   - **Option C:** This suggests that population growth has kept pace with food supplies due to the introduction of genetically modified food. While GM foods have played a role, it is not the sole reason.\n   - **Option D:** This suggests that food supplies are not likely to keep pace with population growth over the next 10 years. This contradicts the historical and current trends.\n\nGiven the historical and current context, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**A. No, technological and institutional innovations have permitted food supplies to more than keep pace with population growth.**"
