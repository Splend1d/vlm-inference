The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic.\n\nWhen an excise tax is imposed on the production of good X, the price of the good increases. The extent to which the price increases depends on the elasticity of the demand curve for good X. \n\n- If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price will rise by the full amount of the tax, as consumers will not be willing to pay more for the good.\n- If the demand curve is less elastic, the price will rise by less than the full amount of the tax, as consumers are willing to pay more for the good despite the price increase.\n- If the demand curve is more elastic, the price will rise by more than the full amount of the tax, as consumers are willing to pay less for the good despite the price increase.\n\nTherefore, the consumer's burden of the tax ( which is the amount of money consumers pay in excess of the pre-tax price - rises as the demand curve is less elastic."
