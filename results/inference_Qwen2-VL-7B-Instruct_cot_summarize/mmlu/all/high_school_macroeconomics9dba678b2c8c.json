This gives us a measure of the average output per person, which can be used to compare the living standards between the two countries.\n\nLet's calculate the per capita output for each country:\n\n**Country A:**\n- Output: 1200 units\n- Population: 100 persons\n- Per capita output = Output / Population = 1200 / 100 = 12 units/person\n\n**Country B:**\n- Output: 2400 units\n- Population: 400 persons\n- Per capita output = Output / Population = 2400 / 400 = 6 units/person\n\nNow, let's compare the per capita outputs:\n\n- Country A: 12 units/person\n- Country B: 6 units/person\n\nBased on the per capita output, Country A has a higher standard of living than Country B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Country A has a higher standard of living than country B."
