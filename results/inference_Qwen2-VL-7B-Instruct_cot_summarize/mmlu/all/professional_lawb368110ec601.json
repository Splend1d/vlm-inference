The will was duly probated shortly thereafter. In 2005, the son conveyed the tract of land to a friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 2009. The son's will, duly probated following his death, named the friend as sole legatee and devisee of the son's entire estate. In 2008, the son mortgaged the tract of land to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 2008, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to a rancher in 1988 and recorded in 1988. In that instrument, the son purported to grant the rancher a mortgage on the tract of land. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, the State of Baden has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. What is the probable legal effect of the son's mortgage agreement in 2008 with the bank?\n\nA. The mortgage would be invalid, because the son conveyed his interest in the property to the friend in 2005.\nB. The mortgage would be invalid, because the first mortgage in 1988 would take precedence over the second mortgage.\nC. The mortgage would be invalid, unless the mortgagee bank had knowledge of the prior conveyance to the friend.\nD. The subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n"

The subsequent mortgage by the bank would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **State of Baden's Recording Statute**: The State of Baden follows a notice-type recording statute, which means that a deed or mortgage is only effective against subsequent purchasers or creditors if it is recorded. The son's mortgage was recorded in 2008, which makes it effective against subsequent creditors.\n\n2. **Prior Conveyance to the Friend**: The son conveyed the tract of land to the friend in 2005, and this conveyance was not recorded until after the son's death in 2009. Since the conveyance was not recorded, it is not effective against subsequent creditors.\n\n3. **Mortgage Priority**: The son's mortgage in 2008 was recorded and is therefore effective against subsequent creditors. The 1988 mortgage, which was also recorded, would take precedence over the 2008 mortgage if the 1988 mortgage was recorded before the 2008 mortgage.\n\n4. **Title Theory for Mortgages**: The State of Baden follows a title theory for mortgages, which means that the mortgage is a lien on the property and takes priority over any other interests in the property, including prior conveyances.\n\nTherefore, the subsequent mortgage by the bank would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated."
