Neandertals who lived in Africa did not interbreed with anatomically modern humans, but must have followed them when they migrated out of Africa.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the genetic evidence that modern Africans do not possess any Neandertal DNA. If Neandertals and anatomically modern humans had interbred, some Neandertal DNA would be present in the modern African population. Since there is no Neandertal DNA in modern Africans, it suggests that Neandertals did not interbreed with anatomically modern humans in Africa. Instead, it implies that Neandertals followed anatomically modern humans out of Africa."
