After applying batch normalization, the layer\u2019s activations will follow a standard Gaussian distribution.\n\nBatch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a technique used in deep learning to normalize the activations of a layer by subtractinging the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation. This process helps to stabilize the learning process and improve the performance of the model. The activations after applying BatchNorm do not necessarily follow a standard Gaussian distribution, but they are normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\nB. The bias parameter of affine layers becomes redundant if a batch normalization layer follows immediately afterward.\n\nThis statement is not entirely true. While BatchNorm can help to stabilize the learning process and reduce the need for a large learning rate, it does not make the bias parameter redundant. The bias parameter still serves to shift the distribution of the activations, and it is still necessary for the model to learn the optimal bias values.\n\nC. The standard weight initialization must be changed when using Batch Normalization.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. While BatchNorm can help to stabilize the learning process and reduce the need for a large learning rate, it does not necessarily require a change in the standard weight initialization. The weight initialization can remain the same, and BatchNorm can still be used effectively.\n\nD. Batch Normalization is equivalent to Layer Normalization for convolutional neural networks.\n\nThis statement is not true. Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization are two different techniques used in deep learning. Batch Normalization normalizes the activations of a layer by subtractinging the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation, while Layer Normalization normalizes the activations of a layer by subtractinging the layer mean and dividing by the layer standard deviation. While they both aim to normalize the activations of a layer, they differ in how they normalize the activations and in their implementation."
