                    "text": "To determine which political philosophy Spencer was an advocate of, we need to carefully analyze the passage and understand the core principles he espouses.\n\n1. **Conservatism**: This philosophy emphasizes tradition, stability, and the preservation of social order. It often supports a limited role for government in economic affairs and tends to favor a hierarchical society. Spencer's emphasis on the inherent goodness of nature and the role of government in protecting individual freedom alignss more with liberal principles rather than conservative ones.\n\n2. **Anarchism**: This philosophy advocates for the abolition of all government and societal structures. Spencer does not advocate for the complete abolition of government but rather for a limited role in protecting individual freedom.\n\n3. **Liberalism**: This philosophy emphasizes individual freedom, equality, and the protection of individual rights. Spencer's emphasis on the protection of individual freedom and the role of government in ensuring that individuals have the freedom to do what they will, provided it does not infringe on the freedom of others, alignss with liberal principles.\n\n4. **Socialism**: This philosophy advocates for the ownership of the means of production by the collective or the state. Spencer's views do not align with socialist principles, as he does not advocate for collective ownership or state control over the means of production.\n\nGiven the passage, Spencer's emphasis on the protection of individual freedom and the role of government in ensuring that individuals have the freedom to do what they will, provided it does not infringe on the freedom of others, aligns most closely with liberal principles.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nC. Liberalism"
