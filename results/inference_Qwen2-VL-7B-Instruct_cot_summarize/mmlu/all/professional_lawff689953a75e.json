To support this defense, the owner needs evidence that the materials in question are not obscene and thus protected by the First Amendment. Let's analyze each option to determine which would be most helpful to the owner's defense:\n\nA. **The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.**\n   - This option suggests that the materials depicted normal sexual conduct rather than deviant behavior. If the materials were considered normal, they might be less likely to be deemed obscene. However, this does not directly address the constitutionality of the sale itself.\n\nB. **The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.**\n   - This option suggests that the materials were scientific in nature. If the materials were scientific, they might be considered educational and thus protected speech. This could be a strong argument for the defense, as scientific materials are generally considered to have a legitimate purpose and are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nC. **The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.**\n   - This option suggests that the police did not have a warrant when they purchased the materials. This could be relevant to the legality of the police action but does not directly address the constitutionality of the sale itself.\n\nD. **85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.**\n   - This option suggests that the majority of the state's citizens believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial behavior. This could be relevant to public opinion but does not directly address the constitutionality of the sale itself.\n\nGiven these options, the most helpful to the owner's defense would be:\n\n**B. The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the constitutionality of the sale by suggesting that the materials have a legitimate scientific purpose, which could be considered protected speech under the First Amendment."
