The senator, who is 61, brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the state statute. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion?\n\nA. Since a fundamental right is involved, the state must show the regulation is necessary to vindicate a compelling government interest.\nB. Since no fundamental right is involved, the petitioner must show the age restriction is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\nC. The state must show the age regulation substantially furthers an important government objective and does not impair the fundamental right to vote.\nD.
