The man took the agent to the home of a drug dealer, who sold the agent four pounds of marijuana. At trial, the drug dealer claimed the defense of entrapment and demanded that the informant's identity be disclosed and that he be produced. At no time prior to trial did the drug dealer seek to subpoena the man. However, the man was a fugitive from justice the whole time, and no subpoena could have been served. The government claims a right to protect the informant's identity. Should the government's claim be honored?\n\nA. Yes, because an informant has a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. Yes, because informants would not assist in crime prevention unless they were reasonably certain that their identities would be kept secret.\nC. No, because under the Fifth Amendment, a defendant has the right to be confronted by witnesses against him.\nD. No, because under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to a fair trial.\n"

Yes, because informants would not assist in crime prevention unless they were reasonably certain that their identities would be kept secret.\n\nThis reasoning is based on the principle that informants are essential to law enforcement's ability to prevent and investigate crimes. If informants were not confident that their identities would remain secret, they would be less likely to provide information that could lead to the apprehension of criminals. Therefore, the government's claim to protect the informant's identity is justified to maintain the effectiveness of law enforcement operations and to encourage informants to continue providing valuable information."
