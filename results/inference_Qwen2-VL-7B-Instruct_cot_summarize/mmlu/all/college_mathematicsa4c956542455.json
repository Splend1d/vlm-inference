Therefore, Statement I is true.\n\n### Statement II: \\(v\\) is also an eigenvector of \\(A^2\\).\n\nIf \\(v\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\), then:\n\\[ Av = \\lambda v \\]\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n\\[ A^2 v = A(Av) = A(\\lambda v) = \\lambda(Av) = \\lambda^2 v \\]\n\nThis shows that \\(v\\) is also an eigenvector of \\(A^2\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda^2\\). Therefore, Statement II is true.\n\n### Statement III: \\(v\\) is also an eigenvector of \\(A^{-1}\\).\n\nIf \\(v\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\), then:\n\\[ Av = \\lambda v \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(A^{-1}\\) gives:\n\\[ A^{-1}Av = A^{-1}(\\lambda v) \\]\n\\[ v = \\lambda A^{-1}v \\]\n\nThis shows that \\(v\\) is also an eigenvector of \\(A^{-1}\\) with eigenvalue \\(1/\\lambda\\). Therefore, Statement III is true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll three statements are necessarily true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. I, II, and III"
