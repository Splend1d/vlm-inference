                    "text": "To determine the correct inference from the passage, let's analyze the information provided by Thomas Henry Huxley in \"The Physical Basis of Life\" from 1868.\n\n1. **Identify the type of logical reasoning involved**: This question involves inferential reasoning, where we need to deduce the main argument from the given text.\n\n2. **Comprehend the context and the core of the question**: The passage discusses the nature of life and its relationship to matter. Huxley argues that life is not something that works through matter but rather is a property of a certain kind of matter.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"a force that works through matter\" - This contradicts Huxley's argument. He states that life is not a force working through matter but a property of matter.\n   - **Option B**: \"essentially a philosophical notion\" - The passage does not discuss life as a philosophical notion. It focuses on the scientific understanding of life.\n   - **Option C**: \"merely a property of a certain kind of matter\" - This aligns with Huxley's argument. He suggests that life is a property of a certain kind of matter, which breaks down into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds.\n   - **Option D**: \"a supernatural phenomenon\" - The passage does not discuss life as a supernatural phenomenon. It is focused on the physical and scientific aspects of life.\n\n4. **Conclude with a clear answer**: Based on the analysis, the correct inference is that Huxley argued that \"life\" was merely a property of a certain kind of matter.\n\n**Final Answer: C. merely a property of a certain kind of matter**"
