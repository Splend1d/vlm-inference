However, it is known that the Holocaust was a systematic and deliberate attempt by the Nazi regime to exterminate European Jews and other groups deemed undesirable by the regime. The Holocaust began in the early 1940s and continued until the end of World War II in 1945. It is estimated that between 5 and 6 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust, along with millions of other people, including political prisoners, Roma, and disabled individuals. It is important to remember the atrocities of the Holocaust and to educate ourselves and others about this dark period in history."
