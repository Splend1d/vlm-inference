Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   P(E \\cap F) = P(E) \\times P(F)\n   \\]\n   Given:\n   \\[\n   P(E) = 0.32, \\quad P(F) = 0.15, \\quad P(E \\cap F) = 0.048\n   \\]\n   Let's check if the events are independent:\n   \\[\n   P(E) \\times P(F) = 0.32 \\times 0.15 = 0.048\n   \\]\n   Since \\( P(E \\cap F) = 0.048 \\) and \\( P(E) \\times P(F) = 0.048 \\), the events E and F are independent.\n\n2. **Mutual Exclusivity of Events E and F:**\n   Two events E and F are mutually exclusive if the probability of both events occurring together is zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   P(E \\cap F) = 0\n   \\]\n   Given:\n   \\[\n   P(E \\cap F) = 0.048\n   \\]\n   Since \\( P(E \\cap F) \\neq 0 \\), the events E and F are not mutually exclusive.\n\nBased on these evaluations, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**D.
