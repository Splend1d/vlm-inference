All of these options.\n\nThe recent global economic crisis has presented several challenges to the liberalist perspective, which generally emphasizes minimal government intervention in the economy. Here's how each option reflects this challenge:\n\nA. Governmental cyberspace restrictions, in the form of censorship and monitoring, are increasing.\n- This reflects a shift towards more state control and surveillance, which is contrary to the liberalist emphasis on individual freedoms and minimal government intervention.\n\nB. The crisis has revealed the failure of international cooperation to prevent a global catastrophe, in the form of massive economic collapse and contagion.\n- This highlights the limitations of liberalist principles in addressing global issues, as it relies on market forces and international cooperation, which failed to prevent the crisis.\n\nD. Increasing state involvement in key industrial and financial sectors, including nationalisation and state-funded development.\n- This is a direct challenge to the liberalist perspective, as it involves significant government intervention in the economy, which is typically avoided in a liberalist framework.\n\nTherefore, all of these options illustrate how the recent global economic crisis presents challenges to the liberalist perspective."
