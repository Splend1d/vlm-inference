He signed an agreement with the local swimming club to use their swimming pool four times per week. The agreement, which had a duration of one year, stated that the man could use the poo1 four times per week for $250 per month, due on the first day of each month. For three months, the man paid the $250 on the first and made use of the swimming pool. Toward the middle of the third month, the man was involved in an automobile accident. Shortly thereafter, the man sent the following letter to the swimming club:\"Please be advised that because of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, my physician has advised me not to engage in any strenuous activities. Since I will not be able to make use of the pool anymore, no further payments will be forthcoming. \"Which of the following does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter?\n\nA. The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pooi.\nB. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.\nC. The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.\nD. The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter, we need to analyze the implications of his letter and the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - The man signed an agreement to pay $250 per month for the use of the swimming pool.\n   - He paid for three months and then informed the club that he would not be able to use the pool anymore due to an automobile accident.\n   - The man's letter indicates that he will not make any further payments.\n\n2. **Legal Principles:**\n   - **Breach of Contract:** The man's letter constitutes a repudiation of the contract, which means he is reneging on his obligation to pay.\n   - **Right to Sue:** The club has the right to sue the man for breach of contract immediately, as the man's letter is an immediate repudiation.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n   - **Option A:** \"The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pool.\"\n     - This is not necessarily true. The man's letter does not explicitly state that the club has the right to bar him from the pool. It only states that he will not use the pool anymore and will not make further payments.\n\n   - **Option B:** \"The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.\"\n     - This is accurate. The man's letter is an immediate repudiation, and the club has the right to sue him immediately for breach of contract.\n\n   - **Option C:** \"The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.\"\n     - This is accurate. The man can retract his repudiation if he does so before the club initiates legal action. This.\n\n   - **Option D:** \"The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\"\n     - This is not accurate. The club does not have to wait until the next payment date to sue the man for breach of contract. The man's letter is an immediate repudiation, and the club can sue immediately.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe statement that does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter is **Option A**."
