A factor group ( or quotient group, denoted as \\( G/N \\), where \\( G \\) is a group and \\( N \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), is always an Abelian group. This is because the operation in the factor group is defined by the cosets multiplication, which is commutative due to the properties of normal subgroups. Therefore, the statement that a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian is incorrect.\n\nStatement 2 is True. If \\( K \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( H \\) and \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), then \\( K \\) is indeed a normal subgroup of \\( G \\). This is because normality is a transitive property. If \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\), then for any \\( g \\in G \\), \\( gHg^{-1} = H \\). Since \\( K \\) is normal in \\( H \\), for any \\( h \\in H \\), \\( hKh^{-1} = K \\). Therefore, for any \\( g \\in G \\), \\( gKg^{-1} = K \\), which means \\( K \\) is normal in \\( G \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
