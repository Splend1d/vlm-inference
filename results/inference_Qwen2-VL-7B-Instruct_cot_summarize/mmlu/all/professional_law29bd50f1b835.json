A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a water park on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city's charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the commission rejected the developer's subsequent application for \"recreational area\" approval for the proposed water park on the grounds that the council's rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. Assume that while the action was pending in the state court, the proposed zoning change was defeated in a referendum. Which would be the most applicable rule of constitutional law with respect to the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance?\n\nA. The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of the democratic process does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The referendum procedure is arbitrary and capricious and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.\nC. The referendum procedure is violative of the due process clause of the FourteenthAmendment.\nD. The referendum procedure in this context is invalid as against publicpolicy.\n"

The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of the democratic process does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle that referendums are generally considered as a democratic process that allows the people to have a say in the decisions affecting their community. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects against unreasonable and arbitrary actions by the government, but it does not generally per se invalidate referendums as a democratic process. The referendum in this case was a democratic process that was not arbitrary or capricious, and it was not against public policy."
