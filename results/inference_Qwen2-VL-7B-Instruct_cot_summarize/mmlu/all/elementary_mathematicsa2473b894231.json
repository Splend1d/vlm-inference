So, after \\( t \\) minutes of exercise, her heart rate will be \\( 55 + 5t \\) beats per minute ( (since her resting heart rate is 55 beats per minute).\n\nWe want to find out when her heart rate reaches 120 beats per minute, so we set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 55 + 5t = 120 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 5t = 120 - 55 \\]\n\\[ 5t = 65 \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{65}{5} \\]\n\\[ t = 13 \\]\n\nSo, it will take Trish 13 minutes to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute.\n\nHowever, this option is not listed in your choices. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be 13 minutes, which is not among the given choices.
