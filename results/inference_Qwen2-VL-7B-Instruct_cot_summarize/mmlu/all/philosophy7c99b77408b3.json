Provide an account of what makes right action right.\n- Stevenson might be discussing the criteria or principles that determine what constitutes right actions. This alignss with the idea of providing an account of the nature of right actions.\n\nB. Establish which things are good in themselves.\n- While the concept of goodness might be discussed, the primary focus is likely not on identifying what is inherently good but rather on the nature of right actions.\n\nC. Develop a theory of good moral character.\n- Although moral character might be discussed, the primary focus is more on the nature of right actions rather than the development of a theory of moral character.\n\nD. Make ethical questions clear.\n- Stevenson might be aiming to clarify ethical questions, but this is more of a secondary goal rather than the primary aim.\n\nGiven the context and the options, Stevenson's primary aim is most likely:\n\nA. Provide an account of what makes right action right.\n\nThis option directly addresses the core of the paper, which is to explain the nature of right actions."
