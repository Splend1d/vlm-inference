The retailer purchased 20,000 pounds of soybeans. So, the total expenses in 2014 were:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Expenses in 2014} = \\text{Price per pound} \\times \\text{Pounds purchased} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Expenses in 2014} = \\$0.24 \\times 20,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Expenses in 2014} = \\$4,800 \\]\n\nIn 2015, the average wholesale price of soybeans was $0.16 per pound. The retailer purchased the same amount of soybeans, 20,000 pounds. So, the total expenses in 2015 were:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Expenses in 2015} = \\text{Price per pound} \\times \\text{Pounds purchased} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Expenses in 2015} = \\$0.16 \\times 20,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Expenses in 2015} = \\$3,200 \\]\n\nNow, to find the percent change in the retailer's expenses from 2014 to 2015, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percent Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percent Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\$3,200 - \\$4,800}{\\$4,800} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percent Change} = \\left( \\frac{-\\$1,600}{\\$4,800} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percent Change} = -33.33\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percent change in the retailer's expenses from 2014 to 2015 is approximately -33.33%, which rounds to -33%.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. \u201333%"
