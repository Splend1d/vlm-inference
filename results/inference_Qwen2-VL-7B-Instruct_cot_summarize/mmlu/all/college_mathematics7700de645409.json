In this case, the force is a constant unit force parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1), so the force vector is (-1, 0, 1). The displacement vector is the change in position of the particle, which is given by the difference between the final and initial positions. The initial position is (0, 0, 0) and the final position is (1, 1, 1), so the displacement vector is (1, 1, 1). The dot product of the force and the displacement vector is (-1, 0, 1) dot (1, 1, 1) = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0. Therefore, the work done by F on the particle is 0. The answer is C."
