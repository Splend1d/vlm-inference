C4 plants fix CO2 as the 4-carbon acid oxaloacetate, while CAM plants fix CO2 as the 5-carbon acid ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate.\nB. C4 plants fix CO2 in the mesophyll but carry out the Calvin cycle in the bundle sheath, while CAM plants fix CO2 and carry out the Calvin cycle in the mesophyll.\nC.

C4 plants fix CO2 in the mesophyll but carry out the Calvin cycle in the bundle sheath, while CAM plants fix CO2 and carry out the Calvin cycle in the mesophyll.\n\nExplanation:\n- C4 plants strategy involves fixing CO2 in the mesophyll cells and then transferring it to the bundle sheath cells where the Calvin cycle takes place.\n- CAM plants ( on the other hand, fix CO2 during the night in the mesophyll cells and then use the stored CO2 during the day for the Calvin cycle in the mesophyll cells."
