Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nWhich of the following factors is likeliest to have prevented the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage?\n\nA. Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism\nB. Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure\nC. Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites\nD.

                    "text": "To determine which factor is most likely to have prevented the progress hoped for by the Halima Ghomri, we need to carefully analyze the context and the content of both passages.\n\n1. **Identify the Context and Core of Each Passage:**\n   - **First Passage (** ( This passage by Olympe de Gouge is from the French Revolution era and discusses the rights of women and the need for them to assert their independence and equality. It highlights the disparity between the ideals of the Revolution and the reality faced by women.\n   - **Second Passage.** This passage by Halima Ghomri is from the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence. It reflects on the lack of improvement in the lives of poor peasants despite gaining independence.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Option:**\n   - **A. Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism:** This option suggests that traditional Islamic beliefs and practices have hindered progress. However, the passage does not specifically mention Islamic traditions or their impact on the situation.\n   - **B. Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure:** This option suggests that the lack of industrial development and infrastructure has hindered progress. While this could be a contributing factor, it is not directly addressed in the passage.\n   - **C. Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites:** This option suggests that the new elites are hostile to women's rights. This is a plausible factor as the passage by Olympe de Gouge mentions the need to oppose the force of reason against empty pretensions of superiority.\n   - **D. Prioritization of national liberation over social reform:** This option suggests that the focus on national liberation has overshadowed social reforms. This passage mentions that the war is over and the peasants work without fear, implying that national liberation has been achieved. However, it also also mentions that nothing has changed, suggesting that social reforms have not been prioritized.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The passage by Halima Ghomri explicitly mentions that \"nothing has changed\" despite gaining independence. This passage by Olympe de Gouge mentions the need to oppose the force of reason against empty pretensions of superiority, which implies that the new elites might be hostile to women's rights.\n   - Therefore, the most likely factor preventing the progress hoped for by Halima Ghomri is the hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites.\n\n**Final Answer: C. Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites.**"
