Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, \"What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?\" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, \"Study this, baby!\" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Burglary only.\nB. Attempted violation of the statute.\nC. Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.\nD. Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.\n"

The student entered the sorority house with the intent to flash the sisters, which is a crime. Therefore, the student can be charged with burglary.\n\n2. **Attempted Violation of the Statute**: The student attempted to violate the statute by flashing the sisters. The statute in question is the one that makes it a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude. The student's attempt to flash the sisters constitutes an attempt to violate this statute.\n\nGiven this analysis, the student should be found guilty of both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute."
