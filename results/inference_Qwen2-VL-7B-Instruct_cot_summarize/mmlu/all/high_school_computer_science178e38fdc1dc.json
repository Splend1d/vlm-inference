The game's running speed can only be improved if the game is played between two human players instead of with the computer-controlled player.\nB. The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn.\nC. The game's running speed cannot be improved because computers can only be programmed to find the best possible solution.\nD.

The issue is not about the players but about the computational complexity of the game.\n\n2. **Option B: The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn.**\n   - This option is correct. By using a process that finds approximate solutions instead of the best possible solution, the computational complexity can be reduced, leading to faster game execution. This approach is known as heuristic or approximate algorithms, which can significantly speed up the game without compromising the quality of the solution too much.\n\n3. **Option C: The game's running speed cannot be improved because computers can only be programmed to find the best possible solution.**\n   - This option is incorrect because computers can indeed be programmed to find approximate solutions, which can be faster than finding the best possible solution.\n\n4. **Option D: The game's running speed cannot be improved because the game is an example of an algorithm that does not run in a reasonable time.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the game can be improved by using approximate algorithms, which can run in a reasonable time.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn.**"
