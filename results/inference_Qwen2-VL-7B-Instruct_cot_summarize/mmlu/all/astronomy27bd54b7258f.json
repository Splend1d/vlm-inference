To explain the fact that planets sometimes appear to move westward rather than eastward relative to the stars in our sky.\n\nPtolemy's model of the universe, known as the geocentric model, was designed to explain the observed motion of the planets. The idea of \"circles upon circles\" was a way to account for the apparent retrograde motion of planets, where they appear to move backward relative to the stars. This was a significant challenge for ancient astronomers, and Ptolemy's model provided a solution by incorporating small, rapid motions (called epicycles, which allowed the planets to appear to move in a more complex, yet predictable, manner."
