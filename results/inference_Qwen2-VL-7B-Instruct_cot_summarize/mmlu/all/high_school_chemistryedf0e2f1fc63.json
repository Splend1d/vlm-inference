It has a pKb value.\n   - **Strong Acid**: A strong acid completely dissociates in water, producing H+ ions.\n\n2. **Initial pH**:\n   - Initially, the pH of a weak base solution is typically above 7 because the base is not fully dissociated, and the concentration of OH- ions is higher than H+ ions.\n\n3. **Titration Progress**:\n   - As the strong acid is added, it reacts with the weak base, consuming OH- ions and producing H2O and the conjugate acid of the base.\n   - This reaction reduces the concentration of OH- ions, causing the pH to decrease.\n\n4. **Equivalence Point**:\n   - At the equivalence point, all the weak base has been neutralized by the strong acid. The pH will be determined by the strong acid, which is a strong electrolyte and will dominate the solution.\n   - Since the strong acid is a strong electrolyte, it will completely dissociate, resulting in a pH below 7.\n\n5. **Post-Equivalence Point**:\n   - After the equivalence point, if more strong acid is added, the pH will continue to decrease, but the rate of decrease will slow down because the strong acid is now the dominant species.\n\nGiven these points, the correct observation is:\n\n**B. The pH of the solution gradually decreases throughout the experiment and the pH at the equivalence point is below 7.**"
