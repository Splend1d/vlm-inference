The high temperature water will rise to the top of the container until it has cooled and then mixes with the alcohol.\nB. The molecules of the water continue to have a higher kinetic energy than the molecules of the alcohol, but the two liquids mix until the energy is spread evenly throughout the container.\nC. The hot water produces thermal radiation that is absorbed by the cold alcohol until the kinetic energy of all the molecules is the same.\nD. The water molecules collide with the alcohol molecules, transferring energy until the average kinetic energy of both the water and alcohol molecules are the same.\n"

The water molecules collide with the alcohol molecules, transferring energy until the average kinetic energy of both the water and alcohol molecules are the same.\n\nWhen hot water is poured into a beaker containing cold alcohol, the temperature of the mixture will eventually reach the same temperature due to the transfer of kinetic energy between the water and alcohol molecules. This transfer occurs through collisions between the molecules, where the faster-moving water molecules collide with the slower-moving alcohol molecules, transferring some of their kinetic energy to the alcohol. Over time, this process continues until the average kinetic energy of all the molecules in the mixture is the same, resulting in a uniform temperature throughout the container."
