Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the following most likely prompted the complaint voiced in the passage?\n\nA. British sale of opium in China\nB. British exports of tobacco to China\nC. British introduction of gunpowder to China\nD. British encouragement of heroin use to China\n"

The passage mentions that the British know full well how harmful opium is to mankind and that they should not allow this harmful drug to be transferred to China, especially to the \"Inner Land.\" Lin Zexu also emphasizes that the products China exports to foreign countries are beneficial to mankind.\n\nGiven this context, the most likely complaint Lin Zexu is addressing is related to the British sale of opium in China. This is explicitly mentioned in the passage as a harmful practice that Lin Zexu believes the British should not engage in.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. British sale of opium in China"
