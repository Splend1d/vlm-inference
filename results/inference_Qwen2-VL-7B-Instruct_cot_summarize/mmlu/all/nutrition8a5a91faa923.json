The mechanism by which non-esterified fatty acids are taken up by cells is by a combination of diffusion and carrier-mediated transport involving fatty acid binding, translocase and transport proteins.\n\nNon-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs are transported into cells primarily through a combination of diffusion and carrier-mediated transport. This process involves specific transport proteins that facilitate the movement of NEFAs across the cell membrane. The transport proteins bind to the fatty acids, translocate them across the membrane, and then release them into the cell. This mechanism allows for the efficient uptake of NEFAs by cells for various metabolic processes."
