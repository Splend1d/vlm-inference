The results of the exam are sent to a government data information center for the purpose of keeping information about men who may be drafted into the military. A 25-year-old law school graduate has herpes. He has recently sent resumes to many governmental agencies. Fearful that the information about his herpes condition will become available, he seeks a declaratory judgment that would forbid the government from requiring him to take a physical examination. Which of the following is the best constitutional basis in support of the federal law?\n\nA. The commerce clause.\nB. The dormant commerce clause.\nC. To raise and support an army and navy.\nD.

This power includes the authority to regulate the military and to ensure the defense of the nation. The requirement for all males between the ages of 18 and 30 to take a physical examination each year is a measure to ensure that the military can maintain a healthy and capable force, which is a legitimate purpose under this constitutional provision."
