Impact\n\nIn public relations messages distributed through the mass media, the criterion that would be most important is likely to be \"impact.\" Impact refers to the extent to which a message influences or changes the attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors of the audience. Public relations professionals aim to create messages that have a significant and positive impact on the target audience, whether it's to raise awareness, change perceptions, or encourage specific actions. Therefore, impact is a crucial criterion in determining the effectiveness of public relations messages in the mass media."
