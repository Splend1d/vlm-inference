Therefore, the complement of \\( s \\) is dense in the unit square.\n   - Since the complement of \\( s \\) is dense, it cannot be open. Hence, \\( s \\) is not closed.\n\n2. **Openness**:\n   - A set is open if every point in the set has a neighborhood entirely contained within the set.\n   - For \\( s \\), consider any point \\((x, y)\\) in \\( s \\). Since \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) ( or both are irrational, there exists a neighborhood around \\((x, y)\\) that contains points with both rational coordinates. This neighborhood is entirely contained within the complement of \\( s \\), which is dense.\n   - Therefore, \\( s \\) cannot be open.\n\n3. **Connectedness**:\n   - A set is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two non-empty disjoint open sets.\n   - Consider the set \\( S \\) consisting of all points \\((x, y)\\) in the unit square where both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are rational. \\( S \\) is a non-empty open set in \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\).\n   - The set \\( S \\) is disjoint from \\( s \\), and \\( S \\cup s \\) covers the entire unit square. Since \\( S \\) is open, \\( S \\cup s \\) is not connected.\n\n4. **Totally Disconnected**:\n   - A set is totally disconnected if it has no non-empty connected subsets.\n   - Consider any two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) in \\( s \\). Since \\( x_1 \\) or \\( y_1 \\) or both are irrational, and \\( x_2 \\) or \\( y_2 \\) or both are irrational, there exists a neighborhood around each point that contains points with both rational coordinates. This.\n   - Therefore, \\( s \\) is not totally disconnected.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. totally disconnected**"
