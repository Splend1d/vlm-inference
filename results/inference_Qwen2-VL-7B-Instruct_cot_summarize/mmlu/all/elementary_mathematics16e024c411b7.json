The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 is 36. So, you convert both fractions to have the denominator of 36:\n\nMorning distance: ( (7/9) * (4/4 = 28/36 miles\nAfternoon distance: ( (5/12) * (3/3 = 15/36 miles\n\nNow, subtract the afternoon distance from the morning distance:\n\n28/36 - 15/36 = 13/36 miles\n\nSo, you walked your dog 13/36 miles farther in the morning than in the afternoon.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 13 over 36."
