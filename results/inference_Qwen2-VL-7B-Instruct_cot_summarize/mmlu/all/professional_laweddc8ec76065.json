After receiving the letter, the woman sent the man a fax that stated, \"The price is a little high, I'll give you $800. \" The man responded by fax, \"I will not accept $800. \" The next day, the woman telephoned the man and said, \"I changed my mind, I will pay $1,000 for the motorcycle. \" The man refused to sell the woman his motorcycle. If the woman sues the man for breach of contract, which of the following defenses would be the man's best defense?\n\nA. Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.\nB. The contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds, because the woman's purported acceptance was oral.\nC. The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.\nD. The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.\n"

The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.\n\nThis defense is based on the principle of counter-offering, which typically terminates the original offer and creates a new offer that must be accepted or rejected by the original party. In this case, the woman's counter-offer of $800 effectively terminated her power of acceptance for the original offer of $1,000. Therefore, when the woman later changed her mind and offered to pay $1,000, it was a new offer, and the man was not bound to accept it.\n\nThe other options are less compelling:\n\nA. The mode of communication is not relevant to the termination of the offer due to the counter-offer.\nB. The statute of frauds is not applicable here because the offer and acceptance were not in writing.\nD. The rejection of the counter-offer does not necessarily terminate the woman's power of acceptance, as it was a new offer.\n\nThus, the man's best defense is that the woman's counter-offer terminated her power of acceptance."
