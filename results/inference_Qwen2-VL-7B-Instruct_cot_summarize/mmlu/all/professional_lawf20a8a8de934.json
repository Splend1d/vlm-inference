Their contract provided that the artist would paint a full-color portrait of the man, to be delivered by November 1, in exchange for $15,000. A contractual provision recited that the artist \"guarantees that the quality of the portrait will be fully satisfactory. \"The artist finished the portrait and presented it to the man on November 2. The man looked at the portrait and said, \"This is awful! I really expected better. I'm not paying for this!\" The artist was enraged by the man's reaction, as he felt the finished portrait was one of his best works. Which of the following arguments would be LEAST helpful to the artist in his efforts to recover on a breach of contract theory?\n\nA. The man's dissatisfaction with the quality of the portrait was not genuine.\nB. The man failed to make an adequate examination of the quality of the portrait.\nC. The man's dissatisfaction with the portrait was the result of delivery after November 1, rather than of any lack of quality in the portrait.\nD. Because of a recent hand injury, the artist did not have sufficient time to produce a portrait of a quality satisfactory to the man.\n"

This could be a strong argument in favor of the artist's claim, as it would suggest that the man's refusal to pay was not based on a genuine dissatisfaction with the quality.\n\n2. **Option B: The man failed to make an adequate examination of the quality of the portrait.**\n   - This argument suggests that the man did not properly examine the quality of the portrait. If the man did not properly examine the portrait, it could be argued that he cannot claim dissatisfaction based on a lack of examination. This would also be a strong argument in favor of the artist's claim.\n\n3. **Option C: The man's dissatisfaction with the portrait was the result of delivery after November 1, rather than of any lack of quality in the portrait.**\n   - This argument suggests that the man's dissatisfaction was due to the late delivery rather than the quality of the portrait. If the man was dissatisfied because the portrait was delivered after the agreed deadline, it would not be a valid reason for refusing to pay. This would also be a strong argument in favor of the artist's claim.\n\n4. **Option D: Because of a recent hand injury, the artist did not have sufficient time to produce a portrait of a quality satisfactory to the man.**\n   - This of a recent hand injury, the artist did not have sufficient time to produce a portrait of a quality satisfactory to the man.**\n   - This argument suggests that the artist's inability to produce a satisfactory quality was due to a recent hand injury. This would be a weak argument in favor of the artist's claim, as it would suggest that the artist's inability to produce a satisfactory quality was due to an external factor ( the hand injury, rather than any fault or negligence on the artist's part.\n\nTherefore, the argument that would be LEAST helpful to the artist in his efforts to recover on a breach of contract theory is:\n\n**D. Because of a recent hand injury, the artist did not have sufficient time to produce a portrait of a quality satisfactory to the man.**"
