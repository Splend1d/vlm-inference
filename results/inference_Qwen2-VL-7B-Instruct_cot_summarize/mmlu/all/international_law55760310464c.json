International tribunals share some, but not all, of of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts.\n\nInternational tribunals jurisdiction is indeed influenced by the principles applicable to national courts, but it is also also subject to specific rules and regulations set forth in the founding treaties or charters of these tribunals. These founding treaties often establish the scope of jurisdiction, the types of cases that can be heard, and the procedures for jurisdictional decisions. Therefore, while international tribunals jurisdiction is influenced by general principles of law, it is not solely determined by the UN Security Council or the founding treaties alone."
