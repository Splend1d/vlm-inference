Identity defines actors, and tells us who they are, what their preferences and interests are, and how those preferences might inform their actions.\nB. Identity is of fundamental importance to the social constructivist perspective because it is the basest principle in defining behaviour; it is a naturally bestowed quality comprised of certain unalterable behavioural characteristics.\nC. The identities, interests and behaviour of political agents are socially constructed by shared ideas, collective meaning, and interpretations and assumptions about the world.\nD.
