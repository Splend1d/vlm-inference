This can be expressed as \\( N = mg \\cos \\theta \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of incline.\n\n3. **Friction Force \\( f \\)**: The friction force acts parallel to the plane and is equal to the component of the weight that is parallel to the plane. This can be expressed as \\( f = mg \\sin \\theta \\).\n\n4. **Net Force \\( F_{net} \\)**: The net force acting on the object is the difference between the force parallel to the plane (and the friction force. This can be expressed as \\( F_{net} = mg \\sin \\theta - mg \\mu \\cos \\theta \\), where \\( \\mu \\) is the coefficient of friction.\n\n5. **Acceleration \\( a \\)**: The acceleration of the object is the net force divided by the mass of the object. This can be expressed as \\( a = \\frac{F_{net}}{m} = g \\sin \\theta - g \\mu \\cos \\theta \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the acceleration of the object is \\( a = g \\cos \\theta - \\mu \\sin \\theta \\)."
