Realism emphasizes the state-centric approach, where the primary concern is the national interest, and it often criticizes humanitarian interventions for various reasons.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"Armed force should only ever be used in the national interest and that humanitarian intervention is therefore imprudent.\"\n- This alignss with the realist perspective, as it emphasizes the national interest and suggests that humanitarian interventions are imprudent.\n\nB. \"Foreign intervention reduces the proportion of wars that end in outright victory, it leaves behind an unstable peace that is likely to reignite.\"\n- This also is also consistent with the realist view, as it argues that foreign intervention can lead to unstable peace and the potential for renewed conflict.\n\nC. \"Foreign intervention tends to prolong wars; it is inappropriate and does not work.\"\n- This is also consistent with the realist perspective, as it suggests that foreign intervention prolongs wars and is ineffective.\n\nD. \"Humanitarian intervention prioritises the human as the referent object of security, undermining the state-centric approach of realism.\"\n- This option suggests that humanitarian intervention prioritizes the human over the state, which is a direct challenge to the state-centric approach of realism. This is not an assertion made in the realist case against humanitarian inventions.\n\nTherefore, the option that is not an assertion made in the realist case against humanitarian inventions is:\n\nD. Humanitarian intervention prioritises the human as the referent object of security, undermining the state-centric approach of realism."
