It may get stuck in a local optimum and not find the globally optimal tree.\n\nStatement 2 is True. In probability theory, the probability of a value x from a continuous probability distribution with density f() is indeed equal to f(x). This is because the probability density function (f() gives the relative likelihood for the value x to occur, and the probability of a value occurring within a given interval is the integral of the density function over that interval.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
