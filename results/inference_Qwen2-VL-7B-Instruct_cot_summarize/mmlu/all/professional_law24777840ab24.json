One employee of the department of treasury brought an action claiming a denial of equal protection and due process by taking away his right to a job. It is claimed that the prohibition is necessary to protect the public from potential problems that could arise. Which test of constitutional validity would be likely applied to this regulation?\n\nA. Strict scrutiny, since drug users are a special class of persons often discriminated against by the public.\nB. Intermediate scrutiny, because, like gender, this can be a sensitive area where discrimination is common.\nC. The rational basis test, because discrimination is generally favored with drug users or even those getting treatment.\nD. The rational basis test, because the regulation need only be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid.\n"

When evaluating such a restriction, the court would likely apply the rational basis test. This is because the regulation is not based on a fundamental right or a suspect classification ( (such as race, gender, or national origin), but rather on a general interest in public safety. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The rational basis test, because the regulation need only be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid."
