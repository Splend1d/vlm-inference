A law in the state requires new political entrants (regardless of party affiliation) to obtain three times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident, however, failed to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures to have his name placed on the ballot. The resident filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the authenticating requirement. Which of the following, if established, is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement?\n\nA. The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures.\nB. A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.\nC.

The authenticate requirement is likely being challenged under the First Amendment, which protects the right to free speech and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures.\n- This argument is about the specific case of the resident's petition and does not address the broader constitutional issue. It.\n\nB. A similar authenticate statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.\n- This argument relies on precedent from another state, which may not be directly applicable to the current case. It does not address the compelling state interest or the necessity of the requirement.\n\nC. The authenticate requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n- This argument directly addresses the constitutional requirement that a law must serve a compelling state interest to be valid. It aligns with the Equal Protection Clause, which requires that laws must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\n\nD. Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot.\n- This argument is about the success of other candidates and does not address the necessity or the compelling state interest behind the requirement.\n\nGiven the analysis, the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticate requirement is:\n\nC.
