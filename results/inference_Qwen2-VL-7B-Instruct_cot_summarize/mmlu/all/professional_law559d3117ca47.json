The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.\nB. The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\nC. The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.\nD. The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.\n"

The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Voting Rights and Quorum**: In corporations, the voting rights of preferred stockholders and common stockholders are typically different. Preferred stockholders often have fewer voting rights than common stockholders. In this case, the preferred stockholders have 1,000 shares, while the common stockholders have 1,000 shares.\n\n2. **Majority Requirement**: For a proposal to be approved, it must meet the majority requirement for each class of stock. In this scenario, the proposal requires a majority of the outstanding shares of each class to be approved.\n\n3. **Approval by Class**: The proposal was approved by 700 common shares ( out of 1,000, which is a majority of the common shares. However, it was not approved by 400 preferred shares out of 1,000, which is a majority of the preferred shares.\n\n4. **Majority Requirement for Each Class**: Since the proposal did not receive a majority of the preferred shares ( (400 out of 1,000), it is invalidly approved. The majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve the proposal.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is B."
