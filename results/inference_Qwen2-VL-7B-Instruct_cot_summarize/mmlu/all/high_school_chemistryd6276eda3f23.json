                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Alternate reaction pathways become available at higher temperatures.\n\nExplanation: Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the rate of reaction by providing more energy to the reactant molecules. This energy allows the reactants to overcome the activation energy barrier more easily, leading to more collisions between reactant molecules and a greater distribution of reactant molecules with high velocities. These factors increase the likelihood of successful collisions that lead to the formation of products. However, the availability of alternate reaction pathways is not a direct consequence of increasing temperature. Instead, it is the increased in the number of collisions and the distribution of reactant molecules with high velocities that lead to the formation of products through the primary reaction pathway."
