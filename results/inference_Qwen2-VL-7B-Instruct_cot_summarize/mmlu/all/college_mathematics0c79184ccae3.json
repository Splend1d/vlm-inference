This inequality describes a region that is the union of two triangles, one in the first and third quadrants, and another in the second and fourth quadrants. The vertices of these triangles are at \\((1, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((-1, 0)\\), and \\((0, -1)\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the condition \\(2(x + y) > 1\\). This simplifies to \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly chosen point (x, y) from the given region satisfies \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\), we need to find the area of the region where \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\) within the given triangle and divide it by the total area of the triangle.\n\nThe region where \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\) is a trapezoid within the triangle. The vertices of this trapezoid are at \\((\\frac{1}{2}, 0)\\), \\((0, \\frac{1}{2})\\), \\((-1, 0)\\), and \\((0, -1)\\).\n\nThe area of the trapezoid can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of trapezoid} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{sum of parallel sides}) \\times (\\text{height}) \\]\n\nThe parallel sides of the trapezoid are the lines \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(y = \\frac{1}{2}\\), and the height is the distance between these lines, which is 1.\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of trapezoid} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}) \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nThe total area of the triangle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 1 = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point (x, y) from the given region satisfies \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Area of trapezoid}}{\\text{Area of triangle}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to have led to an incorrect conclusion based on the provided options. Let's re-examine the problem and the calculation more carefully.\n\nUpon re-examining the the problem, we realize that the correct approach involves calculating the area of the region where \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\) within the given triangle and dividing it by the total area of the triangle. The correct calculation should be:\n\nThe area of the trapezoid where \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), but the total area of the triangle is \\(1\\). Therefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the provided options.
