Murder and voluntary manslaughter.\n\nThe man's's actions appear to be a reaction to witnessing a sexual act, which could potentially elevate the crime to voluntary manslaughter if the man acted in the heat of passion after witnessing the act. However, since he used a firearm and killed the neighbor, the court should also also instruct on murder, which is the most serious charge in this scenario. Voluntary manslaughter is a lesser charge that could apply if the man acted in the heat of passion, but murder is the more serious charge that must be considered."
