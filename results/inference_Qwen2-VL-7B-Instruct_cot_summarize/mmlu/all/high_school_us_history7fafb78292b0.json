But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nPresident Jackson's policy was later altered by the\n\nA. Homestead Act of 1862.\nB. Immigration Act of 1921.\nC. Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson.\nD. Dawes Act of 1887.\n"

The passage provided by Benjamin Franklin discusses the Stamp Act, which was a tax imposed by the British Parliament on the American colonies. The passage explains that the tax was considered unfair because it was imposed without the consent of the people and was considered an internal tax, which was forced upon the people without their consent.\n\nPresident Jackson's policy is not directly mentioned in the passage, but the context suggests that the passage is discussing the Stamp Act and its impact on the American colonies. The passage does not provide information about any specific policy of President Jackson that was altered by any of the options provided.\n\nGiven the lack of information about President Jackson's policy in the passage, none of the options (A, B, C, or D can be directly inferred to be the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nNone of the above"
