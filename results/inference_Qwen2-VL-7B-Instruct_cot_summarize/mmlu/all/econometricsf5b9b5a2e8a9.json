This means that the residuals from a regression model are positively correlated with each other. \n\nThe Durbin Watson statistic is defined as:\n\n\\[ DW = \\frac{\\sum_{t=2}^{n} ( (e_{t} - oe_{t-1})^2}{\\sum_{t=1}^{n} oe_{t}^2} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( oe_{t} \\) is the residual at time \\( t \\)\n- \\( o_{t} \\) is the observed value at time \\( t \\)\n\nA value of DW close to zero suggests that the residuals are positively correlated, which implies that the first order autocorrelation coefficient \\( \\rho \\) is close to plus one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
