A pH of 6.0 indicates that Lake B is acidic, not alkaline.\n\nB. Lake B is 100 times more alkaline than Lake A.\n- This statement is incorrect. A pH of 6.0 indicates that Lake B is acidic, not alkaline. Therefore, it cannot be compared to alkalinity.\n\nC. The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 104 M.\n- This statement is incorrect. The pH of Lake B is 6.0, which means the hydrogen ion concentration is \\(10^{-6.0}\\) M, not 104 M.\n\nD. The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain.\n- This statement is correct. Acid rain typically has a pH of around 5.6, which is more acidic than the pH of both Lake A and Lake B. Therefore, both lakes would become more acidic if exposed to acid rain.\n\nThe correct statement is:\n\nD. The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain."
