It suggests that laws should be fair, just, and consistent with the values of a society. This notion is likely to lead to more individual rights and greater liberty, a more genuine community, and a better moral justification for political power. However, it is less likely to lead to authoritarianism, as it would contradict the principles of fairness, justice, and consistency that Dworkin's notion of law as integrity emphasizes."
