An advantage of larger pages is that they lead to smaller page tables.\n   - Larger pages indeed reduce the number of page table entries needed, which can lead to smaller page tables. This is a valid consideration.\n\n II. An advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation.\n   - Smaller pages can indeed reduce internal fragmentation because they can be more efficiently packed on the disk. This is also a valid consideration.\n\n III. Normally, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length, so longer pages can be used advantageously.\n   - The dominant factor in disk access time is typically the seek time, which is the time it takes the disk head to move to the correct track. Page length does not significantly affect seek time. However, longer pages can reduce the number of disk accesses, which can be advantageous in terms of overall system performance.\n\nGiven this analysis, options I and III are valid considerations for choosing the page size in a paging system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I and III only"
