We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nWould the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era?\n\nA. Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal\"\nB. Yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties\nC. No, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism\"\nD. No, because they were largely opponents of Woodrow Wilson\n"

The party's platform emphasized the need for a government that was \"of the people, by the people, and for the people,\" and it was dedicated to maintaining the government's original purpose of serving the people's interests.\n\nThe Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 was a significant piece of legislation that lowered tariffs on many imported goods. This was in line with the Progressive Party's goal of reducing the power of large corporations and promoting fair trade practices. The party was largely supportive of the \"Square Deal\" policies of Theodore Roosevelt, which included measures to regulate business and protect consumers.\n\nGiven this context, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 would likely be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era because it aligns with their core principles of promoting fair trade and reducing corporate power.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal\""
