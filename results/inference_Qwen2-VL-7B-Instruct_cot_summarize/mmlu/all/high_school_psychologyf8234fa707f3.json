Her sample may not have been representative of the population.\n\nThis is because the advice columnist's conclusion is based on a non-random sample of respondents who chose to respond to the column. The sample is likely to be biased towards those who are dissatisfied with having children, as they are more likely to respond to the column seeking advice. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be generalized to the entire population of parents."
