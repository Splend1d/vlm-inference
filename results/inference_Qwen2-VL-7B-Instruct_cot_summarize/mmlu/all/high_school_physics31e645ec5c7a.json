The electric field is given by:\n\nEr = \u20136r^2 + 4r + 3\n\nThe potential difference (V is given by the negative integral of the electric field:\n\nV = -\u222bEr dr\n\nLet's integrate the given equation:\n\nV = -\u222b(-6r^2 + 4r + 3) dr\n\nV = -[-2r^3 + 2r^2 + 3r] + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral from r = 0 to r = 3:\n\nV = -[-2(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3)] + C - [-2(0)^3 + 2(0)^2 + 3(0)] + C\n\nV = -[-54 + 18 + 9] + C - 0 + C\n\nV = -[-71] + C - C\n\nV = 71 V\n\nSo, the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4) is 71 V.
