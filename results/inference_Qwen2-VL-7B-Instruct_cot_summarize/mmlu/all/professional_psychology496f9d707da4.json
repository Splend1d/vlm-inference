One of the most frequent findings is that the right hemisphere is better at processing visual and spatial information, while the left hemisphere is better at processing language and verbal information. This is because the right hemisphere is more involved in processing information that is presented to the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere is more involved in processing information that is presented to the right side of the body."
