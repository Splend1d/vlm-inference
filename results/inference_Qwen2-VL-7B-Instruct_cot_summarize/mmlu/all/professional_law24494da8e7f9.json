When the officer accepted the job, the city's employee benefit plan provided a death benefit to the spouse of any employee who died as a result of any job-related injury. Last year, the city amended its employee benefit plan to deny its death benefit in cases where the death \"was caused by the employee's refusal to accept, for any reason other than its excessive risk to life or health, reasonably available medical care prescribed by a physician.\" After this amendment took effect, the officer was shot while on duty. Because of a sincerely held religious belief, the officer refused to allow a prescribed blood transfusion and, as a result, died from loss of blood. When the officer's spouse applied for the death benefit, the city denied the application on the basis of the amendment to the employee benefit plan. The officer's spouse has challenged the amendment, claiming that, as applied to the officer, it violated the officer's constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. Is the court likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer?\n\nA. No, because it effectively discriminates against a religious practice.\nB. No, because it violates the vested contractual rights of city employees who were hired before the amendment took effect.\nC. Yes, because it does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits.\nD. Yes, because it imposes a condition only on the award of a government benefit and does not impose a penalty on an individual's conduct.\n"
