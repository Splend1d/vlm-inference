                    "text": "To determine which option is most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive in this goose species, we need to consider the implications of the hypothesis and how each option relates to it.\n\nThe hypothesis suggests that cliff nesting is adaptive because it allows the chicks to reach the ocean, despite the risk of falling. This implies that the benefits of cliff nesting outweigh the risks.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Many more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs.\n- This option does not directly address the hypothesis. It only states a fact about the distribution of nesting sites but does not provide information about the survival rates or fitness implications.\n\nB. Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\n- This option directly supports the hypothesis. If cliff nesting confers a higher fitness, it means that the benefits of cliff nesting (such as reaching the ocean) outweigh the risks (such as falling).\n\nC. Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time.\n- While this option explains how the chicks might navigate the cliffs, it does not directly address the fitness implications or the overall adaptive nature of cliff nesting.\n\nD. More chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed.\n- This option contradicts the hypothesis. If more chicks survive the fall than are killed, it would suggest that cliff nesting is not adaptive because the risks are not outweighed by the benefits.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that is most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive is:\n\nB. Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\n\nFinal answer: B. Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting."
