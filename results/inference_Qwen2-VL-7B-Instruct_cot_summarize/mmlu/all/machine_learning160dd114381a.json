                    "text": "To determine the truth of these statements, let's analyze each one individually.\n\n### Statement 1\nThe statement claims that for any two variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) having a joint distribution \\( p(x, y) \\), we always have \\( H[x, y] \\geq H[x] + H[y] \\) where \\( H \\) is the entropy functionunction.\n\nThis statement is actually a version of the **Chain Rule for Entropy**. The Chain Rule for Entropy states that the joint entropy \\( H[x, y] \\) of two random variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is greater than or equal to the sum of their individual entropies \\( H[x] + H[y] \\). Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\\[ H[x, y] \\geq H[x] + H[y] \\]\n\nThis inequality holds true for any joint distribution \\( p(x, y) \\). Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2\nThe statement claims that for some directed graphs, moralization decreases the number of edges present in the graph.\n\nMoralization is a process in graph theory where directed graphs are transformed into undirected graphs by adding edges between all pairs of nodes that have a common parent or child in the directed graph. This process does not necessarily decrease the number of edges in the graph. In fact, moralization typically increases the number of edges because it creates new edges between variables that were previously connected through a common parent or child.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is **False**.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\nC. True, False"
