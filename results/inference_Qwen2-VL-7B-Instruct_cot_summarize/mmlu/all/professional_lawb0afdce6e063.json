A buyer sent a signed letter to a seller that stated: \"Ship 100 boxes of nails at $3 per box, the price quoted in your circular.\" The seller mailed the buyer a signed form acknowledgment that agreed to the buyer's terms and stated on the reverse side: \"Disputes regarding quality shall be arbitrated.\" The buyer did not reply to the seller's acknowledgment, and the seller shipped the nails. When the buyer received the nails, it found their quality to be unsatisfactory and sued the seller for breach of warranty. The seller has asked an attorney whether the parties' contract requires arbitration of the buyer's claim. What is the best advice the attorney can provide?\n\nA. A contract was formed pursuant to conduct when the buyer received the nails, and a court would exclude the arbitration provision from the contract.\nB. A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract. arbitration term became part of the contract.\nC. A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.\nD. No contract exists, because the arbitration term in the seller's acknowledgment created a counteroffer that the buyer never accepted.\n"

A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Formation of the Contract**: The buyer's initial letter and the seller's acknowledgment together form a contract. The acknowledgment is a response to the buyer's offer, and it includes the terms agreed upon by both parties.\n\n2. **Arbitration Clause**: The arbitration clause on the reverse side of the acknowledgment is part of the terms agreed upon when the acknowledgment was sent. This clause is not a separate offer but rather a term of the contract.\n\n3. **Material Alteration**: The arbitration clause is not a material alteration of the contract because it was part of the terms agreed upon when the acknowledgment was sent. The buyer did not object to the arbitration clause when the acknowledgment was received and accepted the terms.\n\n4. **No Counteroffer**: There was no counteroffer by the buyer because the buyer did not respond to the acknowledgment. The buyer's silence does not constitute acceptance of a counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, the arbitration clause is part of the contract, and the court must decide whether it should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract."
