Heritability studies of intelligence suggest that genetic factors play a significant role in intelligence. Therefore, it is most likely that Jim and Tim will have very similar IQs.\n\nScott and Michael, on the other hand, are dizygotic ( fraternal twins, which means they share only about half of their genetic material. While they may have some genetic similarities, their IQs are more likely to be influenced by environmental factors as well. Therefore, it is less likely that Scott and Michael will have very similar IQs compared to Jim and Tim."
