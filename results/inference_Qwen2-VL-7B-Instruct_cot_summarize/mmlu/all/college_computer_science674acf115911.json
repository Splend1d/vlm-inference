Integer multiplication is a function whose inverse, factorization, remains difficult for a large class of inputs.\n\nInteger multiplication is a relatively easy problem, meaning that it can be computed efficiently. However, the inverse operation, integer factorization, is believed to be computationally difficult for large integers. This difficulty is the basis for the security of many cryptographic protocols that rely on the assumption that integer factorization is hard."
