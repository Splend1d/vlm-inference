                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the biological and physical processes described in the theory. The theory suggests that pollen grains, which are initially too large to enter the airways, release starch granules when exposed to water due to osmotic shock. This release of starch granules is small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack.\n\nLet's analyze each option in the context of the theory:\n\nA. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\n- This option suggests that the pollen grains were hypotonic. However, the theory states that the pollen grains are exposed to water, which would make the surrounding environment hypotonic. Therefore, the pollen grains would become hypertonic relative to the surrounding water, leading to osmotic shock and the release of starch granules.\n\nB. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\n- This option suggests that the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than the surrounding environment. This would be consistent with the theory, as the pollen grains would become hypertonic when exposed to water, leading to osmotic shock and the release of starch granules.\n\nC. The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\n- Plasmolysis is the process where plant cells lose water and shrink due to a decrease in the solute concentration inside the cell. This is not consistent with the theory, as the pollen grains are not plant cells and the theory suggests that the pollen grains become hypertonic, not hypotonic.\n\nD. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\n- This option suggests that the pollen grains shrank before rupturing. This is not consistent with the theory, as the pollen grains become hypertonic and rupture due to osmotic shock, not due to shrinking.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct statement is:\n\nB. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment."
