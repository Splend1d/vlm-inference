In protein-coding genes, exons (s can indeed consist of noncoding DNA. Noncoding DNA, also known as introns, is not translated into protein but plays a role in gene regulation and splicing.\n\nB. The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site.\n- This statement is incorrect. The translational start site ( (also known as the start codon) is typically found within the first exon, but it is not always in the first exon. The start codon can be in the first exon, but it can also be in the second or even later exons depending on the gene structure.\n\nC. The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon.\n- This statement is incorrect. The normal termination codon ( (also known as the stop codon) is typically found within the last exon, but it is not always in the last exon. The stop codon can be in the last exon, but it can also be in the penultimate or even earlier ex ex depending on the gene structure.\n\nD. A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames.\n- This statement is incorrect. A coding exon is translated in all three possible forward reading frames ( (also known as the reading frames). The choice of which reading frame to use is determined by the ribosome during translation.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nA. Some ex ex in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA."
