Let's analyze each option to determine which one fits this definition:\n\nA. The number of tosses before a \"5\" appears when tossing a fair die.\n- This is not a binomial random variable because it is not a fixed number of trials. The number of tosses is not predetermined and can be infinite.\n\nB. The number of points a hockey team receives in 10 games, where two points are awarded for wins, one point for ties, and no points for losses.\n- This is not a binomial random variable because the number of trials (10 games) is fixed, but the outcomes (points awarded) are not binary (success or failure. The points awarded depend on the game's result (win, tie, or loss.\n\nC. The number of hearts out of five cards randomly drawn from a deck of 52 cards, without replacement.\n- This is a binomial random variable. It has a fixed number of trials (5 draws, each with two possible outcomes (heart or not a heart, and the probability of drawing a heart remains constant for each draw.\n\nD. The number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers.\n- This is a binomial random variable. It has a fixed number of trials (5 drivers, each with two possible outcomes (wearing seat belts or not, and the probability of not wearing seat belts remains constant for each driver.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The number of hearts out of five cards randomly drawn from a deck of 52 cards, without replacement."
