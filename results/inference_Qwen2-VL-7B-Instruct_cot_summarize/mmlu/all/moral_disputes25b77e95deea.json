The suffering of the puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas the suffering of animals on factory farms is simply a by-product of the conditions dictated by economic considerations.\n- This statement discusses the necessity of suffering for different purposes ( gustatory pleasure vs. economic conditions.\n\nC. Fred could prevent the suffering of the puppies, whereas meat-eatersers can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume.\n- This statement addresses the possibility of preventing suffering in the two scenarios.\n\nD. none of the above\n- This option suggests that none of the statements are discussed by Norcross.\n\nGiven the analysis, option D is the correct choice because it states that none of the above statements are discussed by Norcross, which is consistent with the information provided.\n\nFinal answer: D. none of the above"
