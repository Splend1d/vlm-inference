The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them.

The task is to determine how the second passage undermines traditional historical assumptions.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. The first passage discusses the concept of jihad in Islam, emphasizing that the obligation to wage jihad did not cease until all the world was under the sway of Islam. It also discusses the duty of Muslim rulers to bring about the victory of Islam and the consequences of making peace with infidids.\n\n2. The second passage, attributed to Ibn Jubayr, a Muslim scholar traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem around 1185, describes how Christian merchants were not hindered in Muslim territories, and how Christians treated Muslim hermits kindly.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Showing that state-level antagonisms in the Middle East during the crusading era were not always reflected in personal or economic life.**\n   - This option suggests that the passage undermines the assumption that state-level antagonisms were always reflected in personal or economic interactions. The passage shows that despite the theoretical obligations of jihad, there were instances where Christians treated Muslims kindly and did not hinder their economic activities.\n\nB. **Showing how Middle Eastern Muslims during the crusading era did not take religious obligations as seriously as Christians did.**\n   - This option suggests that the passage undermines the assumption that Muslims did not take religious obligations as seriously as Christians. However, the passage does not provide evidence to support this claim; it focuses more on the treatment of Muslims by Christians rather than the seriousness of religious obligations.\n\nC. **Showing how Muslims were on the whole kinder than Christians in the Middle East during the crusading era.**\n   - This the passage does not provide evidence to support this claim. It only discusses the treatment of Muslims by Christians, not the overall kindness of Muslims compared to Christians.\n\nD. **Showing how, in the Middle East during the crusading era, economic factors trumped all other considerations.**\n   - This the passage does not provide evidence to support this claim. It focuses on the treatment of Muslims by Christians and the duty of Muslim rulers to wage jihad, but it does not discuss economic factors.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**A. Showing that state-level antagonisms in the Middle East during the crusading era were not always reflected in personal or economic life.**\n\nThus, the final answer is A."
