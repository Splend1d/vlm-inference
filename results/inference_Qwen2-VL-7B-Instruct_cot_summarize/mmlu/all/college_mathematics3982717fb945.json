The second derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is:\n\\[ f''(x) = e^x \\]\n\nSince \\( e^x \\) is always positive for all real numbers \\( x \\), the second derivative is positive at \\( x = \\ln(c) \\), which means that \\( x = \\ln(c) \\) is a local minimum.\n\nNow, we evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at \\( x = \\ln(c) \\):\n\\[ f(\\ln(c)) = e^{\\ln(c)} - c\\ln(c) \\]\n\\[ f(\\ln(c)) = c - c\\ln(c) \\]\n\\[ f(\\ln(c)) = c(1 - \\ln(c)) \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\( f \\) is \\( f(\\ln(c)) \\), which corresponds to option D."
