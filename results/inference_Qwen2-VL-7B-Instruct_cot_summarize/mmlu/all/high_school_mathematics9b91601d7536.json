This gives us $n < n - 3$, which simplifies to $3 < 0$, which is not possible. So, there are no solutions in this case.\n\n Case 2: $n > n-3$. This gives us $n > n - 3$, which simplifies to $3 > 0$, which is also not possible. So, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nSo, the first inequality $|n| < |n-3|$ has no solutions.\n\nNow, we need to solve the inequality $|n-3| < 9$. This inequality can be split into two cases:\n\n Case 1: $n-3 < 9$. This gives us $n < 12$.\n\n Case 2: $n-3 > -9$. This gives us $n > -6$.\n\nCombining these two cases, we get $-6 < n < 12$.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of all integer solutions to $-6 < n < 12$. The integer solutions are $-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11$.\n\nThe sum of these integers is $-5 + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = = -9$.\n\nSo, the sum of all integer solutions to $|n| < |n-3| < 9$ is $-9$. The answer is: $A$"
