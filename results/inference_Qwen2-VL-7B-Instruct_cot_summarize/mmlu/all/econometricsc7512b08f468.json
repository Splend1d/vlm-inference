(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nWhen the value of \\( R^2 \\) for an estimated regression model is exactly zero, it indicates that the model does not explain any of the variability of the dependent variable \\( y \\) about its mean value. This means:\n\ni) All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero because the model is not explaining any of the variability in \\( y \\).\n\nii) The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables because the model does not have any explanatory power.\n\niii) The regression line has not explained any of the variability of \\( y \\) about its mean value, which is consistent with the definition of \\( R^2 \\).\n\niv) The intercept coefficient estimate does not necessarily have to be zero. The intercept is the expected value of \\( y \\) when all explanatory variables are zero, and it can be non-zero even if \\( R^2 \\) is zero."
