There are 7 days in a week, so the day of the week repeats every 7 days.\n\nLet's start by calculating the remainder when 10^(10^(10)) is divided by 7, as this will tell us how many days from now it will be the same day of the week as today.\n\nWe can use modular arithmetic to simplify this calculation. We know that:\n\n10 \u2261 3 ( (mod 7)\n\nSo, 10^(10^(10)) \u2261 3^(10^(10)) ( (mod 7)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 3^(10^(10)) is divided by 7. We can use the property of modular arithmetic that says (a^b \u2261 (a^k)^((b/k ) * k) (mod m) where k is the greatest common divisor of b and m.\n\nIn this case, k = 10^(10) and m = 7. Since 10 is not a multiple of 7, we can't simplify further using this property. However, we can use the fact that 3^3 \u2261 27 \u2261 6 ( (mod 7) and 3^6 \u2261 729 \u2261 1 ( (mod 7).\n\nSo, 3^(10^(10)) \u2261 (3^6)^(10^(10)/6) \u2261 1^(10^(10)/6) \u2261 1 ( (mod 7)\n\nThis means that 10^(10^(10)) \u2261 1 ( (mod 7), which means that 10^(10^(10)) days from now will be the same day of the week as today.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nD.
