A program that finds the shortest driving route between two locations on a map\n\nA heuristic is a rule of thumb or a shortcut that can be used to solve a problem more quickly than a brute-force approach. In the case of finding the shortest driving route between two locations, a heuristic can be used to quickly estimate the distance between two points and eliminate unlikely routes. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to find the shortest route."
