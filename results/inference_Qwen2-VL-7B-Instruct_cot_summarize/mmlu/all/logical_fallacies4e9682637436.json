This fallacy is often used to dismiss an argument by attacking the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. attacking the character or background of someone making an argument instead of his or her evidence and reasoning\n- This describes the fallacy of ad hominem, where the argument is dismissed based on the person's character or background rather than the argument itself.\n\nB. responding to charges of wrongdoing by saying other people do the same thing\n- This describes the fallacy of tu quoque, where the argument is dismissed by pointing out that the accuser also does the same thing.\n\nC. arguing against a position only based on personal feelings toward the position\n- This describes the fallacy of emotional appeal, where the argument is dismissed based on the speaker's personal feelings or emotions.\n\nD. responding to an argument with an expression of derision instead of a counter argument\n- This describes the fallacy of appeal to indignation, where the argument is dismissed by expressing derision or ridicule rather than providing a counter argument.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. responding to an argument with an expression of derision instead of a counter argument"
