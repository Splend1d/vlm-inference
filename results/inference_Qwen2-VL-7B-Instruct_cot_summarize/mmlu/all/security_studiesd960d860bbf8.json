A fusion weapon is a three-stage-bomb that uses an implosion device to create a fission reaction, which then detonates a fusion reaction. It is often referred to as a thermo-nuclear or hydrogen device and has unlimited destructive potential.\nB. A fusion reaction is created when the nuclei of two light elements are combined, the reaction resulting in heavier elements fragmenting into smaller parts. This fragmentation releases energy of limited destructive capacity, the extent of energy released dependent on the mass of material used.\nC. A fusion device is a two-stage process where a gun-type device is used to trigger a series of fission reactions with the cumulative result being the production of a high energy flash explosion with unlimited thermal energy.\nD. Fusion weapons have a highly specific destructive effect. The heavier element produced from a fissions reaction, and the difference in mass from the two lighter nuclei (which is translated into an energy explosion) can be precision calculated. Bombs even within the multi-megaton range have unlimited military utility, their destructive capability can be manufactured according to the target.\n"

This fragmentation releases energy of limited destructive capacity, the extent of energy release dependent on the mass of material used.\n\nFusion devices, also known as hydrogen bombs or thermonuclear weapons, use a two-stage process to release energy. In the first stage, a fission reaction is triggered, which then heats up the material to the point where a fusion reaction can occur. The fusion reaction releases a large amount of energy, which is what gives these weapons their destructive power."
