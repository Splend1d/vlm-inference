By integrating the fixed asset module into the new enterprise-wide system, the company can benefit from a more robust, scalable, and secure system that can handle the increasing complexity of fixed asset management. This approach also minimizes the risk of data loss or errors that might occur with a standalone system and ensures that the company's financial records are accurate and up-to date."
