This is because if \\( I \\) is a maximal ideal, then \\( I \\) is not the whole ring \\( R \\), and if \\( a, b \\in R \\) such that \\( ab \\in I \\), then \\( a \\) or \\( b \\) must be in \\( I \\) ( since \\( I \\) is maximal. This property is a direct consequence of the definition of a prime ideal.\n\nStatement 2 is True. If \\( I \\) is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring \\( R \\), then \\( R/I \\) is a field. This is because a quotient ring \\( R/I \\) is a field if and only if \\( I \\) is a maximal ideal. Since \\( I \\) is given to be maximal, \\( R/I \\) is indeed a field.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
