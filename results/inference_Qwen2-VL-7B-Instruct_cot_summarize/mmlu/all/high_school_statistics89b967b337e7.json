                    "text": "To construct a 94% confidence interval for a population proportion, we need to use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution. The confidence interval is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\hat{p \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\hat{p\\) is the sample proportion,\n- \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the upper critical value of the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level,\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nFor a 94% confidence interval, the level of significance (\\(\\alpha\\)) is 0.06 ( (since 100% - 94% = 6%). Therefore, \\(\\alpha/2 = 0.03\\).\n\nThe upper critical value of the standard normal distribution for a 94% confidence interval is the Z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.97 ( (since 0.5 + 0.44 = 0.94).\n\nLooking up the Z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.97 in a standard normal distribution table or using a calculator, we find that the Z-score is approximately 1.88.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1.88"
