A woman made the highest bid, which was $100, and the auctioneer slammed the gavel down, completing the transaction. Before the day's auction ended, an art historian told the auctioneer in private during a break that the piece was an original by Claude Monet, worth about $1 million. The auctioneer quickly told the successful bidder that the amount was rejected by the seller and that the piece would be withdrawn from the sale that day. The woman sued the auctioneer, claiming that there was a binding contract and requesting specific performance. Based strictly on the rules of offer and acceptance, is the auctioneer in danger of losing the painting to the successful bidder and, if so, why?\n\nA. No, the auctioneer can always reject an offer made by a bidder at a public auction sale.\nB. No, the auctioneer is the offeree at a no-reserve auction and, as such, the offeree has the absolute power to reject the offer if it is not accepted by the owner.\nC. Yes, in a no-reserve auction there is a binding contract based on the highest amount offered by the winning bidder.\nD. Yes, in a no-reserve auction there is a binding contract as soon as the bidding starts, with each bid being a new binding contract.\n"

Yes, in a no-reserve auction there is a binding contract based on the highest amount offered by the winning bidder.\n\nIn a no-reserve auction, the auctioneer is essentially selling the item to the highest bidder without any reserve price. Once the auctioneer accepts the highest bid, a binding contract is formed between the auctioneer and the bidder. This contract is legally enforceable, and the auctioneer is obligated to complete the sale to the highest bidder unless there are specific circumstances that justify rejecting the offer, such as fraud or misrepresentation.\n\nIn this case, the auctioneer accepted the highest bid of $100, and the auctioneer completed the transaction by slamming the gavel down. Therefore, a binding contract was formed, and the auctioneer is legally obligated to complete the sale to the successful bidder unless there are specific reasons to reject the offer."
