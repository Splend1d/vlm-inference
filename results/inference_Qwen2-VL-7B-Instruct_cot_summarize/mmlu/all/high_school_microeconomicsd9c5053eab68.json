The demand curve shifts to the right, and the supply curve shifts to the left.\n\nWhen the demand curve shifts to the right, it means that consumers are willing to buy more of the good at each price level, which increases the quantity demanded. When the supply curve shifts to the left, it means that producers are willing to supply less of the good at each price level, which decreases the quantity supplied. \n\nIn a competitive market, an increase in demand and a decrease in supply will lead to a higher equilibrium price, not a lower one. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
