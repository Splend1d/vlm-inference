The EM algorithm consists of two steps: the E-step ( (Expectation step) and the M-step ( (Maximization step). The E-step computes the expected value of the log-likelihood function with respect to the current estimate of the parameters, while the M-step maximizes this expected log-likelihood to find the new parameter estimates. The log-likelihood is guaranteed to increase or stay the same at each iteration of the EM algorithm. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\n\nQ-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. It does not require any prior knowledge of the environment. Instead, it learns by interacting with the environment. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
