It also indicates that Parliament is considering giving and granting rates and duties to raise revenue in America.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. He felt that the Crown needed to control trade and raise revenue.\n- This align with the excerpt, as it mentions the need for new provisions and regulations to improve revenue.\n\nB. He felt that the colonists should help pay the debt incurred by the war.\n- This align with the excerpt, as it mentions raising revenue in the colonies to defray the expenses of defending and protecting them.\n\nC. He felt that Parliament had the right to increase taxes on the colonies.\n- This align with the excerpt, as it mentions giving and granting rates and duties to raise revenue in America.\n\nD. He wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of \"salutary neglect.\"\n- This does not align with the excerpt, as it mentions the need for new provisions and regulations to improve revenue, not rewarding the colonies through \"salutary neglect.\"\n\nTherefore, the statement that does NOT represent the views of Prime Minister Grenville after the French and Indian War is:\n\nD. He wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of \"salutary neglect.\"\n\nFinal answer: D."
