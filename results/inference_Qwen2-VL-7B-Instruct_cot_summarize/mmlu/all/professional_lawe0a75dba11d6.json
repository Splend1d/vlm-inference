Given the circumstances, the rancher had a reasonable belief that it was necessary to land the plane there to protect himself and his airplane. This situation falls under the legal concept of \"eminent domain\" or \"emergent necessity,\" which generally allows for the taking of private property for a public purpose or necessity. In this case, the rancher's action was taken in an emergency situation to prevent a greater harm (the plane crashing and causing damage to the orange grove and potentially harming others. Therefore, the rancher would likely not be held liable for trespassinging."
