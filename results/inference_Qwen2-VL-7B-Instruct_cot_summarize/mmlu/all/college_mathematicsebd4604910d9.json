An ideal \\(I\\) of a ring \\(R\\) is a subset of \\(R\\) that satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. \\(i\\) is an additive subgroup of \\(R\\).\n2. For every \\(a \\in i\\) and \\(r \\in R\\), \\(ar \\in i\\) and \\(ra \\in i\\).\n\nLet's analyze each of the given sets:\n\nI. \\(\\{u + v : u \\in U\\) and \\(v \\in V\\)\\)\n\nThis set consists of all sums of elements from \\(U\\) and \\(V\\). For this set to be an ideal, it must be closed under addition and multiplication by elements of \\(R\\). Since \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are ideals, their sums are also in \\(U\\) and \\(V\\), respectively. However, the sum of elements from \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) may not necessarily be in \\(U\\) or \\(V\\), so this set may not be an ideal.\n\n II. \\(\\{uv : u \\in U\\) and \\(v \\in V\\}\\)\n\nThis set consists of all products of elements from \\(U\\) and \\(V\\). For this set to be an ideal, it must be closed under multiplication by elements of \\(R\\). Since \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are ideals, their products are also in \\(U\\) and \\(V\\), respectively. Therefore, this set is closed under multiplication by elements of \\(R\\), and it must be an ideal.\n\n III. \\(\\{x : x \\in U\\) and \\(x \\in V\\}\\)\n\nThis set consists of all elements \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is in both \\(U\\) and \\(V\\). For this set to be an ideal, it must be closed under addition and multiplication by elements of \\(R\\). Since \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are ideals, their intersection is also in \\(U\\) and \\(V\\), respectively. Therefore, this set is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of \\(R\\), and it must be an ideal.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. III only"
