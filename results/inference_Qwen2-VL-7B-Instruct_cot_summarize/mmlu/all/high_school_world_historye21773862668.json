It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nWhich of the following best characterizes the author's attitude in the passage?\n\nA. Cynicism about the loyalty of a ruler's subjects\nB. Optimism about the fair-mindedness of political leaders\nC. Criticism of the religious establishment\nD. Ambivalence about the future of his economic prospects\n"

Machiavelli argues that it is safer to be feared than loved, as people are generally ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, and covetous. He emphasizes that love is conditional and can be broken easily, while fear is a more reliable deterrent.\n\n3. **Analyze each option:**\n   - **A. Cynicism about the loyalty of a ruler's subjects:**\n     The passage clearly reflects a cynical view of human nature, suggesting that rulers should be wary of the ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, and covetous nature of their subjects. This.\n   - **B. Optimism about the fair-mindedness of political leaders:**\n     The passage does not express optimism about the fair-mindedness of political leaders. Instead, it focuses on the practical aspects of ruling and the nature of human behavior.\n   - **C. Criticism of the religious establishment:**\n     The passage does not discuss the religious establishment or any criticism thereof. It is focused on political leadership and human nature.\n   - **D. Ambivalence about the future of his economic prospects:**\n     The passage does not discuss economic prospects or any ambivalence about them. It is about political leadership and human nature.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer:**\n   The author's attitude in the passage is best characterized by **A. Cynicism about the loyalty of a ruler's subjects**.\n\nFinal answer: A. Cynicism about the loyalty of a ruler's subjects"
