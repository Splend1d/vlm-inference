Each of the five managers will be asked to place the 200 time cards of their respective employees in a bag, shake them up, and randomly draw out six names. The six names from each plant will be put together to make up the sample. Will this method result in a simple random sample of the 1000 employees?\n\nA. Yes, because every employee has the same chance of being selected.\nB. Yes, because every plant is equally represented.\nC. Yes, because this is an example of stratified sampling, which is a special case of simple random sampling.\nD. No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n"

Yes, because this is an example of stratified sampling, which is a special case of simple random sampling.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Simple Random Sampling (**\n  - In simple random sampling, every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. This method does not consider any subgroups within the population.\n\n- **Stratified Sampling**\n  - Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups (called strata, and then drawing a random sample from each stratum. This method ensures that the sample is representative of all subgroups within the population.\n\n- **The Method Described**\n  - The method described involves dividing the population into five strata ( (assembly plants), and then taking a random sample of 6 employees from each stratum. This is an example of stratified sampling.\n\n- **Equal Chance of Selection**\n  - Since each employee has an equal chance of being selected within their respective stratum ( (plant), this method ensures that every employee has an equal chance of being selected overall.\n\nTherefore, the method described results in a stratified random sample, which is a special case of simple random sampling."
