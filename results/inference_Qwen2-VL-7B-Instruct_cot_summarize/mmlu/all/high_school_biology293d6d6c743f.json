Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have no structural similarities.\nC.

Eukaryotic organelles helped create separate environments for metabolic reactions, thus increasing their metabolic efficiency.\n\nThis statement is accurate because the evolution of eukaryotic cells, which include organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum, allowed for compartmentalization of cellular processes. This compartmentalization led to more efficient metabolic reactions by providing specific environments for different biochemical processes, reducing interference between them."
