The grand jury issued a subpoena requiring the corporation to produce all emails and internal documents regarding the corporation's knowledge of the risks of an oil spill. The corporation has objected, citing its Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Can the subpoena be enforced?\n\nA. No, because the corporation was not granted transactional immunity.\nB. No, because the corporation was not granted use-and-derivative-use immunity.\nC. Yes, because a corporation has no Fifth Amendment privilege.\nD. Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents.\n"

Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies primarily to testimonial evidence, not to the compelled production of documents. In the context of a grand jury investigation, the corporation is being required to produce documents rather than testify. Therefore, the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents, and the subpoena can be enforced."
