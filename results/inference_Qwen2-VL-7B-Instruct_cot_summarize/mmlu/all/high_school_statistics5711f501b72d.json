These values can be found using the z-scores associated with these percentiles and the mean and standard deviation of of the distribution.\n\nThe z-score for the 25th percentile is approximately -0.674, and the z-score for the 75th percentile is approximately 0.674.\n\nUsing the formula for z-scores:\n\nz = ( (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere:\nz is the z-score\nX is the value we want to find\n\u03bc is the mean\n\u03c3 is the standard deviation\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for X:\n\nX = \u03bc + z * \u03c3\n\nNow, we can calculate the values for the 25th and 75th percentiles:\n\nFor the 25th percentile ( (X25):\nX25 = \u03bc + z25 * \u03c3\nX25 = 3,250 + (-0.674) * 320\nX25 \u2248 3,034\n\nFor the 75th percentile ( (X75):\nX75 = \u03bc + z75 * \u03c3\nX75 = 3,250 + 0.674 * 320\nX75 \u2248 3,466\n\nSo, the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days is approximately 3,034 to 3,466.\n\nThe correct answer is A.
