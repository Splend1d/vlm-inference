Threats to the state centralize political and economic power, threatening state development\n\nInternational development can be tied to the security of the state because threats to the state often lead to a centralization of political and economic power. This centralization can be a response to perceived threats, such as external aggression or internal instability, and can result in a more authoritarian form of governance. This can, in turn, threaten state development by limiting the ability of the state to engage in productive economic activities and by limiting the ability of citizens to participate in the political process."
