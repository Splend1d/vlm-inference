The school psychologist has included achievement and aptitude scores as predictor variables for firstyear high school GPA in a regression analysis and is considering whether to also administer a school interest inventory and include those scores. The major concern of the school psychologist when making this decision should be which of the following?\n\nA. The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores\nB. The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA\nC. The zero-order correlation of first-year high school GPA and the school interest inventory score\nD. The difference in the correlations of the school interest inventory scores with first-year high school GPA and the aptitude and achievement test scores with first-year high school GPA\n"

The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA\n\nThis is because the school psychologist is considering whether to include the school interest inventory scores as additional predictor variables in the regression analysis. The psychologist needs to evaluate whether including these scores will improve the predictive power of the model, as indicated by the increase in the multiple correlation coefficient. This decision is crucial for determining the utility of the additional variable in explaining variance in first-year high school GPA."
