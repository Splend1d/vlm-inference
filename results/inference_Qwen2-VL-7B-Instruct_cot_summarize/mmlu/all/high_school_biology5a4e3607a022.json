Which of the following statements is correct and gives the correct reason for it?\n\nA. The cell dies because it cannot make ATP.\nB. The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\nC. The cell would need to consume another food source other than glucose because it will not be able to make adequate ATP with only glucose.\nD. The cell will begin to divide rapidly because larger cells require more oxygen and glucose than smaller ones.\n"

The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\n\nThe reason for this is that aerobic respiration is more efficient in terms of ATP production compared to anaerobic respiration. In aerobic respiration, glucose is completely broken down to carbon dioxide and water, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of ATP. In anaerobic respiration, glucose is only partially broken down, releasing less energy in the form of ATP. Therefore, to maintain the same level of energy production, the cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate in an anaerobic environment compared to an aerobic environment."
