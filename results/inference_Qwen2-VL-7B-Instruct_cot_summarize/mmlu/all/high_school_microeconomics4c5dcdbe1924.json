Without knowing the student\u2019s opportunity cost of studying, we have no way of knowing whether or not her marginal benefits outweigh her marginal cost.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is less than the marginal cost. This is not necessarily true. The student might find the fourth hour to be very beneficial, and thus the marginal benefit could be greater than the marginal cost.\n- **Option B** suggests that the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost. This is also not necessarily true. The student might find the fourth hour to be less beneficial, and thus the marginal benefit could be less than the marginal cost.\n- **Option D** suggests that the marginal cost of the third hour was likely greater than the marginal cost of the fourth hour. This is not necessarily true. The marginal cost of studying can vary depending on the student's current state of fatigue, understanding of the material, and other factors. The marginal cost of the third hour might be higher or lower than the fourth hour.\n- **Option C** is the most accurate. The student\u2019s decision to study for one more hour indicates that she believes the marginal benefit of the fourth hour outweighs the marginal cost. However, without knowing the student\u2019s opportunity cost ( (the value of the next best alternative she could have chosen), we cannot definitively say whether her marginal benefits outweigh her marginal costs. The opportunity cost is crucial in determining whether the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
