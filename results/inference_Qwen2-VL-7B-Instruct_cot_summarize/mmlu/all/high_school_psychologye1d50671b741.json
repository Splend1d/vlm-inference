However, the exam is administered at two different times: Wednesday morning for Antrim School and Wednesday afternoon for Barton School. This difference in timing could introduce a confounding variable that affects the results.\n\nA confounding variable is one that influences both the independent variable ( (the exam administration time) and the dependent variable ( (the students' performance). In this case, the timing of the exam administration could potentially affect the students' performance due to factors such as fatigue, hunger, or other environmental conditions that might vary between morning and afternoon.\n\nTherefore, the best identification of a confounding variable in the psychologist's research is:\n\nC. The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools at two different times.\n\nThis variable could potentially confound the results, making it difficult to attribute differences in performance solely to the schools themselves rather than the timing of the exam."
