It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.\n\nThe correlation coefficient is not affected by linear transformations of the variables. This means that adding a constant to all values of one variable, multiplying all values of one variable by a constant, or interchanging the variables will not change the correlation coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the new correlation coefficient will still be 0.19.\n\nThe answer is A."
