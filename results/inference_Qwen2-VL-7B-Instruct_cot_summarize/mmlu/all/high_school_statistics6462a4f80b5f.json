The probability of the union of two events \\( P(A \\cup B) \\) does not directly imply independence. Independence is about the joint probability \\( P(A \\cap B) \\) being equal to the product of the individual probabilities \\( P(A) \\cdot P(B) \\). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. \\( P(A \\cup B) = 1 \\) implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n- If \\( P(A \\cup B) = 1 \\), it means that either event A or event B or both must occur. This does not necessarily mean that A and B are mutually exclusive ( (i.e., \\( A \\cap B = \\emptyset \\)). For example, if A and B are not mutually exclusive, they could still cover the entire sample space. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nC. \\( P(A \\cap B) = 0 \\) implies events A and B are independent.\n- This statement is incorrect. Independence of events A and B means \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B) \\). If \\( P(A \\cap B) = 0 \\), it means that the probability of both A and B occurring is zero, which does not imply independence. Independence requires the joint probability to be equal to the product of the individual probabilities, not zero. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. \\( P(A \\cap B) = 0 \\) implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n- If \\( P(A \\cap B) = 0 \\), it means that the probability of both A and B occurring is zero. This directly implies that A and B cannot occur simultaneously, which is the definition of mutual exclusivity. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nThe correct answer is D."
