HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines.\nB. The patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses.\nC. HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.\nD. A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n"

A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n\nThis explanation alignss with the concept of natural selection, where drug-resistant viruses have a selective advantage over susceptible viruses in the presence of the drug. Over time, the frequency of drug-resistant viruses increases, leading to the dominance of these viruses in the patient's HIV population."
