The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt.\nC. Collisions are common in the asteroid belt and we can track the fragments from their source asteroid to the Earth where they become meteorites.\nD. The asteroid belt is the only possible source of meteorites therefore they must originate there.\n"

Collisions are common in the asteroid belt and we can track the fragments from their source asteroid to the Earth where they become meteorites.\n\nThis is the most scientifically supported answer. Meteorites are often found to be fragments of larger asteroids that have collided with each other or with other bodies in the asteroid belt. By studying the composition and structure of meteorites, scientists can often trace them back to their original asteroid of origin. This is a common practice in the field of meteoritics, the study of meteorites."
