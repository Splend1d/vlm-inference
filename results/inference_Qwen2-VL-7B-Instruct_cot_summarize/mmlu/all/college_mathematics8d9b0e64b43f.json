This principle states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, we want to find the probability that at least one of the variables is greater than 3, so we can find the probability that both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are less than or equal to 3 and subtract this from 1.\n\nGiven that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, the probability that both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are less than or equal to 3 is the product of their individual probabilities of being less than or equal to 3.\n\nThe probability that \\(X\\) is less than or equal to 3 is:\n\\[P(X \\leq 3) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)\\]\n\\[= \\frac{1}{2^1} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{2^3}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{6}{8}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{3}{4}\\]\n\nSimilarly, the probability that \\(Y\\) is less than or equal to 3 is also \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are less than or equal to 3 is:\n\\[P(X \\leq 3 \\ \\text{and} \\ Y \\ \\leq 3) = P(X \\ \\leq 3) \\times P(Y \\ \\leq 3) = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{16}\\]\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one of the variables is greater than 3 by subtractinging the probability that both are less than or equal to 3 from 1:\n\\[P(\\text{at least one is greater than 3}) = 1 - P(X \\ \\leq 3 \\ \\text{and} \\ Y \\ \\ \\leq 3)\\]\n\\[= 1 - \\frac{9}{16}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{7}{16}\\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the provided options.
