Then, we can calculate how far each whale would travel in 32 days at their respective rates and compare the results.\n\nFor the humpback whales:\n- Distance traveled in 28 days = 2,240 miles\n- Daily migration rate = Distance / Days = 2,240 miles / 28 days = 80 miles/day\n\nFor the gray whales:\n- Distance traveled in 32 days = 2,368 miles\n- Daily migration rate = Distance / Days = 2,368 miles / 32 days = 74 miles/day\n\nNow, we calculate how far each whale would travel in 32 days at their respective rates:\n\n- Humpback whales in 32 days = Daily rate * Days = 80 miles/day * 32 days = 2,560 miles\n- Gray whales in 32 days = Daily rate * Days = 74 miles/day * 32 days = 2,368 miles\n\nTo find out how many more miles the humpback whales would have traveled than the gray whales in 32 days, we subtract the distance traveled by the gray whales from the distance traveled by the humpback whales:\n\n2,560 miles ( (humpback whales) - 2,368 miles ( (gray whales) = 192 miles\n\nTherefore, the humpback whales would have traveled 192 miles more than the gray whales if they had traveled at the same rate for 32 days.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 192."
