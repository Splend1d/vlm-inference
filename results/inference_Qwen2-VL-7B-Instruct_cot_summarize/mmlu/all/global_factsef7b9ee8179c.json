                    "text": "To determine how much GDP per capita increased in Japan from 1950 to 2016, we need to consider both inflation and purchasing power parity ( (PPP) adjustments. Here's a step-by-step approach to calculate this:\n\n1. **GDP per capita in 1950**:\n   - Let's assume the GDP per capita in 1950 was $1,000 ( (this is an arbitrary value for illustration purposes).\n\n2. **GDP per capita in 2016**:\n   - Let's assume the GDP per capita in 2016 was $10,000 ( (this is an arbitrary value for illustration purposes).\n\n3. **Inflation Adjustment**:\n   - To adjust for inflation, we need to know the inflation rate from 1950 to 2016. Let's assume the average annual inflation rate was 3%.\n   - The formula to adjust for inflation is: \\( \\text{Adjusted GDP per capita} = \\text{Nominal GDP per capita} \\times ( (1 + \\text{Inflation Rate})^{ \\text{Number of Years} } \\)\n   - Number of years from 1950 to 2016 is 66 years.\n   - \\( \\text{Adjusted GDP per capita in 2016} = 10,000 \\times ( (1 + 0.03)^{66} \\approx 10,000 \\times 2.393 \\approx 23,930 \\)\n\n4. **PPP Adjustment**:\n   - To adjust for PPP, we need to know the PPP index for Japan in 1950 and 2016. Let's assume the PPP index in 1950 was 1 and in 2016 was 2.5.\n   - The formula to adjust for PPP is: \\( \\text{PPP-adjusted GDP per capita} = \\text{Nominal GDP per capita} \\times \\text{PPP Index} \\)\n   - \\( \\text{PPP-adjusted GDP per capita in 2016} = 10,000 \\times 2.5 = 25,000 \\)\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - Nominal GDP per capita in 2016: $10,000\n   - PPP-adjusted GDP per capita in 2016: $25,000\n\n6. **Increase in GDP per capita**:\n   - Increase = PPP-adjusted GDP per capita in 2016 - GDP per capita in 1950\n   - Increase = $25,000 - $1,000 = $24,000\n\n7. **Increase as a multiple**:\n   - Increase as a multiple = $24,000 / $1,000 = 24\n\nTherefore, the GDP per capita increased by approximately 24 times from 1950 to 2016.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\nD. by 20 fold"
