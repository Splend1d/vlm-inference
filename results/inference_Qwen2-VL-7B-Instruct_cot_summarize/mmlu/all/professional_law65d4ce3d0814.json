The defendant timely moved for postconviction relief under the Sixth Amendment on the ground that his attorney had provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial judge, after a hearing, found that the attorney had performed deficiently by failing to raise a proper objection that would have resulted in exclusion of important prosecution evidence. What more, if anything, must the trial court find in order to sustain the defendant's Sixth Amendment claim?\n\nA. Nothing more, because the unjustifiable failure to object to important prosecution evidence is structural error.\nB. That the attorney was court-appointed and not privately retained.\nC. That there is a reasonable probability that the trial's outcome would have been different if the attorney had objected.\nD. That there is clear and convincing evidence that the trial's outcome would have been different if the attorney had objected.\n"

That there is a reasonable probability that the trial's outcome would have been different if the attorney had objected.\n\nIn a Sixth Amendment claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must demonstrate both that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense. The prejudice prong requires the defendant to show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. This is a less stringent standard than the clear and convincing evidence standard, which is typically applied in other contexts.\n\nTherefore, the trial court must find that there is a reasonable probability that the trial's outcome would have been different if the attorney had objected to the prosecution evidence. This means that the court must determine whether the attorney's failure to object was so serious that it it likely affected the outcome of the trial."
