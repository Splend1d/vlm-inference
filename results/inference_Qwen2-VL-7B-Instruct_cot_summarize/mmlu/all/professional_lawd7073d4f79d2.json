The items were displayed on a variety of tables and shelves, which were easily accessible to the customers. While the woman was walking down one of the aisles, her attention became focused on a doll that was prominently exhibited on an overhead display shelf. When the woman approached the doll display, she reached up to grab the doll. As she did so, the woman failed to see a baseball lying on the floor. She tripped over the baseball and fell down, fracturing her hip. If the woman asserts a claim against the toy store for her injuries, will the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur apply on the issue of whether the toy store was negligent and responsible for the baseball being on the floor?\n\nA. Yes, because the woman was a business invitee on the premises of the toy store.\nB. Yes, because the toy store was in control of the premises at the time of the accident.\nC. No, because another customer may have caused the baseball to be on the floor.\nD. No, because the baseball was an intervening act that cuts off the toy store's liability.\n"

                    "text": "The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is a legal principle that allows a plaintiff to infer negligence on the part of the defendant when certain facts are established. This doctrine is typically applied in cases where the plaintiff has been injured by an object or substance that is under the control of the defendant, and the injury is caused by the defendant's failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the premises.\n\nIn the context of the woman's claim against the toy store, the key issue is whether the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be applied to infer negligence on the part of the toy store. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Yes, because the woman was a business invitee on the premises of the toy store.\n- This option is not directly relevant to the application of res ipsa loquitur. The status of the woman as a business invitee is important for determining the duty of care owed by the store, but it does not directly address the applicability of res ipsa loquitur.\n\nB. Yes, because the toy store was in control of the premises at the time of the accident.\n- This option is more relevant. The toy store was in control of the premises, and the baseball was on the floor, which is under the control of the store. This situation fits the criteria for applying res ipsa loquitur.\n\nC. No, because another customer may have caused the baseball to be on the floor.\n- This option suggests that another customer's actions could be the cause of the accident. However, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not require the plaintiff to prove that the defendant's negligence was the sole cause of the accident. It only allows the plaintiff to infer negligence based on the facts presented.\n\nD. No, because the baseball was an intervening act that cuts off the toy store's liability.\n- This option suggests that the baseball was an intervening act that breaks the chain of causation. However, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not consider intervening acts when determining negligence. It allows the plaintiff to infer negligence based on the facts presented.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. Yes, because the toy store was in control of the premises at the time of the accident.\n\nTherefore, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be applied in this case to infer negligence on the part of the toy store."
