This law states that the intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. In other words, if the distance from the source is doubled, the intensity of the radiation is reduced to one-fourth.\n\nGiven that Mercury's orbit is elliptical, we can use the semi-major axis ( (a) and the semi-minor axis ( (b) to calculate the distance from the sun at perihelion and aphelion. The semi-major axis is the average of the perihelion and aphelion distances, and the semi-minor axis is the difference between the perihelion and aphelion distance.\n\nThe semi-major axis ( (a) is:\na = ( ( (0.304 AU) + ( (0.456 AU))/2 = 0.3805 AU\n\nThe semi-minor axis ( ( b) is:\nb =| ( (0.456 AU) - ( (0.304 AU)| = 0.152 AU\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance from the sun at perihelion and aphelion using the following formulas:\n\nDistance at perihelion ( ( d1) = a - b = 0.3805 AU - 0.152 AU = 0.2285 AU\n\nDistance at aphelion ( ( d2) = a + b = 0.3805 AU + 0.152 AU = 0.5325 AU\n\nNow, we can use the inverse square law to calculate the ratio of the solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface for perihelion versus aphelion:\n\nRatio = ( ( (d1)^2 / ( (d2)^2 = ( ( (0.2285 AU)^2 / ( (0.5325 AU)^2 = 0.0520 / 0.2836 = 0.183\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface for perihelion versus aphelion is approximately 0.183, which is closest to option A."
