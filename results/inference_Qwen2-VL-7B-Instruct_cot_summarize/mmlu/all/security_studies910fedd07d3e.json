Resilience refers to the ability of an IT system to identify and defend against a cyber-security threat.\nB. The only way to build a truly resilient IT system is to ensure that it can repel all types of threat and remain and avoid attack.\nC. Resilience in an IT system refers to its ability to function when there are no threats to its security.\nD. Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from attack.\n"

Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from attack.\n\nResilience in the context of cyber-security is crucial because it allows an IT system to withstand and recover from cyber-attacks. This means that even if a system is breached, it can still function and continue to function its operations. This is important because it helps to minimize the impact of cyber-attacks and protect sensitive data and information."
