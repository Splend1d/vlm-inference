Then the number of birds she counted in the morning is $x + 34$.\nThe total number of birds she counted is the sum of the number of birds in the morning and the afternoon, so we have the equation $x + (x + 34) = 76$.\nCombining like terms, we get $2x + 34 = 76$.\nSubtract 34 from both sides, we get $2x = 42$.\nDivide both sides by 2, we get $x = 21$.\nSo, Keiko counted 21 birds in the afternoon.\nThe answer is: A. 21 birds"
