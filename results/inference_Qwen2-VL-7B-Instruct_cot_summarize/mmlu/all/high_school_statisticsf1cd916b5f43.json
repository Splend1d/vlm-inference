A randomized block design, blocked on temperature, with six treatment groups\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- The manufacturer wants to test the effects of four different temperature levels (300, 325, 350, and 375F), two different types of pans (glass and metal), and three different types of ovens (gas, electric, and microwave).\n- There are a total of \\(4 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 24\\) possible combinations of these factors.\n- A completely randomized design would randomly assign the treatments to the experimental units without considering any blocking factors. This would not be the best choice because it does not account for the potential confounding effects of temperature, pan type, and oven type.\n- A randomized block design, on the other hand, involves grouping the experimental units into blocks based on a blocking factor (in this case, temperature. This design helps to reduce variability within blocks and increases the precision of the treatment comparisons.\n- Since there are four temperature levels, we can create four blocks, each containing six treatment groups ( one for each combination of pan type and oven type.\n- Therefore, the correct design is a randomized block design, blocked on temperature, with six treatment groups per block, resulting in a total of 24 treatment groups ( one for each combination of pan type and oven type."
