While it is a common perception that people tend to overestimate their own happiness relative to others, it is not universally true. There are exceptions and cultural differences that can affect how people perceive happiness. Therefore, this statement is an overgeneralization and is likely false.\n\n2. **Statement 2: In the United States, women\u2019s happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men.**\n   - This statement is specific to the United States and claims that women's happiness has increased both absolutely and relatively compared to men. This statement is supported by empirical data. Studies have shown that over time, women's happiness has increased in the United States, both in absolute terms and relative to men's happiness. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. False, True"
