The shopper contended that the doors, which were programmed to swing inward, swung outward and injured him as he attempted to enter the store one afternoon. The shopper's brother-in- law, who was an eyewitness to the accident, was not called to testify at trial. Moreover, the shopper's attorney failed to depose the brother-in-law, who redomiciled out of state shortly after the accident. With respect to the shopper's failure to offer the brother-in-law's testimony at trial, on request by the supermarket's attorney, the court should\n\nA. instruct the jury that it raises the presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nB. instruct the jury that it constitutes an adoptive admission that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nC. permit the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nD. neither instruct the jury on the matter nor permit the supermarket's attorney to argue the matter.\n"
