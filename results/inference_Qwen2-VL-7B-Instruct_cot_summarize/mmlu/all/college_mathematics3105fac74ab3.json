Since \\( f \\) is Lebesgue integrable, it is bounded. However, being Lebesgue integrable does not necessarily imply that \\( f \\) is continuous almost everywhere. For example, the characteristic function of the rationals numbers is Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.\n\n### Option B: There does not exist a countably infinite \\( E \\) of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( f \\) is nondifferentiable at every \\( x \\in E \\).\nFor a function to be nondifferentiable at every point in a set \\( E \\), it must be discontinuous at every point in \\( E \\). Since \\( f \\) is Lebesgue integrable, it is bounded and continuous almost everywhere. Therefore, it cannot be nondifferentiable at every point in a countably infinite set \\( E \\), because such a set would imply that \\( f \\) is discontinuous at every point in \\( E \\), which contradicts the fact that \\( f \\) is Lebesgue integrable. Hence, this option must be true.\n\n### Option C: There does not exist an uncountable subset \\( E \\) of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( f \\) is nondifferentiable at every \\( x \\in E \\).\nFor a function to be nondifferentiable at every point in an uncountable set \\( E \\), it must be discontinuous at every point in \\( E \\). Since \\( f \\) is Lebesgue integrable, it is bounded and continuous almost everywhere. Therefore, it cannot be nondifferentiable at every point in an uncountable set \\( E \\), because such a set would imply that \\( f \\) is discontinuous at every point in \\( E \\), which contradicts the fact that \\( f \\) is Lebesgue integrable. Hence, this option must be true.\n\n### Option D: None of the above.\nSince both Option B and Option C are true, this option is not correct.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is **Option B and Option C**."
