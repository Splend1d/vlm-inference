It was a late autunm afternoon, and the football team was practicing for its upcoming game against its archrival. While the team was practicing, the skies darkened as a storm approached. Minutes later, it began to rain heavily. Even though the storm intensified, the coach did not stop the practice because he had no reason to believe the storm presented a danger to his players. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck and killed the team's star player. This jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity, and a school board may be sued as a private entity. If the player's parents bring a wrongful death action against the coach and the high school board, will they prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the player was injured while engaged in a school activity.\nB. Yes, because under the circumstances the coach would be strictly liable.\nC. No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.\nD. No, because lightning is an act of God.\n"

No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.\n\nIn this scenario, the coach's decision to continue the practice despite the storm and the subsequent lightning strike leading to the death of the star player would likely be scrutinized for negligence. The fact that the jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity means that the school board can be sued as a private entity. The coach's failure to recognize the danger posed by the storm and the potential for lightning to strike could be seen as a breach of duty of care owed to the players. Therefore, the parents of the deceased player might have grounds to argue that the coach was negligent in continuing the practice under such conditions."
