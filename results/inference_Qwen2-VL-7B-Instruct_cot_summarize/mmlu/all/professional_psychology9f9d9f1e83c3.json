The correct completion of the analogy should involve two brain lobes that are involved in these senses.\n\nA. \"parietal lobe is to temporal lobe.\"\n- This is incorrect because the parietal lobe is involved in sensory processing, including touch, temperature, and pain, while the temporal lobe is involved in hearing.\n\nB. \"occipital lobe is to parietal lobe.\"\n- This is incorrect because the occipital lobe is involved in vision, while the parietal lobe is involved in sensory processing.\n\nC. \"frontal lobe is to occipital lobe.\"\n- This is incorrect because the frontal lobe is involved in motor functions and executive functions, while the occipital lobe is involved in vision.\n\nD. \"occipital lobe is to temporal lobe.\"\n- This is correct because the occipital lobe is involved in vision, and the temporal lobe is involved in hearing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
