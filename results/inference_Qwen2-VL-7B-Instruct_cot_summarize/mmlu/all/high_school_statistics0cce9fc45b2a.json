                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement about the correlation coefficient:\n\nA. The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line may have opposite signs.\n- This statement is true. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. The slope of the regression line, on the other hand, indicates the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the independent variable. If the correlation coefficient is positive, the slope of the regression line will also be positive. If the correlation coefficient is negative, the slope of the regression line will be negative. Therefore, the correlation coefficient and the slope can indeed have opposite signs.\n\nB. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables.\n- This statement is false. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship between the variables, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable increases in a perfectly linear manner. However, this does not imply a cause-and-effect relationship. Correlation does not imply causation.\n\nC. Correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line.\n- This statement is true. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the linear relationship. Both +0.87 and -0.87 have the same absolute value, meaning they both indicate a strong linear relationship. The sign of the correlation coefficient only indicates the direction of the relationship, not the strength.\n\nD. Correlation applies equally well to quantitative and categorical data.\n- This statement is false. Correlation is specifically designed for quantitative data. It measures the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. For categorical data, other measures such as contingency tables or chi-square tests are more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nC. Correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line."
