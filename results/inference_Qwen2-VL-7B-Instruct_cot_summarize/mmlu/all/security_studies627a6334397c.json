Historical materialism as a paradigm is opposed to the broad goals of the global justice movement, which advocates an expansion of neo-liberalism in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\nB. Historical materialism has an established history of supporting global justice and opposing inequality; during the Cold War it was the basis of opposition to repressive communist states.\nC. Historical materialism does not provide any unique perspective on capitalism, and is more concerned with the history of capitalist trade than with exploitation or alienation of populations in the system.\nD. Historical materialism can concern both human rights and economic rights. It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.\n"

It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.\n\nExplanation: Historical materialism, a theory developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, focuses on the economic and social conditions that shape human societies. It emphasizes the role of class struggle and the exploitation of workers by capitalists. This theory has been influential in various social movements, including those advocating for global justice. The global justice movement seeks to address issues of economic inequality, environmental degradation, and human rights abuses, which align with the concerns of historical materialism. The movement has been involved in anti-globalization protests and has supported alternative economic models that challenge the dominance of neoliberal policies."
