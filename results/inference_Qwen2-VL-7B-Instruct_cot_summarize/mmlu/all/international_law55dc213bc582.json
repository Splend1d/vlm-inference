This alignss with the concept of \"cumulative acts\" or \"cumulative incidents\" leading to an armed attack.\n\n2. **Option B: The concept of an armed attack refers to a single attack, not multiple smaller instances of armed force**\n   - This option suggests that the ICJ views an armed attack as a single, significant event rather than a series of smaller incidents. This is contrary to the concept of cumulative acts leading to an armed attack.\n\n3. **Option C: In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory**\n   - This option suggests that the ICJ explicitly rejected the idea of an armed attack arising from a series of smaller, cumulative incidents in the Nicaragua case. This is consistent with the concept of cumulative acts leading to an armed attack.\n\n4. **Option D: The ICJ has never addressed this issue**\n   - This option suggests that the ICJ has not considered the idea of an armed attack arising from a series of smaller, cumulative incidents. This is incorrect because the concept of cumulative acts leading to an armed attack has been discussed and considered by the ICJ.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory**"
