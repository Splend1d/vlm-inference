The product of two subgroups \\( HK \\) is defined as the set of all elements of the form \\( hk \\) where \\( h \\in H \\) and \\( k \\in K \\). If \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), then \\( HK \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) because the normality of \\( H \\) ensures that the product of elements from \\( H \\) and \\( K \\) and their inverses are also in \\( HK \\). This property is known as the normal closure property.\n\n### Statement 2\nAll groups of order \\( p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is prime are Abelian.\n\nThis statement is also true. A group of order \\( p^2 \\) is a \\( p \\)-group, and by the classification of finite \\( p \\)-groups, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order \\( p \\). In both cases, the group is Abelian. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order \\( p \\) is Abelian because the operation in the direct product is defined component-wise, and in a group of prime order, every non-identity element has order \\( p \\), which implies that the group is cyclic and hence Abelian.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
