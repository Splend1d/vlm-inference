He told police that \"I didn't even get any money from the art museum. It all went to the first guy and the second guy.\" When the first and second guy go on trial for the theft of the art painting, is the driver's statement admissible in court?\n\nA. Yes, as an admission by a party opponent.\nB. Yes, as a statement against the interests of the other defendants.\nC. No, because it was made while in custody and therefore is unreliable.\nD. No, because the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus it is hearsay.\n"

Hearsay is a statement made outside of court that is offered in court to prove the truth of the matter asserted. For a statement to be admissible as hearsay, it must have been made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy. Since the driver's statement was made after the conspiracy had ended, it is not admissible as hearsay."
