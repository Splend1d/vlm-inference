The sets have identical medians.\n- The median of a set is the middle value when the elements are arranged in ascending order.\n- For set X: 10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90. The middle value is 50.\n- For set Y: 10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90. The middle value is 50.\n- Therefore, the medians are identical.\n\n### B. The sets have identical means.\n- The mean ( (average) of a set is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.\n- For set X: \\( \\frac{{10 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90}{7} = \\frac{{310}{7} \\approx 44.29 \\)\n- For set Y: \\( \\frac{10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90}{7} = \\frac{310}{7} \\approx 44.29 \\)\n- Therefore, the means are identical.\n\n### C. The sets have identical ranges.\n- The range of a set is the difference between the largest and smallest elements.\n- For set X: \\( 90 - 10 = 80 \\)\n- For set Y: \\( 90 - 10 = 80 \\)\n- Therefore, the ranges are identical.\n\n### D. None of the above are false.\n- Since all the previous statements are true, this option is also correct.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that is false is:\n\n**B. The sets have identical means.**"
