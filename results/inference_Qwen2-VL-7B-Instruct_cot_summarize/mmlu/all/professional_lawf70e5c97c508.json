During direct examination, the informer testified that he was unemployed but sometimes worked part-time as a substitute teacher. On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the informer if he had recently filed an application to become a police officer. The informer responded affirmatively. The defendant's attorney then asked the informer the following question:\"Isn't it true that you hope that by acting as an undercover agent, the police department will overlook the fact that you had two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana?\" The prosecuting attorney immediately objected. The trial judge should rule that the defendant's attorney's inquiry concerning the informer's hopes and misdemeanor convictions is\n\nA. improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.\nB. improper, as relating to convictions of crimes not punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\nC. proper, as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness.\nD. proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.\n"

The focus should be on the informer's credibility and reliability in testifying about the defendant's knowledge of the stolen property, not on unrelated personal conduct or past convictions."
