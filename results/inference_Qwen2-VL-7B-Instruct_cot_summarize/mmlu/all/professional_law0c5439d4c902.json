The witness proposes to testify that when the beating stopped, the victim screamed, \"I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this. \"Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's proffered testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an excited utterance.\nB. admissible as a dying declaration.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the victim was not questioned about the statement before being excused.\n"
