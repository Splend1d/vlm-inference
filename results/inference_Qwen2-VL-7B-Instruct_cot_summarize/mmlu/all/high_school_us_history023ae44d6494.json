We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nOf the following policies, which was NOT a main objective of American Progressives?\n\nA.

It also also advocates for the public welfare to be prioritized.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. Passage of of the Pure Food and Water Act\n- This policy aligns with the Progressive Party's focus on improving public health and safety, which is consistent with their emphasis on the public welfare and the need for government intervention to protect citizens.\n\nB. Creation of national forests and protected wildlife reserves\n- This policy also align with the Progressive Party's concern for the environment and the need to preserve natural resources for the public good, which is consistent with their emphasis on the public welfare and the need for government intervention to protect citizens.\n\nC. Initiation of antitrust lawsuits against various corporate monopolies\n- This policy align with the Progressive Party's focus on economic justice and the need to prevent corporate monopolies from exploiting the public, which is consistent with their emphasis on the public welfare and the need for government intervention to protect citizens.\n\nD. Intervention in the affairs of Central American governments\n- This policy does not align with the Progressive Party's focus on domestic issues and the need to prioritize the public welfare within the United States. Instead, it suggests an interventionist foreign policy, which is not mentioned in the Progressive Party Platform.\n\nTherefore, the policy that was NOT a main objective of American Progressives is:\n\nD. Intervention in the affairs of Central American governments"
