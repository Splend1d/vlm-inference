In other words:\n\nA. there is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another.\n\nThis option correctly captures the idea that the definition of philosophy is not based on a single, clear-cut feature but rather on a set of overlapping characteristics that are shared by various issues.\n\nB. the way we come to think about philosophy, love, or art really depends on how we were raised by our families to identify things as resembling one another.\n\nThis option suggests that our understanding of these concepts is influenced by our upbringing, which is not directly related to the definition of philosophy as a \"family resemblance\" concept.\n\nC. the necessary and sufficient condition for something to be considered philosophic is that it answers either of these questions: What does it mean? and How do you know?\n\nThis option suggests that the definition of philosophy is based on answering certain questions, which is not aligned with the idea of \"family resemblance\" where there is no single feature that defines philosophy.\n\nD. philosophy is not a closed discipline insofar as it is willing to accept any answer suggested by the \"human family\" as being true.\n\nThis option suggests that philosophy is open to any answer, which is not aligned with the idea of \"family resemblance\" where there is an overlapping set of characteristics that define philosophy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. there is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another."
