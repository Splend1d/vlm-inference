The margins obtained by different kernels on a training set do not necessarily correlate with the performance of the classifier on the test set. The performance on the test set depends on various factors such as the complexity of the model, the choice of hyperparameters, and the generalization ability of the model, which are not directly related to the margin values obtained by different kernels.\n\nStatement 2: The activation function of BERT is the GELU.\n\nThis statement is false. BERT uses the ReLU activation function for its hidden layers. The GELU activation function is not used in BERT.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
