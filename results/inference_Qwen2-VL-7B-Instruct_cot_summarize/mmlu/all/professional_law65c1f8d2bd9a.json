They paced back and forth, walked around the store, and periodically looked in the window. The experienced officer feared that these individuals were most likely \"casing\" the place prior to robbing it. He approached, identified himself, and patted down the outer clothing of each. He found a hand gun in each man's pocket and arrested them for carrying concealed weapons. Will the court suppress the guns on the basis that there was no probable cause and the search was unconstitutional?\n\nA. Yes, because there was no probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed.\nB. No, because the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that there might be criminal activity afoot.\nC. No, because the officer did have probable cause to believe that a crime was being attempted.\nD. Yes, because the officer is not allowed to take anything out of the men's pockets while conducting a pat-down.\n"

No, because the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that there might be criminal activity afoot.\n\nThe officer's actions were based on reasonable suspicion, which is a lower standard of than probable cause. Reasonable suspicion allows law enforcement officers to conduct a pat-down search of an individual's outer clothing to ensure their safety and to prevent the immediate acquisition of evidence. In this case, the officer's observations of the men's suspicious behavior provided him with reasonable suspicion to justify the pat-down search. Therefore, the court is unlikely to suppress the guns on the basis that there was no probable cause and the search was unconstitutional."
