Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three judge to a one judge formation.\n- This statement is false. Protocol 14 did not change the committee that hears admissibility cases. It introduced a new criterion for admissibility, but it did not alter the composition of the committee.\n\nB. Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility.\n- This statement is true. Protocol 14 introduced a new criterion for admissibility, which is that a case must be \"admissible\" within six months of the expiry of the time-limit for bringing a case before the Court.\n\nC. Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights.\n- This statement is false. Protocol 14 did not abolish the Commission of Human Rights. It merely changed its name to the European Commission for Human Rights.\n\nD. Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.\n- This statement is true. Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights from 12 years to 18 years.\n\nBased on the analysis, the false statement is:\n\nA. Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three judge to a one judge formation."
