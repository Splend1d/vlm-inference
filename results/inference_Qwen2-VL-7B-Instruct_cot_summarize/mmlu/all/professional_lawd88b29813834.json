With every prescription of this drug distributed, the company inserted a written warning, which stated:\"Use of this drug may cause dizziness. \"In accordance with the prescription, the plaintiff received a four-day supply of the drug from his neighborhood pharmacy, which passed along the warning to the plaintiff. After two days, the plaintiff felt much better and went back to work at a home improvement store, where he was the manager. The plaintiff continued to take the drug until his supply was exhausted. On the fourth day, the plaintiff took his final capsule at 2:00 p. m. While he was driving his car home at 5:45 that afternoon, he became dizzy and crashed into a tree. As a result, he received multiple injuries. The plaintiff decided to consult an attorney, who filed a lawsuit on the plaintiff's behalf against the pharmaceutical company, alleging that the company was responsible for the accident and resulting injuries on the theories of negligence and strict liability. At trial, the plaintiff's attorney attempts to introduce evidence that subsequent to this accident, the company expanded its warning to read: \"Use of this drug may cause dizziness. Do not drive for five hours after use. \"Such evidence is\n\nA. admissible as an indication that the company did not use due care in wording its original warning.\nB. admissible as a declaration against interest, to prove the possibility of alternate warnings.\nC. inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning.\nD. inadmissible, because the subsequent warning is not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning.\n"

Admissible as a declaration against interest, to prove the possibility of alternate warnings.\n\nThe subsequent warning, which was expanded to include a recommendation not to drive for five hours after use, is admissible as a declaration against interest. This is because it is a statement made by the pharmaceutical company subsequent to the accident, which is relevant to the possibility of alternate warnings that could have been provided to prevent the plaintiff's injuries. The plaintiff's attorney can use this evidence to argue that the company could have provided a more comprehensive warning to prevent the plaintiff from driving while dizzy and thus could have been negligent in its original warning."
