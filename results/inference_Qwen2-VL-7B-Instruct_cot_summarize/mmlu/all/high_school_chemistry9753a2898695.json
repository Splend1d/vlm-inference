The partial vapor pressure of each component is given by the product of its mole fraction and its vapor pressure.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( P_A \\) as the vapor pressure of solvent A ( (345 torr)\n- \\( P_B \\) as the vapor pressure of solvent B ( (213 torr)\n- \\( x_A \\) as the mole fraction of solvent A ( (0.285)\n- \\( x_B \\) as the mole fraction of solvent B ( (1 - \\( x_A \\) = 1 - 0.285 = 0.715)\n\nThe vapor pressure of the mixture (\\( P_{mixture} \\)) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ P_{mixture} = x_A \\cdot P_A + x_B \\cdot P_B \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P_{mixture} = 0.285 \\cdot 345 \\, \\text{torr} + 0.715 \\cdot 213 \\, \\text{torr} \\]\n\n\\[ P_{mixture} = 100.625 \\, \\text{torr} + 151.495 \\, \\text{torr} \\]\n\n\\[ P_{mixture} = 252.12 \\, \\text{torr} \\]\n\nThe closest answer to 252.12 torr is:\n\nD. 251 torr"
