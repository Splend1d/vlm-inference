Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?\n\nA. The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India\nB. British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company\nC. Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority\nD. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government\n"

The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India:** This passage does not mention any such outcome. The focus is on the imposition of direct rule by the British government.\n   - **B. British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company:** This passage does not support this outcome. The revolt shattered the monopoly of violence, and the British response was to impose direct rule.\n   - **C. Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority:** this is not mentioned in the passages. The revolt did not lead to full independence.\n   - **D. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government:** this is consistent with the information provided. The revolt led to the British imposing direct rule, as described in both passages.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe correct outcome of the events discussed in both passages is:\n**D. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government.**"
