And I do not know whether the Creator will grant relief immediately so that I can come home, or whether matters will take time, for I cannot come home with nothing. Now the matter is in your hand. If you wish to end our marriage, accept this bill of repudiation, and you are free. May God inspire you with the right decision.\nLetter from a Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo, ca. 1200\nThe passage above is best seen in light of which of the following historical developments?\n\nA. The formation of far-flung diaspora communities as a result of interregional commerce\nB. The continued use of organized religion to justify patriarchy\nC.

This scenario is characteristic of the diaspora communities that formed as a result of interregional commerce, which was common during the medieval period."
