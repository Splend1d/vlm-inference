No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.\n\nExplanation: The police had probable cause to suspect the man of murder, and they went to his home to arrest him. They knocked and announced, but when they heard no response, they forcibly broke open the door and entered the house. They did not find anyone but seized a handgun that was in plain view. The suspect was later arrested for murder, and he filed for the suppression of the gun. The court would likely not throw out the gun because the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances ( (the lack of response to the knock and announcement) and the gun was in plain view."
