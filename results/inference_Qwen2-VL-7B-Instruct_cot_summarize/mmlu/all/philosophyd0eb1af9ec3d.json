According to Socratic philosophy, wisdom involves understanding the fundamental principles or essences of justice and virtue, rather than merely memorizinging specific examples of these concepts.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. By knowing enough examples of justice or virtue, we will live a worthwhile life even if we do not know what makes them examples of justice or virtue.\n- This option suggests that knowing examples is sufficient for living a worthwhile life, which is not consistent with Socratic philosophy. Socrates emphasizes understanding the essence, not just examples.\n\nB. Knowledge of individual examples alone would not prepare someone for situations of justice or virtue to which the example do not immediately apply.\n- This option suggests that examples alone are insufficient for understanding justice or virtue in all situations. This aligns with Socratic belief that understanding the essence is necessary.\n\nC. What makes an action just or virtuous can be known only by asking people for their opinions and respecting each answer as equally valuable.\n- This option suggests that opinions of others are equally valuable, which is not consistent with socratic belief that wisdom involves understanding the essence.\n\nD. Justice and virtue are universal goals of all human beings, even if people do not always agree on how to achieve those ends.\n- This option suggest that justice and virtue are universal goals, which is true but does not directly address the task of the wise and virtuous person.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most consistent with Socrates' view is:\n\nB. Knowledge of individual example alone would not prepare someone for situations of justice or virtue to which the example do not immediately apply.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
