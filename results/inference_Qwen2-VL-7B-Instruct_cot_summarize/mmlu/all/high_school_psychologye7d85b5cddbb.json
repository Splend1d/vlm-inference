This sequence of events can be best explained by:\n\nA. Selya's general adaptation syndrome\n\nSelye's general adaptation syndrome describes the body's response to stress, which includes a fight-or-flight response, a stress response, and a stage of exhaustion. Conrad's increased in study hours could be seen as a stressoror, leading to the flu, which is a stage of exhaustion in the general adaptation syndrome.\n\nThe other theories do not directly relate to the sequence of events described:\n\nB. Yerkes-Dodson law explains the relationship between stress and performance, but it does not explain the progression of events described.\n\nC. Thorndike's law of effect explains the relationship between behavior and consequences, but it does not explain the progression of events described.\n\nD. Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory explains the relationship between attitudes and behavior, but it does not explain the progression of events described."
