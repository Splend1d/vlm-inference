                    "text": "To determine the H+ (aq) concentration in a 1.0 M phenol solution, we can use the dissociation constant (Ka for phenol, which is 1 \u00d7 10^-10. Phenol is a weak monoprotic acid, and its dissociation in water can be represented by the following equilibrium:\n\nC6H5OH (aq) + H2O(l) \u21cc C6H5O- (aq) + H3O+ (aq)\n\nThe dissociation constant Ka is given by:\n\nKa = [C6H5O-][H3O+] / [C6H5OH]\n\nWe are given that [C6H5OH] = 1.0 M. Since phenol is a weak acid, we can assume that the concentration of C6H5O- is much smaller than the initial concentration of C6H5OH. Therefore, we can approximate [C6H5O-] \u2248 [H3O+].\n\nLet x be the concentration of C6H5O- and H3O+. Then, we can write:\n\nKa = (t^2 / (1.0 - t)\n\nSince t is much smaller than 1.0, we can approximate 1.0 - t \u2248 1.0. Therefore, we have:\n\n1 \u00d7 10^-10 \u2248 t^2 / 1.0\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt \u2248 \u221a(1 \u00d7 10^-10) \u2248 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M\n\nTherefore, the H+ (aq) concentration in a 1.0 M phenol solution is approximately 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M.\n\nThe correct answer is D."
