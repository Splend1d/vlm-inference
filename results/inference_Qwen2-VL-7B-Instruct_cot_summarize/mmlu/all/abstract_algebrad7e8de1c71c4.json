The order of \\(G + H\\) is the number of elements in this set, which is \\(|G|\\) times \\(|H|\\), since each element of \\(G\\) can be paired with each element of \\(H\\). Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n### Statement 2\nThe statement claims that if \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\), then the internal direct product \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) has a subgroup isomorphic to \\(Z_r + Z_s\\).\n\nThe internal direct product \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) is the direct sum of the cyclic groups \\(Z_m\\) and \\(Z_n\\), which is isomorphic to \\(Z_{mn}\\) ( because the direct sum of cyclic groups of coprime orders is isomorphic to the cyclic group of the product of their orders. However, the statement is asking for a subgroup isomorphic to \\(Z_r + Z_s\\), which is not necessarily true. The subgroup of \\(Z_{mn}\\) isomorphic to \\(Z_r + Z_s\\) would depend on the specific values of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(r\\), and \\(s\\), and it is not guaranteed to exist for all possible values of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(r\\), and \\(s\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is:\nC. True, False"
