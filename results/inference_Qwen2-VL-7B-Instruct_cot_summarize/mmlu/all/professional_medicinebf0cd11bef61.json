Acute cholecystitis\n\nThe symptoms described, including band-like, burning pain in the right upper abdomen extending to the midline of the back, are consistent with acute cholecystitis. The absence of abdominal tenderness to palpation and normal findings on ultrasonography of the gallbladder and serum amylase levels suggest that the pain is not due to pancreatitis or other conditions that typically cause more localized pain and tenderness. Acute cholecystitis is a common cause of right upper quadrant pain and can present with similar symptoms."
