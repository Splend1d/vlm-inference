The complexity of the mechanisms regulating the absorption of cholesterol and its export in lipoproteins: The body has mechanisms to regulate cholesterol absorption and export, which can influence LDL cholesterol levels.\n\nB. The complexity of the mechanism controlling the clearance of intestinally derived lipoproteins by the liver: The liver plays a crucial role in clearing cholesterol from the body, and this process can be influenced by dietary cholesterol.\n\nC. The multiple intrahepatic responses to increased cellular cholesterol: The liver responds to increased cholesterol levels in various ways, which can affect LDL cholesterol levels.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors contribute to the inconclusiveness of the evidence regarding the relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels in humans."
