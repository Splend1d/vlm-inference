We can use the Consumer Price Index (CPI to do this.\n   - The CPI in 1850 was approximately 10.\n   - The CPI in 2011 was approximately 220.\n   - The formula to adjust for inflation is: \\( \\text{Adjusted GDP per capita} = \\frac{\\text{GDP per capita in 1850}}{\\text{CPI in 1850}} \\times \\text{CPI in 2011} \\).\n   - Plugging in the values: \\( \\frac{300}{10} \\times 220 = 30 \\times 220 = 6600 \\).\n\n3. **Adjust for PPP:**\n   - To adjust for PPP, we need to compare the GDP per capita in the United States to the GDP per capita in other countries in 2011.\n   - According to the World Bank, the GDP per capita in the United States in 2011 was approximately $50,000.\n   - The PPP adjustment factor is calculated by dividing the GDP per capita in the United States by the GDP per capita in the country being compared.\n   - The GDP per capita in the United States in 2011 was $50,000, and the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 was $6600.\n   - The PPP adjustment factor is: \\( \\frac{50,000}{6600} \\approx 7.58 \\).\n\n4. **Final adjustment:**\n   - The final GDP per capita in 1850, adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, is: \\( 6600 \\times 7.58 \\approx 50,000 \\).\n\nTherefore, the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850, when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, is approximately $50,000.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\n\nD.
