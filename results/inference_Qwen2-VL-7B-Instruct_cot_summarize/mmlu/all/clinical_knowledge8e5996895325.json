They may have difficulty reading the screen.\n\nCareful consideration should be given to providing people aged over 65 with information sources that are internet-based because they may have difficulty reading the screen. This is due to a variety of factors, including age-related changes in vision, such as presbyopia ( (which affects the ability to focus on close objects), as well as potential challenges with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Providing accessible and user-friendly internet-based information sources can help ensure that older adults have access to the information they need to stay informed and engaged in their communities."
