This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nA. invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\nB. invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\nC. valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\nD. valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n"

The state's tax on pitchblende would interfere with this federal power, and therefore, the state tax would be invalid under the supremacy clause of the Constitution."
