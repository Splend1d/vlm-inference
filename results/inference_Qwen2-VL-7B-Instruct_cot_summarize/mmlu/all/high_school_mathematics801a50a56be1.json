Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles and each pile had an equal number of pins, he had a total of \\(2x\\) pins.\n\nJohn gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means he gave away \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times x = \\frac{x}{6}\\) pins to his brother.\n\nAfter giving away \\(\\frac{x}{6}\\) pins, John had \\(2x - \\frac{x}{6}\\) pins left. According to the problem, this equals 66 pins. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[2x - \\frac{x}{6} = 66\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6, and rewrite the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{{12}{6}x - \\frac{x}{6} = 66\\]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n\\[\\frac{{11}{6}x = 66\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(\\frac{{6}{11}\\) to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x = 66 \\times \\frac{6}{11}\\]\n\n\\[x = 6 \\times 6\\]\n\n\\[x = 36\\]\n\nSo, each pile originally had 36 pins. Since there were two piles, John originally had \\(2 \\times 36 = 72\\) pins.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 72."
