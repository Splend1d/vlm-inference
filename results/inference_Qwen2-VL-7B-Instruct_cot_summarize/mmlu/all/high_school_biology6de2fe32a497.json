For example, skeletal muscle cells convert pyruvate into lactic acid when no oxygen is present. Yeast cells can produce alcohol and carbon dioxide under the same circumstances. However, regardless of the specific reactions, the purpose of glycolysis is an important one. Which statement best describes the importance of glycolysis?\n\nA. It produces large amounts of ATP by substrate level phosphorylation.\nB. It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue.\nC. It produces pyruvate, which is the raw material for oxidative phosphorylation.\nD. It occurs in the cytoplasm.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue.\n\nGlycolysis is the initial stage of cellular respiration where glucose is broken down into pyruvate. During this process, NADH is produced, which is a reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( (NAD+). NADH is an electron carrier that helps in the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another. In the absence of oxygen, NADH cannot be oxidized back to NAD+ and thus cannot be used in the next stage of cellular respiration, oxidative phosphorylation. However, in the presence of oxygen, NADH can be oxidized back to NAD+ by the electron transport chain, which allows glycolysis to continue. Therefore, the reoxidation of NADH is an important step in glycolysis."
