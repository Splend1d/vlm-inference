Lord Devlin was known for his views on the criminal law and its role in society. He argued that the criminal law should be used to preserve moral and social cohesion.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"Society has no right to preserve its moral and social cohesion through the criminal law.\"\n- This directly challenges Lord Devlin's argument by suggesting that the criminal law is not the appropriate tool for preserving moral and social cohesion. It implies that other means should be used instead.\n\nB. \"Homosexual acts cause public outrage.\"\n- This statement is more about the cause of public outrage rather than refuting Lord Devlin's argument about the role of the criminal law. It does not directly address the core of Lord Devlin's argument.\n\nC. \"The courts are the best place to resolve moral questions such as those concerning homosexuality and prostitution.\"\n- This statement supports Lord Devlin's argument by suggesting that the courts should handle moral questions, which aligns with his view that the criminal law should be used for moral and social cohesion.\n\nD. \"The law is anachronistic.\"\n- This statement is a general critique of the law but does not specifically address Lord Devlin's argument about the role of the criminal law in preserving moral and social cohesion.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most powerful refutation by Hart of Lord Devlin's argument is:\n\nA. Society has no right to preserve its moral and social cohesion through the criminal law.\n\nThis option directly challenges the core of Lord Devlin's argument by suggesting that the criminal law is not the appropriate tool for preserving moral and social cohesion."
