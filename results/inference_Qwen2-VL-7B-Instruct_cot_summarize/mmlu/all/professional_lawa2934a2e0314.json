The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable adverse possession statute in effect. Twelve years after the man took possession, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son was 15, the son's guardian discovered that the man was in possession of the tract. Assume that the statutory period of adverse possession is 20 years and the age of majority is 18. Which of the following correctly describes the state of title to the tract?\n\nA. The man has acquired title by adverse possession.\nB. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.\nC. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.\nD. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12years, or nine years after the son attains the ageof 18.\n"

The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The woman was the fee simple owner of the 20-acre tract of land.\n2. The man took possession of the tract and complied with the applicable adverse possession statute.\n3. The statutory period of adverse possession is 20 years.\n4. The man has been in possession for 12 years.\n5. The woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir.\n6. Nine years after the woman's death, the son was 15 years old.\n\nThe son's guardian discovered the man's possession nine years after the woman's death. At this point, the man has been in possession for 12 years. To acquire title by adverse possession, the man must continue in possession for an additional three years ( (20 years - 12 years = 8 years) or until the son reaches the age of 18 ( (18 years - 15 years = 3 years).\n\nTherefore, the man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18."
