This is because individuals may assume that someone else will take responsibility for helping, leading to a diffusion of responsibility.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one: This would likely increase the pedestrian's willingness to help, as he might feel more empathy for someone in a lower socioeconomic position.\n\nB. The presence of another group of people one block up the street: This would likely decrease the pedestrian's willingness to help, as he might assume that someone else will take responsibility for the situation.\n\nC. The person requiring aid appearing to be the same ethnicity rather than a different one: This would likely have little to no effect on the pedestrian's willingness to help, as the bystander effect is more related to the number of people present rather than the ethnicity of the person in distress.\n\nD. The presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl: This would likely decrease the pedestrian's willingness to help, as he might assume that the other person will take responsibility for the situation.\n\nTherefore, the option that would change how the pedestrian reacts is:\n\nB. The presence of another group of people one block up the street."
