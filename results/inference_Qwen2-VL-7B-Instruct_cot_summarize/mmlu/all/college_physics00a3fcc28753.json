The Lorentz contraction formula is given by:\n\nL' = L / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L' is the length measured by the observer, L is the length of the object in its rest frame, v is the velocity of the observer relative to the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that L = 1.00 m and L' = 0.80 m. We need to solve for v.\n\n0.80 = 1.00 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n0.64 = 1 - v^2/c^2\n\nRearranging:\n\nv^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64\n\nv^2/c^2 = 0.36\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nv/c = sqrt(0.36)\n\nv/c = 0.60\n\nTherefore, the observer must move at a speed of 0.60c to measure the length of the rod to be 0.80 m. The correct answer is B."
