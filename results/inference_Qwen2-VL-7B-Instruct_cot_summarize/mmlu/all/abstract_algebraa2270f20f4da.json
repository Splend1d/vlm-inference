The external direct product of two cyclic groups \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m \\times \\mathbb{Z}_n \\) is cyclic if and only if \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\). This is because the direct product of two cyclic groups is cyclic if and only if the orders of the groups are coprime. \n\nFor example, consider \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\). The orders of these groups are 4 and 6, respectively, and \\( \\gcd(4, 6) = 2 \\neq 1 \\). Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\) is not cyclic. \n\n### Statement 2: The external direct product of \\( D_3 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) is isomorphic to \\( D_{12} \\).\n\nThe dihedral group \\( D_n \\) is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon, which includes both rotations and reflections. The external direct product of two dihedral groups \\( D_m \\times D_n \\) is not necessarily isomorphic to \\( D_{mn} \\). \n\nFor \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\), the orders of these groups are 6 and 8, respectively. The direct product \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) has an order of \\( 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\). \n\nHowever, \\( D_{12} \\) has an order of 24, which is not equal to 48. Therefore, \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) is not isomorphic to \\( D_{12} \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatement 1 is false because the external direct product of cyclic groups is not always cyclic.\nStatement 2 is false because the external direct product of \\( D_3 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) is not isomorphic to \\( D_{12} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
