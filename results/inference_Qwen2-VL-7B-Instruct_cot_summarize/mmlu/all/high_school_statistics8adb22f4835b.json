The FDA investigator is testing the manufacturer's claim about the weight of aspirin tablets. The claim is that the mean weight of the tablets is 300 milligrams. The investigator has a sample of seven tablets and is using a t-test to compare the sample mean to the claimed mean.\n\nGiven the sample data (299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, we can calculate the sample mean and standard deviation to perform the t-test. However, the key point here is understanding the degrees of freedom ( df.\n\nThe degrees of freedom for a t-test with a sample size of n is df = n - 1. In this case, the sample size is 7, so df = 7 - 1 = 6.\n\nThe t-statistic is calculated based on the sample mean, the claimed mean, the sample standard deviation, and the sample size. The t-statistic is compared to the t-distribution with df = 6.\n\nThe P-value is the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis in this case is that the mean weight of the tablets is 300 milligrams.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA. P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\nB. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\nC. P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\nD. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n\nThe correct P-value is the probability of observing a t-statistic greater than 1.54 with df = 6. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. P(t > 1.54) with df = 6"
