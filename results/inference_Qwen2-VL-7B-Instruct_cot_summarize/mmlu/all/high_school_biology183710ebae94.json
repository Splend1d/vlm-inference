A decrease in the light level in surface waters as day length starts to shorten after the summer solstice\nB. Increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton during the summer months\nC.

A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus\n\nThe most likely factor triggering the algal blooms and the associated dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico is the summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients, primarily from agricultural runoff, are carried by the Mississippi River and contribute to the growth of photosynthetic phytoplankton, leading to algal blooms. The subsequent decay of these blooms by oxygen-depleting microbes results in the formation of dead zones."
