This relationship is described by Newton's second law of of motion, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ F = ma \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the net force, \\( m \\) is the acceleration, and \\( m \\) is the mass of the object. Rearranging this equation to solve for mass gives:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{F}{a} \\]\n\nThis shows that the slope of the graph, which is the change in force divided by the change in acceleration (\\( \\frac{F}{a} \\)), is directly proportional to the mass of the object.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Inertial mass"
