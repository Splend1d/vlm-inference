Closure: For all a, b in H, a * b is also in H.\n  2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in H, ( (a * (b) * c = a * ( (b * c).\n  3.

Inverse: For all a in H, there exists an element b in H such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nThe closure property is given in option A, and the associativity property is given in option B. The inverse property is given in option C. The identity property is given in option D. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
