Produce a 1-step ahead conditional variance forecast, take its square root and multiply it by the square root of 10\n\nThis approach is based on the properties of the GARCH model and the nature of volatility forecasting. Here's why:\n\n1. **GARCH Model Properties**: The GARCH model is designed to forecast the conditional variance (\u03c3\u00b2_t, which is the variance of the returns at time t. The conditional variance is a measure of the volatility at time t.\n\n2. **Volatility Forecasting**: To forecast volatility for a future period, we need to forecast the conditional variance for that period. The GARCH model allows us to forecast the conditional variance for each future period based on the past observations.\n\n3. **Square Root of Conditional Variance**: The standard deviation (\u03c3_t, which is the square root of the conditional variance \u03c3\u00b2_t, is the measure of volatility. Therefore, to forecast volatility for a future period, we forecast the conditional variance and then take the square root of that forecast.\n\n4. **Multiplying by the Square Root of the Forecast Period**: If we want to forecast volatility for a period of n days, we need to multiply the square root of the conditional variance forecast by the square root of n. This is because the variance scales linearly with time, and the standard deviation ( (which is the square root of variance) scales with the square root of time.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to forecast the conditional variance for each of the next 10 days, take the square root of each forecasted, and then multiply the square root of the conditional variance forecast by the square root of 10 to get the forecast for the 10-day volatility."
