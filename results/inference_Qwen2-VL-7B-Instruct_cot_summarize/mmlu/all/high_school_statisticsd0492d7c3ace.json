                    "text": "To find the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed, with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nGiven:\n- Population mean ( (\u03bc) = 4 ounces\n- Population standard deviation ( (\u03c3) = 0.25 ounces\n- Sample size ( (n) = 40 jars\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error ( (SE) of the sample mean, which is given by:\n\nSE = \u03c3 / \u221an\n\nSE = 0.25 / \u221a40 \u2248 0.0395\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 3.9 ounces. The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = ( - \u03bc / SE\n\nz = 3.9 - 4 / 0.0395 \u2248 -1.27\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability that the z-score is less than -1.27. This probability is approximately 0.1025.\n\nHowever, this is the probability that the sample mean is less than 3.9 ounces, but we want the probability that it is less than 3.9 ounces. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, the probability that the sample mean is less than 3.9 ounces is the same as the probability that it is greater than 3.9 ounces.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces is approximately 0.1025.\n\nNone of the the given options ( A. 0.0057, B. 0.0225, C. 0.025, D. 0.05 match the calculated probability. It seems there might be a mistake in the options provided."
