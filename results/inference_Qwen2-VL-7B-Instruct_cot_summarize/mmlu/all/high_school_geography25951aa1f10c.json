The national anthem.\n\nA national anthem is a symbol of national pride and unity, but it is not a force that directly influences the stability or cohesion of a state. It is more of a cultural or symbolic element rather than a force that acts on the state in a physical or direct manner.\n\nOn the other hand, options A, B, and C are all examples of forces or factors that can influence the stability and cohesion of a state. High confidence in the central government, strong separatist groups, and national transportation networks can all have significant impacts on the internal dynamics and stability of a state."
