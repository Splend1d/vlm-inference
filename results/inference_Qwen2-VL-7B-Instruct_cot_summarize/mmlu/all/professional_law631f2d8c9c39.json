He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.\n\nA. No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\nB. No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.\nC. Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.\nD. Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.\n"

No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship**: In a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship, the property is owned by two or more individuals as a single unit. Upon the death of one joint tenant, the property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) without the need for probate or other legal proceedings.\n\n2. **Mortgage and Joint Tenancy**: A mortgage is a lien on property, which secures a debt. When a mortgage is taken out on property, it does not automatically destroy the joint tenancy. The mortgage is a separate legal instrument that does not affect the ownership structure of the joint tenancy.\n\n3. **Right of Survivorship**: The right of survivorship is a legal principle that ensures that the property passes directly to the surviving joint tenant(s) upon the death of one of the joint tenants. This principle is independent of the existence of a mortgage.\n\n4. **Bank's Ability to Execute**: The bank's ability to execute on the mortgage lien is separate from the ownership structure of the joint tenancy. The bank can foreclose on the property and enforce the mortgage lien, but this does not affect the joint tenancy itself.\n\nTherefore, the majority view would hold that the mortgage lien does not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant."
