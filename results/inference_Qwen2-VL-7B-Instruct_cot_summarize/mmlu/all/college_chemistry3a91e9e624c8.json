                    "text": "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (\\(\\Delta x\\)) and momentum (\\(\\Delta p\\)) of a particle is greater than or equal to Planck's constant (\\(h\\)) divided by \\(4\\pi\\). Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}\n\\]\n\nIn the context of a quantum mechanical particle in the lowest energy level of a one-dimensional box, the particle is in a state of definite energy, and the wave function (\\(\\psi\\)) is a standing wave. The particle is confined to a specific region of space, which means that the uncertainty in position (\\(\\Delta x\\)) is minimized. However, the particle is also in a state of definite energy, which implies that the momentum (\\(\\Delta p\\)) is also a definite value.\n\nGiven that the particle is in the lowest energy level, the momentum is quantized, and the uncertainty in momentum is not zero. Therefore, the uncertainty in position is also also minimized, but it is not zero. This means that while the particle is in a definite state of position, the uncertainty in momentum is non-zero.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Position is known exactly, but no information about momentum can be known."
