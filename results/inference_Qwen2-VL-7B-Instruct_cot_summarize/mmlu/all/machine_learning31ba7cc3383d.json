For two-dimensional data points, the separating hyperplane learnt by a linear SVM will be a straight line.\n- This is true. In two dimensions, a linear SVM learns a hyperplane (which is a straight line, to separate the data points.\n\nB. In theory, a Gaussian kernel SVM cannot model any complex separating hyperplane.\n- This is false. A Gaussian kernel SVM can model complex separating hyperplanes by mapping the data into a higher-dimensional space where it might be linearly separable.\n\nC. For every kernel function used in a SVM, one can obtain an equivalent closed form basis expansion.\n- This is false. Not every kernel function used in a SVM can be represented by an equivalent closed form basis expansion. Some kernels, like the Gaussian kernel, do not have a closed form basis expansion.\n\nD. Overfitting in an SVM is not a function of the number of support vectors.\n- This is false. Overfitting in an SVM is indeed a function of the number of support vectors. The more support vectors, the more complex the decision boundary can be, potentially leading to overfitting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. For two-dimensional data points, the separating hyperplane learnt by a linear SVM will be a straight line."
