To develop a new international justice system to enhance human security.\n\nThe Commission on Human Security was established in 1999 by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to promote the concept of human security and to develop strategies to address threats to human security. The objectives of the Commission included promoting public understanding, engagement, and support for human security, developing the concept of human security as an operational tool for policy formulation and implementation, and proposing a concrete program of action to address critical and pervasive threats to human security. However, the Commission did not have the objective of developing a new international justice system to enhance human security."
