Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\n\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation focuses on the dynamics of economic development and the ways in which regions with initial advantages can expand their wealth and prosperity, often at the expense of less developed regions. The theory emphasizes the role of trade, capital, and labor in driving this process, but it does not suggest that developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade. Instead, it highlights the disparities and the cumulative effects of these advantages."
