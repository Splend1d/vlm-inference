Half of the tract is swampland totally unfit for cultivation, though it is heavily covered with valuable hardwood timber. The other half is also covered with valuable timber, but it is land that would be fit for the raising of crops if it were cleared of the timber. The latter section of land is more valuable for cultivation than it is for the growing of timber. The grantor conveyed his tract to his brother for life. At the time of the conveyance, the swampland had never been used for the production of timber. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. In addition, the brother cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, thus becoming the first person to exploit this area. The brother's cutting of the timber on the section of tract suitable for cultivation would be an example of\n\nA. permissive waste.\nB. ameliorative waste.\nC. equitable waste.\nD. unreasonable exploitation.\n"
