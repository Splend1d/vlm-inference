The home is to be given to the friend who has cared for the Pomeranians dogs.\n2. If the dogs do not receive proper care, the home is to be given to the son and his heirs.\n3. If the son does not own any dogs, the home is to be given to the American Society for the Protection of Animals.\n\nGiven these conditions, the son's interest hinges on whether he owns dogs at the time of his father's death. If he does not own dogs, the interest vests immediately. If he does own dogs, the interest vests 21 years after his death.\n\nThis type of interest is known as an executory interest of a shifting type, as it vests upon the occurrence of a future event (i.e., the son owning dogs.\n\nHowever, since the interest vests 21 years after the son's death, it does not comply with the Rule against Perpetuities, which requires the interest to vest within 21 years after the life in interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nC. It is an executory interest of a shifting type that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities."
