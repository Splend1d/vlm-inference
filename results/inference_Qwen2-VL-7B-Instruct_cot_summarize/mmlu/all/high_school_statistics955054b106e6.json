Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. Which of the following statements is correct about the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests?\n\nA. The correlation coefficient is -0.71.\nB. The correlation coefficient is 0.71.\nC. The correlation coefficient is -0.84.\nD. The correlation coefficient is 0.84.\n"

It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. A positive correlation coefficient indicates a positive relationship ( (as one variable increases, the other variable also increases), while a negative correlation coefficient indicates a negative relationship ( (as one variable increases, the other variable decreases).\n\nIn this context, the study found that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. This suggests a strong positive relationship, as the number of calls increases, the abundance of nests also increases.\n\nGiven that 71% of the variation is explained by the number of calls, the correlation coefficient \\( r \\) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{0.71} \\]\n\nCalculating the square root of 0.71:\n\n\\[ r \\approx 0.84 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nD. The correlation coefficient is 0.84."
