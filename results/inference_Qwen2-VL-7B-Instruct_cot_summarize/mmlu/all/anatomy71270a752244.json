Therefore, the cricothyroid muscle remains functional. However, the interarytenoid muscles, which are innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve, are typically affected by recurrent laryngeal nerve damage. As a result, the interarytenoid muscles are weak or paralyzed, leading to the vocal fold being in an intermediate position between adduction and abduction."
