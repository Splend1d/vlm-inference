                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze Corvino's argument about the \"unnatural\" charge and the conditions under which it can carry moral weight. According to Corvino, the \"unnatural\" charge can carry moral weight only if those who level it can fulfill two conditions:\n\n1. **Specify exactly what they mean by \"unnatural\" and explain why unnaturalness (so defined) matters morally.**\n\nThis condition ensures that the charge is not vague or arbitrary but is based on a clear and meaningful definition of \"unnatural\" and its moral implications. Without this specificity, the charge would lack the necessary moral weight to be effective.\n\n2. **Establish that one's sexual orientation is a matter of choice and that people who choose homosexuality have an intrinsic desire for self-harm.**\n\nThis condition addresses the claim that homosexuality is a choice and that those who choose it have an intrinsic desire for self-harm. This is crucial because it would undermine the moral weight of the \"unnatural\" charge by challenging the assumption that homosexuality is inherently unnatural.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **i) explain the harms of anal sex and ii) establish that all homosexuals will inevitably suffer those harms.**\n   - This option focuses on the harms of anal sex and the inevitability of suffering for homosexuals, which is not directly related to the definition and moral implications of \"unnatural.\"\n\nB. **i) specify exactly what they mean by \"unnatural\" and ii) explain why unnaturalness (so defined) matters morally.**\n   - This option directly addresses Corvino's conditions by specifying the definition of \"unnatural\" and explaining its moral significance, which aligns with his argument.\n\nC. **i) establish that one's sexual orientation is a matter of choice and ii) that people who choose homosexuality have an intrinsic desire for self-harm.**\n   - This this option addresses the claim that homosexuality is a choice and the intrinsic desire for self-harm, which is not directly related to the definition and moral implications of \"unnatural.\"\n\nD. **i) explain the value of naturalness and ii) why nothing \"unnatural\" can be of value.**\n   - This this option focuses on the value of naturalness and the idea that nothing \"unnatural\" can be valuable, which is not directly related to the conditions Corvino outlines for the \"unnatural\" charge to carry moral weight.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. i) specify exactly what they mean by \"unnatural\" and ii) explain why unnaturalness (so defined) matters morally.**"
