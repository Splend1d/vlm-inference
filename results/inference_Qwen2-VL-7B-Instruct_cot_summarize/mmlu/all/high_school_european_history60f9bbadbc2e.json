Socioeconomic changes created divisions of labor that led to the the development of self-conscious classes.\n\nThe Luddite Song, \"The Cropper's Song,\" reflects the Luddite movement, which was a response to the industrialization process. The Luddites were a group of workers who opposed the introduction of new machinery in the textile industry, fearing it would lead to unemployment and loss of their traditional skills. The song expresses the Luddites' sentiments and their resistance to the changes brought on by industrialization, particularly the division of labor and the creation of self-conscious classes."
