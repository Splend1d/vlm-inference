Apoptosis, a special type of cell division, requires multiple cell signaling.\n- This statement is correct. Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that involves multiple signaling pathways and proteins.\n\nB. The fact that apoptosis is widespread across several kingdoms is evidence that it evolved early in the evolution of eukaryotes.\n- This statement is correct. Apoptosis is a fundamental process that is present in all eukaryotic organisms, suggesting it evolved early in the history of life.\n\nC. Apoptosis plays a crucial role in the development of fingers in embryonic development.\n- This statement is not correct. Apoptosis is not involved in the development of fingers. Instead, it plays a role in the removal of excess cells during development, allowing for the proper formation of structures like fingers.\n\nD. Apoptosis prevents an aging and dying cell from damaging neighboring cells.\n- This statement is correct. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death process that prevents damaged cells from releasing harmful substances that could damage neighboring cells.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct about apoptosis is:\n\nC. Apoptosis plays a crucial role in the development of fingers in embryonic development."
