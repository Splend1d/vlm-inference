Introns are removed and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nDuring RNA processing, introns (non-coding sequences within the preRNA) are removed in the nucleus, and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. This process is known as RNA splicing and is essential for the production of mature, functional RNA molecules."
