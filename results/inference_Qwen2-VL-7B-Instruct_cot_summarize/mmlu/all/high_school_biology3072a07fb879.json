Biogeography\n\nBiogeography is the study of the distribution and historical movements of species across the globe. It can explain how different species have adapted to different environments and how their traits, such as prehensile tails, have evolved over time. In this case, the difference in tail structure between the two groups of monkeys could be attributed to their different habitats and evolutionary histories, which are central concerns in biogeography."
