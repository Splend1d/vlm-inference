                    "text": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze the impact of Marguerite's score of 100 on her previous scores, which range from 75 to 89.\n\n1. **Mode**: The mode is the score that appears most frequently. Since Marguerite's previous scores are all unique ( (75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89), and her new score of 100 is higher than all of them, it the mode will not change. Therefore, Statement A is false.\n\n2. **Mean**: The mean is the average of all the scores. To calculate the mean, we sum all the scores and divide by the number of scores. Let's calculate the mean of her previous scores and then add the new score to see how it it changes.\n\n   - Sum of previous scores: \\(75 + 76 + 77 + 78 + 79 + 80 + 81 + 82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 86 + 87 + 88 + 89 = 1200\\)\n   - Number of previous scores: 15\n   - Mean of previous scores: \\(1200 / 15 = 80\\)\n\n   - Adding the new score: \\(1200 + 100 = 1300\\)\n   - New mean: \\(1300 / 16 = 81.25\\)\n\n   The mean increases from 80 to 81.25. Therefore, Statement B is true.\n\n3. **Median**: The median is the middle score when the scores are arranged in order. Since there are 15 scores ( (an odd number), the median is the 8th score when arranged in ascending order. The 8th score is 82.\n\n   - Adding the new score: \\(1200 + 100 = 1300\\)\n   - New median: \\(1300 / 16 = 81.25\\)\n\n   The median remains the same, as it is the middle value of the new set of 16 scores. Therefore, Statement C is false.\n\n4. **Median**: The median is the middle score when the scores are arranged in order. Since there are 15 scores ( (an odd number), the median is the 8th score when arranged in ascending order. The 8th score is 82.\n\n   - Adding the new score: \\(1200 + 100 = 1300\\)\n   - New median: \\(1300 / 16 = 81.25\\)\n\n   The median remains the same, as it is the middle value of the new set of 16 scores. Therefore, Statement D is false.\n\nThe correct statement is:\n\n**B. The mean will increase.**"
