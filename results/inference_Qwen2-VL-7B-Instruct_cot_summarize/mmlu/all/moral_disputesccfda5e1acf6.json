The context here revolves around the relationship between genetic enhancement and parent-child relationships, as discussed by Sandel and Kamm.\n\n1. **Identify the type of logical reasoning involved**: This problem involves understanding and analyzing an argument and determining the best response to it.\n2. **Comprehend the context and the core of the question**: Kamm is responding to Sandel's argument about genetic enhancement and its impact on parent-child relationships. Kamm's argument is about the moral implications of genetic enhancement.\n\n3. **Carefully analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Genetic transformation will actually strengthen the bond between parent and child.\"\n     - This option suggests a positive outcome of genetic enhancement on parent-child relationships. However, Kamm's argument does not focus on the strengthening of the bond but rather on the moral implications of genetic enhancement.\n   - **Option B**: \"Children are too young to understand the implications of genetic enhancement.\"\n     - This option addresses the understanding of children but does not directly address the moral implications of genetic enhancement as discussed by Kamm.\n   - **Option C**: \"Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation.\"\n     - This option suggests that Sandel's argument does not completely rule out the use of moderate genetic enhancement. This aligns with Kamm's argument that genetic enhancement can be morally permissible under certain conditions.\n   - **Option D**: \"The use of training and appliances as a way of transforming gifts is not, as Sandel argues, morally permissible.\"\n     - This option discusses the morality of using training and appliances to enhance gifts, which is not directly related to Kamm's argument about genetic enhancement.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer**: Based on the analysis, Option C is the best response as it directly addresses the moral implications of genetic enhancement as discussed by Kamm.\n\n**Final Answer: C. Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation.**"
