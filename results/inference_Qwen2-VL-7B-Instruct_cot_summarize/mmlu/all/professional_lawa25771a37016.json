Before making the gift, the Secretary was approached by the head of a church. The church leader indicated that he would be sponsoring a worldwide crusade and suggested to the Secretary that such an undertaking would serve to strengthen relations with foreign governments. The Secretary donated the plane to the church instead of the organization. Who would have the best standing to challenge the Secretary's action?\n\nA. A citizen of the United States.\nB. A taxpayer of the United States.\nC. The national organization.\nD. A state within the United States.\n"

The organization would likely have a stronger standing to challenge the Secretary's action because it was the intended beneficiary of the gift."
