Calculate the total units purchased and the total cost of these purchases.\n2. Calculate the total units available for sale.\n3. Calculate the total cost of goods available for sale.\n4. Calculate the weighted average cost per unit.\n5. Calculate the cost of goods sold for the units sold.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Total units purchased and total cost of purchases:**\n   - May 4: 20 units at $5.80 each = $116.00\n   - May 17: 80 units at $5.50 each = $440.00\n   - Total units purchased = 20 + 80 = 100 units\n   - Total cost of purchases = $116.00 + $440.00 = $556.00\n\n2. **Total units available for sale:**\n   - Beginning inventory = 200 units\n   - Purchases = 100 units\n   - Total units available for sale = 200 + 100 = 300 units\n\n3. **Total cost of goods available for sale:**\n   - Beginning inventory = $1250\n   - Purchases = $556.00\n   - Total cost of goods available for sale = $1250 + $556.00 = $1806.00\n\n4. **Weighted average cost per unit:**\n   - Weighted average cost per unit = Total cost of goods available for sale / Total units available for sale\n   - Weighted average cost per unit = $1806.00 / 300 units = $6.02 per unit\n\n5. **Cost of goods sold for the units sold:**\n   - Cobb sold 10 units on May 14 for $120.\n   - Cost of goods sold = Number of units sold * Weighted average cost per unit\n   - Cost of goods sold = 10 units * $6.02 per unit = $60.20\n\nTherefore, the weighted average cost of goods sold for May is $60.20.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. $60.20"
