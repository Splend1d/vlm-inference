For safety concerns, the condominium association amended the covenants and restrictions toprohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment did not affect families withchildren already living in balcony units. The amendment was promptly recorded. The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association. Subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, the owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a familywith minor children. Before the closing, the association told the buyers that because they had minor children,they could not buy the unit. The association further told the buyers that numerous units were available in thebuilding without balconies. After receiving this notification, the buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming that the amendmentwas unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws. Is there reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred?\n\nA. No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.\nB. No, because the amendment is based on legitimate safety issues.\nC. Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.\nD. Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.\n"

Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.\n\nThe amendment to prohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children is discriminatory and violates federal fair housing laws. The law prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of housing based on family status, which includes the presence of minor children. The fact that families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies does not negate the discriminatory nature of the amendment. The amendment segregates families with minor children from other families, which is a violation of fair housing laws."
