The landowner, who is a resident of the state, has been informed by his attorney that his sales agreement with the farmer is null and void under state law. Which of the following is the best constitutional argument to contest the validity of the state statute?\n\nA. The contract clause prohibition against a state from enacting any law that will impair the obligation of contracts.\nB. The privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause under Article IV, Section 2.\nD. The national property power provision under Article IV, Section 3.\n"

The contract clause prohibition against a state from enacting any law that will impair the obligation of contracts.\n\nThis argument is based on the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution, which states that \"No State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or take away the Beneficent and Equitable Rules Provided for securing them, or suspend the Execution of any such Law, on account of the Obligation of a public Credit.\" This clause protects the sanctity of contracts and the ability of parties to a contract to enforce their obligations under the law.\n\nIn this case, the state law that restricts the ability of a U.S. citizen to own agricultural land in the state would be seen as impairing the obligation of the contract between the out-of-state farmer and the landowner. Therefore, this argument would be the most compelling to contest the validity of the state statute."
