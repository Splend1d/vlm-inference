When we add polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. When we compose polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the product of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\n\nGiven that $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6$, $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$, and $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $d$, we have:\n\n1. $f(m(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $6$ because the degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\n2. $g(n(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3$ because the degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\n3. $h(f(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $d$ because the degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\n\nWhen we add these three polynomials together, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\max\\{6, 3, d\\} = 36.$$\n\nSince $6$ and $3$ are both less than $36$, the maximum degree is $36$. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial $h$ is $36 / 6 = 6$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
