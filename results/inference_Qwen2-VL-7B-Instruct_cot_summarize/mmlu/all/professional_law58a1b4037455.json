The man raised his gun at the officers and a flurry of shots followed. The man was injured but survived; the woman co-conspirator died from a police officer's bullet. The authorities charged the man with felony-murder of the woman. He was convicted and appealed. Under the prevailing modern view of felony murder, will the appellate court likely reverse the first-degree murder conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because the felony murder rule has been declared unconstitutional.\nB. Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime.\nC. No, because all states recognize that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime regardless of who fired the fatal shot.\nD. No, because the man started the flurry of shots instead of surrendering; he caused the woman's death and is guilty of first degree murder.\n"

The felony murder rule generally holds that a person can be guilty of first-degree murder if they commit or attempt to commit a felony and someone dies as a result of the felony or its aftermath. In this case, the man's actions (raising his gun at the police officers and causing the flurry of shots that led to the woman's death\u2014constitute the underlying felony (the robbery. The fact that the woman died from a police officer's bullet does not negate the man's's responsibility for the death under the felony murder rule.
