A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nWhich of the following explains why Nkrumah feels Africa must \"avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity\"?\n\nA. African nations will not achieve independence without unity.\nB. Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.\nC. The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.\nD. The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.\n"

                    "text": "To determine why Kwame Nkrumah feels Africa must \"avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity,\" we need to analyze the context and the core message of his statement. Nkrumah emphasizes the importance of unity among African states for several reasons:\n\n1. **Creating a Political Union**: He believes that a political union among African states would be a significant contribution to world peace. This union would serve as an example to the world, demonstrating the power of unity.\n\n2. **Projecting the African Personality**: A unified Africa would better represent its unique cultural and political identity, commanding respect from the world community.\n\n3. **Size and Influence**: Nkrumah mentions that the world community values size and influence, suggesting that unity would enhance Africa's standing in the global arena.\n\n4. **Historical and Political Lessons**: He references the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the United Nations' handling of the Congo crisis, highlighting the callous disregard for African independence by the Great Powers. This indicates that disunity has led to a lack of respect and consideration from the world community.\n\nGiven these points, the most compelling reason why Nkrumah feels Africa must avoid disunity is:\n\n**D. The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the importance of size and influence in the global community, which Nkrumah believes a unified Africa could achieve. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.**"
