                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Alex walks to place the first 50 stones. Each stone placement involves walking to the stone, placing it, and then walking back to the crate. This means for each stone, Alex walks a total of 4 feet ( (3 feet to the stone + 1 foot back to the crate).\n\nHowever, the distance Alex walks increases by 4 feet for each subsequent stone ( (2 feet farther each way). So, the distances for placing the first stone is 4 feet, the second stone is 8 feet, the third stone is 12 feet, and so on.\n\nThis forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term \\(a_1 = 4 \\) ( and the common difference \\( d = 4 \\). The \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \\( a_n = a_1 + ( (n - 1) \\cdot d \\).\n\nFor the 50th stone, the distance Alex walks is:\n\\[ a_{50} = 4 + ( (50 - 1) \\cdot 4 = 4 + 49 \\cdot 4 = 4 + 196 = 200 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThe total distance Alex walks to place the first 50 stones is the sum of the first 50 terms of this arithmetic sequence. The sum \\( S_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot ( (a_1 + a_n) \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( n = 50 \\), \\( a_1 = 4 \\), and \\( a_{50} = 200 \\):\n\\[ S_{50} = \\frac{50}{2} \\cdot ( (4 + 200) = 25 \\cdot 204 = 5100 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Alex walked is 5100 feet, which is not listed among the options provided. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer is not listed among the options A, B, C, or D."
