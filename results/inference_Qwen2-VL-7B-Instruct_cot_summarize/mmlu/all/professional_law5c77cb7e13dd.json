After a hearing, the state court ordered possession of the land surrendered to the corporation, upon deposit in court of a sum deemed adequate to cover damages that might be awarded. The timber company immediately commenced an action to enjoin the court-ordered sale of their property. Which of the following would be the best ground for upholding the state court's order?\n\nA. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity.\nB. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\nC. The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a \"taking. \"\nD. The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n"

The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\n\nThis ground is based on the principle that the power of eminent domain is a governmental power and should be exercised by a public authority, such as a state or local government, rather than a private corporation. The delegation of this power to a private enterprise would undermine the public interest and the democratic process of determining the public good."
