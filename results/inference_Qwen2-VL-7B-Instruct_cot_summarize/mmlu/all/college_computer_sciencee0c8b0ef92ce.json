Among the options provided:\n\nA. Round-robin - This policy allocates a fixed amount of CPU time to each process in a round-robin fashion. While it prevents starvation in a sense that no process is starved indefinitely, it does not guarantee that all jobs will be completed in a finite amount of time.\n\nB. Priority queuing - This policy schedules jobs based on their priority. Jobs with higher priority are served before those with lower priority. While this can prevent starvation, it does not guarantee that all jobs will be completed in a finite amount of time.\n\nC. Shortest job first - This policy schedules jobs based on their length. Jobs with the shortest length are served first. This policy guarantees that all jobs will be completed in a finite amount of time, as the shortest jobs will be completed first, and the remaining jobs will be completed as the CPU becomes available.\n\nD. Youngest job first - This policy schedules jobs based on their arrival time. Jobs that arrived first are served first. While this can prevent starvation, it does not guarantee that all jobs will be completed in a finite amount of time.\n\nTherefore, the Shortest Job First policy is the one that guarantees that no job waits indefinitely for service, making it the starvation-free job-scheduling policy."
