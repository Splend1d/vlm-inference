The momentum of the water exiting the fire hydrant is equal to the momentum of the water entering the nozzle. \n\nThe momentum of the water is given by the product of its mass and velocity. Since the pressure is kept constant, the mass flow rate of the water remains the same. Therefore, the momentum of the water entering the nozzle is equal to the momentum of the water exiting the nozzle.\n\nLet's denote the initial velocity of the water as \\( v_i = 2 \\) m/s, the final velocity of the water as \\( v_f \\), and the area of the start of the hose as \\( A_i \\).
