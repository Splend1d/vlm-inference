The police were looking for evidence of the husband's suspected activities in a major drug trafficking plot. The wife gave her voluntary consent to the search. The police found a kilo of cocaine in a dresser drawer and various written notes that contained the names and phone numbers of co-conspirators. After the husband was arrested, he moved for suppression of all of the evidence seized in his bedroom. Will the court likely deny the motion due to the voluntary consent given by the wife?\n\nA. No, the search was unconstitutional because a wife cannot give consent for her husband.\nB. No, the search was unconstitutional because the items were under the husband's control and the wife therefore had no authority to give consent.\nC. Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\nD. The search was unconstitutional because the police did not have a search warrant.\n"

Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\n\nIn the United States, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. When it comes to consent searches, the law generally assumes that a person who has joint authority over property can validly consent to a search of that property. In this case, the wife and husband presumably have joint authority over the mutual bedroom, and she gave her voluntary consent to the search. Therefore, the court is likely to find that the search was proper and deny the husband's motion to suppress the evidence."
