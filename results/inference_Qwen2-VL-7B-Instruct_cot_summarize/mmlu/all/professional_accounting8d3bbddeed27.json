It is calculated as the covariance of the stock's returns with the market returns, divided by the variance of of the market returns. The formula for beta is:\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\frac{\\text{Covariance of stock returns with market returns}}{\\text{Variance of market returns}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Covariance between Stock A and the market index = 88\n- Standard deviation of Stock A = 19%\n- Standard deviation of the market index = 14%\n\nFirst, we need to convert the standard deviations into variances because the formula for beta involves variances. The variance is the square of the standard deviation.\n\n\\[ \\text{Variance of Stock A} = ( (19\\%)^2 = 0.361 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Variance of the market index} = ( (14\\%)^2 = 0.196 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the beta of Stock A:\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\frac{{88}{0.196} \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta = 448.98 \\]\n\nHowever, this result is not directly in the options provided, which suggests a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the options. Given the standard options and the typical range for beta (0.2 to 1.0, the closest match to the calculated beta is:\n\nC. 0.245\n\nThis is likely due to rounding or a misunderstanding in the question's presentation. The correct beta calculation based on the provided data would yield a value closer to 448.98, but given the options, the closest match is C. 0.245."
