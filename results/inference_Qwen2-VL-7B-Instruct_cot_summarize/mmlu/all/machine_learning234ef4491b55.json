VGGNet uses smaller convolutional kernels compared to AlexNet. AlexNet's first-layer kernels are 11x11, while VGGNet uses 3x3 kernels.\n\nStatement 2: \"Data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization.\"\n- This statement is false. Data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced after Batch Normalization. Data-dependent weight initialization procedures, such as Xavier initialization and He initialization, were introduced in the early 2010s, while Batch Normalization was introduced in 2014.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. True, False"
