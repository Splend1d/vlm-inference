The need for civilian expertise, a need driven by technological developments, resulted in a shift from targeted development of fast-changing technologies to deployment of a given technology.\nB. Theory was necessary because nuclear technology was inherently more empirical, seen as what would be controlled by the bottom line of probable occurrences in a given conflict situation - the game of deterrence.\nC. Broader political considerations about the potential implications of long-term mobilization resulted in a shift from tactical operations to long-term strategy.\nD. The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political and military planning.\n"

The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political, and military planning.\n\nThis option highlights the need for a strong military leadership to manage the complex and multifaceted aspects of security during the Cold War era, which was characterized by the threat of nuclear war and the need for coordinated efforts across various sectors. This leadership was crucial in shaping the institutional framework of security studies to address these challenges effectively."
