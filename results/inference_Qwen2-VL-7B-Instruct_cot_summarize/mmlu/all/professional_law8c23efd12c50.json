She was running late for the meeting and could not find a legal parking spot, so she decided to park illegally in front of a fire hydrant. This was in violation of a local ordinance that prohibited parking within 50 feet of a fire hydrant. The lawyer figured that it was better to get a ticket than to miss her meeting with an important client. The spot where she parked was next to the site of the construction of the new building. While the lawyer was at her meeting, an accident occurred at the construction site. A large crane was being used to lift a load of bricks. A cable on the crane broke, and the bricks fell. Most of them landed on top of the lawyer's car. The load of bricks that fell on the lawyer's car caused the gas tank of the car to rupture and explode. Shrapnel from the explosion flew in all directions and injured a pedestrian who was talking on the sidewalk near the lawyer's car. If the pedestrian sues the lawyer and relies on the doctrine of negligence per Se, which of the following, if true, is the lawyer's best defense?\n\nA. Payment of a small fine is the only penalty provided in the ordinance for those who park too close to fire hydrants.\nB. The police never issued a ticket to the lawyer for parking in front of the fire hydrant.\nC. The purpose. of the parking ordinance was tofacilitate access to the hydrant by fire trucks,not to protect against accidents like the onethat occurred when bricks fell on the lawyer'scar.\nD. The pedestrian would not have been injured ifthe construction company had properly maintained the crane.\n"

However, the defense can argue that the parking ordinance was not intended to protect against the specific type of accident that occurred (i.e., falling bricks causing a car explosion. By arguing that the purpose of the ordinance was to facilitate access to fire hydrants by fire trucks, the lawyer can argue that the injury was not a foreseeable risk of the parking violation.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not provide a strong defense because:\n\nA. Payment of a small fine is the only penalty provided in the ordinance for those who park too close to fire hydrants. This does not address the foreseeability of the accident or the purpose of the ordinance.\n\nB. The police never issued a ticket to the lawyer for parking in front of the fire hydrant. This does not address the foreseeability of the accident or the purpose of the ordinance.\n\nD. The pedestrian would not have been injured if the construction company had properly maintained the crane. This places the blame on the construction company, which is not the lawyer's best defense.\n\nTherefore, option C is the lawyer's best defense."
