Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $30,000.\n\nExplanation:\nThe company prepaid $90,000 for services that will be performed evenly over a six-month period from November 1, year 1, through April 30, year 2. Since the company paid the full amount in October, year 1, it needs to recognize the portion of the service expense that has already been incurred in year 1. \n\nThe services will be performed evenly over six months, so the company should recognize one-sixth of the total payment as an expense in year 1. \n\n$90,000 / 6 = $15,000 per month\n\nSince the payment was made in October, the company should recognize one month's worth of services expense in year 1:\n\n$15,000 * 1 = $15,000\n\nHowever, the question asks for the adjusting journal entry to properly report the prepayment in its year 1 financial statements. The correct adjustment is to recognize the portion of the service expense that has already been incurred in year 1, which is $15,000. \n\nTherefore, the adjusting journal entry should be:\n\nDebit Prepaid Services $15,000\nCredit Services Expense $15,000\n\nThis entry will properly report the prepayment in the company's year 1 financial statements."
