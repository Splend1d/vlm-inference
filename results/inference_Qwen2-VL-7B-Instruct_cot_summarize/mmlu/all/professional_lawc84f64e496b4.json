The statute appropriates the necessary funds but provides that the funds may not be expended until both houses of Congress have adopted a concurrent resolution, not subject to presentment to the President, approving the agency's plans for the monument's location and design. Is the provision requiring further congressional approval before expenditure of the funds constitutional?\n\nA. No, because decisions regarding the placement and design of government-owned structures are an exclusively executive function with which Congress may not interfere by any means.\nB. No, because the provision amounts to an unconstitutional legislative interference with an executive function.\nC. Yes, because Congress may attach reasonable conditions to its appropriation of funds to executive departments, and its special interest in the members of its own police force makes the provision a reasonable condition.\nD. Yes, because the provision is part of a statute that was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President.\n"

Yes, because Congress may attach reasonable conditions to its appropriation of funds to executive departments, and its special interest in the members of its own police force makes the provision a reasonable condition.\n\nThis answer is based on the principle that Congress has the authority to attach conditions to its appropriations, especially when those conditions are related to the public interest or the specific needs of the agency receiving the funds. In this case, the provision is related to the public interest in honoring the members of the Capitol Police Force, and it is reasonable for Congress to require further approval before the funds can be expended."
