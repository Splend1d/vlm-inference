Initially, educated Germans believed Germany had a special mission, which was later criticized after the collapse of 1945. Today, the predominant view is that Germany did not differ from other great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a \"unique German path.\"\n\nThe question asks us to infer what happened to the belief that Germany had a unique mission in history. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"resulted from Germany's defeat in World War II\"\n   - This option suggests that the belief was a direct result of Germany's defeat. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the defeat directly led to the discrediting of the belief. It mentions a shift in perception but does not specify the cause.\n\nB. \"was unaffected by Germany's defeat in World War II\"\n   - This option suggests that the belief remained unchanged despite the defeat. However, the passage clearly states that the belief changed after the defeat, so this option is incorrect.\n\nC. \"was proven correct by Germany's defeat in World War II\"\n   - This option suggests that the belief was validated by the defeat. However, the passage does not suggest that the defeat validated the belief. Instead, it indicates a shift in perception away from the belief.\n\nD. \"was discredited by Germany's defeat in World War II\"\n   - This option suggests that the belief was discredited after the defeat. The passage explicitly states that the belief changed after the defeat, indicating that the belief was discredited.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most accurate inference based on the passage is:\n\nThe belief that Germany had a unique mission in history was discredited by Germany's defeat in World War II.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is D."
