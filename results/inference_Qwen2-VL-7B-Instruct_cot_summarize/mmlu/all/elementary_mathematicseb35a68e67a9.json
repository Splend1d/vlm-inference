Everest is 29,028 feet above sea level.\n\nTo find the total distance, we add these two values together:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Depth of Mariana Trench} + \\text{Height of Mt. Everest} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Distance} = 35,840 \\text{ feet} + 29,028 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Distance} = 64,868 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice to 64,868 feet is:\n\nC. 64,000 feet"
