Several different classes (sets) of registers\n\nAggressive pipelining refers to the practice of overlapping the execution of multiple instructions to improve performance. This can be facilitated by having a large number of registers available for storing intermediate results, as it allows for more instructions to be executed in parallel. Therefore, having several different classes of registers is not an obstacle to aggressive pipelining.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\nA. Condition codes set by every instruction - This can be an obstacle because it requires additional logic to handle the condition codes, which can slow down the pipeline.\n\nB. Variable-length encoding of instructions - This can be an obstacle because it complicates the design of the instruction decoder and can lead to longer pipeline stages.\n\nC. Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute - This can be an obstacle because it makes it difficult to predict and schedule the execution of instructions in the pipeline."
