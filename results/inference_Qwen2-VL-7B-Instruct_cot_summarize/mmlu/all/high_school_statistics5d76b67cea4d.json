Students in the first class generally scored higher than students in the second class.**\n     - This is incorrect because the 40th percentile for the first class is lower than the 80th percentile for the second class, indicating that the first class has a higher proportion of lower scores.\n   - **B. Students in the second class generally scored higher than students in the first class.**\n     - This is the correct conclusion because the 80th percentile for the second class is higher than the 40th percentile for the first class, indicating that the second class has a higher proportion of higher scores.\n   - **C. A score at the 20th percentile for the first class is at the 40th percentile for the second class.**\n     - This is not necessarily true. The relationship between percentiles does not imply that a specific score at one class's percentile will be at the same percentile at the other class.\n   - **D. A score at the 50th percentile for the first class is at the 90th percentile for the second class.**\n     - This is also not necessarily true. The relationship between percentiles does not imply that a specific score at one class's percentile will be at the same percentile at the other class.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most reasonable conclusion is:\n\n**B. Students in the second class generally scored higher than students in the first class.**"
