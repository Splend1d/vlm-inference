It is particularly useful when the distribution of the data is unknown or when the sample size is small. Pure simulation, on the other hand, involves generating data from a known distribution to simulate the behavior of a system or process.\n\nGiven the options:\n\ni) If it is desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are the same as those of some actual data, bootstrapping would be preferred because it allows for the resampling of the actual data to mimic its distribution.\n\nii) If it is desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are known exactly, pure simulation would be preferred because it allows for the generation of data from a known distribution.\n\niii) If the distributional properties of the actual data are unknown, bootstrapping would be preferred because it does not require knowledge of the underlying distribution.\n\niv) If the sample of actual data available is very small, bootstrapping would be preferred because it can provide more reliable estimates with smaller samples compared to pure simulation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
