In this case, we want to find the choice of significance level (\u03b1 and sample size n that results in the greatest power of the test when the true mean \u03bc = 65.\n\nGiven:\n- H0: \u03bc = 70\n- Ha: \u03bc < 70\n- True mean \u03bc = 65\n\nWe need to calculate the power for each choice of \u03b1 and n.\n\n### Power Calculation\n\nThe power of a test is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Power} = 1 - \\text{Type II Error} \\]\n\nThe type II error (\u03b2 is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. For a one-sample t-test, the type II error is calculated using the non-centrality parameter (\u03b4, which is:\n\\[ \\delta = \\frac{\\mu - \\mu_0}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \u03bc is the true mean\n- \u03bc0 is the hypothesized mean ( (70 in this case)\n- \u03c3 is the population standard deviation ( (unknown but assumed to be known or estimated)\n- n is the sample size\n\n### Choice A: \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 15\n\nFor \u03bc = 65:\n\\[ \\delta = \\frac{65 - 70}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{15}} = \\frac{-5}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{15}} \\]\n\n### Choice B: \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 15\n\nFor \u03bc = 65:\n\\[ \\delta = \\frac{65 - 70}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{15}} = \\frac{-5}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{15}} \\]\n\n### Choice C: \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 30\n\nFor \u03bc = 65:\n\\[ \\delta = \\frac{65 - 70}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{-5}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{30}} \\]\n\n### Choice D: \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30\n\nFor \u03bc = 65:\n\\[ \\delta = \\frac{65 - 70}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{-5}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{30}} \\]\n\n### Comparing the Power\n\nThe power of the test is highest when the non-centrality parameter \u03b4 is largest. Since the \u03b4 is the same for all choices ( (\u03b4 = -5), the sample size n has the most significant impact on the power.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sample size n = 30 results in the greatest power of the test because it has more degrees of freedom, which increases the power of the test.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30"
