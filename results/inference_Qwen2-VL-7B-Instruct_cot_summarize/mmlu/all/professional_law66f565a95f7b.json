As part of an elaborate plan to increase the city's tourist trade and revive the local economy, the city planned to sell the beach houses to a company that would demolish the houses and build a luxury hotel in their place. The owners of the beach houses have challenged the city's exercise of eminent domain, contending only that the city's plan is unconstitutional. Will the owners of the beach houses be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a property owner can challenge an exercise of eminent domain only on the ground of the sufficiency of the compensation.\nB. No, because the planned sale to the private developer to increase the tourist trade qualifies as a public use.\nC. Yes, because a public entity cannot seize the property of one person in order to transfer that property intact to other private parties.\nD. Yes, because the city's action would deprive the owners of all economic use of their property.\n"

Yes, because a public entity cannot seize the property of one person in order to transfer that property intact to other private parties.\n\nThe owners of the beach houses are likely to prevail in their challenge to the city's exercise of eminent domain. The principle at issue here is the prohibition against the government seizing the property of one person in order to transfer it intact to another private party. This principle is known as the \"public use\" requirement, which means that the government must use the property for a public purpose, such as the creation of a public park or the construction of a public building. In this case, the city's plan to sell the beach houses to a private developer to build a luxury hotel does not qualify as a public use, as it is primarily intended to benefit private interests rather than the public. Therefore, the owners of the beach houses are likely to prevail in their challenge."
