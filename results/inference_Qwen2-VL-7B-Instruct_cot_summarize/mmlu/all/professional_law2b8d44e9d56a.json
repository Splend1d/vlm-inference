                    "text": "A state has adopted a system of bifurcated trials in cases in which a defendant's insanity is in issue. According to the bifurcated trial system, whenever a defendant pleads not guilty to an offense by reason of insanity, two trials will be held. The first one will simply determine whether the defendant has committed the offense for which she is charged. This trial will not address the issue of insanity. In the event that it is found that the defendant has, in fact, committed the offense, then a second trial will be conducted to determine whether she should be exculpated for the criminal action by reason of insanity. A woman was arrested and charged with murder. She pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At her first trial, the state introduced evidence showing that the woman was having an affair with the victim. When the victim tried to break off their relationship, the woman shot and killed him during a lover's quarrel. The woman was then called to testify in her own behalf. She testified that she had been living with the victim for two years prior to the time of his death. During that period she had undergone psychiatric treatment and was diagnosed as being schizophrenic. She further testified that at the time the victim was killed, she was under the influence of narcotics. While she was hallucinating, she remembered perceiving the victim as a demon and shot at this satanic figure in order to free herself from his evil spell. She then testified that she didn't believe shooting the demon was morally wrong. The prosecuting attorney objected to the woman's testimony. Over such objections, the trial judge admitted the woman's testimony. Was the trial judge correct in admitting the woman's testimony?\n\nA. No, because proof of mental disease requires the use of expert testimony.\nB. No, because testimony relating to her belief that she didn't know what she was doing was wrong, is not relevant until the second trial.\nC. Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the mental state necessary for the commission of the crime.\nD. Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the issue of self-defense.\n"

Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the mental state necessary for the commission of the crime.\n\nThe woman's testimony is relevant to the mental state necessary for the commission of the crime, as it pertains to her state of mind at the time of the murder. This testimony is crucial in determining whether she was legally insane at the time of the crime, which is the primary issue in the first trial. The fact that she was under the influence of narcotics and perceived the victim as a demon are relevant to her mental state and thus to the issue of her guilt or innocence."
