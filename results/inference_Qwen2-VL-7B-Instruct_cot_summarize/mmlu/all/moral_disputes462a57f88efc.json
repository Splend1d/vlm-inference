This is because the option of euthanasia can lead to a situation where the patient feels that they have no control over their own life and that they are being forced to make a decision that they may not truly want to make. This can be particularly harmful for patients who are already feeling vulnerable or who may have a pre-existing condition that makes them more susceptible to feeling like they have no control over their own life."
