For example, 2 + 4 = 6, which is in s. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. **S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.**\n- For any two elements a, b in s, their product a * b modulo 10 is also also in s. For example, 2 * 4 = 8, which is in s. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nC. **S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.**\n- The identity element for addition in any ring is 0. Since 0 is in s, this statement is true.\n\nD. **S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.**\n- The identity element for multiplication in any ring is 1. However, 1 is not in s. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nThus, the false statement is:\n\n**D. (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.**"
