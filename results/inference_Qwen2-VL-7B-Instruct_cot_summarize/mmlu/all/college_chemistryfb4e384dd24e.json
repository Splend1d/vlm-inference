Mass spectrometry involves the conversion of analyte molecules into gaseous ions through ionization processes such as electron ionization ( (EI), chemical ionization ( (CI), or fast atom bombardment ( (FAB).\n\n ii. The ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio.\n   - This is true. Mass spectrometry uses a mass analyzer to separate ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z. Common mass analyzers include quadrupole, time-of-flight ( (TOF), and magnetic sector analyzers.\n\n iii. In addition to compound identification, mass spectra can be utilized to determine precise isotopic mass and isotopic ratios.\n   - This is true. Mass spectrometry can provide detailed information about the isotopic composition of a compound, which is useful for identifying isotopes and their ratios.\n\nGiven this analysis, all three statements are characteristic of mass spectrometry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. I, II, and III"
