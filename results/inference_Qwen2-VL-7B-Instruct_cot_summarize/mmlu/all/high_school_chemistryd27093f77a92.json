The stronger the acid, the higher its percentage ionization will be. Here's a brief overview of the acids listed:\n\nA. Hono2 ( (Formic acid) - This is a weak acid.\nB. HClO4 ( (Perchloric acid) - This is a strong acid.\nC. H2S ( (Hydrogen sulfide) - This is a weak acid.\nD. H3PO4 ( (Phosphoric acid) - This is a weak acid.\n\nSince HClO4 is a strong acid, it will have the highest percentage ionization when dissolved in water. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. HClO4"
