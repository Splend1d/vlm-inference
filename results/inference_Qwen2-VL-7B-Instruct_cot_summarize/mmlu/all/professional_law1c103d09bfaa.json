Based on the evidence presented at these hearings, a senator wishes to introduce a bill providing free medical and hospital care for all citizens 70 years of age and older. The senator, however, intends to include a provision in the bill denying such medical and hospital care benefits to aliens (in the same age category) unless they have been legally admitted for permanent U. S. residency. The senator has asked for your advice regarding his proposed bill. You are understandably concerned about the legality of the aliens proviso. Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the provision disqualifying aliens from receiving such medical and hospital benefits?\n\nA. Due to the fact that the medical and hospital benefits will be paid for by the government, they are a privilege not a right and, therefore, are not within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.\nB. The disqualifying provision does not unduly burden either interstate commerce or the right of aliens to travel freely from state to state.\nC. The principles of equal protection apply against the states and not against the federal government.\nD. The disqualifying provision is reasonably related to legitimate congressional objectives under its immigration, citizenship, and spending powers.\n"

The disqualifying provision is reasonably related to legitimate congressional objectives under its immigration, citizenship, and spending powers.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that Congress has the authority to regulate immigration and to spend money for the general welfare. By including a provision that denies medical and hospital benefits to aliens unless they have been legally admitted for permanent U.S. residency, Congress is exercising its power to regulate immigration and to ensure that its spending is used for the benefit of U.S. citizens. This provision is therefore reasonably related to legitimate congressional objectives and is likely to be constitutional."
