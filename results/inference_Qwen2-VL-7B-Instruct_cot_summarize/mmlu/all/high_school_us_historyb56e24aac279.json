It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nAll of the following were part of Johnson's Great Society program EXCEPT\n\nA. the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nB.

It aimed to end segregation and discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin.\n\n2. **Medicare and Medicaid**: These were also part of the Great Society program. Medicare provided health insurance for the elderly, and Medicaid provided health insurance for the poor and disabled.\n\n3. **The establishment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( (HUD)**: This was also part of the Great Society program. HUD was created to address housing issues and urban development.\n\n4. **The balanced budget mandate**: This was not part of the Great Society program. The balanced budget mandate is a fiscal policy that requires government spending to be equal to or less than government revenue, which was not a part of Johnson's initiatives.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. the balanced budget mandate**"
