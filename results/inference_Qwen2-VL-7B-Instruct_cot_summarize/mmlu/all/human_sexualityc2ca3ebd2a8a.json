This study likely provides data on the sexual behaviors of different ethnic and cultural groups. Based on the information provided in the question, we are looking for a comparison between two groups of single men regarding their likelihood of having had more than one sexual partner in the previous year.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Chinese; North African Muslim\n- This option compares Chinese and North African Muslim men. Without specific data from the study, we cannot determine which group is more likely to have had more than one sexual partner.\n\nB. South Asian; English-speaking Caribbean\n- This option compares South Asian and English-speaking Caribbean men. Again, without specific data, we cannot determine which group is more likely to have had more than one sexual partner.\n\nC. South Asian; Chinese\n- This option compares South Asian and Chinese men. Without specific data, we cannot determine which group is more likely to have had more than one sexual partner.\n\nD. North African Muslim; Latin American\n- This option compares North African Muslim and Latin American men. Without specific data, we cannot determine which group is more likely to have had more than one sexual partner.\n\nSince none of the options provide specific data from the study, we cannot definitively choose one. However, if we had to make an educated guess based on general knowledge, we might consider that North African Muslim men might have higher rates of multiple sexual partners due to cultural and social factors, but this is speculative.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data, the correct answer cannot be determined from the options provided."
