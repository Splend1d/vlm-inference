The pH of a solution is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions (\\( [H^+] \\)) and the \\( K_a \\) of the acid by the equation:\n\n\\[ pH = -\\log[H^+] \\]\n\nGiven that the pH of the solution is 2.0, we can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration (\\( [H^+] \\)):\n\n\\[ pH = 2.0 \\]\n\\[ -\\log[H^+] = 2.0 \\]\n\\[ [H^+] = 10^{-2.0} \\]\n\\[ [H^+] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ M} \\]\n\nFor a weak monoprotic acid, the ionization constant \\( K_a \\) is related to the hydrogen ion concentration by the equation:\n\n\\[ K_a = [H^+] \\times [A^-] \\]\n\nSince the acid is monoprotic, the concentration of the conjugate base (\\( [A^-] \\)) is equal to the concentration of the hydrogen ions (\\( [H^+] \\)). Therefore:\n\n\\[ K_a = [H^+] \\times [H^+] \\]\n\\[ K_a = [H^+]^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the calculated hydrogen ion concentration:\n\n\\[ K_a = (1.0 \\times 10^{-2})^2 \\]\n\\[ K_a = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\]\n\nNone of the provided options match this value.
