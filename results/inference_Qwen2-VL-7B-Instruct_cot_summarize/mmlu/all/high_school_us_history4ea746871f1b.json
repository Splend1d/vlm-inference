Board of Education from 1954. This decision declared that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal and thus violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Continuing white resistance slowed efforts at desegregation, sparking a series of social conflicts throughout the South.\n- This option describes the aftermath of the decision, including resistance and social conflicts. It aligns with the effects of the decision.\n\nB. The Supreme Court decision Brown v. the Board of Education led to increased enrollment in colleges and universities.\n- This option suggests a direct increase in college enrollment due to the decision. However, the passage does not mention any direct impact on college enrollment.\n\nC. During the 1960s, increasing numbers of high school graduates rejected the notion that a college education was desirable.\n- This option suggests a change in the desirability of college education, which is not directly related to the decision described in the passage.\n\nD. In the twentieth century, jobs in advanced technical and medical industries generally require postgraduate degrees.\n- This option describes a general trend in job requirements, which is not directly related to the specific legal decision described in the passage.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Continuing white resistance slowed efforts at desegregation, sparking a series of social conflicts throughout the South."
