Could a state law requiring citizenship for teachers prevent him from doing so?\n\nA. Yes, because states can regulate aliens.\nB. Yes, because the teacher could exert too much influence.\nC. No, unless they use the rationally related to a legitimate state interest standard.\nD. No, there is no compelling state interest.\n"

No, unless they use the rationally related to a legitimate state interest standard.\n\nIn the United States, states generally have the authority to regulate the qualifications and licensing of teachers. However, such regulations must be rationally related to a legitimate state interest. This means that the state must have a compelling reason to require citizenship for teachers, and the regulation must be designed to achieve that interest in a reasonable manner. Without such a compelling state interest, a state law requiring citizenship for teachers would likely be found unconstitutional."
