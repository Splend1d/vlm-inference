Since B is a subset of A, B can have at most as many elements as A. Therefore, B must also be finite. This statement is always true.\n\n2. **If A is regular, then B is regular.**\n   - Regular languages are closed under taking subsets. If A is regular, then any subset of A (including B, which is a subset of A, must also be regular. This statement is always true.\n\n3. **If A is context-free, then B is context-free.**\n   - Context-free languages are not closed under taking subsets. This means that even if A is context-free, B might not be context-free. For example, consider A to be the language of all strings over \u03a3* that contain the substring \"ab\". B could be the subset of A consisting of strings that contain \"ab\" and also also contain \"ba\". This B is not context-free because it cannot be described by a context-free grammar. Therefore, this statement is not always true.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. I only**"
