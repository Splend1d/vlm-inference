These patients are more likely to get urinary tract infections if their blood sugar is unstable.\n\nDiabetes can affect the immune system and increase the risk of infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs. Poorly controlled blood sugar levels can weaken the immune system, making it easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract and cause an infection. It is important for patients with diabetes to monitor their blood sugar levels and follow their healthcare provider's recommendations to reduce the risk of UTIs."
