The idea is to generate pairs of random variables that are negatively correlated, such that the average of these pairs is closer to the expected value than the original random variables. This reduces the variance of the estimate and can lead to more accurate results with fewer replications.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the statements:\n\ni) Antithetic variates work by reducing the number of replications required to cover the whole probability space.\n- This is incorrect. Antithetic variates do not reduce the number of replications required to cover the whole probability space. Instead, they reduce the variance of the estimate, which can lead to more accurate results with fewer replications needed to achieve a certain level of confidence.\n\nii) Antithetic variates involve employing a similar variable to that used in the simulation, but whose properties are known analytically.\n- This is incorrect. Antithetic variates do not involve using a similar variable to that used in the simulation whose properties are known analytically. Instead, they involve generating pairs of random variables that are negatively correlated.\n\niii) Antithetic variates involve using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws.\n- This is correct. Antithetic variates involve using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws.\n\niv) Antithetic variates involve taking one over each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws.\n- This is incorrect. Antithetic variates do not involve taking one over each of the random draws. Instead, they involve using the negative of each of the random draws.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
