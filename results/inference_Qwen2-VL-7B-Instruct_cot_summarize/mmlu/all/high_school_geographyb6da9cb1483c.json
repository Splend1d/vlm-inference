A relict boundary refers to a boundary that has remained unchanged since the last ice age, typically forming a natural border between countries.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Vietnam - Vietnam does not share a relict boundary with any other country. Its borders have been subject to significant changes over time, including the partition during the Vietnam War.\n\nB. United Kingdom - The United Kingdom has a well-known example of a relict boundary, the English Channel, which has remained unchanged since the last ice age.\n\nC. Germany - Germany has a well-known example of a relict boundary, the Rhine River, which has remained a natural border since the last ice age.\n\nD. Bolivia - Bolivia does not share a relict boundary with any other country. Its borders have been subject to significant changes over time, including the partition during the War of the Pacific.\n\nGiven this analysis, the country that does not have a well-known example of a relict boundary is:\n\nA.
