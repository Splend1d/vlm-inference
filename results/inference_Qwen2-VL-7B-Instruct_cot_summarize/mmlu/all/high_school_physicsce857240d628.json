The other options are true:\n\nA. The average speed of the molecules increases because the temperature increases, and the average speed of the molecules is directly proportional to the temperature.\nB. The pressure increases because the temperature increases, and the pressure of an ideal gas is directly proportional to the temperature when the volume is constant.\nC. The kinetic energy of the system increases because the temperature increases, and the kinetic energy of the system is directly proportional to the temperature."
