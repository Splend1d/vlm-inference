Kass, a bioethicist, argues against reproductive cloning primarily because it allows one to impose their will on a child's future, which he considers to be a form of despotism.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Cloning is inherently morally wrong.\n- This statement is a conclusion rather than a premise. It is an assertion about the morality of cloning, not a foundational belief that supports the argument.\n\nB. In reproductive cloning, one seeks to impose one's will on a child's future.\n- This statement directly alignss with Kass's argument. It encapsulates the core idea that reproductive cloning allows for the imposition of one's will on a child's future, which is a central premise of his argument.\n\nC. The permissibility of cloning depends on the parent's intent to raise the child.\n- This statement is more about the conditions under which cloning might be permissible rather than a foundational premise about the nature of cloning itself.\n\nD. We have a good reason not to clone.\n- This statement is a conclusion rather than a premise. It is an assertion about the moral or ethical reasons against cloning, not a foundational belief that supports the argument.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. In reproductive cloning, one seeks to impose one's will on a child's future."
