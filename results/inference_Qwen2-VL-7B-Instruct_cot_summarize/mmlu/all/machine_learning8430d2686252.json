                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement step by step.\n\n### Statement 1\nIn AdaBoost, weights of the misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor.\n\nAdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers into a strong classifier. The key idea is to iteratively adjust the weights of the training examples. Specifically, in AdaBoost, the weights of the misclassified examples are increased by a factor of \\( \\frac{1}{1 - e_t} \\), where \\( e_t \\) is the weighted training error of the \\( t \\)-th weak classifier. This means that the weights of the misclassified examples are increased by a different factor for each iteration, not by the same multiplicative factor. Therefore, Statement 1 is **False**.\n\n### Statement 2\nIn AdaBoost, weighted training error \\( e_t \\) of the \\( t \\)-th weak classifier on training data with weights \\( D_t \\) tends to increase as a function of \\( t \\).\n\nThe weighted training error \\( e_t \\) in AdaBoost is defined as the fraction of the training examples that are misclassified by the \\( t \\)-th weak classifier, weighted by the weights \\( D_t \\). As the algorithm progresses through iterations, the weights \\( D_t \\) are adjusted based on the performance of the weak classifiers. Misclassified examples receive higher weights, which means that the weighted training error \\( e_t \\) tends to increase as the algorithm focuses more on correcting the misclassified examples. Therefore, Statement 2 is **True**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
