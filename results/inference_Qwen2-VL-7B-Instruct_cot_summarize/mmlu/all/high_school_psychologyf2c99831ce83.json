Here's a breakdown of each option:\n\nA. Changes must be made in the delivery of the core program.\n- This option suggests making changes to the core program itself. While it might be necessary to improve the effectiveness of the core program, it is not the only solution. It is important to first identify why students are not meeting competencies.\n\nB. Students who are not meeting competencies must be given strategic or supplemental instruction.\n- This option suggests providing additional support to students who are not meeting competencies. This could include tutoring, extra practice sessions, or other forms of supplemental instruction. This is a reasonable step to take, but it is not the only solution.\n\nC. Students must be given more time to develop competencies.\n- This option suggest giving students more time to develop competencies. While it might be necessary to provide additional time for students who are struggling, it is not the only solution. It is important to identify the underlying causes of the problem first.\n\nD. Students who are not meeting competencies must be evaluated for learning disabilities.\n- This option suggest evaluating students who are not meeting competencies for learning disabilities. This is a reasonable step to take, but it is not the only solution. It is important to identify the underlying cause of the problem first.\n\nIn conclusion, the best option is to first identify the underlying cause of the problem and then implement appropriate interventions. This could include changes in the delivery of the core program, providing additional support to students, giving students more time to develop competencies, or evaluating students for learning disabilities."
