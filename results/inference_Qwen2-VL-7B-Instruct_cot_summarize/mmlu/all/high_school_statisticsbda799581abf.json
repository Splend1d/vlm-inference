The standard deviation of the population is also zero.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The standard deviation of the population can be zero, but it can also also be non-zero. The standard deviation of the population is not directly determined by the sample standard deviation. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nB. The sample mean and sample median are equal.\n- When the standard deviation of the sample is zero, it means that all the values in the sample are identical. Therefore, the sample mean ( (which is the average of all the values) and the sample median ( (which is the middle value when the data is ordered) will both be the same value. This statement is true.\n\nC. The sample may have outliers.\n- If the standard deviation of the sample is zero, it means that all the values in the sample are identical. Therefore, there cannot be any outliers in the sample. This statement is false.\n\nD. The population has a symmetric distribution.\n- The standard deviation of being zero indicates that all the values in the sample are identical, but this does not necessarily imply anything about the shape of the distribution of the population. The population could have any distribution, including a symmetric one, but it could also also be skewed or have any other shape. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nThe true statement is:\n\nB. The sample mean and sample median are equal."
