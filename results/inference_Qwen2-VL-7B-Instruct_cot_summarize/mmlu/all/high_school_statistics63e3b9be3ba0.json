Using the z-score formula again, but this time solving for \\( X \\):\n\n\\[ 1.5 = \\frac{(X - 112)}{10} \\]\n\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 10 = X - 112 \\]\n\n\\[ 15 = X - 112 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 15 + 112 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 127 \\]\n\nTherefore, the student's score on the final exam must have been 127 points to have the same z-score as her 58-point score on the midterm.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 127 points."
