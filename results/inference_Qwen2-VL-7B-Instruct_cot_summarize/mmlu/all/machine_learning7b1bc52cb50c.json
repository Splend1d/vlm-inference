They are not feedforward neural networks. They use residual connections, which are a form of feedback, making them a type of recurrent neural network (RNN.\n     - **Transformers:** Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that is not feedforward. They are based on self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to process sequences in parallel, making them a type of recurrent neural network (RNN.\n   - **Conclusion:** Statement 1 is **False**.\n\n2. **Statement 2| The original Transformers use self-attention, but the original ResNet does not.**\n   - **Analysis:**\n     - **Transformers:** Yes, the original Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to compute the output of of a given input element based on the other elements in the same (sequence.\n     - **ResNet:** No, the original ResNet does not use self-attention. Instead, it uses residual connections, which are a form of feedback, allowing it to process sequences in parallel.\n   - **Conclusion:** Statement 2 is **True**.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
