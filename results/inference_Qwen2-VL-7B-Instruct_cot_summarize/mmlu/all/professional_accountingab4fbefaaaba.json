Under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods.\n\nExplanation:\n- A. In periods of rising prices, the LIFO method results in a higher cost of sales and lower taxable income, not lower cost of sales and higher taxable income, when compared to the FIFO method. This is because LIFO assumes that the oldest ( and therefore the most expensive goods are sold first, leading to a higher cost of sales and lower taxable income.\n- B. The taxpayer is not required to receive permission each year from the Internal Revenue Service to continue the use of the LIFO method. The choice of inventory valuation method, including LIFO, is a management decision and does not require IRS approval.\n- C. The LIFO method can be used for tax purposes even if the FIFO method is used for financial statement purposes. This is because tax laws and accounting standards are separate, and a company can choose different methods for tax and financial reporting purposes.\n- D. This statement is accurate. Under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods, which is the core principle of LIFO."
