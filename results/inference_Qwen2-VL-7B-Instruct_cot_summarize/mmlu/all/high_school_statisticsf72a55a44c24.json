This can be done using the concept of z-scores and the standard normal distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the proportion of riders who wait between 0 and 31.7 minutes. We can use the z-score formula to convert the waiting times into standard normal distribution values:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( x \\) is the waiting time, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean waiting time, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFor waiting times between 0 and 31.7 minutes:\n\n\\[ z_1 = \\frac{0 - 35}{10} = -3.5 \\]\n\\[ z_2 = \\frac{31.7 - 35}{10} = -0.37 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the proportion of riders who wait between these two z-scores. We can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the cumulative probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(z \\le \\le -3.5) \\approx 0.0002 \\]\n\\[ P(z \\ \\geq -0.37) \\approx 0.6446 \\]\n\nThe proportion of riders who wait between 0 and 31.7 minutes is:\n\n\\[ P(-3.5 \\ \\le \\ z \\ \\ \\le -0.37) = P(z \\ \\geq -0.37) - P(z \\ \\le \\ -3.5) \\]\n\\[ P(-3.5 \\ \\ \\le \\ z \\ \\ \\le -0.37) \\approx 0.6446 - 0.0002 \\]\n\\[ \\approx 0.6444 \\]\n\nThis proportion is approximately 64.44%, which means that about 64.44% of the riders wait between 0 and 31.7 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to find the range of waiting times that includes 100,000 riders out of 150,000 riders. We can use the z-score formula again to find the waiting times corresponding to the proportion of 100,000 riders:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nFor waiting times between 31.7 and 39.3 minutes:\n\n\\[ z_1 = \\frac{31.7 - 35}{10} = -0.37 \\]\n\\[ z_2 = \\frac{39.3 - 35}{10} = 0.43 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the proportion of riders who wait between these two z-scores. We can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the cumulative probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(z \\ \\geq -0.37) \\approx 0.6446 \\]\n\\[ P(z \\ \\le \\ 0.43) \\approx 0.6681 \\]\n\nThe proportion of riders who wait between 31.7 and 39.3 minutes is:\n\n\\[ P(-0.37 \\ \\ \\le \\ z \\ \\ \\le \\ 0.43) = P(z \\ \\le \\ 0.43) - P(z \\ \\geq -0.37) \\]\n\\[ \\approx 0.6681 - 0.6446 \\]\n\\[ \\approx 0.0235 \\]\n\nThis proportion is approximately 2.35%, which means that about 2.35% of the riders wait between 31.7 and 39.3 minutes.\n\nFinally, we need to find the range of waiting times that includes 100,000 riders out of 150,000 riders. We can use the z-score formula again to find the waiting times corresponding to the proportion of 100,000 riders:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nFor waiting times between 25.3 and 44.7 minutes:\n\n\\[ z_1 = \\frac{25.3 - 35}{10} = -0.97 \\]\n\\[ z_2 = \\frac{44.7 - 35}{10} = 0.97 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the proportion of riders who wait between these two z-scores. We can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the cumulative probabilities:\n\n\\["
