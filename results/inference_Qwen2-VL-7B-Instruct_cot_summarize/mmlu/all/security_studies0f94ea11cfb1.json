There is no direct return on investment in building security systems.\n- This is a common challenge because security investments are often seen as a cost rather than an investment. Companies may prioritize other areas of their business that promise more immediate returns, such as marketing or sales, over security.\n\nB. Security systems are detrimental to usability and can make IT systems less functional, and therefore less attractive to the consumer.\n- Security measures can sometimes interfere with the user experience, leading to usability issues. This can make the product less appealing to consumers, as they may prefer a product that is easier to use and less prone to security issues.\n\nC. There is pressure to reduce the time it taking to get a new IT product or system onto the market, so security systems are sacrificed in order to reduce the time to market.\n- Time-to market is a critical factor in the success of IT products and systems. Companies may be tempted to skip thorough security testing or implementation to meet deadlines, which can compromise the security of the product or system.\n\nTherefore, all of these options represent significant obstacles to developing robust IT security in the context of commerce and marketing."
