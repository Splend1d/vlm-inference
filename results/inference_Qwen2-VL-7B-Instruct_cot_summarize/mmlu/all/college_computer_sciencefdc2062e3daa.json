P_1 can be solved in polynomial time but P_2 is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **P_1 ( Shortest Simple Path:** This problem can be solved in polynomial time using algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm. These algorithms have time complexity O((V+E) log V) or O(V^2) respectively, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. Since these algorithms run in polynomial time, P_1 can be solved in polynomial time.\n\n- **P_2 Longest Simple Path:** The problem of finding a longest simple path between two vertices in an undirected graph is known to be NP-hard. This means that it is not known whether there exists a polynomial-time algorithm to solve this problem. The NP-hardness of this problem implies that it is unlikely that P_2 can be solved in polynomial time, and it is not known whether it is possible to solve it in polynomial time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
