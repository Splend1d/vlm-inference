Source 2 mentions the tradition of making pictorial representations and its utility in showing the incarnation of the Word of God as real, rather than fantastic.\n\nBoth sources are concerned with religious iconography, which is the use of visual representations in religious contexts. The debate seems to revolve around the appropriateness and significance of using images in religious practices.\n\nGiven this analysis, the context of the debate is best understood as:\n\nC. Disagreement about the appropriate use of religious iconography\n\nThis option directly addresses the central theme of the sources, which is the use and significance of religious images in religious practices."
