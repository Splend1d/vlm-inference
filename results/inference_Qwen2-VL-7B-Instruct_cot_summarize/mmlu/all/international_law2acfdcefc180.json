Conciliation is the continuation of mediation with the difference that conciliation produces a binding result, while mediation does not.\n\nConciliation and mediation are both methods used to resolve disputes, but they differ in several key aspects:\n\n1. **Nature of the Result**: Mediation aims to facilitate a voluntary agreement between the parties, but it does not produce a legally binding outcome. Conciliation, on the other hand, can lead to a legally binding agreement or settlement, as it often involves the conciliator's authority to propose terms that the parties must accept or reject.\n\n2. **Role of the Conciliator**: In mediation, the mediator is neutral and impartial, facilitating communication and understanding between the parties. In conciliation, the conciliator may have more authority and can propose terms that the parties must accept or reject, making the process more directive.\n\n3. **Process and Approach**: Mediation typically involves a more collaborative and less confrontational approach, with the mediator helping the parties to find common ground. Conciliation can be more directive, with the conciliator taking a more active role in proposing solutions.\n\n4. **Legal Nature**: Mediation is generally considered to be a non-binding process, whereas conciliation can lead to a legally binding agreement if the parties accept the conciliator's proposals.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that conciliation is the continuation of mediation with the difference that conciliation produces a binding result, while mediation does not."
