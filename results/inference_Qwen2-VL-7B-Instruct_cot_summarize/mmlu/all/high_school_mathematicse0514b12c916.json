Then, he can add the remaining numbers, 2 and 4, to this product.\n\nSo, the calculation would be: $48 + 2 + 4 = 54$.\n\nHowever, this option is not listed among the choices provided. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options. Given the operations and numbers provided, the highest possible number John could obtain is 54, which is not listed among the options A, B, C, or D. \n\nIf the question intended to include the option for the highest possible number that can be obtained with the given operations and numbers, then the correct answer would be 54, which is not listed among the provided options."
