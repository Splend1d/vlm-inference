Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days.\n- This scenario involves adding two quantities (six miles each day for two days, which is 6 miles/day x 2 days = 12 miles. This does not match the expression 6 x 2.\n\nB. Rocco had six baseballs and gave away two of them.\n- This scenario involves subtraction, not multiplication. Rocco starts with six baseballs and gives away two, which is 6 - 2 = 4 baseballs. This does not match the expression 6 x 2.\n\nC. Rocco had a total of six tennis balls in two cans.\n- This scenario involves division, not multiplication. Rocco has six tennis balls in two cans, which is 6 tennis balls / 2 cans = 3 tennis balls per can. This does not match the expression 6 x 2.\n\nD. Rocco biked six miles and then continued for two more miles.\n- This scenario involves addition, not multiplication. Rocco bikes six miles and then continues for two more miles, which is 6 miles + 2 miles = 8 miles. This does not match the expression 6 x 2.\n\nNone of the options directly match the expression 6 x 2. However, if we interpret the expression as a multiplication of a quantity by two, the closest scenario would be:\n\nA. Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days.\n- This scenario involves multiplying the quantity of miles hiked each day (6 miles/day by the number of days (2 days, which is 6 miles/day x 2 days = 12 miles. This matches the expression 6 x 2.\n\nTherefore, the situation that could be represented by the expression 6 x 2 is:\n\nA. Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days."
