                    "text": "To determine how much energy Americans waste each year by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Energy required to produce ice**: The energy required to produce ice from water is approximately 336 kJ per kg of ice. This energy is typically provided by electricity.\n\n2. **Energy required to melt ice**: When ice is thrown out, it needs to be melted back into water, which requires additional energy. The energy required to melt ice is approximately 336 kJ per kg of ice.\n\n3. **Energy required to cool the water**: The water that is melted from the ice needs to be cooled back to the desired temperature ( typically around 0\u00b0C. The energy required to cool water is approximately 4.18 kJ per kg of water.\n\n4. **Energy required to dispose of the water**: The energy required to dispose of the water is negligible compared to the other steps.\n\nLet's assume an average household uses 1 kg of ice per day and there are approximately 300 million households in the United States. \n\nThe total energy required per day for one household is:\n\\[ 336 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\times 1 \\, \\text{kg} + 336 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\times 1 \\, \\text{kg} + 4.18 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\times 1 \\, \\text{kg} = 676.18 \\, \\text{kJ} \\]\n\nFor 300 million households:\n\\[ 676.18 \\, \\text{kJ/household/day} \\times 300,000,000 \\, \\text{households} = 202,854,000,000 \\, \\text{kJ/year} \\]\n\nConverting kJ to J:\n\\[ 202,854,000,000 \\, \\text{kJ/year} \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{J/kJ} = 202,854,000,000,000 \\, \\text{J/year} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest power of 10:\n\\[ 202,854,000,000,000 \\, \\text{J/year} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{J/year} \\]\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is:\nC. 6*10^14 J"
