To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined.

When a word is hashed and its corresponding entry in the hash table is set to true, it indicates that the word was indeed in the dictionary.\n\n2. **False means the word was not in the dictionary.**\n   - This statement is also correct. When a word is hashed and its corresponding entry in the hash table is set to false, it indicates that the word was not in the dictionary.\n\n3. **Hash table size should increase with document size.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The size of the hash table is determined by the number of words in the dictionary, not by the size of the document. The document size does not affect the size of the hash table.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. I and II only**"
