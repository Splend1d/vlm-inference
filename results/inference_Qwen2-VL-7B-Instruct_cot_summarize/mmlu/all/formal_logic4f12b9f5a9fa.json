If Beth rides her bike ( (B \u2283)\n2. She gets to work earlier ( (W)\n\nThe sentence is structured as \"If B, then W,\" which is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this is represented as:\n\nA. B \u2283 W\n\nThis means that if B (Beth rides her bike) is true, then W (she gets to work earlier) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the other options:\nB. W \u2283 B\nThis represents the inverse of the original statement. It says \"If she gets to work earlier, then Beth rides her bike.\" This is not the same as the original statement.\n\nC. B \u2261 W\nThis represents a biconditional statement, meaning \"Beth rides her bike if and only if she gets to work earlier.\" This is not the same as the original statement, which is a conditional statement.\n\nD. Both A and B\nThis is incorrect because B is not the correct representation of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the sentence \"If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier\" is:\n\nA.
