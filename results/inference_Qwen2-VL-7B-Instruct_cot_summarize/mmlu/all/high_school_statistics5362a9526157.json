She selects a random sample of students and collects information about their family income. A 95 percent confidence interval computed from this data for the mean income per family is ($35,095, $45,005). Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?\n\nA. 95 percent of the students in her school are from families whose income is between $35,095 and $45,005.\nB. There is a 95% probability that the families of all the students in this school have an income of between $35,095 and $45,005.\nC. If we were to take another sample of the same size and compute a 95 percent confidence interval, we would have a 95% chance of getting the interval ($35,095, $45,005).\nD. There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.\n"

There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.\n\nThis interpretation is correct because a 95 percent confidence interval provides an estimate of the range within which the true mean income per family is likely to fall, with 95 percent confidence. It does not imply that 95 percent of the students' families fall within this range or that there is a 95 percent probability that the families of all students in the school have an income within this range."
