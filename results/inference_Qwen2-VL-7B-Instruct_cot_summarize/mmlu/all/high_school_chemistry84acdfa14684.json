The equation is:\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Base}]}{[\\text{Acid}]\\right) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- pH = 4.26\n- The acid is monoprotic, so the base is the conjugate base.\n- The concentration of the acid ([Acid]) is 0.0025 mol / 0.250 L = 0.0100 M.\n- The concentration of the base ([Base]) is the same as the concentration of the conjugate base, which is also 0.0100 M.\n\nPlugging these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n\\[ 4.26 = \\text{pKa} + \\log\\left(\\frac{0.0100}{0.0100}\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ 4.26 = \\text{pKa} + \\log(1) \\]\n\nSince \\(\\log(1) = 0\\), we have:\n\n\\[ 4.26 = \\text{pKa} \\]\n\nTherefore, the pKa of the weak acid is 4.26.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 4.26"
