One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nAccording to the passage, which statement below correctly describes the economy of Ghana?\n\nA.

This indicates that salt mining is a significant activity in Ghana.\n\n2. **Cattle Raising**: There is no mention of cattle raising or the production of meat and hides in the passage.\n\n3. **Taxes on Salt and Copper**: The passage explicitly states that the king of Ghana taxes salt and copper when they are brought into or sent out of the country. This suggests that there is a trade in these goods.\n\n4. **Self-Sufficient Farming Economy**: The passage does not provide any information about the farming economy being self-sufficient. It does mention that the people grow vegetables with sweet water from wells, but this does not necessarily indicate a self-sufficient farming economy.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct description of Ghana's economy is:\n\n**C. The king of Ghana taxed salt and copper imports and exports.**"
