Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization: This is expected because antibodies binding to ZP3 would prevent the sperm from recognizing and binding to it, thus blocking fertilization.\n- B. Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization: This is expected because binding of ZP3 to sperm is necessary for the acrosomal reaction to occur, which is essential for fertilization.\n- C. Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization: This is expected because antibodies binding to ZP3 would prevent the sperm from recognizing and binding to it, thus blocking fertilization.\n- D. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads: This is not expected because ZP2 is a different glycoprotein and does not bind to the sperm receptors that are necessary for the acrosomal reaction and fertilization. Therefore, it should not lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
