This is because the order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a^n = e\\), where \\(a\\) is the element and \\(e\\) is the identity element of the group. In the case of permutations, the identity element is the permutation that leaves all objects in their original positions. The largest possible order of a permutation of 5 objects is when the permutation is a cycle of length 5, which is the identity permutation. Therefore, the answer is A."
