It ranges from -1 to 1. The square of of the correlation coefficient ( (r^2) represents the proportion of the variance in one variable that is predictable from the other variable.\n\nFor a correlation of 0.3:\n\\[ r^2 = 0.3^2 = 0.09 \\]\nThis means that 9% of the variation in y is explained by the variation in x.\n\nFor a correlation of 0.6:\n\\[ r^2 = 0.6^2 = 0.36 \\]\nThis means that 36% of the variation in y is explained by the variation in x.\n\nTo find how many times the percentage of variation in y explained by the variation in x is for a correlation of 0.6 compared to a correlation of 0.3, we divide the percentage for the correlation of 0.6 by the percentage for the correlation of 0.3:\n\\[ \\frac{36\\%}{9\\%} = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of variation in y explained by the variation in x is 4 times the percentage indicated by a correlation of 0.3.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 4"
