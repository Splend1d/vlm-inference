There is no difference between combatants and noncombatants.\n- This option suggests that there is no distinction between combatants and noncombatants, which is a strong statement that implies a complete lack of differentiation.\n\nB. The difference between combatants and noncombatants is a matter of degree.\n- This option suggests that the distinction between combatants and noncombatants is not absolute but rather a matter of degree. This implies that there is some differentiation but it is not categorical.\n\nC. The difference between combatants and noncombatants is categorical and clear.\n- This option suggests that the distinction between combatants and noncombatants is categorical and clear, meaning there is a clear and distinct line between the two groups.\n\nD. \"Tremism\" should be defined as indiscriminate violence.\n- This option suggests that \"terrorism\" should be defined as indiscriminate violence, which is a specific definition of terrorism but does not directly address the discrimination in war.\n\nGiven the context of discrimination in war, the most fitting option is:\n\nC. The difference between combatants and noncombatants is categorical and clear.\n\nThis option alignss with the idea that there is a clear distinction between combatants and noncombatants, which is a fundamental aspect of the discussion of discrimination in war."
