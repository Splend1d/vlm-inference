Animal growth assays underestimate the quality of dietary proteins for human nutrition\n\nThis is because animal growth assays, such as the rat protein efficiency ratio (PER) and the rat net protein utilization (NPU, are not ideal models for assessing protein quality in human nutrition. These assays are based on animal models and may not accurately reflect the human body's response to dietary proteins. Human nutrition requires a more accurate assessment of protein quality that takes into account the specific needs and responses of the human body."
