In the deed, the grantee and her assigns were required by covenant to share proportionately in the paving of a road that abutted the property. The grantee conveyed the property to a married couple by special warranty deed that did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. The buyers did not have an attorney and did not do a title search. When the road was completed, the married couple buyers refused to pay the share that was demanded of them. The original sellers of the parcel sued the couple in an equity claim without a jury. The judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving. On appeal, will the appellate court affirm the trial judge's order?\n\nA. Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns\".\nB. Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.\nC. No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.\nD. No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. No, because the general warranty of of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn the context of real estate law, a covenant running with the land is a condition that binds not only the original parties to the deed but also all subsequent owners of the property. This means that the covenant would apply to the married couple buyers in this case, even though they did not receive the covenant in their special warranty deed.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks whether the appellate court will affirm the trial judge's order. The trial judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving, which implies that the court found that the covenant was enforceable against the buyers.\n\nGiven the options:\n\n- **A. Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns\".** This option is incorrect because it suggests that the covenant is enforceable against the buyers, which is not necessarily the case based on the information provided.\n- **B. Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.** This option is incorrect because it does not address the specific legal principle of covenants running with the land.\n- **C. No, because the general warranty of of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.** This option is correct because it correctly identifies that the general warranty deed did not extend to subsequent purchasers, and thus the covenant would not apply to the married couple buyers.\n- **D. No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.** This option is incorrect because it suggests that the covenant was not enforceable against the buyers, which is not the case based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court is likely to affirm the trial judge's order because the covenant was intended to run with the land and bind subsequent owners, even though it was not explicitly stated in the deed to the married couple."
