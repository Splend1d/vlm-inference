Unfortunately, I don't have access to specific data on this topic. However, I can provide a general approach to answering such a question based on typical trends and available information.\n\n1. **Identify the trend for men**: Look for data or studies that show the trend in the number of unmarried men aged 20 to 45 who report having multiple partners from 1988 to 1990.\n2. **Identify the trend for women**: Similarly, look for data or studies that show the trend in the number of unmarried women aged 20 to 45 who report having multiple partners from 1988 to 1990.\n\nBased on the trends, you can then determine whether the number of multiple partners declined for both men and women ( declined for men but not for women, declined for women but not for men, or declined for men and remained the same for women.\n\nSince I don't have specific data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to specific data or studies, you can compare the trends for men and women to determine the correct answer."
