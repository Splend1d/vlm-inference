In this case, the defendant entered the store with a gun in his possession, which is a threat of force. The owner's fear of being hurt or having anything happen to him is irrelevant to the crime of robbery. The defendant's taking of the money from the register is also the act of obtaining property from another person, which is the definition of robbery. Therefore, the defendant should be found guilty of robbery."
