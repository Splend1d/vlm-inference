The defendant acted without deliberation and premeditation.\n\nVoluntary manslaughter is a charge that requires the defendant to have acted in a state of passion or heat of passion, typically following a provocation. The key elements to establish voluntary manslaughter include:\n\n1. The defendant must have acted in the heat of passion.\n2. The defendant must have been provoked by a sufficiently serious provocation.\n3. The defendant must have acted without deliberation and premeditation.\n\nOption D states that the defendant acted without deliberation and premeditation, which is actually a necessary element for establishing voluntary manslaughter. Therefore, this statement would be proper proof to establish a voluntary manslaughter charge to the jury.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are all potential elements that could be used to establish a voluntary manslaughter charge, but they are not as directly related to the core elements of the charge as option D."
