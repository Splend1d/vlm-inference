It mentions that the specter of Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be a power and that it is high time for the Communist party to publish its views.\n\nBy 1917, the Russian Revolution had occurred, which was a violent overthrow of the Russian monarchy by the working class ( the proletariat. This event aligns with the idea discussed in the pamphlet that the specter of Communism is a power and that the Communist party should openly publish its views.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The avoidance of entangling foreign alliances - This is not directly related to the content of the pamphlet or the events leading up to 1917.\n\nB. The violent overthrow of the the bourgeoisie by the proletariat - This align with the idea discussed in the pamphlet and the events leading up to 1917.\n\nC. The establishment of a powerful Russian Parliament - This is not directly related to the content of the pamphlet or the events leading up to 1917.\n\nD. The adoption of free education for all children in public schools - This is not directly related to the content of the pamphlet or the events leading up to 1917.\n\nTherefore, the idea that had become a reality in Russia by 1917, as discussed in the pamphlet, is:\n\nB. The violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat"
