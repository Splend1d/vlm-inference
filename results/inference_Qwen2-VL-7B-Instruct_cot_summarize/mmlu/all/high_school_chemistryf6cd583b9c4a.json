Bases donate hydroxide ions (OH- into solution, but not all bases donate OH- ions. For example, ammonia (NH3) is a base but does not donate OH- ions; instead, it donates a proton (H+.\n\nB. Only strong bases create solutions in which OH- ions are present.\n- This statement is incorrect. Both strong and weak bases can create solutions with OH- ions. Strong bases completely dissociate in solution, while weak bases only partially dissociate.\n\nC. Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\n- This statement is incorrect. Both strong and weak bases can be good conductors when dissolved in solution. Conductivity depends on the ability of the solution to carry an electric current, which is influenced by the concentration and mobility of ions in the solution, not just the strength of the base.\n\nD. For weak bases, the concentration of the OH-ions exceeds the concentration of the base in the solution.\n- This statement is incorrect. For weak bases, the concentration of the base in the solution is typically much higher than the concentration of the OH- ions. The concentration of OH- ions is determined by the degree of dissociation of the weak base, which is usually very low.\n\nNone of the options provided are true for all bases. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNone of the above statements are true for all bases."
