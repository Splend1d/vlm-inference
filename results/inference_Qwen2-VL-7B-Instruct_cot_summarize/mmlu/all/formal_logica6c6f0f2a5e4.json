From the first premise \\( A \\supset (B \\cdot C \\), we know that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( B \\cdot C \\) must also be true.\n2. The second premise \\( \\neg(B \\cdot C) \\) tells us that \\( B \\cdot C \\) is false.\n3. Since \\( B \\cdot C \\) is false, \\( A \\) cannot be true because if \\( A \\) were true, then \\( B \\cdot C \\) would have to be true ( (contradiction).\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that \\( A \\) must be false.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\nA. \\( A \\)\n- This is not an immediate consequence because \\( A \\) can be true or false depending on the truth values of \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nB. \\( \\neg A \\)\n- This is an immediate consequence because if \\( A \\) is false, then \\( \\neg A \\) is true.\n\nC. \\( B \\)\n- This is not an immediate consequence because \\( B \\) can be true or false independently of \\( A \\).\n\nD. \\( \\neg B \\)\n- This is not an immediate consequence because \\( \\neg B \\) cannot be determined solely from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\( \\neg A \\)"
