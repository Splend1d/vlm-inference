If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level.\n- This statement is incorrect. If there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 10% level, it does not necessarily mean there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level. The significance level (\u03b1 ( (alpha) is a threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, and a lower \u03b1 level requires stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nB. Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\n- This statement is incorrect. The choice between a one-sided and a two-sided test is made before the data are gathered, based on the research question and the hypothesis being tested.\n\nC. If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n- This statement is incorrect. The 1% level refers to the significance level (\u03b1 ( (alpha), which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. It does not represent the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is false.\n\nD. The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\n- This statement is correct. The power of a test is defined as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It is a measure of the test's ability to detect an effect, if there is one.\n\nTherefore, the true statement about hypothesis testing is:\n\nD. The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis."
