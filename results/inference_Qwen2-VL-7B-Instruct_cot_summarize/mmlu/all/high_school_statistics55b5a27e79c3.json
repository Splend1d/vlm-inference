The insurance agent is successful in selling a life insurance policy to 20 percent of the customers he contacts. This means that the probability of successfully selling a policy to a customer is 0.20, and the probability of failing to sell a policy to a customer is 0.80.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Assign numbers 0, 1 to successfully sell a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n- This option assigns 0 and 1 to success ( (0.20 probability) and 2 to 9 to failure ( (0.80 probability). This is incorrect because it does not match the given probabilities.\n\nB. Assign numbers 0, 1 to successfully sell a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n- This option assigns 0 and 1 to success (0.20 probability) and 2, 3, 4 to failure (0.80 probability). This is incorrect because it does not match the given probabilities.\n\nC. Assign number 0 to successfully sell a policy to a customer and number 1 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n- This option assigns 0 to success ( (0.20 probability) and 1 to failure ( (0.80 probability).

Assign numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 to successfully sell a policy to a customer and numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n- This option assigns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 to success ( (0.20 probability) and 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failure ( (0.80 probability).
