If a void void purchase order represents office equipment ordered and never received, it means that the purchase order was processed and approved, but the equipment was never received. This could indicate a weakness in the internal control process, as the purchase order was approved without the corresponding receipt of the equipment. Therefore, replacing the void void purchase order with another would allow the auditor to continue testing the internal control process effectively."
