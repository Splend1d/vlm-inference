This will help us understand how far each individual's height is from the average height for their sex.\n\nFor the man:\n- Mean height for men = 70 inches\n- Standard deviation for men = 4 inches\n- Height of the man = 74 inches\n\nFirst, calculate the number of standard deviations above the mean the man's height is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of standard deviations} = \\frac{\\text{Height of the man} - \\text{Mean height for men}}{\\text{Standard deviation for men}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of standard deviations} = \\frac{74 - 70}{4} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of standard deviations} = \\frac{4}{4} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of standard deviations} = 1 \\]\n\nSo, the man's height is 1 standard deviation above the mean height for men.\n\nFor the woman:\n- Mean height for women = 66 inches\n- Standard deviation for women = 3 inches\n- Height of the woman = 70 inches\n\nFirst, calculate the number of standard deviations above the mean the woman's height is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of standard deviations} = \\frac{\\text{Height of the woman} - \\text{Mean height for women}}{\\text{Standard deviation for women}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of standard deviations} = \\frac{70 - 66}{3} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of standard deviations} = \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of standard deviations} \\approx 1.33 \\]\n\nSo, the woman's height is approximately 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height for women.\n\nComparing the number of standard deviations above the mean for each individual:\n- Man: 1 standard deviation\n- Woman: 1.33 standard deviations\n\nThe woman's height is more unusually tall within her respective sex because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height for women, whereas the man's height is only 1 standard deviation above the mean height for men.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. The woman, because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of of all women, whereas the man\u2019s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of of all men."
