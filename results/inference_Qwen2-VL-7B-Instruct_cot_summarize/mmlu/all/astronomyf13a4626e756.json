To measure galactic distance.\n\nCepheid stars are important for astronomers because they have a well-defined relationship between their luminosity and the period of their pulsation. This relationship, known as the Period-Luminosity Law, allows astronomers to use Cepheid stars as \"standard candles\" to measure distances in the universe. By comparing the observed brightness of a Cepheid star with its known intrinsic brightness, astronomers can calculate the distance to the star. This method is particularly useful for measuring distances to galaxies that are too far away for other methods, such as parallax, to be effective."
