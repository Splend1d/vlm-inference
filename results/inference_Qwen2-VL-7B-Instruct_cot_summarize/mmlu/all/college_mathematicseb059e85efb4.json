This means that any polynomial in \\( V \\) can be written in the form \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\), where \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\) are real numbers.\n   - The dimension of \\( V \\) is the number of independent coefficients, which is 4.\n\n2. **Dimension of \\( W \\)**:\n   - \\( W \\) is the subspace of \\( V \\) where all polynomials satisfy \\( p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0 \\).\n   - This means that for any polynomial \\( p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\) in \\( W \\), we have \\( p(0) = d = 0 \\), \\( p(1) = a + b + c + d = 0 \\), and \\( p(-1) = -a + b - c + d = 0 \\).\n   - From \\( p(0) = 0 \\), we get \\( d = 0 \\).\n   - From \\( p(1) = 0 \\), we get \\( a + b + c = 0 \\).\n   - From \\( p(-1) = 0 \\), we get \\( -a + b - c = 0 \\).\n   - These equations can be rewritten as:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{align*}\n     a + b + c &= 0 \\\\\n     -a + b - c &= 0\n     \\end{align*}\n     \\]\n   - Adding these equations, we get \\( 2b = 0 \\), so \\( b = 0 \\).\n   - Substituting \\( b = 0 \\) into the first equation, we get \\( a + c = 0 \\), so \\( c = -a \\).\n   - Therefore, any polynomial in \\( W \\) can be written in the form \\( ax^3 - ax + d \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( d \\) are real numbers.\n   - The dimension of \\( W \\) is the number of independent coefficients, which is 2.\n\n3. **Sum of the dimensions**:\n   - The dimension of \\( V \\) is 4.\n   - The dimension of \\( W \\) is 2.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\dim V + \\dim W = 4 + 2 = 6 \\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 6"
