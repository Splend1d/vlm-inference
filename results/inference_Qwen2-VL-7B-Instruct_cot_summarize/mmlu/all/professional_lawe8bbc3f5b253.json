The businessman had slightly grazed against the drunk man's body. \"Man, are you trying to kill me or something?'' said the very drunk man. The businessman did not think anything of it, since he had barely grazed the drunkard. The drunk continued to bully the businessman, calling him made-up names, and saying things that were nonsensical to the businessman and to others at the bar who were listening to the drunk's boisterous and irrational rants. The drunk then took a gun out of his pocket and shot the businessman, killing him. At trial, the defense argued that the man could not form the specific intent to premeditate for first degree murder. Which of the following crimes is the defendant most likely guilty of under these facts?\n\nA. Voluntary Manslaughter\nB. First Degree Murder\nC. Second Degree Murder\nD. Involuntary Manslaughter\n"

Voluntary Manslaughter** under these facts.\n\nVoluntary manslaughter typically involves a killing that is committed in the heat of passion or in sudden and unreasonable provocation, often without premeditation. In this scenario, the drunk man's actions were clearly motivated by his extreme drunkenness and irrational behavior, which can be considered as being in the heat of passion or under the influence of alcohol, leading to a killing without premeditation.\n\nFirst Degree Murder requires a specific intent to kill, which the defense argued the defendant could not form. Second Degree Murder, on the other hand, involves a killing committed with malice aforethought but without premeditation. Involuntary Manslaughter involves a killing that occurs without the intent to kill but with criminal negligence or recklessness.\n\nGiven the context, the defendant's actions were likely driven by his extreme drunkenness and irrational behavior, which aligns more closely with the criteria for Voluntary Manslaughter rather than the more premeditated and intentional crimes like First Degree Murder or Second Degree Murder."
