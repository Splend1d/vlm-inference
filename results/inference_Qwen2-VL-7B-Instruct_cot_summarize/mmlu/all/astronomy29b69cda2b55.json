Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.\n\nJovian planets, such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are gas giants with a significant amount of mass. Due to their rapid rotation, the gravitational force of the planet's mass is stronger at the equator than at the poles. This causes the mass to be flung outward, creating a bulge around the equator and giving the planet a \"squashed\" appearance. This effect is known as the centrifugal force."
