According to this theory, there are two types of factors that influence job satisfaction and motivation:\n\n1. **Hygiene Factors**: These are external factors that, if not present, can lead to job dissatisfaction. Examples includes company policies, supervision, interpersonal relations, working conditions, salary, and company administration.\n\n2. **Motivators**: These are internal factors that lead to job satisfaction and motivation. Examples includes achievement, recognition, responsibility, and opportunities for growth and advancement.\n\nIn the scenario described, the president implemented a financial incentive program ( which is a hygiene factor. However, the employees' job motivation and satisfaction did not increase. This suggests that the financial incentives were not sufficient to motivate or satisfy the employees, which alignss with the concept that hygiene factors alone are not enough to increase job satisfaction and motivation.\n\nTherefore, the two-factor theory best explains why the financial incentives did not lead to the desired increase in motivation and satisfaction."
