The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\n\nIn a reversible thermodynamic process, the system can be returned to its initial state without any net change in the entropy of the system and its environment. This is a fundamental principle of thermodynamics, known as the Clausius inequality, which states that the entropy of the universe ( including the system and its environment - must not decrease in a reversible process. Therefore, the entropy of the system and its environment must remain constant."
