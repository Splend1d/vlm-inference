The statement suggests that any attempt to justify the claim that humans have a higher moral status than other animals by appealing to rationality will face into two specific issues:\n\nA. **Fail to give an adequate answer to the argument from marginal cases.**\n   - The argument from marginal cases refers to the idea that if humans are morally superior, then there should be a clear, logical boundary between humans and animals. If this boundary is not clear, it undermines the claim of moral superiority.\n\nB. **Fail to make the case that such a difference is morally relevant to the status of animals as moral patients as opposed to their status as moral agents.**\n   - This point addresses the distinction between moral agents ( who can make moral decisions and take moral responsibility ( and moral patients ( who are the recipients of moral actions but cannot make moral decisions or take moral responsibility. Rationality is often seen as a key characteristic of moral agents, so appealing to rationality to justify moral superiority might not adequately address the status of animals as moral patients.\n\nGiven these points, the statement implies that appealing to rationality alone will not adequately address both the argument from marginal cases and the distinction between moral agents and moral patients.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. **both A and B**"
