                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement individually:\n\n**Statement 1: The back-propagation algorithm learns a globally optimal neural network with hidden layers.**\n\nThis statement is generally false. Back-propagation is a gradient-based optimization algorithm used to train neural networks. While it can find a local minimum, it does not guarantee finding the globally optimal solution. The optimization landscape of neural networks can be highly complex with many local minima, and back-propagation might get stuck in one of these local minima rather than finding the global minimum.\n\n**Statement 2: The VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line.**\n\nThis statement is true. The VC dimension of a hypothesis class measures the capacity of the class to shatter a set of points. A line in a two-dimensional space can shatter at most 3 points ( (i.e., separate them into two groups). If you have 4 points, it is possible to find a configuration where no line can separate them into two groups. Therefore, the VC dimension of a line is indeed at most 2.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
