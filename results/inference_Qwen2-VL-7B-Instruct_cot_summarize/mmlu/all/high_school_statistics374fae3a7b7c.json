However, even after one follow-up visit the interviewer is unable to make contact with anyone in 8 of these homes. Concerned about nonresponse bias, the researcher picks another simple random sample and instructs the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50 homes. The average number of children is determined to be 1.73. Is this estimate probably too low or too high?\n\nA. Too low, because of undercoverage bias.\nB. Too low, because convenience samples overestimate average results.\nC. Too high, because of undercoverage bias.\nD. Too high, because convenience samples overestimate average results.\n"

Too high, because of undercoverage bias.\n\nUndercoverage bias occurs when certain groups are systematically excluded from the sample, leading to an overestimation of the average value in the population. In this scenario, the researcher initially sampled 50 homes but was unable to make contact with anyone in 8 of these homes. This means that the sample was not representative of the population of single-family homes, as some homes were not included due to nonresponse. \n\nWhen the researcher conducted another sample and was able to make contact with someone in all 50 homes, the average number of children was found to be 1.73. However, this second sample is not a true random sample because it was conducted after the initial nonresponse, which means it is likely to be biased towards homes that are easier to contact. \n\nTherefore, the estimate of 1.73 children per home is likely too high because it is based on a sample that is biased towards homes that are easier to contact, which may not be representative of the entire population of single-family homes."
