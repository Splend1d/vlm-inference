Since the sequence consists of consecutive odd integers, the common difference $d$ is 2.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: $S = \\frac{n}{2}(2a + (d(n-1))$, where $n$ is the number of terms in the sequence.\n\nGiven that the sum $S$ is 240, we can set up the equation: $240 = \\frac{n}{2}(2a + 2(n-1))$.\n\nSimplify the equation: $240 = n(2a + 2n - 2)$.\n\nDivide both sides by 2: $120 = n(2a + 2n - 2)$.\n\nWe know that $a$ and $n$ are integers, and $a$ is an odd integer. The possible values of $a$ are 1, 3, 5, ..., 239. For each value of $a$, we can solve for $n$ and check if it's an integer.\n\nAfter trying each possible value of $a$, we find that the only values of $a$ that give an integer value of $n$ are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23. \n\nSo, there are 12 possible arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$."
