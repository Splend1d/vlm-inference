A group of five demonstrators who wanted to protest inadequate state funding for children's services applied for a permit to march single file on the sidewalk surrounding the capitol building. Each demonstrator planned to carry a two-foot-square sign that would read, \"Our lawmakers do not care about our children.\" The group's permit application was denied pursuant to the state law, and the group has filed an action challenging the law's constitutionality. Should the court uphold the law's constitutionality?\n\nA. No, because even though the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is more restrictive than needed to serve a legitimate government interest. government interest.\nB. No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.\nC. Yes, because even though the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is necessary to serve a compelling public interest.\nD. Yes, because the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is reasonable.\n"

Yes, because the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of sign is reasonable.\n\nIn this case, the sidewalk surrounding the capitol building is not a public forum. Public forums are areas where the government has traditionally allowed public expression, such as streets, parks, and sidewalks. However, when a government restricts access to a public forum, it must do so in a way that is reasonable and necessary to serve a compelling government interest. In this case, the state has enacted a law to preserve the appearance and accessibility of its capitol building, which is a legitimate government interest. The prohibition against the display of sign is reasonable and necessary to serve this interest. Therefore, the court should uphold the law's constitutionality."
