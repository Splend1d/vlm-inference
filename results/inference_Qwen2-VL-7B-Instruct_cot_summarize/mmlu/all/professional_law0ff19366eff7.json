Summary judgment can be entered only after all discovery has been completed.\nB. Motion for summary judgment is the proper motion on the ground that plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action.\nC. Since both parties have filed summary judgment motions that assert there are no genuine issues of material fact, summary judgment for plaintiff or defendant will be granted.\nD. If plaintiff's proofs submitted in support of his motion for summary judgment are not contradicted and if plaintiff's proofs show that no genuine issue of material fact exists, summary judgment will be granted even if defendant's answer denied plaintiff's complaint.\n"

Since both parties have filed summary judgment motions that assert there are no genuine issues of of material fact, summary judgment for plaintiff or defendant will be granted.\n\nExplanation:\nIn a civil case, a motion for summary judgment is filed when the parties believe that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. If both parties file such motions, the court will consider the evidence presented by both sides to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact that require a trial. If the court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact, it will grant summary judgment in favor of the party who filed the motion."
