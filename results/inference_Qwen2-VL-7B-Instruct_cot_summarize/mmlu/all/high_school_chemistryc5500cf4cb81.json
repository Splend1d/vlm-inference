Therefore, it is endothermic.\n\n2. **Step 2**: Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent.\n   - This process also involves breaking intermolecular bonds, which typically requires energy. Therefore, it is endothermic.\n\n3. **Step 3**: Separated solute and solvent are brought together, filling in the spaces.\n   - This process involves forming new intermolecular bonds between the solute and solvent molecules, which typically releases energy. Therefore, it is exothermic.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n**B. Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.**"
