The binding energy per nucleon is highest for 56Fe, which is the most stable isotope of iron.\n\nB. Nuclear binding energies have about the same magnitude as chemical bond energies.\n- This statement is not true. Nuclear binding energies are typically much larger than chemical bond energies. For example, the binding energy per nucleon for 56Fe is around 8 MeV, while typical chemical bond energies are in the range of 1-100 kJ/mol ( (about 0.01-1 MeV per nucleon).\n\nC. Nuclei have slightly less mass than the sum of their component nucleons.\n- This statement is true. According to the mass defect concept, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the masses of its constituent nucleons due to the binding energy.\n\nD. The nuclei of heavy elements have more neutrons than protons in order to provide sufficient binding energy to hold the nuclei together.\n- This statement is true. In heavy elements, the number of neutrons is typically greater than the number of protons to balance the charge and provide the necessary binding energy.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is:\n\nB. Nuclear binding energies have about the same magnitude as chemical bond energies."
