At a pretrial hearing, the defendant told the judge that he was unhappy with the public defender who had been appointed to represent him and that he wanted the judge to appoint another lawyer. The judge refused to appoint another lawyer, telling the defendant, with no further explanation, that his only other choice was to represent himself. The defendant said that he would represent himself at trial then, as \"anything [was] better than having this lawyer.\" The defendant did not raise the subject again, and he represented himself at trial. After hearing overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, the jury convicted him of armed robbery. On appeal, the defendant has requested a new trial on the ground that he was deprived of his right to counsel. Should the appellate court grant the defendant's request?\n\nA. No, because the defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel.\nB. No, because the trial court's error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence.\nC. Yes, because the defendant was not capable of effectively representing himself.\nD. Yes, because the record does not establish a valid waiver of the right to counsel.\n"

Yes, because the record does not establish a valid waiver of the right to counsel.\n\nThe defendant's statement that \"anything [was] better than having this lawyer\" does not constitute a valid waiver of the right to counsel. A valid waiver requires a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a constitutional right, and the defendant's statement does not demonstrate that he understood the implications of waiving his right to counsel. The appellate court should grant the defendant's request for a new trial because the record does not establish a valid waiver of the right to counsel."
