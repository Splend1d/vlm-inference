As the man approached the rear of the woman's car, he became impatient and tried to pass her along a section of the highway designated as a no-passing zone. When the man swerved his car into the westbound lane to pass the woman, he didn't see another driver, who was rounding a curve in the westbound lane. In order to avoid a head-on collision with the man, the other driver swerved his car to the shoulder of the roadway. The other driver, however, was unable to control his car along the narrow strip of the shoulder, and it fell down the steep mountain. The man and the woman both saw the other driver's car slide down the hillside. They immediately stopped their vehicles and walked over to the edge of the roadway looking for the car. They saw the other driver's car overturned in a gully about 200 feet down the mountain. The man and the woman heard the other driver moaning and calling for help. However, the man and the woman failed to provide any assistance. They walked back to their cars and drove off. Although the man and the woman passed through a business area a short while later, they neither reported the accident nor sought aid for the other driver. Hours later, the other driver died from injuries suffered in the accident. If the man and the woman are subsequently prosecuted for the other driver's death, the most likely outcome would be that\n\nA. the man and the woman are both guilty of manslaughter.\nB. the man is guilty of manslaughter only.\nC. the woman is guilty of manslaughter only.\nD. neither the man nor the woman is guilty of manslaughter.\n"

It can be either voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary manslaughter involves a killing that is the result of a sudden passion or heat of passion, while involuntary manslaughter involves a killing that results from criminal negligence or recklessness.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Situation**:\n   - The man and the woman did not intentionally cause the death of the other driver. They were not involved in a collision or any act that directly led to the other driver's death.\n   - They did not have the intent to kill or cause serious bodily harm to the other driver. Their actions were not reckless or negligent in a way that would constitute criminal negligence or recklessness.\n   - They did not have the intent to cause harm to the other driver, nor did they act with malice aforethought.\n\n3. **Legal Consequences**:\n   - The man and the woman did not commit any act that could be considered as causing the death of the other driver. They did not drive recklessly, negligently, or with intent to harm.\n   - They did not have any criminal intent or negligence that would make them guilty of manslaughter.\n\nGiven these points, it neither the man nor the woman is likely to be found guilty of manslaughter."
