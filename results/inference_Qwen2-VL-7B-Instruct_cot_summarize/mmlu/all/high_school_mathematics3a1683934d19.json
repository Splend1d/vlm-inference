                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem and the given ratio of the length to the height of the television screen.\n\nGiven:\n- The ratio of the length to the height is 5:3.\n- The width (W ( (which is the horizontal length) is 48 inches.\n\nLet's denote the length as \\( L \\) and the height as \\( H \\). According to the given ratio, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{L}{H} = \\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nWe can express \\( L \\) in terms of \\( H \\):\n\\[ L = \\frac{5}{3}H \\]\n\nWe are asked to find the difference in length when measured along the horizontal length (W and along the diagonal (D. The diagonal \\( D \\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ D^2 = L^2 + H^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( L \\) with \\( \\frac{5}{3}H \\):\n\\[ D^2 = \\left(\\frac{5}{3}H\\right)^2 + H^2 \\]\n\\[ D^2 = \\frac{25}{9}H^2 + H^2 \\]\n\\[ D^2 = \\frac{25}{9}H^2 + \\frac{9}{9}H^2 \\]\n\\[ D^2 = \\frac{34}{9}H^2 \\]\n\\[ D = \\sqrt{\\frac{34}{9}H^2} \\]\n\\[ D = \\frac{\\sqrt{34}}{3}H \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in length between the horizontal length \\( W \\) and the diagonal \\( D \\):\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = W - D \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 48 - \\frac{\\sqrt{34}}{3}H \\]\n\nWe know that \\( H \\) is the height of the television screen. Since the ratio of the length to the height is 5:3, we can express \\( H \\) in terms of \\( L \\):\n\\[ H = \\frac{3}{5}L \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( H \\) in the difference equation:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 48 - \\frac{\\sqrt{34}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5}L \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 48 - \\frac{\\sqrt{34}}{5}L \\]\n\nWe need to find the difference in inches. Since we are given the ratio and the width, we can calculate the height:\n\\[ H = \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 48 \\]\n\\[ H = \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 48 \\]\n\\[ H = 28.8 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( H \\) back into the difference equation:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 48 - \\frac{\\sqrt{34}}{5} \\cdot 48 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 48 - \\frac{48\\sqrt{34}}{5} \\]\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can approximate \\( \\sqrt{34} \\approx 5.83 \\):\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 48 - \\frac{48 \\cdot 5.83}{5} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 48 - \\frac{279.84}{5} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 48 - 55.968 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} \\approx 3.032 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest inch, the difference is approximately 3 inches.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. 3"
