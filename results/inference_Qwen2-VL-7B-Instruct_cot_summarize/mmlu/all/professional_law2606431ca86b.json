The seller answered the complaint and included as a separate defense an allegation that the purchaser had brought and lost a similar contract claim against a different seller three years earlier, and that this history represented a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits. The purchaser believes that the earlier lawsuit was factually completely different from the current one and is therefore irrelevant. What is the purchaser's best response to the seller's answer?\n\nA. File a reply that includes a denial of the separate defense.\nB. Move for sanctions against the seller for asserting a frivolous defense.\nC. Move to amend the complaint to add allegations about the differences between the lawsuits.\nD. Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n"

This is because the separate defense is a new claim raised by the seller, and the purchaser can respond to it by denying the allegations and providing any necessary evidence to support their position. Denying the separate defense is a standard legal response to a new claim or defense raised by the opposing party in a lawsuit."
