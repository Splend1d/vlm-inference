These included:\n\nA. Scholarly critiques of traditional security discourse and practices, which began to highlight the inadequacy of these approaches in addressing environmental risks to national and international security. This critique was a significant step in recognizing the interdependence between environmental health and security.\n\nB. A growing recognition that environmental changes not only threatened ecosystems but also posed risks to human well-being. This realization broadened the scope of security concerns to include human health and welfare, which is a core aspect of environmental security.\n\nC. The emergence of a shared environmental consciousness in developing countries, which led to increased awareness and activism around environmental issues. This consciousness was crucial in mobilizing public opinion and political action to address environmental challenges.\n\nTherefore, all of these options reflect important developments that contributed to the emergence of environmental security during that period."
