In a hypothetical environment, the coat pattern that is associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive, with the result that both the coat pattern and the cross-eyed condition increase in a feline population over time. Which statement is supported by these observations?\n\nA. Evolution is progressive and tends toward a more perfect population.\nB. Phenotype is often the result of compromise.\nC. Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes in populations over the course of time.\nD. Polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive, and should become less common in future generations.\n"

This suggests that the gene is subject to natural selection, where the adaptive trait (the coat pattern associated with crossed eyes) is favored over the maladaptive trait (the cross-eyed condition. \n\nGiven these observations, the statement that is best supported is:\n\nC. Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive gene in populations over the course of time.\n\nThis statement alignss with the scenario where the maladaptive trait (crossed-eyed condition) is being replaced by the adaptive trait (the coat pattern associated with crossed eyes) due to natural selection."
