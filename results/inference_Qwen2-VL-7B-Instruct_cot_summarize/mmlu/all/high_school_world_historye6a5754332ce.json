And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat was the likely cause of women not wearing the veil?\n\nA. They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam.\nB. It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.\nC. As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves.\nD. The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the likely cause of women not wearing the veil in Mali, let's analyze the given information and each option:\n\n1. **Option A: They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam.**\n   - The passage does not provide any direct evidence of rebellion or oppression against women in Islam. It describes the customs and practices of the people in Mali, but does not mention any specific actions or motivations behind the women's behavior.\n\n2. **Option B: It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.**\n   - The passage mentions that the women do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. This suggests that the practice of not wearing the veil is a cultural norm that has been maintained over time, rather than a recent or rebellious act.\n\n3. **Option C: As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves.**\n   - The passage does not provide any information about women being prevented from veiling themselves due to their status as sexual objects. It focuses more on the customs and practices of the people in Mali, rather than on the reasons behind the women's behavior.\n\n4. **Option D: The climate of Mali made veiling women impractical.**\n   - The passage does not mention anything about the climate of Mali affecting the practice of veiling women. It does not provide any information that would suggest the impracticality of veiling due to the climate.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most plausible explanation is that the practice of not wearing the veil is a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.\n\nTherefore, the likely cause of women not wearing the veil is:\n\n**B. It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.**"
