However, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) provides some general statistics that can give us an idea of the scale of air travel.\n\nIn 2014, IATA reported that there were approximately 32,000 aircraft in service worldwide. This number includes both commercial and private aircraft. However, this figure does not account for the number of aircraft that are in the air at any given time, as some aircraft may be on the ground for maintenance or other reasons.\n\nTo estimate the number of aircraft in the air at any given time, we can use the concept of \"aircraft utilization rate,\" which is the percentage of aircraft that are in the air at any given time. According to IATA, the average aircraft utilization rate in 2014 was around 75%.\n\nUsing this information, we can estimate the number of aircraft in the air at any given time by multiplying the total number of aircraft in service by the aircraft utilization rate:\n\n32,000 aircraft x 75% utilization rate = 24,000 aircraft in the air at any given time.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the number of airplanes in the air worldwide right now (as of 2014 is:\n\nC. 80,000"
