The legal system is, in fact, unfair.\n\nThis argument directly challenges the core of the 'fair play' argument, which posits that laws should be obeyed because they are fair. If the legal system is inherently unfair, then the argument that laws should be obeyed because they are fair falls apart. This undermines the basis for the duty to obey the law, making it a compelling counter-argument."
