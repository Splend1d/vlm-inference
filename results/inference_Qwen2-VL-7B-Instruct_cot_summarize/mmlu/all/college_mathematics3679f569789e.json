This series diverges because the absolute value of the terms does not converge to zero ( (|a_i| = 1/i does not converge to 0). However, the series \u2211 a_i converges to 0 ( (because it is an alternating series that converges by the alternating series test). \n\nNow, let's consider a rearrangement of the terms. If we rearrange the terms such that we take the positive terms first and then the negative terms, we can make the sum of the rearranged series equal to 4. For example, if we take the first 4 positive terms and then the first 4 negative terms, the sum of the rearranged series would be 4.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2\nThe statement asserts that there exist metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT \u201cclosed and bounded\u201d.\n\n**Counterexample:**\nConsider the metric space X = [0, 1] with the standard metric and the metric space Y = R with the standard metric. X is closed and bounded, and f : X \u2192 Y defined by f(x) = x is a continuous mapping. However, f(X) = [0, 1] is also closed and bounded in R.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is **False**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is:\nC. False, True"
