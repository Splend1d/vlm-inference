The variance of a Bernoulli random variable $B$ is given by:\n$$ \\text{Var}(B) = \\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x)) $$\n\nComparinging the derivative of the sigmoid function with the variance of a Bernoulli random variable, we see that they are not equal. Therefore, Statement 1 is False.\n\n### Statement 2\nSetting the bias parameters in each layer of a neural network to 0 changes the bias-variance trade-off such that the model's variance increases and the model's bias decreases.\n\nIn neural networks, bias parameters are typically set to non-zero values to ensure that the model can learn from the data. Setting the bias parameters to 0 would mean that the model would not be able to shift the decision boundary, which would likely increase the bias of the model. However, it would not necessarily decrease the variance of of the model. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
