Let's analyze each option to determine which one fits this description:\n\nA. Leslie spent 20 dollars and 8 cents at a store. How is the amount of money Leslie spent written as a fraction?\n- This option describes a monetary amount, which is not represented by a fraction in the traditional sense. The amount is 20 dollars and 8 cents, which can be written as 2008/100 in decimal form or 2008/10000 in fractional form, but not as 20/8.\n\nB. Mr. Kramer\u2019s 8 grandchildren shared 20 crackers equally. How many crackers did each grandchild get?\n- This option describes a division of 20 crackers among 8 grandchildren. Each grandchild would get 20/8 crackers, which simplifies to 2.5 crackers per grandchild. This fits the description of dividing a whole into 8 equal parts and considering 20 of those parts.\n\nC. Mitch bought 20 containers of flowers at a plant store. Each container had 8 flowers in it. How many flowers did Mitch buy?\n- This option describes a multiplication of 20 containers by 8 flowers per container, resulting in 160 flowers. This does not fit the description of dividing a whole into 8 equal parts and considering 20 of those parts.\n\nD. Stamps are sold in booklets of 20 stamps. Donna used 8 stamps to send invitations for a party. How many booklets of stamps did Donna use to send her invitations?\n- This option describes a situation where Donna used 8 stamps out of a booklet of 20 stamps. This does not fit the description of dividing a whole into 8 equal parts and considering 20 of those parts.\n\nTherefore, the situation that can be represented by the fraction 20/8 is:\n\nB. Mr. Kramer\u2019s 8 grandchildren shared 20 crackers equally. How many crackers did each grandchild get?"
