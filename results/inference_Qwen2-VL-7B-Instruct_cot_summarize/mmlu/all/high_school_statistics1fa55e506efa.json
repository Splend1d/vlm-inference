At first, she had decided to use a random sample of 15 observations. But her teacher asked her to take 35 observations. The mean and standard deviation from 35 observations turned out to be approximately the same as those from 15 observations. Is there any advantage in using 35 observations instead of 15 observations?\n\nA. There is no advantage. Because the mean and the standard deviation are about the same, the confidence interval computed using 35 observations should be approximately the same as that computed using 15 observations.\nB. There is no advantage. In fact, the 20 extra observations will increase the likelihood of error.\nC. There is no advantage. Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be wider than that using 15 observations.\nD. There is some advantage. Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be narrower than that using 15 observations.\n"

Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be narrower than that using 15 observations.\n\nThe advantage in using 35 observations instead of 15 observations is that the confidence interval will be narrower, which means that the estimate of the mean amount of chemicals in the water supply will be more precise. This is because the standard error of the mean ( (SEM) is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. Therefore, as the sample size increases, the SEM decreases, resulting in a narrower confidence interval."
