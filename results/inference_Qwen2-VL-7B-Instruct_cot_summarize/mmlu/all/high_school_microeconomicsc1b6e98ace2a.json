Highly elastic demand curve.\n\nIn an oligopoly, if rival firms follow a price decrease but do not follow a price increase, the demand curve facing an oligopolist will likely be highly elastic. This is because the oligopolist's price change will have a significant impact on the quantity demanded, as consumers are more sensitive to price changes when there are few substitutes available. The other options do not accurately describe the demand curve in this scenario."
