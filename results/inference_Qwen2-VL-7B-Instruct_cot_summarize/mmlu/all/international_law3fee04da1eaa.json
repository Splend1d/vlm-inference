The political methods are pursued upon the consent of the parties to the dispute, whereas the legal methods are not.\n\nPolitical means of dispute settlement, such as diplomatic negotiations, are typically pursued with the consent of the parties involved in the dispute. This means that the parties must agree to engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve their differences. In contrast, legal means of dispute settlement, such as arbitration or adjudication by the International Court of Justice ( (ICJ), are pursued regardless of the consent of the parties involved. These methods are typically used when the parties are unable to resolve their differences through diplomatic means or when there is a need for a binding and enforceable resolution."
