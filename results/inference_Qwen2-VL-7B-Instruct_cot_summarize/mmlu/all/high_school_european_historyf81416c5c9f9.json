Both High Contracting Parties obligate themselves to desist from any act of violence, any aggressive action, and any attack on each other, either individually or jointly with other Powers.\nArticle II. Should one of the High Contracting Parties become the object of belligerent action by a third Power, the other High Contracting Party shall in no manner lend its support to this third Power.\nArticle III. The Governments of the two High Contracting Parties shall in the future maintain continual contact with one another for the purpose of consultation in order to exchange information on problems affecting their common interests.\nArticle IV.

The text refers to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was signed in 1939 between Germany and the Soviet Union. The text mentions that the agreement was based on the Neutrality Agreement concluded in April 1926 between Germany and the U.S.S.R.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Had some degree of a nonaggression agreement since at least 1926**\n   - The text mentions that the agreement was based on the Neutrality Agreement concluded in 1926. This implies that there was a nonaggression agreement between the two countries since at least 1926.\n\nB. **Created their first peace agreement in 1926**\n   - The text does not state that this was their first peace agreement. It only mentions that the agreement was based on a previous agreement from 1926.\n\nC. **Had technically been in a state of war since 1926**\n   - The text does not provide any information to suggest that there was a state of war between Germany and the Soviet Union since 1926. It only mentions a nonaggression agreement.\n\nD. **Previously held a peace agreement that expired in 1926**\n   - The text does not mention that the agreement from 1926 expired in 1926. It only mentions that the agreement was based on the 1926 agreement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate inference is:\n\n**A. Had some degree of a nonaggression agreement since at least 1926**"
