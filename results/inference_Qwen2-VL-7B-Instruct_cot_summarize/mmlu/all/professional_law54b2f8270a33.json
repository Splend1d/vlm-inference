The accusation was demonstrably false, and the senator was negligent in making it. The purchasing officer has sued the senator for defamation, alleging only that the accusation was false and that the senator was negligent. What is the most appropriate ground for the court to dismiss the purchasing officer's complaint?\n\nA. The federal government is constitutionally immune from suit without its consent, and it has not consented to suits of this kind.\nB. The First Amendment guarantees members of Congress an unqualified right to speak on matters of public concern at any place and time without having to fear adverse legal consequences.\nC. The First Amendment protects public officials from defamation liability for statements made in their official capacity, unless the plaintiff alleges and proves that the statement was false and uttered with actual malice.\nD. The speech and debate clause of Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution wholly insulates members of Congress from tort liability for statements made on the floor of Congress.\n"

The speech and debate clause of Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution wholly insulates members of Congress from tort liability for statements made on the floor of Congress.\n\nThe speech and debate clause provides immunity to members of Congress from civil suits for statements made in the course of their official duties. This immunity is designed to protect the independence of Congress and ensure that members can speak freely without fear of legal repercussions. Therefore, the court would likely dismiss the complaint on the basis that the the senator's speech was made in the course of his official duties and is protected by the speech and debate clause."
