There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas.\nC. U.S. markets will have access to less expensive beef.\nD.

There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas.\n\nClear-cuttingtingtinging the tropical rain forests can lead to a decrease in precipitation in the affected areas. This is because the rain forests play a crucial role in the local climate by releasing water vapor into the atmosphere through a process called transpiration. When the trees are removed, this natural water cycle is disrupted, leading to a reduction in rainfall. This can have far-reaching effects on the local ecosystem and the people who depend on it for their livelihoods."
