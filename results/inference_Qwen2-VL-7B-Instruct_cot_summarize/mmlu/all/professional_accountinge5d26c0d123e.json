The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws.\n\nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is a federal law that establishes a tax on employers to help fund unemployment insurance programs in the states. The tax is paid by employers, not employees, and is used to provide temporary financial assistance to unemployed workers. The states administer the unemployment insurance programs, and the federal government sets the tax rates and some of the rules."
