The direct labor standards indicated that each unit of finished goods requires 2.4 direct labor hours at a standard wage of $20 per hour, totaling $48.00 per finished good unit. During March, the company actually made 9,000 units of finished goods. Production used 2.5 labor hours per finished unit, and the company actually paid $21 per hour, totaling $52.50 per unit of finished product. What amount is the company's direct labor rate variance for March?\n\nA. $18,000\nB. $22,500\nC. $25,000\nD. $40,500\n"

The difference between the actual and standard labor rate is $21 - $20 = $1 per hour.\n\nThe actual hours worked were 2.5 hours per unit, and the company made 9,000 units. So, the total actual hours worked were 2.5 hours/unit * 9,000 units = 22,500 hours.\n\nThe direct labor rate variance is the difference between the actual labor rate and the standard labor rate, multiplied by the actual hours worked. So, the variance is $1 per hour * 22,500 hours = $22,500.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $22,500."
