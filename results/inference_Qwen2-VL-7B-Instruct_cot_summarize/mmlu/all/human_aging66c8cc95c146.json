However, it's difficult to provide a specific percentage without more information. \n\nBridge jobs are temporary or part-time jobs that people take on to earn money while they search for a more permanent career job. They can be a good way to gain experience, build skills, and make connections in a new field. However, they may not always be as fulfilling or rewarding as a career job. \n\nTherefore, it's difficult to say what percentage of people who have had bridge jobs say it was better than their career job without more information. It's possible that some people may find bridge jobs to be more fulfilling than their career jobs, while others may not."
