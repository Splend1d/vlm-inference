The probability that a single 20-sided die shows an odd number is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe want exactly two of the four dice to show an even number. This is a binomial probability problem, where the probability of success (getting an even number) is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of failure (getting an odd number) is also also $\\frac{1}{2}$. The number of trials is 4, and we want exactly 2 successes.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is $P(k; n, p) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (q^{n-k}$, where $n$ is the number of trials, $k$ is the number of successes, $p$ is the probability of success, and $q$ is the probability of failure. In this case, $n=4$, $k=2$, $p=\\frac{1}{2}$, and $q=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo the probability that exactly two of the four dice show an even number is\n\\[P(2; 4, \\frac{1}{2}) = \\binom{4}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4-2} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}.\\]\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$."
