                    "text": "In 1973, a woman was the actual and record owner of 20 acres of certain undeveloped timberland. In September 1973, the woman mortgaged the 20 acres of timberland to the bank by a mortgage deed (in the traditional form of a conveyance in fee simple subject to a condition subsequent), which was not recorded until January 1974. The mortgage deed contained the following clause immediately after the legal description of the 20 acres of timberland:\"Together with all the real property now owned by (the woman) or which shall be owned by (the woman) during the continuance of the indebtedness secured by this mortgage. \" This mortgage was given, as the recorded instrument revealed, to secure a note for $100,000 repayable over a 40-year term. In March 2004, the woman, using money loaned by a finance company, purchased a 50-acre mountainous estate situated outside of a major city. This deed was recorded immediately. In April 2004, the woman executed and delivered to the finance company a mortgage to secure its loan. This mortgage was promptly and duly recorded. The finance company had no actual notice of the prior mortgage to the bank. In February 2007, the woman defaulted on both mortgages. The bank then initiated foreclosure proceedings against the woman and the finance company as joint defendants. In its foreclosure action, the bank averred that its mortgage was a first mortgage on both the 20 acres of timberland and the 50-acre estate. The finance company filed a cross-complaint, alleging that its mortgage was a first mortgage on the 50-acre estate and praying for foreclosure on that parcel of property. In order to decide this case in favor of the bank, the court does not need to resolve which of the following issues?\n\nA. Whether the finance company is charged with record notice of the bank's mortgage.\nB. Whether the quoted clause in the mortgage instrument to the 20 acres of timberland covers the 50-acre estate.\nC. Whether the finance company's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage.\nD. Whether the finance company can rely on the doctrine of implied purchase money liens.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which issue the court does not need to resolve in order to decide the case in favor of the bank, we need to analyze the given facts and the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Finance Company's Notice of Bank's Mortgage:**\n   - The finance company had no actual notice of the prior mortgage to the bank. This means that the finance company did not know about the bank's mortgage when it purchased its mortgage in April 2004.\n\n2. **Coverage of the Mortgage Clause:**\n   - The mortgage clause in the bank's mortgage deed states that it covers \"all the real property now owned by [the woman] or which shall be owned by [the woman] during the continuance of the indebtedness secured by this mortgage.\"\n   - The bank's mortgage was recorded in January 1974, and the finance company's mortgage was recorded in April 2004. The bank's mortgage covered the 20 acres of timberland and the 550-acre estate purchased by the woman in March 2004.\n\n3. **Purchase Money Mortgage:**\n   - A purchase money mortgage is a mortgage given to secure the purchase of real property. The finance company's mortgage was given to secure its loan to the woman for the purchase of the 50-acre estate.\n\n4. **Doctrine of Implied Purchase Money Lien:**\n   - This doctrine of implied purchase money lien is a legal principle that allows a mortgage to be considered a purchase money mortgage if it was given to secure the purchase of the property. This doctrine is not directly relevant to the issue of whether the finance company's mortgage is a first mortgage on the 50-acre estate.\n\nGiven these points, the court does not need to resolve the issue of whether the finance company can rely on the doctrine of implied purchase money lien because this doctrine is not directly relevant to the case. The court needs to determine whether the finance company is charged with record notice of the bank's mortgage and whether the quoted clause in the mortgage instrument to the 20 acres of timberland covers the 50-acre estate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Whether the finance company can rely on the doctrine of implied purchase money lien.**"
