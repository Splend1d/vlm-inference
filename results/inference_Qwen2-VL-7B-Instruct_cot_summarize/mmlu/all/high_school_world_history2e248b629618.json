To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nWhich of the following resources would the author of the second passage have been most likely interested in obtaining from local natives?\n\nA.

He emphasizes the importance of making the natives dependent on the foodstuffs and manufactured goods provided by the Hudson's Bay Company. This suggests that the company is interested in obtaining resources that are essential for the natives' survival and well-being.\n\nGiven the historical context, the most likely resource that would be essential for the survival and well-being of the local natives would be foodstuffs. However, the passage does not explicitly mention foodstuffs. Instead, it mentions manufactured goods, which could include items like clothing, tools, and other necessities.\n\nAmong the options provided:\nA. Ivory - This is not a foodstuff and is not mentioned in the passage.\nB. Tobacco - while it is a foodstuff, it is not mentioned in the passage.\nC. Silver - this is not a foodstuff and is not mentioned in the passage.\nD. Furs - this is a resource that could be obtained from local natives and is mentioned in the passage as part of the manufactured goods.\n\nGiven the context and the mention of manufactured goods, the most likely resource that George Simpson would have been interested in obtaining from local natives is:\n\nD.
