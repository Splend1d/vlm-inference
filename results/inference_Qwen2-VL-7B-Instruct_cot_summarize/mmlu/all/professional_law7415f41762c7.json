The contract provided that the construction company would be paid upon completion of the warehouse. The contractor finished the warehouse but it had some minor deviations from the plans due to substitution for certain building materials that were not available in the market. The construction company finished working and demanded payment. The paper company refused to pay based on deviations from the specifications. Will the construction company likely prevail in a breach of contract action against the paper company?\n\nA. Yes, a company that performs construction work can always collect for what it has done on a job.\nB. No, the construction company cannot change the specifications and hope to get paid.\nC. No, the construction company is guilty of fraud and misrepresentation.\nD. Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n"

Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n\nIn a breach of contract action, the key consideration is whether the construction company has substantially performed the contract. The fact that there were minor deviations from the plans due to material substitutions does not necessarily mean that the construction company has breached the contract. If the deviations were minor and did not significantly affect the functionality or safety of the warehouse, the construction company may still be entitled to payment.\n\nThe construction company has completed the work as per the contract, and the deviations were not substantial enough to constitute a breach. Therefore, the construction company is likely to prevail in the breach of contract action."
