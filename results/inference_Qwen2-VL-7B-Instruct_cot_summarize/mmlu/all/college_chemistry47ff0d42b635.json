T1, unlike T2, is sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency.\n\nExplanation: \n- T1 ( (also known as the spin-lattice relaxation time) is the time it takes for a nucleus to return to equilibrium with the lattice ( or surroundings. It is sensitive to the molecular motions at the Larmor frequency, which is the frequency at which the nucleus precesses in a magnetic field.\n- T2 ( (also known as the spin-spin relaxation time) is the time it takes for a nucleus to lose phase coherence with other nuclei due to magnetic field inhomogeneities. It is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions.\n\nTherefore, T1 is sensitive to the Larmor frequency, while T2 is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions."
