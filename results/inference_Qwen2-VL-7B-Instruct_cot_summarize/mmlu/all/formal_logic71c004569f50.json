O \u2228 P\n\nFirst, let's define the truth values for O and P:\n- O can be either true ( (T) or false ( (F).\n- P can also be either true ( (T) or false ( (F).\n\nNow, let's construct the truth table for both propositions.\n\n| O | P | ~O | ~O \u2283 P | O \u2228 P |\n|---|---|----|--------|------|\n| T | T | F  | T      | T    |\n| T | F | F  | T      | F    |\n| F | T | T  | T      | T    |\n| F | F | T  | F      | F    |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth values for the two propositions:\n- ~O \u2283 P is true when ~O is false or P is true.\n- O \u2228 P is true when O is true or P is true.\n\nNext, let's compare the truth values of ~O \u2283 P and O \u2228 P for each row:\n\n| O | P | ~O | ~O \u2283 P | O \u2228 P |\n|---|---|----|--------|------|\n| T | T | F  | T      | T    |\n| T | F | F  | T      | F    |\n| F | T | T  | T      | T    |\n| F | F | T  | F      | F    |\n\n- In the first row, O is true and P is true. ~O is false, and P is true, so ~O \u2283 P is true. O \u2228 P is true, so the two propositions are consistent.\n- In the second row, O is true and P is false. ~O is false, and P is false, so ~O \u2283 P is true. O \u2228 P is false, so the two propositions are inconsistent.\n- In the third row, O is false and P is true. ~O is true, and P is true, so ~O \u2283 P is true. O \u2228 p is true, so the two propositions are consistent.\n- In the fourth row, O is false and p is false. ~O is true, and p is false, so ~O \u2283 p is false. O \u2228 p is false, so the two propositions are inconsistent.\n\nSince the truth values of ~O \u2283 P and O \u2228 p are not always the same, the two propositions are not logically equivalent.\n\nSince the truth values of ~O \u2283 p and O \u2212 p are not always the same, the two propositions are not contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the two propositions are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent"
