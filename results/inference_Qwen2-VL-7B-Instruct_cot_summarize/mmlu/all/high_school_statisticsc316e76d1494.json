The probability of committing a Type I error is denoted by \u03b1, which is also the significance level of the test.\n\n2. **Type II Error**: This is the error of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The probability of committing a Type II error is denoted by \u03b2.\n\n3. **Power of the Test**: This is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It is given by 1 - \u03b2.\n\nGiven:\n- H0: p = 0.6\n- Ha: p = 0.7\n- Power of the test for Ha: p = 0.7 is 0.8\n\nThe power of the test is 0.8, which means:\n\\[ 1 - \\beta = 0.8 \\]\n\\[ \\beta = 0.2 \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The probability of committing a Type I error is 0.1.\n- This is not necessarily true. The probability of committing a Type I error (\u03b1 is not given, but it is not necessarily 0.1.\n\nB. If Ha is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is 0.2.\n- This is correct. If Ha is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is the probability of committing a Type II error, which is \u03b2 = 0.2.\n\nC. The probability of committing a Type II error is 0.3.\n- This is incorrect. The probability of committing a Type II error is \u03b2 = 0.2, not 0.3.\n\nD. All of the above are valid conclusions.\n- This is incorrect because option C is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the valid conclusion is:\n\nB. If Ha is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is 0.2."
