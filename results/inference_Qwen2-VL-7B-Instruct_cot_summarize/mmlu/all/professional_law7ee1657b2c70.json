As he drove down a small hill toward an intersection with a stop sign, he applied the brakes, but they failed to work, and the truck did not slow down. The farmer could not stop for the stop sign. He saw a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection and tried to steer around him, but was unable to do so. The pickup truck struck the pedestrian and seriously injured him. If the injured pedestrian asserts a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer, and if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the car, will the pedestrian prevail?\n\nA. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.\nB. No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.\nC. Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\nD. Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.\n"

Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\n\nIn a negligence claim, the injured pedestrian would likely prevail if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the truck. This would suggest that the auto dealership, as the seller, placed a defective product into the stream of commerce, which is a significant factor in establishing liability. The fact that the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck does not necessarily preclude a claim, as the manufacturer's's responsibility extends to anyone who might reasonably be expected to use the product. Additionally, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer, this would further support the claim against the dealership."
