The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\nA. The mean of all the salaries.\nB. The mode of all the salaries.\nC. The standard deviation of all the salaries.\nD. The median of all the salaries.\n"

This measure is sensitive to outliers, meaning that the salaries of the highly paid administrators could significantly skew the mean salary, making it appear higher than what the typical teacher earns.\n\n2. **Mode.** The mode is the most frequently salary. If there are multiple modes ( (e.g., if there are several teachers earning the same salary), it it does not provide a clear indication of the typical salary.\n\n3. **Standard Deviation.** The standard deviation measures the dispersion of salaries around the mean. It does not provide a single value that represents the typical salary.\n\n4. **Median.** The median is the middle value when all salaries are arranged in order. It is not affected by extreme values ( ( like the highly paid administrators), making it a more representative measure of the typical salary.\n\nGiven that the union is likely to argue for a salary that reflects the typical teacher's earnings, the median is the most appropriate measure to quote. It provides a clear, unskewed representation of the salary that the majority of teachers earn."
