Defining criteria are subjective and differ among researchers.\n\nPerceptual or vernacular regions, also known as cultural or linguistic regions, are often difficult to identify because the criteria used to define them are subjective and can vary among researchers. These regions are based on shared cultural, linguistic, or historical experiences, which can be difficult to quantify or measure objectively. Additionally, the boundaries of these regions can be fluid and change over time, making it challenging to establish clear and consistent definitions."
