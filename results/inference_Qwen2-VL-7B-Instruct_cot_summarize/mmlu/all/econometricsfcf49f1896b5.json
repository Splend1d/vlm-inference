The ARCH(q) model has fewer parameters than the GARCH(1,1) model, making it more parsimonious.\n\nii) The ARCH(q) model is the more likely to violate non-negativity constraints: This statement is true. The ARCH(q) model does not ensure that the conditional variance is non-negative, whereas the GARCH(1,1) model does.\n\niii) The ARCH(q) model can allow for an infinite number of previous lags of squared returns to affect the current conditional variance: This statement is true. The ARCH(q) model allows for the conditional variance to be influenced by the squared returns of the past q periods.\n\niv) The GARCH(1,1) model will usually be sufficient to capture all of the dependence in the conditional variance: This statement is false. While the GARCH(1,1) model is a popular choice for modeling conditional variance, it may not always be sufficient to capture all the dependence in the conditional variance, especially in cases with complex dependence structures."
