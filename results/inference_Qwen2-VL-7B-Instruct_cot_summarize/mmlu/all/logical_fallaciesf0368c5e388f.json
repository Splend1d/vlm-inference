( (Conclusion)\n\nThis is a conditional syllogism, where the conclusion is drawn from the conditional statement and the premise that the antecedent (P) is true.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. It is a formally valid categorical syllogism\n- This is incorrect because the argument is not a categorical syllogism. A categorical syllogism involves three categorical propositions, and this argument only has two.\n\nB. It is a formally invalid disjunctive syllogism\n- This is incorrect because a disjunctive syllogism involves a disjunction ( (or) and two premises, which is not the case here.\n\nC. It is a formally valid conditional syllogism\n- This is correct because the argument follows the structure of a conditional syllogism, where the conclusion logically follows from the conditional statement and the premise that the antecedent is true.\n\nD. It is a formally invalid conditional syllogism\n- This is incorrect because the argument is actually valid, not invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. It is a formally valid conditional syllogism"
