(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nHere's the reasoning for each option:\n\ni) **VARs receive strong motivation from financial and economic theory:** This is generally not true. VARs (Vector Autoregression models) are empirical models that are motivated by the observed data rather than theoretical models. They are used to capture the dynamic interrelationships among multiple time series.\n\nii) **VARs in their reduced forms can be used easily to produce time-series forecasts:** This is true. VAR models can be used to forecast future values of the variables in the model by using the reduced form equations, which are obtained by solving the VAR model for the endogenous variables.\n\niii) **VAR models are typically highly parsimonious:** This is true. VAR models are often used because they are relatively simple and require fewer parameters compared to full structural models, which can be more complex and require more parameters to estimate.\n\niv) **OLS can be applied separately to each equation in a reduced form VAR:** This is false. OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is not applied separately to each equation in a reduced form VAR. Instead, the entire system of equations is estimated simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
