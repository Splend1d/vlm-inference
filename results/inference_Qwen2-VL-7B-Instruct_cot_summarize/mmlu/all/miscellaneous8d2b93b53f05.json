Flight\n- The letters \"fl\" typically represent the sound /fl/ in English, which is the sound of the letter \"f\" followed by the letter \"l\" or \"i\" in words like \"fly\" or \"fill.\"\n\nB. Said\n- The letters \"sa\" typically represent the sound /s/ in English, which is the sound of the letter \"s\" in words like \"say\" or \"saw.\"\n\nC. Things\n- The letters \"th\" typically represent the sound /\u03b8/ in English, which is the sound of the letter \"th\" in words like \"this\" or \"that.\"\n\nD. Lamp\n- The letters \"lm\" typically represent the sound /lm/ in English, which is the sound of the letter \"l\" or \"i\" in words like \"fly\" or \"fill.\"\n\nUpon analyzing each word, it is clear that all of them can be decoded through knowledge of letter-sound relationships. Therefore, the question seems to be misleading as all the words provided can be decoded through such knowledge.\n\nHowever, if the intention was to find a word that does not follow typical letter-sound relationships, none of the given options fit that criterion. Thus, the question might be flawed or misinterpreted."
