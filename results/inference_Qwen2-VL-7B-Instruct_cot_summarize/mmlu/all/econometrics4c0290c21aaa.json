(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nWhen a relevant variable is omitted from a regression equation, the consequences are as follows:\n\ni) The standard errors would be biased: This is because the omitted variable bias occurs when a variable that is correlated with both the dependent variable and one or more of the independent variables is left out of the regression model. This can lead to biased estimates of the standard errors, which in turn affects the standard errors of the coefficients.\n\nii) If the excluded variable is uncorrelated with all of the included variables, all of the slope coefficients will be inconsistent: This is because the omitted variable bias can cause the coefficients of the included variables to be biased and inconsistent. If the omitted variable is uncorrelated with the included variables, the bias will not be present, but the coefficients will still be inconsistent because the omitted variable is affecting the dependent variable.\n\niii) If the excluded variable is uncorrelated with all of the included variables, the intercept coefficient will be inconsistent: This is because the intercept coefficient represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. If an omitted variable that is correlated with the dependent variable is left out, the intercept coefficient will be biased and inconsistent.\n\niv) If the excluded variable is uncorrelated with all of the included variables, all of the slope and intercept coefficients will be consistent and unbiased but inefficient: This statement is incorrect. If the excluded variable is uncorrelated with all of the included variables, the coefficients will be consistent and unbiased, but they will not be efficient. Efficiency refers to the precision of the estimates, and it is not affected by the correlation between the omitted variable and the included variables."
