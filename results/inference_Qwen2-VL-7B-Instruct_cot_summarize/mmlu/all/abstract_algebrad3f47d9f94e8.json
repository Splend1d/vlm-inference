The order of an element in a direct product of groups is the least common multiple (l.c.m. of the orders of its components.\n\nThe order of an element in Z_n is the smallest positive integer k such that n divides k. \n\nFor Z_12, the order of 4 is 3 because 12 divides 3*4. \nFor Z_8, the order of 2 is 4 because 8 divides 4*2.\n\nThe least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nTherefore, the order of the element (4, 2) in Z_12 x Z_8 is 12.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 12."
