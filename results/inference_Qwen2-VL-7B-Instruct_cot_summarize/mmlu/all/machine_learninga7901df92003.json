This is because the density estimates can be used to assign a new data point to the class with the highest density, effectively performing classification.\n- Statement 2 is False: The correspondence between logistic regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes with identity class covariances does not imply a one-to-one correspondence between the parameters of the two classifiers. While the two models can be mathematically equivalent under certain conditions, the parameters do not necessarily map one-to-one between the two models."
