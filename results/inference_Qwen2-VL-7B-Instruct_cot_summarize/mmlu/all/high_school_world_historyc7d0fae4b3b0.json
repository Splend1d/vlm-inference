They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1750\u20131900 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA.

Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants\n- This option suggests that the Chinese were interested in specific goods from Europe. However, the paragraph does not mention any specific goods that the Chinese were interested in. It only describes the general trade patterns and the goods exchanged.\n\nB. Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas\n- The Enlightenment period focused on ideas of reason, individualism, and the separation of church and state. While it may have influenced trade indirectly, it does not directly impact the specific trade patterns described in the paragraph.\n\nC. The Industrial Revolution\n- The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, significantly transformed economies and trade patterns. It would have led to increased production and trade, which could have influenced the trade patterns described in the paragraph. However, the paragraph does not mention any specific changes in trade patterns due to the Industrial Revolution.\n\nD. The colonization of Africa\n- The colonization of Africa by European powers began in the 15th century and continued through the 19th century. This colonization would have led to the establishment of trade networks and the exchange of goods between Africa and other regions, which could have influenced the trade patterns described in the paragraph.\n\nGiven the context of the paragraph, which describes specific trade patterns involving China, Japan, and Portugal, the most direct influence would be the colonization of Africa, which would have led to the establishment of trade networks and the exchange of goods between Africa and other regions, including China and Japan.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nD. The colonization of Africa"
