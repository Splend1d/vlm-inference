The lot, which the retiree owned, was situated on the corner of Davis Street and University Way. The tract measured 100 feet along Davis Street and 175 feet along University Way. The retiree executed a deed purporting to convey the vacant lot to his lifelong friend for the consideration of $28,000. After escrow, the deed was delivered to the friend, who immediately filed it with the county recorder's office. The recorded instrument described the property conveyed as \"all the tract of land beginning at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way; thence west along Davis Street 100 feet; thence north 175 feet; thence west 100 feet; thence south 175 feet along University Way to the place of beginning. \" Three months after his conveyance to the friend, the retiree died intestate. His heirs have now filed an appropriate action contesting the friend's title to the vacant lot. Which of the following statements is most accurate concerning the outcome of this suit?\n\nA. The retiree's heirs will prevail because metes and bounds, rather than streets, are appropriate boundary descriptions.\nB. The friend will prevail because equity will not permit forfeiture for a mere technicality.\nC. The outcome will depend on whether the tract of land was plotted as a lot in a subdivision.\nD. The outcome will depend on whether the last call (175 feet along University Way) prevails over the third call (west 100 feet).\n"

The outcome will depend on whether the last call (175 feet along University Way) prevails over the third call (west 100 feet).\n\nThis is because the description of the property in the deed includes two conflicting directions: \"thence west 100 feet\" and \"thence west 100 feet; ththere south 175 feet along University Way to the place of beginning.\" The last call (175 feet along University Way) must be considered as the controlling direction because it is the last call in the description. Therefore, the property conveyed would be the area bounded by the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way, west along Davis Street 100 feet, north 175 feet, west 100 feet, south 175 feet along University Way, and back to the starting point."
