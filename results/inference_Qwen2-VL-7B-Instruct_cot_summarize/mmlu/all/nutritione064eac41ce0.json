The gut/brain signalling pathway controls energy intake to within 2% of requirements, even in people who are morbidly obese\nC. The problem is one of greed and gluttony, whereby people override strong satiety signals on a regular basis\nD. Flavour signals from tasty, processed food will override satiety signals even after a large meal\n"

Obesity occurs because gut hormone secretion becomes deranged and PYY secretion fails to give a satiety signal.\n\nExplanation: Obesity is a complex condition influenced by various factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. One of the key roles of the intestine in obesity development is related to gut hormone secretion. Specifically, the hormone PYY ( (peptide YY) plays a crucial role in regulating satiety, or the feeling of being full after eating. When PYY secretion is deranged, it may not effectively signal to the brain that the stomach is full, leading to overeating and weight gain. This derangement can be influenced by various factors, including the consumption of processed and high-calorie foods, which can disrupt normal gut hormone balance."
