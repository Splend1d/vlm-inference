Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .\nYou must know that I am not content with the Courtier unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .\nI wish our Courtier to guard against getting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who do not deserve it.\n\u2014From Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, 1528\nWhich of the following skills that Castiglione recommends for a courtier would be valued LEAST by a European gentleman at the end of the twentieth century?\n\nA.

Therefore, expertise in multiple languages would still be valued.\n\n2. **Being strong and attractive**: Physical strength and attractiveness were valued in the Renaissance, but by the end of the twentieth century, societal norms had shifted towards more diverse and inclusive beauty standards. However, physical fitness and attractiveness would still be valued to some extent.\n\n3. **Expertise with many kinds of weapons**: The Renaissance valued martial skills, but by the end of the twentieth century, the focus had shifted away from military prowess to more peaceful and intellectual pursuits. The decline of the military's role in society and the rise of non-military professions made this skill less valued.\n\n4. **Ability to write poetry and prose**: While writing skills were valued in the Renaissance, by the end of the twentieth century, the emphasis had shifted towards more practical skills and less on literary arts. However, writing skills were still valued in various professional and academic contexts.\n\nGiven these considerations, the skill that would be valued least by a European gentleman at the end of the twentieth century is:\n\n**C. Expertise with many kinds of weapons**\n\nThis is because the societal values and expectations had shifted significantly away from valuing martial skills by the end of the the twentieth century."
