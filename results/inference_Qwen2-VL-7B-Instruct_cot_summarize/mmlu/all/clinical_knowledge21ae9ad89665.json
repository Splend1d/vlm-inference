These symptoms typically occur when the cannula (or IV line) is not properly placed or when the vein is damaged by the cannula.\n\nBased on the symptoms you've described, the most appropriate action would be:\n\nB. Stage 2 - re-site cannula.\n\nThis means that the cannula should be moved to a different vein to avoid further irritation and inflammation. If the symptoms persist or worsen, it may be necessary to consider treatment, which could include antibiotics if the infection is severe."
