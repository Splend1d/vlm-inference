He wrote mainly about consumer issues, while acting like a watchdog exposing wrongdoers. He wrote one article about a female preacher with a local church that had no affiliations and only a local blog on the internet. He wrote that she was \"conspiring with the devil\" to figure out \"how to lead people's minds astray\" and to live a nice \"sheltered role of pure moral superiority at the expense of inferiors\" like himself and his readers. He called the woman's fashion Medieval and her hair style was like a bag of \"hot wires ready to electrocute anyone who dares come too close.\" The preacher was not amused, and she filed a defamation action claiming libel per se and demanding damages along with an injunction against the web site. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, because the defendant was expressing opinions more than factual assertions, and opinions in this context are constitutionally protected.\nB. Yes, because statements about religious beliefs or practices cannot be the subject of private defamation actions.\nC. No, because the preacher's allegations are based on serious factual distortions that will destroy her career if she doesn't get protection.\nD. No, because a defamation action cannot be subject to a motion to dismiss \u0080\u0093 the plaintiff is always entitled to present evidence to prove the tort.\n"

Yes, because the defendant was expressing opinions more than factual assertions, and opinions in this context are constitutionally protected.\n\nThis is the most plausible answer. The defendant's statements about the preacher's fashion and hair style are clearly expressions of opinion rather than factual assertions. Opinions, especially those involving matters of taste, style, or personal appearance, are generally protected under the First Amendment in the United States. The court would likely find that the defendant's statements are not actionable as defamation because they are not statements of fact that could reasonably be understood as making an assertion of fact about the preacher's character or conduct.\n\nB. Yes, because statements about religious beliefs or practices cannot be the subject of private defamation actions.\n\nThis is not a strong argument. While religious beliefs and practices are often protected under the First Amendment, the court would likely focus on whether the statements are factual or opinion-based rather than the subject matter of the statements.\n\nC. No, because the preacher's allegations are based on serious factual distortions that will destroy her career if she doesn't get protection.\n\nThis argument is less compelling. The court would likely consider the nature of the statements rather than the potential impact on the preacher's career. The fact that the statements are opinions rather than factual assertions would likely outweigh the potential harm to the preacher's career.\n\nD. No, because a defamation action cannot be subject to a motion to dismiss \u0080\u0093 the plaintiff is always entitled to present evidence to prove the tort.\n\nThis is incorrect. While the plaintiff is entitled to present evidence to prove the tort, the court can still dismiss the case if it finds that the statements are protected opinions rather than actionable factual assertions.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to grant the motion to dismiss because the defendant's statements are expressions of opinion rather than factual assertions."
