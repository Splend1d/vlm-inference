This means that 4Z = {0 | o is an integer}. \n\nNow, let's consider the cosets of 4Z in 2Z. A coset of a subgroup H in a group G is a set of the form gH = {gh | h \u2208 H} for some g in G. \n\nIn this case, we are looking for cosets of 4Z in 2Z, which means we are looking for sets of the form g(4Z) = {g(4n) | n is an integer} for some g in 2Z.\n\nSince 2Z consists of all integer multiples of 2, we can consider the coset of 4Z in 2Z for g = 2. \n\nSo, the coset of 4Z in 2Z for g = 2 is 2(4Z) = {2(4n) | n is an integer} = {8n | n is an integer} = 8Z.\n\nTherefore, the coset of 4Z in 2Z is 8Z, which is not listed in the options provided. \n\nSo, the answer is not among the given options."
