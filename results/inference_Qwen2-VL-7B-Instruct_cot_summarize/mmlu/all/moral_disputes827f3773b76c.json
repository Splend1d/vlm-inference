Let's analyze each option in light of this conclusion:\n\nA. The abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person.\n- This option alignss with Thomson's conclusion. If the determination of when a fetus is a person is not the sole factor, then the issue cannot be settled solely based on that determination.\n\nB. Abortion is always morally permissible.\n- This option contradicts Thomson's conclusion. Thomson's conclusion suggests that the morality of abortion cannot be determined solely by the stage of fetal development, implying that other factors must be considered.\n\nC. Abortion is never morally permissible.\n- This option also contradicts Thomson's conclusion. Thomson's conclusion suggests that the morality of abortion cannot be determined solely by the stage of fetal development, implying that other factors must be considered, which could include circumstances where abortion might be morally permissible.\n\nD. The abortion issue can be settled just by determine at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person.\n- This option contradicts Thomson's conclusion. Thomson's conclusion suggests that the determination of when a fetus is a person is not the sole factor in resolving the abortion issue.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the abortion issue cannot be settled just by determine at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person."
