                    "text": "To determine the nature of the image formed by a bi-convex lens, we need to consider the lens formula and the sign conventions used in optics. The lens formula is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( f \\) is the focal length of the lens,\n- \\( v \\) is the image distance,\n- \\( u \\) is the object distance.\n\nFor a bi-convex lens, the focal length \\( f \\) is positive. The radius of curvature of the lens is given as 20 cm. The radius of curvature \\( R \\) is related to the focal length \\( f \\) by the formula:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{R}{2} \\]\n\nGiven \\( R = 20 \\) cm, we can calculate \\( f \\):\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the nature of the image formed when an object of height 2 cm is placed 30 cm from the lens. The object distance \\( u \\) is 30 cm. We need to find the image distance \\( v \\).\n\nUsing the lens formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{30} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{30} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{3}{30} - \\frac{1}{30} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{2}{30} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{15} \\]\n\n\\[ v = 15 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nSince \\( v \\) is positive, the image is real. The image is also formed on the same side of the lens as the object, which means it is upright.\n\nThe height of of the image can be calculated using the magnification formula:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{v}{u} \\times h \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the object ( (2 cm),\n- \\( u \\) is the object distance ( (30 cm),\n- \\( v \\) is the image distance ( (15 cm).\n\n\\[ h_i = \\frac{15}{30} \\times 2 \\]\n\n\\[ h_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\]\n\n\\[ h_i = 1 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the image is real, upright, and has a height of 1 cm.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Real, upright, height = 1 cm"
