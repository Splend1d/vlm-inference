The law, signed by the President, imposes a tax of $1 on each pack of marijuana cigarettes sold in the United States. In an inseverable portion of that same law, the entire proceeds of the tax are appropriated on a continuing basis for direct payments to an art museum. The public museum is dedicated to the collection of pictures, artifacts, weapons, and other historical memorabilia of past wars. Which of the following most clearly has standing to attack the constitutionality of this appropriation of the tax monies to the art museum?\n\nA. A state, other than the one in which the museum is located, in which several other public museums are located that are not subsidized by this law.\nB. A nonprofit organization of war veterans that claims it can demonstrate a greater need for the funds than can the museum.\nC. A purchaser of marijuana cigarettes who is required to pay the tax.\nD. An association of medical doctors that alleges that the legalization of marijuana will result in a public health hazard.\n"

They have a personal stake in the outcome, as they are required to pay the tax and the proceeds are being used for a purpose they may not agree with or believe to be in the public interest."
