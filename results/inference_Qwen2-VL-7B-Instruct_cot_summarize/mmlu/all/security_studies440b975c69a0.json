There is little evidence to substantiate the claim that there is a real and increasing threat posed by the scale and scope of transnational crime in the 1980s to 1990s beyond the consensus that concern over the levels of crime were generated by the military re-conceiving its role in light of the dissolution of the Cold War.\nB. Whereas illegal markets were territorially bounded and isolated in the past, the contemporary form illicit markets tend to be interrelated and mutually supporting and more embedded in the legal economy.\nC. TNC is a response by the dispossessed in response to the asymmetric economic development of nation states and the inequity of global market capitalism married with environmental constraints on development.\nD. Transnational crime is no longer the exclusive domain of certain geographic areas or ethnic groups becoming globalized in operation, increasing the number of groups and countries affected and increasing the size of the illegal market ratio to licit trade.\n"

This statement suggests that the concern over crime levels in the 1980s to 1990s was influenced by the military's re-conceptualization of its role post-Cold War. It does not provide evidence that transnational crime became a new phenomenon but rather that the concern over crime was heightened during that period.\n\nB. This statement describes a shift in the nature of illegal markets from being territorially bounded and isolated to being interrelated and mutually supporting, and more embedded in the legal economy. This indicates a significant change in the structure and operation of illegal markets, suggesting that transnational crime has evolved and become more integrated into the global economy.\n\nC. This statement discusses TNC as a response to economic and environmental constraints on development. It suggests that TNC is a reaction to certain conditions but does not necessarily indicate a new phenomenon. It rather describes the context in which TNC operates.\n\nD. This statement indicates that transnational crime has become more globalized, affecting more groups and countries, and increasing the size of the illegal market relative to licit trade. This suggests a significant increase in the scale and scope of transnational crime, indicating that it has become a new phenomenon.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement D provides the strongest evidence that TNC has become a new phenomenon, as it indicates a significant increase in the scale and scope of transnational crime.\n\nFinal answer: D."
