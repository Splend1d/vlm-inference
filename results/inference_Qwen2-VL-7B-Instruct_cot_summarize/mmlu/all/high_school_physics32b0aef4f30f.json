                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the forces acting on the small block placed on top of the original block in the spring-block oscillator. The system consists of two blocks with masses \\( m \\) and \\( m \\), respectively, and a spring with spring constant \\( k \\). The original block has an amplitude \\( A \\) from the equilibrium position.\n\n### Forces Acting on the Small Block\n\n1. **Spring Force**: The spring force \\( F_s \\) is given by Hooke's Law:\n   \\[\n   F_s = -kx\n   \\]\n   where \\( x \\) is the displacement of the original block from the equilibrium position.\n\n2. **Gravitational Force**: The gravitational force \\( F_g \\) on the small block is:\n   \\[\n   F_g = (mg\n   \\]\n\n3. **Normal Force**: The normal force \\( N \\) from the original block on the small block is equal to the weight of the small block:\n   \\[\n   N = mg\n   \\]\n\n4. **Friction Force**: The friction force \\( F_f \\) between the two blocks is given by:\n   \\[\n   F_f = \\mu N = \\mu mg\n   \\]\n\n### Conditions for Sliding\n\nThe small block will slide off when the net force acting on it is greater than zero. The net force \\( F_{net} \\) is:\n\\[\nF_{net} = F_s + F_g - F_f\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the forces:\n\\[\nF_{net} = -kx + mg - \\mu mg\n\\]\n\n### Maximum Displacement\n\nAt maximum displacement \\( x = A \\):\n\\[\nF_{net} = -kA + mg - \\mu mg\n\\]\n\nFor the small block to slide off, the net force must be positive:\n\\[\n-kA + mg - \\mu mg > 0\n\\]\n\nRearrange to solve for \\( \\mu \\):\n\\[\n\\mu mg > kA + mg\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\mu > \\frac{kA + mg}{mg}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\mu > \\frac{kA}{mg} + 1\n\\]\n\n### Coefficient of Static Friction\n\nThe coefficient of static friction \\( \\mu \\) must be greater than:\n\\[\n\\mu > \\frac{kA}{mg} + 1\n\\]\n\n### Correct Answer\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{C. The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than } \\frac{(M+m)g}{kA}}\n\\]\n\nThis is because the condition for the small block to slide off is based on the maximum displacement \\( A \\) and the coefficient of static friction \\( \\mu \\) must be greater than \\( \\frac{(M+m)g}{kA} \\) for the small block to remain stationary."
