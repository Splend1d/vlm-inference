When the audience are convinced via the speech act or the securitize actor but fail to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat.\n\nIn the context of securitization theory, as proposed by Hermann Goldmann and later developed by Johan Galtung, securitization is a process by which a problem is elevated to the level of national security. This process involves three main elements: the securitizing actor ( (the actor who seeks to securitize the issue), the audience ( (the public or political body that is addressed), and the speech act ( (the act of framing the issue as a security threat). For an issue to be securitized, the audience must be convinced by the securitize actor's speech act and must grant the securitize actor the special rights to address the threat.\n\nIf the audience is convinced but does not grant the securitize actor the necessary special rights, the issue fails to become securitized. This is because the securitization process requires not only the recognition of the threat but also the empowerment of the securitize actor to take extraordinary measures to address it."
