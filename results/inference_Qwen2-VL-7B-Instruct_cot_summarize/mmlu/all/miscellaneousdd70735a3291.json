This means that judges are appointed for life and cannot be removed by Congress or the president unless they are impeached and convicted for a specific offense. This provision ensures that judges have political independence to fulfill their duties without fear of political retaliation or influence, allowing them to make decisions based on the law and the Constitution rather than political considerations."
