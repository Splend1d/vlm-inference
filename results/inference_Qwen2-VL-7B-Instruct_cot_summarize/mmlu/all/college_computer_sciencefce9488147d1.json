The cache is physically addressed, physically tagged, and direct-mapped with a block size of 8 bytes. The cache size is 2K bytes ( (2048 bytes).\n\nLet's analyze the loop:\n\n```csharp\nfor (i = 0; i < 256; i++)\n        A[i] = A[i] + B[2*i];\n```\n\n1. **Cache Behavior**: Since the cache is direct-mapped, each block maps to a specific physical memory location. The cache is initially empty, and we assume that only arrays A and B can be cached.\n\n2. **Write-Through Policy**: In a write-through cache, every write operation is immediately written to both the cache and the main memory.\n\n3. **Cache Accesses**: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < 256`. For each iteration, `A[i]` is accessed, and `B[2*i]` is accessed. Since `A` has 256 elements and `B` has 512 elements, both arrays will be accessed multiple times.\n\n4. **Cache Hits and Misses**: Since the cache is direct-mapped and the block size is 8 bytes, each access to `A[i]` and `B[2*i]` will result in a cache miss because the cache is initially empty. Each access will cause a write to both the cache and main memory.\n\n5. **Total Bytes Written**: Each access to `A[i]` and `B[2*i]` results in 4 bytes being written to memory ( (since each element is 4 bytes). Since the loop iterates 256 times, the total number of bytes written to memory is:\n\n\\[ 256 \\text{ accesses} \\times 4 \\text{ bytes/ access} = 1024 \\text{ bytes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1024"
