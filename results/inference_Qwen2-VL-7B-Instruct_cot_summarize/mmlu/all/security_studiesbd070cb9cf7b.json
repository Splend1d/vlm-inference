In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.\nB. Theories of Westphalian sovereignty decree that principles of non-intervention are paramount to achieving security; this has been extended into the contemporary global security environment in which international bodies such as the UN condemn humanitarian intervention, regarding it as detrimental to state-centric security.\nC. State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.\nD. The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.\n"

State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.\n\nThe Treaty of Westphalia, signed in 1648, established the principle of state sovereignty, which is the idea that each state has the right to govern itself without external interference. This principle has been a cornerstone of international law and relations for centuries. However, the concept of state sovereignty has evolved over time, and there are situations where humanitarian intervention may be justified.\n\nIn the context of humanitarian intervention, the idea is that when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens from serious human rights abuses or other forms of humanitarian crises, the international community may have a responsibility to intervene to protect those citizens. This is often referred to as the Responsibility to Protect ( (R2P) principle.\n\nThe idea of R2P is that when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens, the international community has a responsibility to intervene to protect them state's citizens. This is often referred to as the Responsibility to Protect ( (R2P) principle. The idea is that when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens, the international community has a responsibility to intervene to protect a state's citizens. This the international community has a responsibility to intervene to protect a state's citizens."
