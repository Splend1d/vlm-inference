There are two possible outcomes for each toss: heads or tails. If the first player tosses a head, they win immediately. If they toss a tail, the second player gets a chance to win on their next toss. This pattern continues until one of the players tosses a head.\n\nThe probability of getting a head on any given toss is 1/2, and the probability of getting a tail is also also 1/2. Since the game ends as soon as a head appears, the probability that the first player wins is the same as the probability of getting a head on the first toss, which is 1/2."
