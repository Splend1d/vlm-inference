The passage describes readers' reactions to science fiction, comparing them to \"chocolate addicts\" who either love it or hate it, and consume it with great enthusiasm or avoid it completely.\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the author's primary intent in making this comparison. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Suggest that science fiction is not a serious literary genre**: This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not discuss the seriousness of science fiction as a literary genre.\n\nB. **Indicate the depth of certain readers' feelings about science fiction**: This option alignss well with the passage. The comparison to chocolate addicts suggests that some readers have a very strong and passionate affection for science fiction, similar to how chocolate addicts are deeply passionate about their favorite treat.\n\nC. **Explain why some readers consider science fiction to be dangerous**: The passage does not mention anything about science fiction being dangerous. This option is not supported by the passage.\n\nD. **Contrast the characteristics of science fiction with those of other literary genres**: The passage does not make a direct comparison between science fiction and other literary genres. It focuses on the extreme reactions of readers to science fiction.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**B. Indicate the depth of certain readers' feelings about science fiction**."
