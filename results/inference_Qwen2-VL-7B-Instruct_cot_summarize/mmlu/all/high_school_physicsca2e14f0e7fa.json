The wave\u2019s height has become smaller.\n\nWhen a wave travels through a medium, such as water, it experiences energy dissipation due to factors like friction, viscosity, and the wave's interaction with the medium. As the wave travels from the point of impact to the shore, it loses energy, which is why its height decreases. This reduction in height indicates that the wave has lost energy, which is consistent with the wave carrying less energy at the shore compared to when it was first created by the rock\u2019s impact."
