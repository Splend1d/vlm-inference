                    "text": "The club president's statement, \"the judge is the best judge money can buy in the city,\" is a statement of opinion rather than a statement of fact. In law, opinions are generally not admissible as evidence in court. This is because opinions are subjective and can vary from person to person, making them unreliable as evidence.\n\nHowever, if the club president pleads truth as a defense, he may introduce evidence to support the statement. The judge's lawsuit for slander is based on the statement being false, so the club president must prove that the statement was true.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The judge has a reputation for dishonesty in the community.\n- This is an opinion about the judge's reputation, not a fact. Opinions are not admissible as evidence.\n\nB. The judge was convicted of bribery three years earlier.\n- This is a statement of fact. If true, it could be admissible as evidence to support the statement that the judge is the best judge money can buy.\n\nC. The judge, though not convicted, embezzled money from a former employer before being elected to the bench.\n- This is also a statement of fact. If true, it could be admissible as evidence to support the statement that the judge is the best judge money can buy.\n\nD. The judge was convicted for a felony assault 12 years earlier.\n- This is a statement of fact. If true, it could be admissible as evidence to support the statement that the judge is the best judge money can buy.\n\nTherefore, the club president may properly introduce evidence to show that the judge was convicted of bribery three years earlier, as this is a statement of fact that could support the statement that the judge is the best judge money can buy.\n\nFinal answer: B. The judge was convicted of bribery three years earlier."
