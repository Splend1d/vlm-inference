                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to refer to the specific arguments made by Reiman regarding van den Haag's arguments in favor of the death penalty. However, since the exact text from Reiman is not provided, I will provide a general analysis based on common knowledge and ethical considerations.\n\nVan den Haag's arguments in favor of the death penalty typically revolve around the idea that it is a just punishment for certain crimes, particularly those involving murder. His arguments often include the following points:\n\n1. **Deterrence**: The fear of execution is supposed to deter potential criminals from committing murder.\n2. **Justice**: The death penalty is seen as a just punishment for the most heinous crimes.\n3. **Retribution**: The idea that the punishment should fit the crime, and in the case of murder, the death penalty is fitting.\n4. **Public Safety**: The belief that executing a murderer will protect society from future crimes by that individual.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the options provided:\n\nA. **Are incompatible with the right to retaliation.**\n   - This option suggests that van den Haag's arguments are incompatible with the right to retaliate. However, the death penalty is often seen as a form of retaliation itself, as it is a punishment for a crime committed by another person. Therefore, this option seems to misunderstand the nature of the death penalty.\n\nB. **Prove that torture is morally impermissible.**\n   - This option suggests that van den Haag's arguments prove that torture is morally impermissible. This is not directly related to his arguments for the death penalty. Torture and the death penalty are separate issues, and van den Haag's arguments do not necessarily address the morality of torture.\n\nC. **Should be accepted.**\n   - This option suggests that van den Haag's arguments should be accepted. This is a subjective stance and depends on one's ethical and moral beliefs. Some people might accept these arguments, while others might not.\n\nD. **Follow common sense.**\n   - This option suggest that van den Haag's arguments follow common sense. While common sense might support some of the points made by van den Haag ( (e.g., the idea that the death penalty can deter future crimes), it does not necessarily mean that all his arguments follow common sense.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**C. Should be accepted.**\n\nThis is because the acceptance of van den Haag's arguments is a matter of personal or societal ethics and values, and not necessarily a direct logical conclusion from his arguments."
