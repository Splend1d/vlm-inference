A commuter who works in the city but is a resident of a neighboring state, challenges the constitutionality of this statute.

To determine which constitutional provision would furnish the most applicable basis for this challenge, we need to analyze the nature of the challenge and the provisions of the Constitution that are relevant to the issue.\n\n1. **Equal Protection Clause ( (A. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n   - The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that states treat all individuals similarly under similar circumstances. In this case, the commuter is a nonresident who earns income in the city and is subject to a tax, while residents of the city are not taxed on their in-city earned income. This differential treatment might be challenged under the equal protection clause if it is deemed to be arbitrary or irrational.\n\n2. **Due Process Clause ( (B. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.**\n   - The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals from arbitrary and unreasonable government actions. If the commuter feels that the tax is being applied in an arbitrary manner, this clause could be relevant. However, the due process clause is generally and might not be the most specific basis for the challenge.\n\n3. **Privileges and Immunities Clause ( (C. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIV.**\n   - The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution protects citizens of one state from discrimination by the states of which they are not citizens. If the commuter feels that the city's tax statute discriminates against non-residents, this clause could be relevant. However, the clause is more focused on interstate commerce and the rights of citizens of one state in another state, rather than the specific issue of tax rates.\n\n4. **Commerce Clause ( (D. The commerce clause.**\n   - The commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states. If the commuter feels that the tax statute discriminates against interstate commerce or affects interstate commerce in an unfair manner, this clause could be relevant. However, the commuter's challenge is more about the tax rate and its application to non-residents, rather than interstate commerce.\n\nGiven the context of the commuter's challenge, the most applicable basis for the constitutional challenge would be:\n\n**A. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n\nThis is because the commuter is challenging the differential treatment of residents and non-residents based on their state of residence, which is a core issue under the equal protection clause."
