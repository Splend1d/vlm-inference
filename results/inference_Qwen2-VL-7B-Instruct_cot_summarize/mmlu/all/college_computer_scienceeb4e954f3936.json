The grammar is ambiguous.\n- To determine if the grammar is ambiguous, we need to check if there are any sentences that can be derived in more than one way. In this case, the grammar is ambiguous because the production rule \\( s \\rightarrow ( \\, s \\, ) \\) can be applied to the start symbol \\( s \\) to generate the string \\( ( \\, s \\, ) \\), and then the rule \\( s \\rightarrow x \\) can be applied to generate the string \\( x \\). This means that the string \\( x \\) can be derived in two different ways, making the grammar ambiguous.\n\n ii. The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.\n- Top-down parsing starts with the start symbol and tries to match the input string from the top down. However, the grammar is ambiguous, which means that there are multiple ways to derive the same string. Therefore, top-down parsing cannot uniquely determine the parse tree for the input string, making the grammar unsuitable for top-down parsing.\n\n iii. The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n- Bottom-up parsing starts with the input string and tries to match it with the grammar from the bottom up. Since the grammar is ambiguous, bottom-up parsing can still uniquely determine the parse tree for the input string, making the grammar suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. III only"
