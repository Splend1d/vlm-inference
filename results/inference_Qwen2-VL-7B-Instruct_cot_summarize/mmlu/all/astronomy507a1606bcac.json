It's much too cool to emit visible light\n\nThe Sun's corona is the outermost layer of its atmosphere and is composed of very hot plasma (ions and electrons) and magnetic fields. However, the temperature of the corona is much lower than the temperature of the visible surface of the Sun, which is why it is not visible to the naked eye. During a total solar eclipse, the Moon blocks the bright light of the Sun's photosphere, allowing us to see the corona."
