That human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\n\nJohn Finnis, in his work \"Natural Law and Natural Rights,\" critiques Hume's conception of practical reason by arguing that Hume's view fails to account for the role of reason in determining what constitutes a worthwhile life. According to Hume, practical reason is based on empirical observation and experience, and it does not provide a basis for determining what is good or valuable. Finnis, on the other hand, argues that human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life, and that this is an essential part of practical reason."
