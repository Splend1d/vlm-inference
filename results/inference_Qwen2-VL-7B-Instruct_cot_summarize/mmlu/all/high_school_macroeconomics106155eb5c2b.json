Removal of the investment tax credit\n\nRemoving the investment tax credit would likely slow a nation's economic growth because it would reduce the incentive for businesses to invest in new capital, which is a key driver of economic growth. The investment tax credit provides a tax break for businesses that invest in new capital, such as machinery, equipment, and buildings. By removing this tax credit, the government would be reducing the financial incentive for businesses to invest, which could lead to slower economic growth."
