The times are:\n\n86, 94, 97, 88, 96\n\nArranging them in ascending order gives:\n\n86, 88, 94, 96, 97\n\nThe median is the middle number in an ordered list of numbers. Since there are five times, the median will be the third number, which is 94 seconds.\n\nAfter her sixth attempt, her median time is 92 seconds. This means that the sixth time must be lower than 94 seconds but higher than 86 seconds ( (since 94 is the median of the current set of five times). The only option that fits this criterion is 90 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 90."
