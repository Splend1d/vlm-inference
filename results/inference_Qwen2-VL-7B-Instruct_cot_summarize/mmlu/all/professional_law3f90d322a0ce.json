Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.\n\nThe homeowner's claim against the manufacturer of the snowblower is viable because the snowblower itself had a defect that caused the injury. The fact that the homeowner failed to provide the operating manual to the mechanic does not negate the manufacturer's liability. The manufacturer is responsible for the safety of the snowblower, and the failure of the automatic cutoff switch, which was a part of the snowblower, is the cause of the injury."
