Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following Polish thinkers was most likely the person whose ideas convinced Galileo to have written the statement above?\n\nA.

However, Copernicus died in 1543, long before Galileo's time ( (1611).\n\n2. **Johannes Kepler**: Kepler was a contemporary of Galileo and made significant contributions to astronomy, including the laws of planetary motion. His work on the elliptical orbits of planets and the relationship between the planets' distances from the sun and their orbital periods would have been relevant to Galileo's observations.\n\n3. **Galileo Galilei**: Galileo himself was the author of the statement. He was a key figure in the development of modern science and astronomy, and his work on the Medicean planets was a direct result of his observations and the theories he was developing.\n\n4. **Josef Pilsudski**: He was a Polish military and political leader in the 20 century, long after Galileo's time.\n\nGiven the timeline and the context of the quote, the most likely person whose ideas influenced Galileo would be **Johannes Kepler**. Kepler's work on planetary motion and his being a contemporary of Galileo would make him the most plausible candidate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Johannes Kepler**"
