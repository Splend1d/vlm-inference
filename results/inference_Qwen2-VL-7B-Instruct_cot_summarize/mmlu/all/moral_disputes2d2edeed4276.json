This directly addresses the objection by clarifying the motivation behind the prohibition.\n\nB. \"Drug prohibition would be paternalistic, but its consequences would be good enough to outweigh considerations about paternalism.\"\n- This response acknowledges that drug prohibition is paternalistic but suggests that the good consequences justify the paternalistic nature. It does not directly address the objection by changing the perspective on paternalism.\n\nC. \"Drug prohibition would be targeted to adults, and one can only be paternalistic toward children.\"\n- This response clarifies that drug prohibition is targeted at adults, thus not being paternalistic. It does not directly address the objection by changing the perspective on paternalism.\n\nD. \"Paternalism is always justified when the paternalistic practices truly are in the best interest of those affected.\"\n- This response generalizes the justification of paternalism, but it does not directly address the objection that drug prohibition is paternalistic.\n\nAmong these options, option A directly addresses the objection by clarifying that drug prohibition is not paternalistic because it is for the benefit of others, not the producers/sellers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Drug prohibition would be done for the benefit of others, not the benefit of those who wish to produce/sell drug, so it is not paternalistic in an objectionable sense."
