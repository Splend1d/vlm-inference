The consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. It is calculated by taking the ratio of the current period's basket price to the base period basket price and multiplying by 100. In this case, the base period basket price is $200 and the current period basket price is $400. Therefore, the CPI in the current period is (400/200 * 100 = 200."
