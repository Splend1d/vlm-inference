This is a fundamental result in real analysis.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2\nThe statement claims that if \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are everywhere differentiable functions from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{R} \\), then \\( f(g(x)) \\) must be everywhere differentiable.\n\n**Counterexample:**\nConsider \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) and \\( g(x) = x \\). Both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are everywhere differentiable:\n- \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) has derivative \\( f'(x) = 2x \\).\n- \\( g(x) = x \\) has derivative \\( g'(x) = 1 \\).\n\nNow, consider \\( f(g(x)) = f(x) = x^2 \\). The derivative of \\( f(g(x)) \\) is \\( f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) = 2x \\cdot 1 = 2x \\).\n\nHowever, if we consider \\( g(x) = x \\) and \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), then \\( f(g(x)) = f(x^2) \\). The derivative of \\( f(g(x)) \\) is \\( f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) = 2x \\cdot 1 = 2x \\), which is not the derivative of \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is \\( 2x \\).\n\nThis shows that the composition \\( f(g(x)) \\) is not necessarily everywhere differentiable.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is **False**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is:\n**B. True, False**"
