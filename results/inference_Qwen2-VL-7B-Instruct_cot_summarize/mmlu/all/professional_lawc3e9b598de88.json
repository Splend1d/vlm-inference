The plaintiff was severely injured in the reservoir when he dove from a boat into what he thought was deep water and hit an unmarked submerged island. The plaintiff alleges that the company was negligent in failing to mark the submerged island. At trial, the plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as an expert in managing reservoirs. Which of the following opinions by the plaintiff's expert is the court most likely to admit?\n\nA. \"The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made.\"\nB. \"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300.\"\nC. \"The company was required by federal law to mark the island.\"\nD. \"The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.\"\n"

Expert opinions on the feasibility and cost of performing a task are generally admissible as they relate directly to the issue of negligence.\n\nOpinion A is less likely to be admitted because it involves the creation of a computer-animated film, which is more akin to a demonstration or exhibit rather than an expert opinion.\n\nOpinion C is also less likely to be admitted because it involves a legal interpretation of federal law, which is typically the role of the judge rather than the jury or the expert witness.\n\nOpinion D is less likely to be admitted because it involves a legal conclusion about the plaintiff's contributory negligence, which is a matter for the court to decide based on the evidence presented, not an expert opinion."
