The principal gave the assistant all of the materials to set up a table with the principal's cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists and even some order forms with businessperson's logo on them. In addition, the assistant represented to third parties that she was there officially representing the principal and that she was authorized to execute contracts on his behalf. The assistant negotiated a deal for the businessperson with a third party, which the businessperson refused to honor because he did not like the terms that were negotiated. Will the third party likely prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson?\n\nA. Yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\nB. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.\nC. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\nD. No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n"

No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\n\nIn the context of agency law, the principle of \"innocent third party\" protection applies. This means that a third party who deals with an agent of another person ( in good faith and without notice of any defect in the agent's authority is protected. In this case, the businessperson's employee represented herself as authorized to execute contracts on behalf of the principal, and the third party dealt with her in good faith. Therefore, the third party is protected under the innocent third party rule, and the businessperson cannot avoid the contract based on the lack of actual authority of the employee."
