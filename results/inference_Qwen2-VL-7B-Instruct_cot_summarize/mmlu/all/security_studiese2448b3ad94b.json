Social class is a central concept in HM, as it is a key factor in understanding social inequality and the dynamics of power and control.\n\nB. **Within the HM paradigm, the only form of class that matters is social class.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. While social class is indeed a significant focus, HM also also considers other forms of class, such as gender, race, and ethnicity, as they intersect with social class and contribute to overall social stratification.\n\nC. **The focus of HM lies predominantly on class and class in relation to capital.**\n   - This statement is true. HM is heavily influenced by Marxist theory, which emphasizes the role of capital and class in shaping society.\n\nD. **HM regards class as being far more complex than a simple division between a capitalist ruling class and working class.**\n   - This statement is true. HM recognizes that class is a multifaceted concept that includes various dimensions beyond just the capitalist ruling class and working class.\n\nGiven this analysis, the incorrect statement is:\n\n**B. Within the HM paradigm, the only form of class that matters is social class.**\n\nThe final answer is B."
