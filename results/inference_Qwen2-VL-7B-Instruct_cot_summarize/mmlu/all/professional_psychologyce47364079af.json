Goals that are too difficult may lead to frustration and decreased motivation. The optimal level of difficulty for goals is often referred to as the \"stretch zone,\" where the goal is challenging enough to motivate effort but not so difficult that it leads to demotivation. Therefore, the correct approach is to set goals that are specific and moderately challenging, not highly difficult."
