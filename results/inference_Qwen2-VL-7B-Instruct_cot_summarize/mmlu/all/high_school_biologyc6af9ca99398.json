Wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed\n\nThis option is the most comprehensive and appropriate safety precaution for the students conducting the plant pigment separation exercise. Wearing goggles protects the eyes from any potential splashes or spills of acetone, while nitrile gloves provide a barrier against skin contact with the acetone. Keeping all acetone containers closed minimizes the risk of spills or leaks, and the small amount of acetone in the bottom of the chamber should not pose a significant fire hazard if handled properly."
