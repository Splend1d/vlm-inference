So, the horizontal component of velocity is still 30 m/s.\n\nThe vertical component of velocity can be found using the formula:\n\nv_y = g * t\n\nwhere:\nv_y is the vertical component of velocity,\ng is the acceleration due to gravity ( (9.8 m/s^2), and\nt is the time time (4 seconds.\n\nSo, v_y = 9.8 * 4 = 39.2 m/s.\n\nThe total speed (v_total can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nv_total = sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2)\n\nwhere:\nv_x is the horizontal component of velocity ( (30 m/s), and\nv_y is the vertical component of velocity (39.2 e/s).\n\nSo, v_total = sqrt(30^2 + 39.2^2) = sqrt(900 + 1536.64) = sqrt(2436.64) \u2248 49.36 e/s.\n\nThe closest answer to this value is:\n\nC. 50 e/s"
