For \\(f: (0, 1) \\rightarrow: 0, 1]\\), it is possible to have a one-to-one function. For example, \\(f(x) = x\\) is one-to-one.\n- **Onto (** A function is onto if every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. For \\(f: (0, 1) \\rightarrow: 0, 1]\\), it is possible to have an onto function. For example, \\(f(x) = x\\) is onto.\n\n### Statement II: The image of \\(f\\) is compact.\n- **Compactness** In the context of real functions, a set is compact if it is both closed and bounded. The image of \\(f\\) is \\([0, 1]\\), which is indeed both closed and bounded. Therefore, the image of \\(f\\) is compact.\n\n### Statement III: \\(f\\) is continuous, one-to-one, and onto.\n- **Continuity** For \\(f: (0, 1) \\rightarrow: 0, 1]\\), it is possible to have a continuous function. For example, \\(f(x) = x\\) is continuous.\n- **One-to-one and Onto** As discussed in Statement I, it is possible for \\(f\\) to be both one-to-one and onto.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the analysis, all statements can be true under certain conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I and III only**"
