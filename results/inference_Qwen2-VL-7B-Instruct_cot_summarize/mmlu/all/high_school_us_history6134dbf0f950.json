He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nHow did President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the Civil War?\n\nA. The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.\nB. The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.\nC.

                    "text": "To determine how President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation altered the course of the Civil War, let's analyze each option carefully:\n\nA. The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.\n- This option suggests that the Emancipation Proclamation led to a quick end to the war. However, the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, and the war continued until 1865. Therefore, this option is not accurate.\n\nB. The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.\n- This option suggests that the Emancipation Proclamation led to British support for the Union. While the Emancipation Proclamation did have an impact on British policy, it is not accurate to say that it directly caused Britain to join the fight. Britain had already been considering intervention before the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nC. President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves.\n- This option suggests that President Davis vowed massive resistance to freeing the slaves. While Davis did oppose emancipation, the Emancipation Proclamation was not the sole reason for his resistance. Davis's resistance was rooted in the broader conflict over states' rights and the Union itself.\n\nD. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n- This option suggests that the Emancipation Proclamation changed the war's primary goal. Before to include the abolition of slavery. This option is accurate. The Emancipation Proclamation shifted the war's primary goal from merely preserving the Union to also also including the abolition of slavery. This shift in goal was a significant factor in the war's course and outcome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union."
