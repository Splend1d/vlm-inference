His friend had often cautioned him that he should not leave so much of his merchandise out in the open. One day, as the friend entered the store to pay a visit, he decided he'd put his unheeded warnings into action by playing a joke on the owner. The friend took a hatchet that was lying on a display case and swung it over his head as if he were going to strike the owner, who was standing at the register with his back turned. The friend then said, \"All right buddy, one false move and it's over. \" The owner was very frightened at almost being hit with the hatchet but suffered no actual physical or other harm. If the owner asserts a claim against the friend, the most likely result is that he will\n\nA. recover, because the friend was negligent.\nB. recover, because he feared the friend would hit him.\nC. not recover, because he suffered no physical harm.\nD. not recover, because the friend was only joking.\n"

Even though the friend did not actually harm the owner, the owner's fear and the potential for harm were real and significant. Therefore, the owner would likely have a strong case for recovery under negligence, as the friend's actions were reckless and caused the owner to suffer emotional distress."
