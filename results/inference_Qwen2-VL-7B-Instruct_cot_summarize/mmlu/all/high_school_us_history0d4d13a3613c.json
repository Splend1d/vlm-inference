Ferguson ( (1896), the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which allowed for the segregation of public facilities based on race. This doctrine was later overturned by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which declared that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal and thus unconstitutional."
