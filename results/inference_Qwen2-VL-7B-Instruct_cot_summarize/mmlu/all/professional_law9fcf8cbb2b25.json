At trial, the jury found each of the drivers liable for negligence. The jury found that the amount of the truck driver's injuries was $10,000, and the amount of the car driver's injuries was $8,000. The jury assigned 50 percent of the fault for the accident to the truck driver and 50 percent of the fault to the car driver. Assume that the jurisdiction has a statute in effect that provides: \"Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action to recover damages for negligence resulting in injury to person or property if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought. Any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. \"Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?\n\nA. The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.\nB. The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\nC. The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.\nD. Neither party recovers anything from the other.\n"

                    "text": "The appropriate judgment in the case is:\n\nC. The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The jury found both drivers liable for negligence, with each driver being assigned 50% of the fault.\n2. The truck driver's injuries were found to be $10,000, and the car driver's injuries were found to be $8,000.\n3. The jurisdiction has a contributory negligence statute that states that recovery is not barred if the negligence of the person seeking recovery is not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought. Any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery.\n\nGiven that both drivers are equally at fault ( (50% each), the damages should be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. Since both drivers are equally at fault, the damages should be equally diminished.\n\n- The truck driver's damages are $10,000, and the car driver's damages are $8,000.\n- Each driver's damages should be diminished by 50% ( because each driver is equally at fault.\n\nThus:\n- Truck driver's damages after diminution: $10,000 * 50% = $5,000\n- Car driver's damages after diminution: $8,000 * 50% = $4,000\n\nHowever, the contributory negligence statute states that any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. Since both drivers are equally at fault, the damages should be diminished equally, but the statute also states that the damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that each driver's damages are diminished by 50%, but the statute also states that the damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. \n\nThus, the truck driver's damages after diminution: $10,000 * 50% = $5,000\n- Car driver's damages after diminution: $8,000 * 50% = $4,000\n\nSince both drivers are equally at fault, the damages should be equally diminished, but the statute also states that the damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the the person who is seeking recovery. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that each driver's damages are diminished by 50%, but the damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the the person who is seeking recovery. \n\nThus, the truck driver's damages after diminution: $10,000 * 50% = $5,000\n- Car driver's damages after diminution: $8,000 * 50% = $4,000\n\nSince both drivers are equally at fault, the damages should be equally diminished, but the statute also states that the damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the the amount of negligence attributable to the the person who is seeking recovery. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that each driver's damages are diminished by 50%, but the damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the the amount of negligence attributable to the the person who is seeking recovery. \n\nThus, the truck driver's damages after diminution: $10,000 * 5 5 50% = $5 5 000\n- Car driver's damages after diminution: $8,000 * 5 5 50% = $4,000\n\nSince both drivers are equally at fault, the damages should be equally diminished, but the damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the the amount of negligence attributable to the the person who is seeking recovery. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that each driver's damages are diminished by 5 50%, but the damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the the person who is seeking recovery. \n\nThus, the truck driver's damages after diminution: $10,000 * 5 5 50% = $5 000\n- Car driver's damages after diminution: $8,000 * 5 5 50% = $4 000\n\nSince both drivers are equally at fault, the damages should be equally diminished, but the statute also states that the damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the the amount of negligence attributable to the the person who is seeking recovery. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that each driver's damages are diminished by 5 50"
