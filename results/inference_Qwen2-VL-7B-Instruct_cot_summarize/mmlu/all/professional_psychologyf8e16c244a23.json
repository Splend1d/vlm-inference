SKILLS ACQUISITION\u2192 learning relaxation, self-statements, escape routes not necessary with rehearsing them\n\nExplanation: Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) involves both skills training and modification of maladaptive cognitions. The correct definition of \"Skills Acquisition\" in SIT is learning and rehearsing new skills such as relaxation techniques, self-statements, and escape routes. These skills are essential for the therapist to practice and apply in real or imagined situations. Therefore, the statement \"not necessary with rehearsing them\" is incorrect."
