Compared with the measurement before the session, which of the following is most likely to be decreased?\n\nA. Pulse pressure\nB. Stroke volume\nC. Systolic blood pressure\nD.

This is achieved by increasing the heart rate ( (which increases the number of times the heart pumps blood per minute) and the stroke volume ( (which is the amount of blood pumped by the heart with each beat). As a result, the total peripheral resistance ( (which is the resistance to blood flow in the blood vessels) decreases because the blood vessels dilate to allow more blood to flow through them. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Total peripheral resistance."
