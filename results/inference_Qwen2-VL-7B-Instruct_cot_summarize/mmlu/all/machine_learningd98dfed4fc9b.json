Maximizing the likelihood of a logistic regression model indeed yields multiple local optima, which can lead to overfittingtingation if not properly regularized.\n\nStatement 2 is False. While it's true that a naive Bayes classifier can be very effective in certain scenarios, it no classifier can do better than a naive Bayes classifier if the distribution of the data is known, this is not generally true. There are many other classifiers that can perform better under certain conditions, especially when the data distribution is complex or non-linear.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
