It calculates the precision of of n-grams ( which are sequences of n words. Therefore, BLEU does indeed use precision.\n- ROGUE ( (Rouge) is a family of metrics used to evaluate the quality of machine translation. ROGUE uses recall to measure how many relevant words are included in the generated text. Therefore, ROGUE does indeed use recall.\n- Therefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2: Hidden markov models were frequently used to model English sentences.\n- Hidden Markov Models ( (HMMs) are indeed used to model sequences of data, such as sentences in natural language processing. They are particularly useful for tasks like speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and language modeling.\n- Therefore, Statement 2 is True.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
