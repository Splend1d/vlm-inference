Calculate the net cash flow per year:\n   - Annual revenue: $35,000\n   - Annual operating expenses: $7,000\n   - Depreciation expense: $4,000\n\n   Net cash flow per year = = Annual revenue - Annual operating expenses - Depreciation expense\n   Net cash flow per year = = $35,000 - $7,000 - $4,000\n   Net cash flow per year = = $24,000\n\n2. Calculate the total amount paid for the new machine:\n   - Expected payback period = = 5.2 years\n   - Net cash flow per year = $24,000\n\n   Total amount paid for the new machine = = Net cash flow per year * Expected payback period\n   Total amount paid for the new machine = $24,000 * 5.2\n   Total amount paid for the new machine = $124,800\n\nTherefore, the company paid $124,800 for the new machine.
