Calculate the number of molecules in 36.0 grams of water (H_2O.\n2. Determine the number of oxygen molecules in the same number of molecules.\n3. Calculate the mass of oxygen (O_2 that contains the same number of molecules.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of molecules in 36.0 grams of water (H_2O. The molar mass of water (H_2O is approximately 18.015 g/mol.\n\nNumber of moles of water = mass / molar mass\nNumber of moles of water = 36.0 g / 18.015 g/mol\nNumber of moles of water \u2248 2.00 mol\n\nSince water is composed of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom, there are 2 oxygen atoms in each molecule of water. Therefore, the number of oxygen molecules is half the number of water molecules.\n\nNumber of oxygen molecules = Number of water molecules / 2\nNumber of oxygen molecules = 2.00 mol / 2\nNumber of oxygen molecules = 1.00 mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the mass of oxygen (O_2 that contains 1.00 mol of oxygen molecules. The molar mass of oxygen (O_2 is approximately 32.00 g/mol.\n\nMass of oxygen = Number of moles * Molar mass\nMass of oxygen = 1.00 mol * 32.00 g/mol\nMass of oxygen = 32.00 g\n\nTherefore, the quantity of oxygen (O_2 that contains very nearly the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of water H_2O is 32.0 grams.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 32.0 grams."
