Discriminationion in testing can occur if the test unfairly disadvantages certain groups, such as racial minorities, compared to others.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **No one from the group has applied for a position with the organization using the test**: This option is not a valid criterion for determining whether a test discriminates. The absence of applicants from a particular racial group does not provide any information about the test's fairness or validity.\n\nB. **The test manual demonstrates that the test is valid for a wide variety of jobs**: This option indicates that the test has been validated across different job roles. While this is important for ensuring the test's general applicability, it does not directly address whether the test discriminates against a specific racial group.\n\nC. **The test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion**: This option suggests that the test rejects applicants from different racial groups at the same rate. If the test is not biased, it would be expected that the rejection rates would be similar across racial groups. This criterion is a strong indicator that the test does not discriminate against a particular racial group.\n\nD. **It is not feasible to conduct separate validity studies on male and female employees**: This option indicates that it is impractical to conduct separate validity studies for different genders. This does not directly address the issue of racial discrimination in the test.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate criterion for determining whether a selection test does not discriminate against a particular racial group is:\n\n**C. The test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion.**\n\nThis criterion directly addresses the issue of fairness and ensures that the test does not unfairly disadvantage any racial group."
