This is a classic problem of derangements, which is a permutation of a set of objects such that no object appears in its original position.\n\nThe total number of ways to deliver the four packages is $4! = 24$.\n\nThe number of ways to deliver exactly two packages to the correct houses is given by the formula for derangement, which is $D(n) = n! \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} - \\frac{1}{3!} + \\frac{1}{4!}\\right)$, where $n$ is the number of packages.\n\nSo, the number of ways to deliver exactly two packages to the correct houses is $D(4) = 4! \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} - \\frac{1}{3!} + \\frac{1}{4!}\\right) = 24 \\left(1 - 1 + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{24}\\right) = 24 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{24}\\right) = 24 \\left(\\frac{6}{12} - \\frac{2}{12} + \\frac{1}{24}\\right) = 24 \\left(\\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{1}{24}\\right) = 24 \\left(\\frac{"
