It emphasizes the potential for redemption and the equality of all people, regardless of race. This message aligns with the themes of equality and the potential for all people to be redeemed and join the \"angelic train,\" which is a metaphor for salvation and spiritual elevation. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech also also emphasizes the equality and the potential for all people to be treated equally, regardless of race, and to have the same opportunities and rights as others."
