Neighbor, who owns the adjacent property to the East, built a driveway whose western boundary is along the border of homeowner's property. The excavator dug the driveway five feet deep. The land began to subside along the line of excavation and about three feet of homeowner's land fell off into the driveway, making that part of her property useless. Homeowner demanded that neighbor fill in the property to buttress the erosion created. That was not done and the erosion continued to occur. Homeowner sued and asked for an injunction compelling the neighbor to build and maintain a retaining wall. Will the court rule for the plaintiff/homeowner?\n\nA. Yes, because excavation is an abnormally dangerous activity and neighbor is absolutely liable for any damages caused by the violation.\nB. Yes, because every landowner has a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state.\nC. No, because the neighbor did not go onto the adjacent land and confined all excavation to his own land.\nD. No, the right to lateral support is a common law right that has been abrogated by statute in virtually all states so that the right no longer exists.\n"

Yes, because every landowner has a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state.\n\nThe court is likely to rule in favor of the homeowner because the neighbor's excavation has caused a significant and unreasonable interference with the homeowner's property, resulting in a loss of lateral support and stability. The neighbor's excavation has created a hazardous condition that is not consistent with the natural state of the land and has caused the homeowner's property to become unsafe and unusable. The court would likely recognize the homeowner's right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state and order the neighbor to take reasonable steps to restore the stability of the homeowner's property, such as building and maintaining a retaining wall."
