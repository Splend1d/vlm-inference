All of these options.\n\nEach of these points highlights different aspects of why indigenous nuclear programs can make proliferation safeguards obsolete. They emphasize the potential for WMD to offset conventional military inferiority, act as a deterrent, and gain diplomatic influence. They also also acknowledge the potential for terrorists to acquire WMD, despite the difficulty in constructing them. Finally, they point out the varying capabilities and destructive potential of different types of WMD, which can make them highly desirable as political weapons."
