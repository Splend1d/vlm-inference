At the time the contract was signed, the owner orally said to the distributor, \"We do have an understanding that our chef must approve the quality of the heirloom tomatoes before I will pay you. \" The distributor acknowledged the owner's request and responded, \"If you say so. \"Thereafter, the distributor delivered the heirloom tomatoes to the owner. After inspecting the tomatoes, the chef refused to give his approval, because he felt that the tomatoes were not of sufficient quality. As a result, the owner refused to accept and pay for the tomatoes. The distributor brought a breach of contract action against the owner because he refused to pay for the tomatoes. How should the court rule on the owner's offer to prove, over the distributor's objection, that the chef refused to approve the tomatoes that were delivered?\n\nA. The evidence is admissible to show frustration of purpose.\nB. The evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent.\nC.

The evidence is barred, because the written contract appears to be a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement.\n\nThe court should rule that the evidence is barred because the written contract appears to be a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement. In a situation where a written contract is present and appears to be a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement, any oral modifications or conditions precedent must be shown to be inconsistent with the written agreement. In this case, the written contract specifies that the owner will pay for the heirloom tomatoes, and there is no indication that the oral agreement modifying or condition precedent to the written agreement. Therefore, the court should rule that the evidence is barred because it is inconsistent with the written agreement."
