Debt repayments with interest can be greater than the amount of money received.\n\nEconomic aid, often provided by rich countries to developing countries, has faced challenges in promoting modernization. One significant issue is that the amount of money received by developing countries can be outweighed by the interest payments on their existing debts. This means that even if a developing country receives a large sum of aid, a significant portion of it may be used to pay off existing debts, leaving less available for development projects. This can hinder the effectiveness of economic aid in promoting modernization and economic growth."
