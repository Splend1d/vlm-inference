It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following is referenced by the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which option is referenced by the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph, we need to carefully analyze the context provided by Kwame Nkrumah's quote.\n\nThe quote discusses the struggle against neo-colonialism and emphasizes the importance of non-alignment and cooperation with all states, regardless of their economic system ( (capitalist, socialist, or mixed economy). It mentions that non-alignment involves foreign investment from capitalist countries but that this investment must be in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned state with its own interests in mind. The quote also focuses on the issue of power and the need for a state to be master of its own destiny.\n\nGiven this context, the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph is likely referring to the competing ideologies of the Cold War, as this period was characterized by the ideological struggle between capitalism and socialism.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The competing ideologies of the Cold War - This option align with the context of the quote, as the Cold War was a period of ideological competition between capitalist and socialist states.\n\nB. The competing ideologies of World War II - This option does not fit the context of the quote, as World War II was not primarily about ideological competition but rather about military conflict.\n\nC. The competing empires of World War I - This option does not fit the context of the quote, as World War I was primarily about imperial competition and territorial expansion.\n\nD. The competing colonization companies in the Scramble for Africa - This option does not fit the context of the quote, as the Scramble for Africa was primarily about imperial competition and territorial expansion, not ideological competition.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The competing ideologies of the Cold War"
