The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed over successive generations.\n\nEvolution occurs through the process of natural selection, which is a mechanism that leads to changes in allele frequencies within a population over time. For evolution to have occurred, there must be a change in the frequencies of alleles in the gene pool of a population over successive generations. This change can be due to various factors such as mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection."
