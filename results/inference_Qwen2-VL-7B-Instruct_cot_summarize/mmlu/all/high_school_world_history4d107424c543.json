Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia\n"

The slave trade was a significant source of wealth for European powers and contributed to the underdevelopment of African economies by draining resources and labor from Africa.\n\n2. **Option B: The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market**\n   - This option refers to the involvement of Arabian merchants in the slave trade, which was also a significant factor in the exploitation of African labor. However, it does not specifically highlight the role of Western European capitalists.\n\n3. **Option C: The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company**\n   - This option refers to the establishment of a colony by the Dutch, which was part of the broader European colonial expansion. While it shows European involvement, it it does not specifically focus on the role of Western European capitalists.\n\n4. **Option D: The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia**\n   - This option refers to trade between Europe and Ethiopia, which was not a significant part of the broader European colonial expansion and exploitation of Africa. It does not directly support the assertion about Western European capitalists.\n\nGiven the analysis, **Option A** best supports the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment because it directly ties to the exploitation of African labor for economic gain by European powers.\n\n**Final Answer: A. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations**"
