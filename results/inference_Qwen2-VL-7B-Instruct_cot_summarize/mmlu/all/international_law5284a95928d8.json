This principle allows the court to adapt the interpretation of the convention to new circumstances and developments.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Golder v UK (1978** - This case involved the right to a fair trial and the right to legal aid. The court interpreted Article 6 of the ECHR, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, in light of the economic and social conditions of the time. This case is a classic example of the application of the living instrument principle.\n\nB. **A v UK (2009** - This case involved the right to a fair trial and the right to an effective remedy. The court interpreted Article 6 of the ECHR in the context of the internet and the right to a fair trial in the digital age. This case also reflects the application of the living instrument principle.\n\nC. **Goodwin v UK (2002** - This case involved the right to a fair trial and the right to an effective remedy. The court interpreted Article 6 of the ECHR in the context of the internet and the right to a fair trial in the digital age. This case also reflects the application of the living instrument principle.\n\nD. **Osman v UK (1998** - This case involved the right to life and the right to respect for private and family life. The court interpreted Article 2 of the ECHR in the context of the use of firearms by the police. This case also reflects the application of the living instrument principle.\n\nAll of these cases illustrate the 'living instrument principle' used by the ECtHR. However, the most direct example of the principle being applied to interpret Article 6 of the ECHR in the context of the internet and the right to a fair trial in the digital age is **B. A v UK (2009**.\n\nTherefore, the best illustration of the 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights is:\n\n**B. A v UK (2009**"
