The prosecution presented a professor of art history to authenticate each piece. The defense objected on the basis that the museum curator where the paintings were housed had to identify if these were in fact the paintings that were stolen. Assuming that others will testify to the fact of the burglary, is the court likely to reject this witness as being qualified to authenticate the paintings in question, and why or why not?\n\nA. Yes, because art works and other physical evidence must be authenticated by their official custodian.\nB. Yes, because an outside person may be able to partially authenticate the painting but he can't say whether it is the one that was in the museum or that was stolen.\nC. No, granting the objection will simply waste the court's time if the court has to bring in the museum curator and go through hoops to authenticate the paintings.\nD. No, because the authentication can be accomplished in several different ways that will verify that it is the genuine piece of art in question.\n"

The museum curator is in a unique position to identify the paintings based on their familiarity with the original works and their physical presence in the museum. The curator's testimony can be supplemented by other experts, such as the professor of art history, to provide a comprehensive authentication of the paintings. The court may also consider the fact that the paintings have already been recovered and are in the courtroom, which further supports the authenticity of the paintings."
