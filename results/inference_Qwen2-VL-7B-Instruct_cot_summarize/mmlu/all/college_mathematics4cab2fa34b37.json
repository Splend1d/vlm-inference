This is simply the number of ways to choose 2 courses out of 20 for each of the 10 professors, which is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 20 \\) ( (the number of courses) and \\( k = 2 \\) ( (the number of courses each professor will teach). So, the number of ways to assign the professors to the courses without restriction is:\n\n\\[ C(20, 2) = \\frac{{20!}{2!(20-2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2!18!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation does not account for the fact that each professor must teach exactly 2 courses. To do this, we need to consider the number of ways to assign the professors to the courses while respecting the constraint that each professor teaches exactly 2 courses.\n\nGiven that each professor must teach exactly 2 courses, we can think of this as a problem of partitioninging the 20 courses into 10 groups of 2 courses each. This is a classic problem of combinatorics, and the solution involves the concept of \"double counting\" or \"stars and bars\" method, but with a twist due to the specific constraints.\n\nHowever, the provided options do not directly correspond to the correct approach to solve this problem. The correct approach involves understanding that each professor is assigned to 2 courses, and we need to calculate the number of ways to do this without overcounting. \n\nGiven the options, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. The correct approach to solving this problem involves understanding the constraints and applying combinatorial principles correctly, but the provided options do not directly correspond to the correct solution.\n\nGiven the options provided, none of them directly solve the problem as stated. The correct approach would involve calculating the number of ways to assign 2 courses to each of the 10 professors, which is a different calculation from the provided options. \n\nIf the question was intended to ask for the number of ways to assign 2 courses to each of the 10 professors without any restrictions, the correct answer would be \\( 20! / (2^{10} \\), which is option A. However, this does not account for the specific constraint that each professor must teach exactly 2 courses.\n\nGiven the options and the constraints, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided.
