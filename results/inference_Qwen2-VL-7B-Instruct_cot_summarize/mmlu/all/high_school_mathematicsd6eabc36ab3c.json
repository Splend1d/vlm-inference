To do this, we need to understand that an even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 with no remainder. Since we are looking for even numbers less than 91, we can start from 2 ( (the smallest even number) and count up to 90 ( (the largest even number less than 91).\n\nTo find the number of even numbers in this range, we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence:\n\n\\[n = \\frac{{\\text{last term} - \\text{first term}}{\\text{common difference}} + 1\\]\n\nHere, the first term is 2, the last term is 90, and the common difference is 2 ( (since we are counting even numbers, which are 2 units apart).\n\n\\[n = \\frac{90 - 2}{2} + 1 = \\frac{88}{2} + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of even positive integers less than $ab$ ( which is 91, is 45.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 45."
