Gauthier argues that deliberative justification by definition takes account of all relevant considerations.\n\nGauthier's work on deliberative justification focuses on the idea that rational agents should deliberate over the relevant considerations in order to arrive at justified beliefs or actions. He argues that deliberation is a process that involves considering all the relevant factors that bear on a decision or belief. Therefore, if deliberative justification is incomplete, it would mean that deliberation does not take into account all relevant considerations, which contradicts Gauthier's own definition of deliberative justification."
