After telling his employer by phone that he was going for lunch and getting approval, he pulled into the entrance of a restaurant where he intended to have his usual 30- minute lunch break. While entering the parking lot, the driver carelessly ran over and seriously injured a pedestrian. The injured person sued the driver and the driver's employer for negligence in causing her injuries. Is the employer liable?\n\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\nB. Yes, because the employer owned the truck.\nC. No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\nD. No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\n"

No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\n\nThe doctrine of vicarious liability generally holds that an employer is liable for the negligence of an employee acting within the scope of employment. However, in this case, the truck driver was not within the scope of his employment when he ran over and injured the pedestrian. He was on a personal errand (taking a lunch break) rather than performing a task or activity related to his employment. Therefore, the employer is not liable for the driver's negligence in this situation."
