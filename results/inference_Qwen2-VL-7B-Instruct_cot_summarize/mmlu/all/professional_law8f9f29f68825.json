The contract provided that the owner was to pay the employee a salary of $2,000 per month, payable one-half to the employee and one-half to the employee's elderly mother. The contract further stipulated that \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable. \"When the mother learned of this contract, she wrote a letter to the owner stating, \"Kindly pay the amounts due me under your contract with my son directly to the nursing home, where I am presently a patient. \" During the first year of the contract, the owner paid $1,000 per month to the employee and $1,000 per month to the nursing home. After one year, another pizza restaurant opened across the street, creating competition. During the next few months, business steadily declined. As a result of the loss in business, the owner informed the employee that unless he agreed to take a cut in his salary, the employee would be fired. Reluctantly, the employee orally consented to a salary reduction of $500 per month. By the terms of their oral agreement, the owner promised to continue to pay $1,000 to the employee, but to pay only $500 per month to the nursing home. If the nursing home brings suit against the owner for breach of contract, who is most likely to prevail?\n\nA. The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\nB. The owner, because the agreement between the owner and the employee reduced the owner's obligations to the nursing home.\nC. The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\nD. The nursing home, because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n"

The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\n\nThe anti-assignment clause in the contract between the owner and the employee specifically states that the monies due under the contract shall not be assignable. This clause is a clear restriction on the owner's ability to assign the payments to the nursing home. The fact that the owner agreed to pay $500 per month to the nursing home after the oral agreement with the employee does not negate the original anti-assignment clause. The nursing home's assignment to the nursing home would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee, as the original contract terms were clear and specific."
