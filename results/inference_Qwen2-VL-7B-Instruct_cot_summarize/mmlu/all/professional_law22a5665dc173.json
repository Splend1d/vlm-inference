The law also provides that all other public monies used to support public schools in the state come from locally levied real estate taxes. This results in a large disparity in per-student funding among the state's many public school districts because some districts have higher property values per student than other districts. Public school students who claim to be disadvantaged by this school funding law have challenged the law solely on the ground that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?\n\nA. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to vindicate a compelling state interest.\nB. The state must demonstrate that the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\nC. The students must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest.\nD. The students must demonstrate that the law is not substantially related to an important state interest.\n"

The state would need to show that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest, such as ensuring adequate funding for public schools, and that it interest is sufficiently important to justify the disparate funding."
