Skytop evaluates capital projects using discounted cash flows at a cost of capital of 10% per year. Based upon the following table what action should Skytop take regarding acquisition of the machine and why? Future value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $1.464 Present value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $0.683 Future value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $4.641 Present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $3.170 Acquire: Reason:\n\nA. Yes Net cash flow is $20000\nB. Yes Net future value is $36025\nC. No Net present value is ($750)\nD. No Net present value is ($8750)\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether Skytop Co. should acquire the machine, we need to calculate the net present value ((NPV) of the cash inflows and compare it to the cost of the machine. The NPV is calculated as follows:\n\nNPV = Present value of cash inflows - Cost of the machine\n\nThe present value of the cash inflows can be calculated using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:\n\nPV = PMt * (PVIFA(r, n)\n\nWhere:\nPV = Present value\nPmt = Periodic payment\nr = Interest rate\nn = Number of periods\n\nIn this case, the periodic payment is $25,000, the interest rate is 10%, and the number of periods is 4 years. Using the present value of an ordinary annuity table, we can find the factor for 4 years at 10% which is 3.170.\n\nPV = $25,000 * 3.170 = $79,250\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV:\n\nNPV = $79,250 - $80,000 = ($750)\n\nSince the NPV is negative, Skytop Co. should not acquire the machine. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. No Net present value is ($750)"
