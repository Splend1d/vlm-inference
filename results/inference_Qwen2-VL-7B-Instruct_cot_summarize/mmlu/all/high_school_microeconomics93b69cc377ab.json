                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- The Marginal Revenue Product ( (MRPL) is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more unit of labor.\n- The Marginal Revenue Product ( (MRPL) is calculated as the Marginal Revenue ( (MR) multiplied by the Marginal Product ( (MP).\n- The Marginal Revenue ( (MR) is the additional revenue generated by selling one more unit of output.\n- The Marginal Product ( (MP) is the additional output generated by hiring one more unit of labor.\n\nGiven that the MP of the 3rd worker is 10, and the firm sells its products for $3 each, the MRPL for the 3rd worker would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{MRPL} = \\text{MR} \\times \\text{MP} = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\n\nSince the MP of the 3rd worker is 10, and the firm is currently paying $15 for each worker, the MRPL is higher than the wage cost. To maximize profit, the firm should hire more labor until the MRPL equals the wage cost. This is because hiring more labor will increase the total revenue generated by the additional output produced by the extra worker, and the firm will continue to hire more workers as long as the MRPL is greater than the wage cost.\n\nTherefore, the firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease, which means the firm should hire more workers until the MRPL equals the wage cost."
