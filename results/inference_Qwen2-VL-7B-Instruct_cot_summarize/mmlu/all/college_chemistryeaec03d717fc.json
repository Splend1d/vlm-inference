The normal modes of vibration for a linear triatomic molecule include:\n\n1. **Symmetric stretching**: This mode involves the stretching of the molecule along the axis connecting the two oxygen atoms. This mode is infrared-active because it involves a change in the dipole moment of the molecule.\n\n2. **Asymmetric stretching**: This mode involves the stretching of the molecule along an axis that is not the axis connecting the two oxygen atoms. This mode is also infrared-active because it involves a change in the dipole moment of the molecule.\n\n3. **Bendinging**: This mode involves the bending of the molecule around the carbon atom. This mode is not infrared-active because it does not involve a change in the dipole moment of the molecule.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nB. II only"
