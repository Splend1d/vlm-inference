Give drugs regularly with provision for additional 'as required' pain relief for breakthrough pain.\n\nThis approach is generally considered to be the best approach to the use of analgesic drugs following surgery. Regular administration of pain medication helps to prevent the development of pain, while the provision for additional 'as required' pain relief allows for the treatment of breakthrough pain that may occur despite regular medication. This approach helps to ensure that patients are adequately pain-free and reduces the risk of developing pain tolerance or dependence on pain medication."
