They place greater emphasis on ideology and beliefs\n\nDuring the Cold War, ideational approaches to US foreign policy emphasized the role of ideology and beliefs in shaping foreign policy decisions. This perspective argued that the ideological differences between the United States and the Soviet Union were the primary drivers of their conflict and competition. In contrast, Realist accounts of the Cold War focused more on material interests and power, emphasizing the role of economic factors, geopolitics, and the balance of power in shaping foreign policy decisions."
