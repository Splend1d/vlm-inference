In the early female embryo, one copy of the X chromosome becomes inactivated in every body cell.\n- This statement is correct. In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in most cells, a process known as X-inactivation or Lyonization.\n\nB. The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated.\n- This statement is incorrect. In normal females, both X chromosomes are active in most cells. Only one X chromosome is inactivated in each cell, not both.\n\nC. A male with the XXY genotype will have one Barr body.\n- This statement is correct. In males with an XXY genotype, one of the X chromosomes is inactivated, resulting in one Barr body.\n\nD. Barr bodies consist of highly methylated DNA.\n- This statement is correct. Barr bodies are formed by the inactivation of one of the X chromosomes, which involves the methylation of DNA.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct about Barr bodies is:\n\nB. The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated."
