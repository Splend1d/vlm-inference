America's increased prominence in international affairs: This is a valid reason as the United States has become a global superpower, and the president's role in international relations has become more significant.\n\n II. Continually improve public confidence in the federal government: While public confidence in the federal government might have improved, it is not specific to the presidency and does not directly explain the growth in presidential power and prestige.\n\n III. The New Deal and other programs that have expanded federal responsibility: The New Deal and other programs did indeed expand federal responsibility, but this is more about the growth of federal power rather than specifically the presidency.\n\n IV. The president's increased visibility, due to the development of mass media: The development of mass media has certainly increased the visibility of the president, making the presidency more prominent and influential.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. I and IV only"
