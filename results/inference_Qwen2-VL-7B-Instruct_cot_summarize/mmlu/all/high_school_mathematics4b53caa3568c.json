The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5.\n2. The product of these three primes is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n\nNow, we square this product to get the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors:\n\n\\[30^2 = 900\\]\n\nTherefore, the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors is 900.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 900."
