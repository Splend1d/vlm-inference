The patient reports no new symptoms except for shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise that began 3 months ago when he tried to increase the distance of his daily walk from 1 mile to 3 miles. He has not had orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest pain. Additional medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18 years, but it did not prevent him from serving in the military. Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 60/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 124/61 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a normal S1, pronounced S2, and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border. Pulses are normal in contour. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Decrease the dose of metoprolol\nB. Increase the dose of prednisone\nC. Obtain serum vitamin D concentration\nD. Order a transthoracic echocardiography\n"

Order a transthoracic echocardiography\n\nThe patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise, along with the history of coronary artery disease and the presence of a heart murmur, suggest the possibility of heart failure or other cardiac issues. A transthoracic echocardiography would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate the patient's heart function, assess for any structural abnormalities, and determine the extent of any cardiac dysfunction. This would help guide further management and treatment decisions."
