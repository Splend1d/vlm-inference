But we do not have the right to resort to violence\u2014or the threat of violence\u2014when we don't get our way. Our founders constructed a system of government so that reason could prevail over fear. Oklahoma City proved once again that without the law there is no freedom. Criticism is part of the lifeblood of democracy. No one is right all the time. But we should remember that there is a big difference between criticizing a policy or a politician and demonizing the government that guarantees our freedoms and the public servants who enforce our laws.\"\nPresident Bill Clinton, \"What We Learned in Oklahoma City,\" 2010\n(Written on the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing)\n\"If there would not have been a Waco, I would have put down roots somewhere and not been so unsettled with the fact that my government\u2026was a threat to me. Everything that Waco implies was on the forefront of my thoughts. That sort of guided my path for the next couple of years.\"\nTimothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City bomber, 2001\nU.S. Representative John Conyers, Events Surrounding the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff in Waco, Texas: Hearing Before the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, 1993\nThe above excerpts most closely support which of the following inferences?\n\nA. In the 1990s, anti-government sentiment, in response to excessive uses of federal power to resolve domestic conflicts, inspired militia groups and lone vigilantes, such as Timothy McVeigh.\nB. In 1993 Attorney General Janet Reno launched an offensive against the Branch Davidian cult led by Timothy McVeigh, later drawing criticism from Congress for her heavy-handed approach.\nC. Fearing a rise in anti-government sentiment after the Oklahoma City bombing, Attorney General Janet Reno sent troops to quell the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff, and later faced congressional criticism.\nD. Attorney General Janet Reno resigned from office in part due to Congressional pressure put on President Clinton by Representative John Conyers.\n"

The excerpts do not provide specific details about the anti-government sentiment or the influence of Waco on McVeigh's actions, but rather focus on the broader context of government and law enforcement.\n\nB. **In 1993 Attorney General Janet Reno launched an offensive against the Branch Davidian cult led by Timothy McVeigh, later drawing criticism from Congress for her heavy-handed approach.**\n   - This the statement by McVeigh about Waco and the subsequent events, this option aligns well with the information provided.
