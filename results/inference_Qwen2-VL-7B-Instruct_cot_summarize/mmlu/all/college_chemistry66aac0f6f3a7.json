Electron affinity is the energy change when an electron is added to an isolated gaseous atom or ion to form a negative ion. It is typically measured in electron volts ( (eV).\n\nElectron affinity generally increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases from top to bottom in a group. This is because:\n\n1. Across a period, the nuclear charge increases, pulling the valence electrons closer and making it easier to add an electron.\n2. Down a group, the atomic radius increases, making it harder to add an electron.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. F ( Fluorine\nB. Si ( Silicon\nC. O  Oxygen\nD. Ca  Calcium\n\nFluorine ( F is the most electronegative element in the periodic table, and it has the highest electron affinity. Silicon ( Si is a metalloid, and it has a lower electron affinity than the other elements listed. Oxygen ( O is more electronegative than calcium, but calcium is a metal, and it has a lower electron affinity than oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the atom with the lowest electron affinity is:\n\nD. Ca ( Calcium"
