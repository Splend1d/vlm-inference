A slash-and-b-burn agricultural society\n\nA slash-and-b-burn agricultural society is most likely to experience population pressure because this type of farming method is highly destructive to the environment. It involves cutting down trees, burning the forest, and then farming the land. This method depletes the soil of nutrients and leads to soil erosion, making it difficult for the land to support future crops. As a result, slash-and-burn societies often have to move to new areas to continue farming, which can lead to overpopulation in the new areas and further environmental degradation."
