                    "text": "To determine which of the properties of the two gases are correctly compared, we need to consider the principles of thermodynamics and the behavior of gases under thermal equilibrium.\n\n1. **Average Kinetic Energy of the Gases:**\n   - The average kinetic energy of a gas is given by the equation \\( \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\), where \\( o \\) is the mass of a molecule and \\( v \\) is the velocity of the molecule.\n   - Since both hydrogen (H\u2082) and nitrogen (N\u2082) are diatomic gases, they have the same number of atoms per molecule. However, hydrogen has a lower molecular mass (1 u compared to nitrogen (14 u).\n   - Therefore, the average kinetic energy of hydrogen gas will be greater than that of nitrogen gas because the lower mass of hydrogen molecules results in higher velocities.\n\n2. **Average Force Exerted on the Container by the Gases:**\n   - The average force exerted on the container by the gas is given by the equation \\( \\frac{P \\cdot V}{M} \\), where \\( P \\) is the pressure, \\( V \\) is the volume, and \\( M \\) is the molecular mass.\n   - Since the containers are identical and the volumes are the same, the force exerted on the container will depend on the pressure and the molecular mass.\n   - Since hydrogen has a lower molecular mass, the force exerted on the container by hydrogen gas will be greater than that of nitrogen gas.\n\n3. **Density of the Gases:**\n   - Density is given by the equation \\( \\rho = \\frac{M \\cdot N}{V} \\), where \\( M \\) is the molecular mass, \\( N \\) is the number of molecules, and \\( V \\) is the volume.\n   - Since the containers are identical and the volumes are the same, the density will depend on the molecular mass and the number of molecules.\n   - Since hydrogen has a lower molecular mass, the density of hydrogen gas will be greater than that of nitrogen gas.\n\n4. **Pressures of the Gases:**\n   - The pressure of a gas is given by the equation \\( P = \\frac{P \\cdot V}{M} \\), where \\( P \\) is the pressure, \\( V \\) is the volume, and \\( M \\) is the molecular mass.\n   - Since the containers are identical and the volumes are the same, the pressure will depend on the molecular mass.\n   - Since hydrogen has a lower molecular mass, the pressure of hydrogen gas will be greater than that of nitrogen gas.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.**"
