The sentence states that Dylan does not like math and does not like science.\n\n1. **Understanding the sentence**: \"Dylan likes neither math nor science\" means Dylan dislikes both math and science. In logical terms, this can be expressed as the negation of the disjunction of liking math and liking science.\n\n2. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - **Option A**: \\( M \u2228 S \\) - This represents Dylan liking math or liking science. This is not what the sentence says.\n   - **Option B**: \\( ~(M \u2022 S) \\) - This represents the negation of the conjunction of liking math and liking science. This is not what the sentence says.\n   - **Option C**: \\( ~(M \u2228 S) \\) - This represents the negation of the disjunction of liking math and liking science. This is what the sentence says.\n   - **Option D**: \\( ~M \u2228 ~s \\) - This represents the negation of liking math or the negation of liking science. This is not what the sentence says.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The best symbolization of the sentence \"Dylan likes neither math nor science\" is given by option C: \\( ~(M \u2228 s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. ~(M \u2228 S)**."
