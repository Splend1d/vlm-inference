Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890: This act was specifically designed to regulate the increasing wealth and power of industrialists by prohibiting anti-competitive practices and mergers activities that could lead to monopolies.\n\nB. Interstate Commerce Act 1887: This act was designed to regulate the railroads and other forms of interstate commerce, ensuring fair competition and preventing monopolistic practices.\n\nC. Federal Trade Commission Act 1914: This act was designed to regulate unfair trade practices and promote fair competition, which includes the regulation of industrialists's wealth and power.\n\nD. Newlands Reclamation Act 1902: This act was focused on the reclamation of arid lands in the western United States for agriculture and other uses. It was not designed to regulate the wealth and power of industrialists.\n\nTherefore, the option that was NOT designed to empower the government to regulate the increasing wealth and power of the industrialist is:\n\nD. Newlands Reclamation Act 1902."
