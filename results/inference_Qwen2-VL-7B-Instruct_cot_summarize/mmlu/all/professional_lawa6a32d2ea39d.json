The tutor sent the law student a copy of the tutor's standard tutorial agreement. The agreement stated that the tutor's rate was $50 per one-hour session. The law student then telephoned the tutor and said, \"This agreement looks fine to me. I'd like you to give me 10 sessions over the next 10 days. \" The tutor replied, That will be fine. Fill in 10 sessions on the agreement, sign it, and bring it to me tomorrow when we have our first session. \" The student then said, \"I want you to really push me to do my best. In fact, if I get an A in any class I'll pay you an additional $100 for each A. \"The next day, the law student brought the signed agreement to the tutorial session. The tutor conducted all 10 sessions. Two weeks later, when the results of the finals were released, the law student excitedly called the tutor and exclaimed, \"Thank you so much I just found out that I received two A's and two B's in my classes!\" The tutor then sent the law student a bill for $700. Two days later the tutor received a check from the law student in the amount of $500. Included with the check was a note which read, \"You taught me contract law very well. I now know that I am not obligated to pay you the additional $200 for the A's, because that was just a gratuitous promise. \" On the back of the check the law student typed the following:\"Endorsement of this check by payee constitutes surrender of all claims against me arising out of our tutorial arrangement. \"In need of money, the tutor endorsed and cashed the check. What is the probable legal effect of the tutor's endorsement of the check?\n\nA. It constituted a discharge of a liquidated claim.\nB. It constituted an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim.\nC. Part payment of a liquidated claim would not constitute a discharge of the entire amount due.\nD. Part payment of an unliquidated claim does not constitute sufficient consideration for the discharge of the entire claim.\n"

It constituted an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the law student and the tutor had an agreement for tutoring services, and the student agreed to pay an additional $100 for each A grade received. This additional payment was not a fixed amount (it was contingent on the student receiving A grades. Therefore, it was an unliquidated claim because the exact amount owed was not certain until the grades were known.\n\nWhen the student received two A grades and two B grades, the tutor was owed $200 in additional payments. The student then paid $500, which was less than the $200 owed. The student's note indicated that the payment was in lieu of the additional $200 for the A grades, which is an agreement to settle the claim for less than the full amount due.\n\nThe tutor endorsed and casheded the check, which is a formal acceptance of the payment as full satisfaction of the claim. This that the payment was in lieu of the additional $200 for the A grades, which is an agreement to settle the claim for less than the full amount due.\n\nTherefore, the tutor's endorsement of the check constitutes an accord and satisfaction of the unliquidated claim for the additional $200."
