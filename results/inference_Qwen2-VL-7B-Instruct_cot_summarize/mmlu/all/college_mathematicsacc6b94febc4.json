If \\( s(k) \\) is true, then \\( s(k + 1) \\) must also be true.\n3. There exists some positive integer \\( n_0 \\) such that \\( s(n_0) \\) is not true.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's examine each option:\n\nA. \\( s(n_0 + 1) \\) is not true.\n- This option suggests that \\( s(n_0 + 1) \\) is false. However, since \\( s(n_0) \\) is false, and \\( s(n) \\) must be true if \\( s(k) \\) is true, it \\( s(n_0 + 1) \\) must be true. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.\n\nB. \\( s(n_0 - 1) \\) is not true.\n- This option suggests that \\( s(n_0 - 1) \\) is false. However, since \\( s(n_0) \\) is false, and \\( s(n) \\) must be true if \\( s(k) \\) is true, it \\( s(n_0 - 1) \\) must be true. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.\n\nC. \\( s(n) \\) is not true for any \\( n \\le n_0 \\).\n- This option suggests that \\( s(n) \\) is false for all \\( n \\) less than or equal to \\( n_0 \\). Since \\( s(n_0) \\) is false, and \\( s(n) \\) must be true if \\( s(k) \\) is true, it \\( s(n) \\) must be true for all \\( n \\) less than \\( n_0 \\). Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.\n\nD. \\( s(n) \\) is not true for any \\( n \\geq n_0 \\).\n- This This option suggests that \\( s(n) \\) is false for all \\( n \\) greater than or equal to \\( n_0 \\). Since \\( s(n_0) \\) is false, and \\( s(n) \\) must be true if \\( s(k) \\) is true, it \\( s(n) \\) must be false for all \\( n \\) greater than or equal to \\( n_0 \\).
