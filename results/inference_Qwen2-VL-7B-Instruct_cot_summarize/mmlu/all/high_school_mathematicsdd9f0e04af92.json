                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of selecting two marbles of the same color ( either both red or both blue.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of selecting two red marbles:\n\nThe probability of selecting a red marble on the first draw is 4/10 ( since there are 4 red marbles out of a total of 10 marbles. Since the marble is not replaced, the probability of selecting another red marble on the second draw is 3/9 ( since there are now 3 red marbles left out of a total of 9 marbles. So, the probability of selecting two red marbles is:\n\n(4/10) * ( (3/9) = 12/90 = 1/7.5\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of selecting two blue marbles:\n\nThe probability of selecting a blue marble on the first draw is 6/10 since there are 6 blue marbles out of a total of 10 marbles. Since the marble is not replaced, the probability of selecting another blue marble on the second draw is 5/9 since there are now 5 blue marbles left out of a total of 9 marbles. So, the probability of selecting two blue marbles is:\n\n(6/10) * ( (5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3\n\nFinally, we add the probabilities of selecting two red marbles and two blue marbles to get the total probability of selecting two marbles of the same color:\n\n1/7.5 + 1/3 = 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles are the same color is 7/15, which corresponds to option D."
