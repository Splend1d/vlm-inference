When faced with a difficult decision, people are more likely to follow the opinions of the crowd than to diverge from those opinions.\nB. When challenged to commit a crime, people will most often refuse if they are not coerced, but will agree if an authority figure coerces them.\nC. When asked to inflict pain on others, people are likely to inflict mild amounts of pain without remorse.\nD. When an authority figure is present, people are more likely to obey orders than to question the wisdom of the orders.\n"
