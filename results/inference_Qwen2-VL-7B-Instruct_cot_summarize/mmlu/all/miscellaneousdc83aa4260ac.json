So, 81 squared is \\(81 \\times 81\\).\n\n\\[81^2 = 81 \\times 81 = 6561\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 6561. The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, we are looking for a number that, when squared, equals 6561.\n\nLet's calculate the square root of 6561:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{6561} \\approx 81\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 81"
