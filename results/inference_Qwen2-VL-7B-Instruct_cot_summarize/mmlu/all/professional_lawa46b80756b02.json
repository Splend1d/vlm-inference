The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. The validity of this treaty would most likely be upheld under which of the following principles?\n\nA. The presidential power to conduct foreign affairs.\nB. An ancillary power of the President under his treaty-making power.\nC. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.\nD. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by a majority in Congress.\n"

The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the President has the power to negotiate treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate. This means that treaties must be ratified by the Senate, typically by a two-thirds majority, before they become legally binding. This process ensures that treaties are subject to the scrutiny and approval of the legislative branch, which is responsible for representingational oversight and ensuring that treaties are in the best interests of the nation."
