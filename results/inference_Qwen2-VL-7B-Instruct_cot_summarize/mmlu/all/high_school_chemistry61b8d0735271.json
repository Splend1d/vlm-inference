                    "text": "To determine what will be left in measurable amounts in the reaction vessel, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the reaction between rubidium (Rb) and bromine (Br2). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rb} + \\text{Br}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{RbBr} \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of rubidium reacts with 1 mole of bromine to produce 1 mole of rubidium bromide (RbBr). \n\nGiven that we have 1.0 g of rubidium and 1.0 g of bromine, we can calculate the number of moles of each reactant:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of Rb} = \\frac{\\text{Mass of Rb}}{\\text{Molar mass of Rb}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of Br}_2 = \\frac{\\text{Mass of Br}_2}{\\text{Molar mass of Br}_2} \\]\n\nThe molar masses of rubidium (Rb) and bromine (Br2) are approximately 85.5 g/mol and 79.9 g/mol, respectively. \n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of Rb} = \\frac{1.0 \\text{ g}}{85.5 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 0.0117 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of Br}_2 = \\frac{1.0 \\text{ g}}{79.9 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 0.0126 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the limiting reactant will be the one that is present in the lesser amount. In this case, rubidium (Rb) is the limiting reactant because it has fewer moles (0.0117 mol) compared to bromine (Br2) (0.0126 mol).\n\nTherefore, all of the rubidium will react with some of the bromine to form rubidium bromide (RbBr). However, since bromine is in excess, some of it will remain unreacted.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. RbBr and Br2 only"
