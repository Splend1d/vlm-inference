At any time the French capital affords rare advantages to the anthropologist. The Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, the anthropometric operations of Bertillon in the Palais de Justice, the courses of lectures in the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, the collections in the Jardin de Plantes, the facilities for original work in the \u00e9coles de Medicine, and the hospitals give to the comparative anatomist and biologist abundant employment.\"\nOtis T.

The passage discusses the opportunities for studying the natural history of man in Paris during the Exposition of 1889, emphasizing the advantages for anthropologists due to various institutions and events.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. Scientific societies needed new ways of attracting members who were less interested in the study of the natural world.\n- This option does not directly relate to the passage's focus on the opportunities for studying the natural history of man.\n\nB. There arose a sudden interest in expanding human rights throughout the French colonies.\n- While this might be a related topic, the passage does not specifically mention human rights or the expansion of French colonies.\n\nC. Scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe.\n- This option align with the passage's emphasis on the opportunities for studying the natural history of man, which is a result of the expansion of European dominance and the resulting interest in anthropology.\n\nD. A large influx of immigrants from Africa and Asia arrived in Europe.\n- This option is not directly related to the passage's focus on the opportunities for studying the natural history of man.\n\nGiven the analysis, the field primarily described in the passage is related to the application of scientific principles to other cultures due to the expansion of European dominance.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC. scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe."
