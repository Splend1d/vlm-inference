However, when $y = 0$, the equation becomes undefined because it would imply $x = \\frac{0 - 1}{0}$, which is undefined. Therefore, $y$ cannot be $0$.\n\nSince $y$ can be any real number except $0$, the range of $f(x)$ is all real numbers except $0$. This corresponds to the interval $(-\\infty,0) \\cup (0,\\infty)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. (-\\infty,0)\\cup(0,\\ininfinity)"
