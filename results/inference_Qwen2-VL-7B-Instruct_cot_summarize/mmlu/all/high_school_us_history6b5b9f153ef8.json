The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

                    "text": "To determine which political position the language of \"protest\" used by John C. Calhoun in his \"Exposition and Protest\" is similar to, we need to analyze the context and core of his argument. Calhoun's argument centers around the division of powers between the General and State Governments and the right of the States to judge and correct infractions of their powers. He argues that the States' right to judge such infractions is an essential attribute of sovereignty and that denying them this right would be akin to reducing them to a subordinate condition.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The response of supporters of Andrew Jackson to the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824.\n- This the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824, Andrew Jackson's supporters were protesting against the alleged unfairness of the election process. This protest was more about the electoral process and the legitimacy of the election rather than the division of powers between the General and State Governments.\n\nB. The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812.\n- The New England Federalists were more concerned with the economic impact of the War of 1812 and the potential for the federal government to overreach its powers. This protest was more about economic issues and the balance of power between the federal and state governments.\n\nC. The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the \"Barbary pirates.\"\n- The Jefferson administration's response to the \"Barbary pirates\" was more about foreign policy and the need for the federal government to assert its authority over the nation's maritime interests. This protest was more about foreign relations and maritime security.\n\nD. The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s.\n- Daniel Shays's protest was against the Massachusetts legislature's fiscal policies, particularly the tax increases and the use of force to collect taxes. This protest was more about fiscal policies and the use of force by the state government.\n\nGiven the context of Calhoun's argument, which focuses on the division of powers and the right of the States to judge infractions of their powers, the most relevant political position is:\n\nD. The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s.\n\nDaniel Shays's protest was against the Massachusetts legislature's fiscal policies, particularly the tax increases and the use of force to collect taxes. This protest was more about fiscal policies and the use of force by the state government, which aligns with Calhoun's argument about the division of powers and the right of the States to judge infractions of their powers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s."
