A political group got a proposition on the ballot, and a majority of the people voted to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry. The proposition did not affect any of the other rights that same-sex couples may have possessed from existing state law. Persons affected sued the state government for unconstitutionally taking away the rights that they had and doing it for no legitimate purpose, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Will the court grant the requests of the lawsuit and declare the proposition void and reinstate the rights of same-sex couples to marry?\n\nA. Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.\nB. Yes, because under the Fourth Amendment it would be an illegal interference against the right of privacy guaranteed to everyone.\nC. No, because the people voted to take a provision out of the existing constitution and when that is done by public vote it cannot be altered.\nD. No, because the ballot proposition was properly placed on the ballot and all statutory procedures were followed, thus precluding the courts from taking adverse action.\n"

This conclusion is based on the following reasoning:\n\nA. Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.\n- The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals from government actions that deprive them of \"life, liberty, or property\" without due process of law. In the context of same-sex marriage, the Supreme Court has already established that the right to marry is a fundamental right that is protected by the Due Process Clause. Therefore, a state cannot constitutionally deny same-sex couples the right to marry without a compelling state interest.\n\nB. Yes, because under the Fourth Amendment it would be an illegal interference against the right of privacy guaranteed to everyone.\n- The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. While the right to privacy is a significant consideration in the context of same-sex marriage, the Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled that the right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment is a fundamental right that is protected by the Due Process Clause. Therefore, this option is less likely to be the basis for the court's decision.\n\nC. No, because the people voted to take a provision out of the existing constitution and when that is done by public vote it cannot be altered.\n- While the proposition was placed on the ballot and the people voted to eliminate the right to same-sex marriage, the court would likely consider the constitutional implications of this action. The court would not simply defer to the popular vote but would examine whether the state's action was consistent with the Constitution.\n\nD. No, because the ballot proposition was properly placed on the ballot and all statutory procedures were followed, thus precluding the courts from taking adverse action.\n- While the proposition was placed on the ballot and followed proper statutory procedures, the court would still need to determine whether the state's action was consistent with the Constitution. The court would not simply defer to the procedural correctness of the ballot process but would examine the constitutional implications of the state's action.\n\nGiven the established precedent that the right to marry is a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause, the court is likely to find that the state's action of was unconstitutional and grant the requests of the lawsuit. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry."
