Lower the discount rate risking inflation\n\nAs the chair of the central bank, you would likely choose to lower the discount rate to reduce the \"crowding-out\" effect. Loweringing the discount rate would make it cheaper for banks to borrow money from the central bank, which would increase the supply of money in the economy and potentially stimulate economic growth. However, this could also also lead to inflation if the increase in money supply is not matched by an increase in production."
