The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861, we need to analyze the context and the specific actions taken by Lincoln that might have led to their opposition.\n\n1. **Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.**\n   - This action was taken in 1863, well after the election of 1861. The Emancipation Proclamation was a significant step in the abolition of slavery, but it was not the primary reason for Radical Republicans' opposition in 1861.\n\n2. **The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.**\n   - This statement is more relevant to the period after the election of 1861, as it reflects the Radical Republicans' desire for immediate action on slavery, which was not a primary concern in 1861.\n\n3. **Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.**\n   - The Ten Percent Plan was a Reconstruction policy implemented by Lincoln in 1863, which aimed to restore the Union by allowing states to be readmitted to the Union if a certain percentage of their voters swore allegiance to the Union. This plan was not the primary reason for Radical Republicans' opposition in 1861.\n\n4. **Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate.**\n   - This statement is relevant to the period after the election of 1861, as it reflects the conflict between Lincoln's Reconstruction policies and the Radical Republicans' views on Reconstruction.\n\nGiven the context and the timeline, the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861 is:\n\n**D. Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate.**\n\nThis statement aligns with the period after the election of 1861, when the conflict between Lincoln's Reconstruction policies and the Radical Republicans' views on Reconstruction was more relevant."
