                    "text": "The problem presented involves understanding an objection to care ethics and how Collins responds to it. Care ethics is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of caring relationships and the responsibilities that come with them. The objection to care ethics is that it seems to imply that our attitudes are under our voluntary control, which may not always be the case.\n\nLet's analyze each option in the context of the objection and Collins's response:\n\nA. **Caring attitudes are not moral attitudes at all.**\n   - This option suggests that caring attitudes are not moral at all, which is not a direct response to the objection about voluntary control. It does not address the issue of whether attitudes can be voluntarily controlled or not.\n\nB. **We can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly.**\n   - This option suggests that attitudes of care can be brought about indirectly, which implies that even if they seem not to be under voluntary control, they can still be influenced or brought about through other means. This directly addresses the objection by suggesting a way to control or influence these attitudes.\n\nC. **When we fail to have attitudes of care this means that no caring attitudes were required of us towards some person.**\n   - This option suggests that failing to have attitudes of care means no caring attitudes were required, which is not a direct response to the objection about voluntary control. It does not address the issue of whether attitudes can be voluntarily controlled or not.\n\nD. **Collins agrees with the objection.**\n   - This option suggests that Collins agrees with the objection, which is not consistent with the response provided. Collins's response is aimed at addressing the objection, not agreeing with it.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate response to the objection that attitudes are not under voluntary control is:\n\n**B. We can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the objection by suggesting a way to control or influence these attitudes, thereby responding to the concern about voluntary control."
