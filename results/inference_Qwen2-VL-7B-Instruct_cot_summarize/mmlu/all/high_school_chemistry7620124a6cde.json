Since we have 0.1665 moles of HClO in 500 mL ( or 0.5 L of solution, the concentration of HClO is:\n\n[HClO] = 0.1665 mol / 0.5 L = 0.333 M\n\nSince HClO is a weak acid, we can assume that the concentration of ClO- is negligible compared to the concentration of HClO. Therefore, we can approximate [ClO-] as 0.\n\nNow we can calculate the pH:\n\npH = pKa + log([ClO-]/[HClO])\npH = -log(3.0 \u00d7 10^-4) + log(0/0.333)\npH = 4 - log(0.333)\npH \u2248 4 - (-0.522)\npH \u2248 4.522\n\nThe closest answer to this value is:\n\nD. 1.76"
