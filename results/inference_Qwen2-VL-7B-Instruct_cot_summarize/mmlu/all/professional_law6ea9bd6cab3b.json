Section 22 of the city's reform act of 2010, which is to become effective on January 1, 2010, provides: \"Any parent or guardian financially responsible for the education of his ward may claim a direct tax credit against his income tax liability equal to the amount of tuition of a child or children of high school age who does not attend a public high school. \" Other provisions define \"tuition\" very broadly but limit the credit to tuition paid to schools meeting the educational requirements as determined by the state. On December 1, 2009, the parents of two students who attend a public high school in the state sue for a declaratory judgment and injunction in federal court, claiming that Section 22 violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment. The federal court will most likely\n\nA. dismiss the action, because the suit involves a political question.\nB. dismiss the action, because the plaintiffs lack standing as taxpayers.\nC. dismiss the action, because the issues are not ripe.\nD. dismiss the action, because the issues being litigated are moot.\n"

The reform act of 2010, which includes Section 22, is set to become effective on January 1, 2010. Since the lawsuit was filed on December 1, 2009, the tax credit has not yet been implemented, and therefore the court cannot determine whether the tax credit violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment."
