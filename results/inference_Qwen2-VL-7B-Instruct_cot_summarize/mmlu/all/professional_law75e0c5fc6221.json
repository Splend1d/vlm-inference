On appeal, he had a de novo trial before a county trial court. He presented medical testimony diagnosing the disease of alcoholism, which was marked by a nearly uncontrollable urge to drink. The defense claimed that a person could not be convicted for suffering from a disease process. The state simply argued that the man had no defense to what he did. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the man's appeal after his conviction. Will the Court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because it is unconstitutional to punish someone for the status of being an alcoholic or a drug addict.\nB. Yes, because when a person acts under a compulsion that is part of a medical disease, this negates criminal intent.\nC. No, because the man was sane and knew the difference between right and wrong when he was sober.\nD. No, because he was convicted not for being a chronic alcoholic but for the actions of being in public while drunk.\n"

The defense presented medical testimony that the man suffered from alcoholism, which is characterized by a nearly uncontrollable urge to drink. If the Court accepts this medical testimony, it would find that the man's actions were not voluntary but rather compelled by a medical condition. This negates the requirement of mens rea, which is necessary for a conviction under a criminal statute.\n\n**Option A: Yes, because it is unconstitutional to punish someone for the status of being an alcoholic or a drug addict.**\n\nWhile this might be a valid argument, it is not directly supported by the facts provided. The case does not explicitly address the constitutionality of the statute itself but rather the application of the statute to the defendant's situation.\n\n**Option C: No, because the man was sane and knew the difference between right and wrong when he was sober.**\n\nThis option is less likely because it assumes that the man's actions were voluntary, which is contradicted by the medical testimony presented by the defense.\n\n**Option D: No, because he was convicted not for being a chronic alcoholic but for the actions of being in public while drunk.**\n\nThis option is also less likely because it it does not address the core issue of mens rea and the compulsion caused by the medical condition.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\n**B. Yes, because when a person acts under a compulsion that is part of a medical disease, this negates criminal intent.**"
