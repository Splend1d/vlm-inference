This is likely due to cultural and dietary preferences, as well as the availability of alternative food sources. For example, Scotland has a strong tradition of seafood, while Wales has a strong tradition of dairy products. Additionally, the availability of fresh produce in these regions may be limited, leading to lower consumption of fruits and vegetables."
