The jury returned a verdict for the truck driver, and the court entered judgment. The motorcyclist then sued the company that employed the driver and owned the truck in federal court for personal-injury damages, and the company moved to dismiss based on the state-court judgment. If the court grants the company's motion, what is the likely explanation?\n\nA. Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\nB. Issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) establishes the company's lack of negligence.\nC. The motorcyclist violated the doctrine of election of remedies.\nD. The state-court judgment is the law of the case.\n"

Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\n\nClaim preclusion, also known as res judicata, prevents a party from relitigating the same claim that has already been decided by a court. If the motorcyclist has already sued the truck driver in state court and the jury returned a verdict for the truck driver, the motorcyclist cannot sue the same claim against the company in federal court. The state court's decision on the truck driver's liability is binding and precludes the motorcyclist from pursuing the same claim against the company."
