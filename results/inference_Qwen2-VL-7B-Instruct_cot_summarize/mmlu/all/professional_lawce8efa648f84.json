While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that \"she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up, because there are problems with the floor.\" After falling and breaking a leg due to a loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that: \"The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.' \". Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?\n\nA. Yes, because it is as an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.\nB. Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.\nC. No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.\nD. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n"

No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n\nThe building owner's statement is likely to be held inadmissible because it is hearsay within hearsay. Hearsay is a statement made out of court that is offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the building owner's statement is a statement of what the janitor told the dance student, which itself is a statement made out of court. Since the janitor's statement is also a statement made out of court, it is itself hearsay. There are no exceptions to the hearsay rule that would allow the building owner's statement to be admitted as evidence."
