When viruses carry bacterial DNA from one cell to another, it can lead to new combinations of genes sequences, which can then be passed on to subsequent generations. This genetic variation can be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral, and can contribute to the evolution of new traits or adaptations in the bacterial population."
