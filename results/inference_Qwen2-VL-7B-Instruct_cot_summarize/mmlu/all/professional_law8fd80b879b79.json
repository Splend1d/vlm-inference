The pedestrian sued the occupants of all the rooms from which the chair might have been thrown. At trial, the pedestrian has been unable to offer any evidence as to the exact room from which the chair was thrown. The defendants have filed a motion for a directed verdict. Should the court grant the motion?\n\nA. No, because it is unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which of the defendants caused the harm.\nB. No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\nC. Yes, because a plaintiff always has the burden to prove that a particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause of the plaintiff's physical harm.\nD. Yes, because the pedestrian has failed to offer evidence that the defendants jointly engaged in tortious conduct.\n"

No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\n\nThe doctrine of alternative liability, also known as the doctrine of respondeat superior, holds that an employer is liable for the torts committed by its employees acting within the scope of their employment. In this case, the defendants ( the occupants of the hotel rooms from which the chair might have been thrown - are likely to be considered as agents or employees of the hotel. Therefore, the hotel would be liable for the injuries caused by the thrown chair, regardless of which specific room the chair was thrown from. The plaintiff does not need to prove which specific defendant caused the harm, as the hotel as an employer would be responsible for the actions of its employees."
