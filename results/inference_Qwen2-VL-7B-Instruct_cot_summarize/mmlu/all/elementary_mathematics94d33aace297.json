So, the total for the second week is:\n\\[2 \\times 4 = 8\\]\n\nTo find the total number of cookies Paul ate over the two weeks, we add the totals from each week:\n\\[10 + 8 = 18\\]\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. \\(2x \\times 5x4)\\) - This doesn't make sense because it's not clear what \\(x\\) represents, and the multiplication doesn't match the problem description.\n\nB. \\(2x \\times (5+4)\\) - This also doesn't make sense because it's not clear what \\(x\\) represents, and the addition doesn't match the problem description.\n\nC. \\((2x5)x(2x4)\\) - This is incorrect because it's not clear what \\(x\\) represents, and the multiplication doesn't match the problem description.\n\nD. \\((2+5)x(2+4)\\) - This is incorrect because it's not clear what \\(x\\) represents, and the addition doesn't match the problem description.\n\nNone of the options provided correctly represent the total number of cookies Paul ate over the two weeks. The correct expression would be:\n\\[10 + 8 = 18\\]\n\nHowever, since this option is not available, the question seems to be asking for an expression that doesn't exist in the given choices."
