An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos.\n\nThis conclusion alignss with the concept of **ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny**, which suggests that the development of an individual organism (ontogeny) mirrors the evolutionary history of its species (phylogeny). This means that early stages of an organism's development resemble those of its ancestors, and later stages resemble those of more recent ancestors. Therefore, an early human embryo would indeed share features with early fish and avian embryos, as these are more primitive stages in the evolutionary lineage."
