She remained in open possession of the property. The original owner then attempted to sell the property five years later to another purchaser who did not know of the prior conveyance. The second purchaser performed a title search, checking the public records for deeds and saw that title was in the name of his seller. The search included obtaining a standard tax lien certificate, which showed that someone other than the titled owner had been paying the taxes for the past several years. He did not look into who had possession of the property, but went ahead with the closing, paid the purchase price, and recorded a warranty deed in the recorder of deeds office. The first purchaser found out about the sale and quickly recorded her warranty deed, but this was not done until about three months after the second purchaser's deed had already been recorded. The first purchaser also brought a quiet title action to have the court declare that she had superior ownership and title. Which of the two purchasers will win title to the property in a race-notice jurisdiction and why?\n\nA. The first purchaser wins because the second purchaser had constructive notice from the title search that someone else might be in possession, which triggered a duty to further investigate.\nB. The second purchaser will prevail because he recorded his deed first.\nC. The first purchaser will prevail because she paid the taxes on the property, and the tax lien certificate was legally treated the same as a recorded deed.\nD. The second purchaser wins because the first purchaser had to record her deed within five years in order to make it legal in a race-notice jurisdiction.\n"

The key factors are the timing of recording and the notice of possession.\n\nGiven the scenario:\n\n- The second purchaser recorded their deed first.\n- The first purchaser recorded their deed after the second purchaser's deed had already been recorded.\n\nTherefore, the second purchaser will prevail because they recorded their deed first, and the first purchaser did not record their deed in time to claim priority.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. The second purchaser will prevail because he recorded his deed first."
