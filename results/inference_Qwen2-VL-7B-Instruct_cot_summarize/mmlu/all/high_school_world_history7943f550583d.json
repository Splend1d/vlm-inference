This passage supports the use of holy images in religious practice.\n\n2. **Source 2** from the Decree of the Second Council of Nicaea mentions the tradition of making pictorial representations as a useful practice to depict the incarnation of the Word of God, which aligns with the use of holy images.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer that both passages support the use of holy images in religious practice.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Sunni Islam**: Sunni Islam generally accepts the use of images in religious practice, especially in the context of the Prophet Muhammad's life and teachings.\n\nB. **Buddhism**: Buddhism has a complex relationship with images. While some forms of Buddhism use images as part of their practice, others, particularly Theravada Buddhism, are more opposed to the use of images, especially in the context of idolatry.\n\nC. **Zoroastrianism**: Zoroastrianism does not have a strong tradition of using images in religious practice. It is more focused on rituals and ceremonies involving sacred texts and fire.\n\nD. **Jainism**: Jains also have a tradition of using images in religious practice, especially in the context of the Tirthankaras.\n\nGiven the analysis, the religious movement that was ideologically opposed to the use of holy images would be **Buddhism**, particularly in its Theravada form, which is more opposed to the use of images.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nB. Buddhism"
