The traitor is a traitor.\n2. You are a traitor.\n3. Therefore, I am a patriot.\n4. The words of a patriot are the most valuable.\n5. Therefore, my words are good.\n6. Since my words are good, you are undoubtedly a traitor!\n\nThe logical fallacy here is the fallacy of affirmingative premise ( (also known as affirming). This fallacy occurs when an argument concludes that something is true based on the premise that it is true, which is a circular reasoning.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option to find the one that commits the same logical fallacy:\n\nA. Literature and art are not worthy of attention. Modernization must relies on science and technology, so science and technology are worthy of our attention. But literature and art are not science and technology.\n- This argument does not commit the same fallacy. It is a simple categorical statement and does not involve circular reasoning.\n\nB. Non-university can also become an outstanding talent. Gorky, Edison, Faraday, Franklin, etc. have not attended college, but they have all become outstanding talents.\n- This argument does not commit the same fallacy. It is an example of an inductive generalization based on specific instances.\n\nC. The earth is a sphere, which can be proved from the fact that when we stand at a height and watch the sailing boat in the sea, we always see the mast first and then the hull. The reason for this is because the earth is a sphere.\n- This argument does not commit the same fallacy. It is a logical explanation based on empirical evidence.\n\nD. I saw them coming out of this chemical plant several times before I realized that this young man who was eager to help patient was originally a worker in this chemical plant.\n- This argument does not commit the same fallacy. It is a narrative description and does not involve circular reasoning.\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, none of them commit the same logical fallacy as the original argument. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNone of the options commit the same logical fallacy as the original argument."
