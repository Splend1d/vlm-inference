A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. \"At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later. If the resident alien brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute limiting the membership of its state police force to citizens of the United States, the court will most likely declare the statute\n\nA. constitutional, because the statute is within the state's plenary power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.\nB. constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.\nC. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The state statute in question discriminates against the resident alien based on his citizenship status, which is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The court would likely find that the statute is unconstitutional because it does not provide a rational basis for the differential treatment and fails to justify the discrimination against the resident alien."
