This is because the inner product is defined as the dot product of two vectors, which is only defined for vectors in a Euclidean space, and the Euclidean space is only defined for vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space. The only finite-dimensional vector space that has an inner product is the space of all real or complex vectors of length n, where n is a positive integer. The only norm that is expressible as an inner product is the Euclidean norm, which is only defined for vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space. Therefore, the answer is B."
