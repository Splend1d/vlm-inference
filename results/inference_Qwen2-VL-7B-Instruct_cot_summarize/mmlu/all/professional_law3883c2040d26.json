The vintner sold the vineyard to a husband and wife as tenants in common, who did not record the warranty deed by which the vintner conveyed the vineyard to them. The husband subsequently sold and conveyed his undivided one-half interest in the vineyard to a friend. The friend promptly recorded his deed. Some time later, the vintner purported to convey the vineyard to a farmer, for valuable consideration. The farmer, who had no actual knowledge of any previous conveyances of the vineyard, recorded her deed. The jurisdiction maintains alphabetical grantor and grantee indices. The applicable recording statute provides, \"Every conveyance of real property is void as against any subsequent purchaser of the same property (or any part thereof) in good faith and for a valuable consideration, whose conveyance is first duly recorded. \" None of the various grantees of the vineyard has entered into possession in a manner that would put anyone on inquiry notice as to their interest therein. Who owns the vineyard?\n\nA. The friend, because he recorded his deed before the farmer recorded.\nB. The friend and the wife, because the friend's deed would put the farmer on inquiry notice as to the wife's interest in the vineyard.\nC. The farmer, because the husband \u0080\u0094friend deed is outside the farmer's chain of title.\nD. The friend and the farmer, as tenants in common.\n"

The vintner owned the vineyard in fee simple absolute and conveyed it to the husband and wife as tenants in common. The deed was properly recorded.\n2. The husband sold his undivided one-half interest to a friend, who promptly recorded his deed.\n3. The vintner then conveyed the vineyard to a farmer, who recorded her deed.\n4. The applicable recording statute states that a conveyance of real property is void as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration whose conveyance is first duly recorded.\n\nGiven these points, the farmer's deed is the first conveyance recorded after the husband's deed. Therefore, the farmer's conveyance is the first one that is recorded and thus is protected under the recording statute.\n\nThe friend's deed, although recorded first, is not protected under the recording statute because it was not the first conveyance recorded after the husband's deed. The farmer's deed is the first conveyance recorded after the husband's deed, and thus the farmer is the owner of the vineyard."
