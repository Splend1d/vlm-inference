A local maximum of a function \\( f \\) on an interval \\([a, b]\\) does not necessarily mean that \\( f'(x) \\) must exist and equal 0 at that point. For example, consider the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\) on the interval \\([0, b]\\) where \\( a > 0 \\). At \\( x = a \\), \\( f'(x) \\) does not exist because the function is not differentiable at \\( x = a \\). However, \\( f \\) has a local maximum at \\( x = a \\).\n\nStatement 2 is True. There exist non-constant continuous maps from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). For example, consider the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) for \\( x \\neq 0 \\) and \\( f(0) = 0 \\). This function is continuous on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) and maps to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) because it is a rational number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. False, True"
