The contractor who was working on the restaurant expansion found that the north wall of the new structure needed extensive support, so anchor rods and concrete were added. The supporting anchor rods and concrete extended into a neighboring property farther to the north at a point 20 feet below the surface. Although there was no impact on the surface of his land or on existing uses, the owner of the neighboring property has sued the restaurant owner for trespass. Which party is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The neighboring property owner, because he should have been given notice of the intrusion before it occurred.\nB. The neighboring property owner, because the restaurant intruded upon his property the restaurant intruded upon his property without permission.\nC. The restaurant owner, because the decision to provide the additional support was reasonable.\nD. The restaurant owner, because there was no disturbance of peaceful enjoyment of the neighboring property. \u0080\u0083\n"

The neighboring property owner, because the restaurant intruded upon his property without permission.\n\nThe reasoning behind this conclusion is based on the legal principle of trespass, which occurs when one person's property is invaded by another without their consent. In this case, the restaurant owner expanded their building onto the neighboring property, which is an invasion of that property without the neighboring property owner's consent. The fact that there was no impact on the surface or existing uses does not negate the trespass claim, as the intrusion occurred below the surface.\n\nWhile the restaurant owner may argue that the decision to provide additional support was reasonable, the legal issue here is primarily about the unauthorized invasion of property, not the reason behind the invasion. Therefore, the neighboring property owner is likely to prevail based on the principle of trespass."
