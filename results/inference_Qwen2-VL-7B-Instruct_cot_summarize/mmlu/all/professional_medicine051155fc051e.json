Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?\n\nA. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration\nB. Decreased macrophage activity\nC. Increased basophil count\nD. Increased lymphocyte count\n"

Decrease AM serum cortisol concentration\n\nCortisol is a hormone that plays a significant role in the body's stress response and immune function. Elevated cortisol levels can suppress the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections. A decrease in cortisol levels during examination week would suggest that the stress of studying is indeed affecting the immune system, supporting the hypothesis."
