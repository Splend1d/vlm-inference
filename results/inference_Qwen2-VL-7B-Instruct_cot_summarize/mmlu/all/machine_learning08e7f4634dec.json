The probability density function \\( p(x) \\) for a continuous random variable must satisfy the following properties:\n1. \\( p(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\).\n2. The total area under the curve \\( p(x) \\) from negative infinity to positive infinity is 1, which means \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) \\, dx = 1 \\).\n\nStatement 2: Decision tree is learned by minimizing information gain.\n\nThis statement is false. Decision trees are typically learned by maximizing information gain, not minimizing it. Information gain is a measure of how much \"information\" a feature provides about a target variable. The goal is to choose the feature that provides the most information gain, which helps in splitting the data into subsets that are more homogeneous with respect to the target variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
