As they were leaving, one of the co-defendants inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a refuse pile of old cardboard boxes and papers. Soon afterward, the refuse ignited into a small fire. Although the co-defendants had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, neither did so. Instead, they climbed into the truck and fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames. At common law, the co-defendants should be found guilty of\n\nA. burglary and arson.\nB. larceny and arson.\nC. larceny only.\nD. burglary, larceny, and arson.\n"
