Since every second number is divisible by 2, there are \\(100/2 = 50\\) numbers divisible by 2.\n\nNext, we find how many numbers are divisible by 3 in the set. Since every third number is divisible by 3, there are \\(100/3 = 33.33\\), but since we're dealing with integers, we consider 33 numbers divisible by 3.\n\nHowever, we're interested in numbers that are divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3. Since every second number is divisible by 2, we need to exclude those that are also divisible by 3. The numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 ( (i.e., divisible by 6) are \\(100/6 = 16.66\\), but again, we consider 16 numbers divisible by 6.\n\nTherefore, the numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3 are \\(50 - 16 = 34\\).\n\nThe total number of integers in the set is 100.\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected integer in the set is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3 is thus \\(\\frac{34}{100} = \\frac{17}{50}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\(\\frac{17}{50}\\)."
