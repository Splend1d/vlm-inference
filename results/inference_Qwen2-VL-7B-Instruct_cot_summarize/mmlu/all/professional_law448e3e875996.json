In light of the defendant's lengthy juvenile criminal history, which included violent offenses, and the fact that armed robbery is a crime of violence, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Did the life-without-parole sentence violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment?\n\nA. No, because a juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole if release would pose a danger to the community.\nB. No, because the Eighth Amendment does not apply outside the context of capital punishment.\nC. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\nD. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for an adult or juvenile defendant convicted of a nonviolent offense.\n"

Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the use of cruel and unusual punishment. In the context of juvenile offenders, the Supreme Court has ruled that life-without-parole sentences are generally impermissible for juvenile defendants convicted of nonhomicide offenses. This is based on the principle that juvenile offenders are less culpable and more amenable to rehabilitation than adult offenders. Therefore, the life-without-parole sentence in this case would likely be considered unconstitutional."
