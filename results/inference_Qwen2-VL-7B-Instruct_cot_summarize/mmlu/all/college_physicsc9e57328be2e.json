Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom in its ground state. \n\nIn the case of helium, which has two electrons in its ground state, the energy required to remove both electrons is given as 79.0 eV. This is known as the ionization energy of helium.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the energy required to remove one electron from helium. Since helium has two electrons, removing one electron would leave it with one electron in its ground state. \n\nThe energy required to remove one electron from helium would be half of the total ionization energy, because removing one electron would leave it with one electron in its ground state.\n\nTherefore, the energy required to remove one electron from helium is:\n\n79.0 eV / 2 = 39.5 eV\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 39.5 eV"
