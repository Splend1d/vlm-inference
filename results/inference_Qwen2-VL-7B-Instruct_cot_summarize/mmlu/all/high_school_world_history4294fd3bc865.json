His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.\n\u2026\nHe looked to the West and prayed, \"I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal.\" When he had prayed he bowed again.\nFrom Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s\nIn which of the following ways does the excerpt above most complicate historians' understanding of the career of the Chinese monk and traveler Xuanzang?\n\nA.

This suggests that the story is highly fictionalized, as it includes elements from a fictional work rather than historical facts.\n\nB. **It was written long after the time period in which Xuanzang lived.**\n   - The excerpt is from the Journey to the West, which was written in the 1590s. This. This. This means it was written during the same period as the events described, not long after Xuanzang's lifetime.\n\nC. **It casts doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang.**\n   - The excerpt does not provide any information that would cast doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang. Instead, it describes his actions and beliefs.\n\nD. **It is widely considered by scholars to be a forgery.**\n   - The Journey to the West is not widely considered by scholars to be a forgery. It is recognized as a classic work of fiction that has been influential in Chinese literature and culture.\n\nGiven this analysis, the excerpt most complicates historians' understanding of the career of the Chinese monk and traveler Xuanzang by highly fictionalizing the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments.\n\n**Final Answer: A. It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments.**"
