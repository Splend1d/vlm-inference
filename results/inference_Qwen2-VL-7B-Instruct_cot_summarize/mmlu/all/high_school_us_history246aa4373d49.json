It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nWhich of the following groups would be most likely to support the perspective of Frederick Douglass?\n\nA.

Frederick Douglass was a prominent abolitionist who advocated for the end of slavery. His statement highlights the organized and systematic nature of the slaveholding system, which he contrasts with the fragmented and less organized opposition to slavery.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Southern Democrats in the 1880s:\n- Southern Democrats were generally supporters of the Democratic Party in the South, which was known for its pro-slavery stance. They would likely oppose Douglass's perspective.\n\nB. Western ranchers in the 1850s:\n- Western ranchers were often anti-slavery and supportive of the Union. They would likely support Douglass's perspective.\n\nC. Southern farmers in the 1830s:\n- Southern farmers were generally supporters of the Democratic Party and the institution of slavery. They would likely oppose Douglass's perspective.\n\nD. Northern Republicans in the 1860s:\n- Northern Republicans were generally supporters of the Republican Party, which was known for its anti-slavery stance. They would likely support Douglass's perspective.\n\nGiven the context and the core message of Douglass's statement, the most likely group to support his perspective would be those who were explicitly anti-slavery and supportive of the Union. This.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nD. Northern Republicans in the 1860s"
