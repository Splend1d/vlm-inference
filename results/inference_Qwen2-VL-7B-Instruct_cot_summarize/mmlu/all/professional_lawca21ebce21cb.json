She testified at trial that while sitting on the floor trying to gather the strength to get up, she heard a grocery employee asst. manager say to an employee, \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" The grocer's counsel objected on the basis of hearsay to the admissibility of the purported statements of the asst. manager and the other employee. What will the court decide?\n\nA. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement was not hearsay \u0080\u0094 it was offered to show that they were aware of a problem on the floor.\nB. The objection will be sustained because the asst. manager's statement was pure hearsay and she had to be available for cross-examination for the statement to be admissible.\nC. The objection will be sustained because the statement was irrelevant to whether or not the store was negligent and liable for the shopper's injuries.\nD. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n"

The objection will be overruled because the assistant manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n\nIn this case, the assistant manager's statement, \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" is likely to be considered a vicarious admission of the grocery store. This means that the statement is being made by an employee acting within the scope of their duties, and it is being offered to show that the the grocery store was aware of the problem on the floor and failed to address it, thereby contributing to the shopper's injuries. Therefore, the court is likely to overrule the objection based on the doctrine of vicarious admissions."
