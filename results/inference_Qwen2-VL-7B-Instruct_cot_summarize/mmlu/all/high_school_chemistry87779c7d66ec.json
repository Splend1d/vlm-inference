The combined gas law can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{V_2}{t_2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( V_1 \\) is the initial volume of the gas ( (5.00 L)\n- \\( t_1 \\) is the initial temperature of the gas in Kelvin ( (127\u00b0C + 273.15 = 400.15 K)\n- \\( V_2 \\) is the final volume of the gas ( (10.00 L)\n- \\( t_2 \\) is the final temperature of the gas in Kelvin\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for \\( t_2 \\):\n\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{V_2 \\cdot t_1}{V_1} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{10.00 \\text{ L} \\cdot 400.15 \\text{ K}}{5.00 \\text{ L}} \\]\n\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{4001.5 \\text{ K}}{5.00 \\text{ L}} \\]\n\n\\[ t_2 = 800.3 \\text{ K} \\]\n\nTo convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius, we subtract 273.15:\n\n\\[ t_2 = 800.3 \\text{ K} - 273.15 \\text{ K} \\]\n\n\\[ t_2 = 527.15 \\text{ K} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the final temperature is approximately 527\u00b0C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 527\u00b0C"
