Specifically, a group of order \\( p^2 \\) is either cyclic ( and hence Abelian - in which case it is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{p^2} \\) - or it it is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order \\( p \\), which is also Abelian.\n\nStatement 2 is False. A Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of a group \\( G \\) being normal in \\( G \\) does not necessarily mean it is the only Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( G \\). For example, consider the symmetric group \\( S_4 \\) ( which has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, which is not normal in \\( S_4 \\). However, it is possible for a Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup to be normal and the only one of its kind in \\( G \\), but this is not a necessary condition for normality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
