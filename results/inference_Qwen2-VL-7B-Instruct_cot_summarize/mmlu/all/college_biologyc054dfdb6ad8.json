The maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species.\n\nThis is because brood parasites like the cuckoo are able to exploit the host bird's instinctive behavior to their advantage without significantly affecting the host bird's overall fitness. The host bird's response to the loud begging cues of the cuckoo fledgling does not hinder its ability to rear its own young efficiently. Therefore, the gene that allows the host bird to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings remains in the gene pool because it does not negatively impact the host bird's ability to rear its own offspring."
