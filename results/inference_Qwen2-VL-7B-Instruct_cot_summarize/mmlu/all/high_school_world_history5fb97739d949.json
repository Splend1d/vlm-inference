It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire?\n\nA. Civil wars between rivals for the throne\nB. Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire\nC. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire\nD.

Civil wars between rivals for the throne\n- Civil wars were a significant factor in the decline of the Roman Empire. They drained resources, weakened the government, and led to instability.\n\nB. Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire\n- Barbarian invasions were a major cause of the decline. They led to the loss of territories, the weakening of the empire's borders, and the eventual collapse of the Roman military.\n\nC. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire\n- The Senate was a key institution in the Roman government. Its persistence might have contributed to the stability and continuity of governance, which could have helped in some aspects rather than contributing to the decline.\n\nD. Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics\n- Demographic decline due to diseases and epidemics was a significant factor. It led to a decrease in the population, which weakened the military and the workforce.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that contributed the LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire is:\n\nC. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire\n\nThe persistence of the Senate might have provided some stability and continuity, but it was not a major factor in the decline of the Roman Empire."
