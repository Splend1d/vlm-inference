Shortly thereafter, the woman's financial condition worsened significantly, but she failed to disclose this fact to the bank. Unaware of the woman's changed financial condition, the bank then agreed to lend money to the woman. The bank later learned of the woman's true financial condition. The bank refused to honor its promise to lend money to the woman, contending that the parties' contract was voidable at the bank's option because of the woman's misrepresentation. If the woman sues the bank for breach of contract, will the bank's misrepresentation defense likely succeed?\n\nA. No, because the woman did not make any subsequent affirmative misrepresentations about her financial condition.\nB. No, because the woman's representations were accurate at the time she submitted the loan application to the bank.\nC. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition in order to prevent them from being fraudulent.\nD. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to tell the bank about her changed financial condition due to the longstanding relationship of trust and confidence between them.\n"

Yes, because the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition in order to prevent them from being fraudulent.\n\nIn contract law, a misrepresentation occurs when one party makes a false statement of fact that they believe to be true, which induces the other party to enter into the contract. For the misrepresentation defense to succeed, the bank must demonstrate that the woman's representations were false at the time she submitted the loan application and that the bank relied on those representations in making the loan decision. \n\nHowever, the bank's defense is more robust because it is not just about the initial representations but also the ongoing duty to disclose material facts that could affect the contract's validity. The bank can argue that the woman's failure to disclose her worsening financial condition after submitting the loan application constituted a fraudulent misrepresentation. Fraudulent misrepresentation occurs when a party makes a false statement of fact with the intent to deceive or induce reliance, and the party knew or should have known that the statement was false.\n\nGiven the longstanding relationship of trust and confidence between the bank and the woman, the bank can argue that the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition to prevent them from being fraudulent. This obligation arises from the duty of care owed by the woman to the bank, especially in light of the bank's reliance on her initial representations.\n\nTherefore, the bank's misrepresentation defense is likely to succeed because the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition to prevent them from being fraudulent."
