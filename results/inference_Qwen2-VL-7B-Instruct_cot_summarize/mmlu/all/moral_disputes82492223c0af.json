                    "text": "To determine which condition would make a slippery-slope argument fallacious, we need to understand what a slippery-slope argument is and how it works. A slippery-slope argument suggests that one event will inevitably lead to a chain of negative outcomes if a certain action is taken. The argument is fallacious if the connection between the initial action and the negative outcomes is not strong or if the negative outcomes are not actually bad.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The envisioned results of the action or practice under consideration turn out not to be bad.\n- If the envisioned results are not bad, this does not necessarily make the slippery-slope argument fallacious. The argument could still be valid if the connection between the initial action and the negative outcomes is strong.\n\nB. The central idea of the argument\u2014that the action or practice under consideration will lead us down a path to disaster\u2014turns out not to be plausible.\n- If the central idea of the argument is not plausible, this directly undermines the argument's validity. If the argument's core claim is not believable, it is fallacious.\n\nC. Both A and B are correct; either condition would make the argument fallacious.\n- This option suggests that either condition alone would make the argument fallacious. However, it is not necessarily true. If the central idea is not plausible ( (B), the argument is fallacious. But if the envisioned results are not bad ( (A), it does not necessarily make the argument fallacious.\n\nD. Neither A nor B is correct; neither condition would make the argument fallacious.\n- This option suggests that neither condition alone would make the argument fallacious. However, this is not necessarily true. If the central idea is not plausible ( (B), the argument is fallacious. If the envisioned results are not bad ( (A), it does not necessarily make the argument fallacious.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The central idea of the argument\u2014that the action or practice under consideration will lead us down a path to disaster\u2014turns out not to be plausible.\n\nFinal answer: B."
