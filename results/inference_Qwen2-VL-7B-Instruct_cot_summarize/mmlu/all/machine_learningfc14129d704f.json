True, False\n\nStatement 1 is true because it is well-documented that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can achieve high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, often exceeding 95%.\n\nStatement 2 is false because ensembles of neural networks can indeed improve classification accuracy. The representations they learn are not necessarily highly correlated, and combining multiple models can lead to better generalization and higher accuracy."
