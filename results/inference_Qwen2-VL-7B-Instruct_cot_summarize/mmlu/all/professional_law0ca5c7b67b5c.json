The defendant, who only had $8. 00 in his possession, saw that the game he wanted was selling for $10. 00 Realizing that he did not have enough money to pay for the game, he ripped the $10. 00 price tag off the box. While no one was looking, the defendant then took the $7. 00 sticker from another game and placed it on the box. He then purchased the game for $7. 00 and walked out of the store.

Larceny**.\n\nLarceny is the unlawful taking and carrying away of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. The defendant took the game with the intent to permanently deprive the store of it, even though he initially did not have enough money to purchase it. The act of removing the price tag and replacing it with a lower sticker is an attempt to deceive the store into believing the game is cheaper than it, which is also an element of larceny."
