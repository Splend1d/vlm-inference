Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?\n\nThe question of whether the exchange has commercial substance is primarily concerned with whether the exchange will result in a significant change in the future cash flows of the company. This is because an exchange with commercial substance is one that is expected to have a significant effect on the future cash flows of the company, which can be a result of the exchange of assets with different characteristics or uses. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
