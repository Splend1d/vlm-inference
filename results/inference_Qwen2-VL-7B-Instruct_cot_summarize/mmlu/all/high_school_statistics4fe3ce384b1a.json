                    "text": "To determine which of the given options will increase the power of a hypothesis test, we need to understand the factors that influence the power of a test. The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It is influenced by several factors, including:\n\n1. **Sample Size ( (n)**: Increasing the sample size generally increases the power of the test. This is because a larger sample size provides more information about the population, making it easier to detect a true effect if one exists.\n\n2. **Significance Level ( (\u03b1)**: Increasing the significance level ( increases the power of the test. This is because a higher significance level means that the critical region for rejecting the null hypothesis is larger, making it easier to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.\n\n3. **Probability of a Type II Error ( (\u03b2)**: Increasing the probability of a Type II error ( decreases the power of the test. This is because a higher \u03b2 means that the test is less likely to detect a true effect, thus reducing the power.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **I. Increasing the sample size**: This increases the power of the test.\n- **II. Increasing the significance level**: This increases the power of the test.\n- **III. Increasing the probability of a Type II error**: This decreases the power of the test.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I and II**"
