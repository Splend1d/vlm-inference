                    "text": "To determine the truth of these statements, we need to check if the given sets satisfy the group axioms under matrix multiplication. The group axioms are:\n\n1. Closure: The product of any two elements in the set must also be in the set.\n2. Associativity: Matrix multiplication is associative.\n3. Identity: There exists an identity element in the set such that multiplying any element by the identity leaves it unchanged.\n4. Inverses: For every element in the set, there exists an inverse element such that the product of an element and its inverse is the identity element.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n### Statement 1\nThe set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\n- **Closure**: The product of two matrices with integer entries will also have integer entries. The determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of their determinants. Since the determinant of each matrix is nonzero, the product of their determinants will also be nonzero. Therefore, the product of two matrices with nonzero determinant will also have a nonzero determinant. Hence, the set is closed under matrix multiplication.\n- **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative.\n- **Identity**: The identity matrix \\( I \\) has integer entries and a determinant of 1. Multiplying any matrix \\( A \\) by \\( I \\) results in \\( A \\) itself, so \\( I \\) acts as the identity element.\n- **Inverses**: For any matrix \\( A \\) with a nonzero determinant, there exists an inverse matrix \\( A^{-1} \\) such that \\( A \\cdot A^{-1} = I \\). Since the determinant of \\( A \\) is nonzero, \\( A^{-1} \\) will also have integer entries.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n### Statement 2\nThe set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\n- **Closure**: The product of two matrices with integer entries will also have integer entries. The determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of their determinants. Since the determinant of each matrix is 1, the product of their determinants will also be 1. Therefore, the product of two matrices with determinant 1 will also have a determinant of 1. Hence, the set is closed under matrix multiplication.\n- **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative.\n- **Identity**: The identity matrix \\( I \\) has determinant 1 and integer entries. Multiplying any matrix \\( A \\) by \\( I \\) results in \\( A \\) itself, so \\( I \\) acts as the identity element.\n- **Inverses**: For any matrix \\( A \\) with determinant 1, there exists an inverse matrix \\( A^{-1} \\) such that \\( A \\cdot A^{-1} = I \\). Since the determinant of \\( A \\) is 1, \\( A^{-1} \\) will also have integer entries.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
