The significance level \u03b1 is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true ( ( Type I error). The probability of a Type II error is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. \n\nThe relationship between \u03b1 and \u03b2 is given by the power of the test, which is 1 - \u03b2. The power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. \n\nTherefore, the probability of a Type II error is not given by any of the options provided.
