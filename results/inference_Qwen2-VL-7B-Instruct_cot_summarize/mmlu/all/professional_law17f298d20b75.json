The defendant was refused permission to use the bathroom.\n\nThis is because the defendant's refusal to use the bathroom does not directly relate to the voluntariness of his confession. The other allegations ( B, C, and D, are more directly related to the voluntariness of the confession and could potentially be used to suppress the statement if they demonstrate that the defendant was not free to make an informed decision to confess.\n\n- B. The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement: This could suggest that the defendant was not in a state of being free to make an informed decision to confess.\n- C. The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause: This could suggest that the defendant was not in a state of being free to make an informed decision to confess.\n- D. The defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English: This could suggest that the defendant was not in a state of being free to make an informed decision to confess.\n\nTherefore, the least helpful allegation in this context is A."
