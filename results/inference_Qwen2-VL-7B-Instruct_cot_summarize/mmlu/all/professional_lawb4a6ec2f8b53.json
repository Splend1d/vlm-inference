In this case, the will clearly states that the residue of the estate is to be bequeathed to the niece. Since the woman lived on the farm for 12 years and then sold it and used the proceeds to purchase a home in the city, she never changed her will. Therefore, the home is owned by the niece as the residuary legatee."
