This framework categorizes SBUs into four types based on their market growth and market share:\n\nA. Question marks: These are SBUs that have high market growth potential but low market share. They require significant investment to build market share and are often referred to as \"question marks\" because their future is uncertain.\n\nB. Quick winners: These are SBUs that have high market share and high market growth. They are often referred to as \"quick winners\" because they are likely to generate significant profits quickly.\n\nC. Charging bulls: These are SBUs that have high market share and low market growth. They are often referred to as \"charging bulls\" because they are likely to generate steady profits over time.\n\nD. Cash outs: These are SBUs that have low market share and low market growth. They are often referred to as \"cash outs\" because they are likely to generate little or no profits and may be candidates for divestiture.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Question marks."
