Socrates is more concerned with the distinction between appearances and reality, not the variability of moral and truth standards.\n\nB. \"Appearances are the only real way we have for knowing reality.\"\n- This option contradicts Socrates' view. He is suggesting that appearances can differ from reality, not that appearances are the only way to know reality.\n\nC. \"The distinction of appearance and reality is the basis for the dialectical discovery of truth.\"\n- This option is somewhat related to Socrates' view but does not directly address the core of his argument about the objective principles for the good life.\n\nD. \"There are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life.\"\n- This option aligns with Socrates' view. He is suggesting that despite appearances, there are objective principles that guide thought and action towards the good life.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. There are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life."
