Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed.

Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage.

The fact that the woman then conveyed the property to the farmer by quitclaim deed, which made no reference to the mortgage, does not automatically transfer the mortgage to the farmer. The mortgage remains with the woman, and the niece has a valid claim against her. However, for the niece to recover the amount of the mortgage from the farmer, the farmer must have constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage. Constructive notice means that the farmer should have known about the mortgage, even if it was not explicitly mentioned in the quitclaim deed."
