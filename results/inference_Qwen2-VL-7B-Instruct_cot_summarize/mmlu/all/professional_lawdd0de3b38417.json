The woman readily agreed and delivered the microwave to the handyman, who promised to have it ready in two weeks. One week later, the handyman realized that he had so much work to do that he would not be able to repair the microwave on time. He then took the microwave to a repair store. The repair store agreed to repair the microwave for $80 within one week. The owner of the repair store that contracted with the handyman was unaware that the woman actually owned the microwave. If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.\nB. The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.\nC. The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.\nD. The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.\n"

The woman's cause of action should be against both the repair store and the handyman.\n\nB. **The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.**\n   - This is incorrect because the handyman initially agreed to the repair and took the microwave to the repair store. The handyman's initial promise and subsequent actions make him responsible for the failure.\n\nC. **The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.**\n   - This is the most accurate statement. The handyman initially agreed to the repair and took the microwave to the repair store. Both the handyman and the repair store failed to deliver the repair, so the woman has a cause of action against both.\n\nD. **The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.**\n   - This is incorrect because the handyman initially agreed to the repair and the repair store failed to deliver the repair.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**C. The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.**"
