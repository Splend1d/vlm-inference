A large shipyard firm has provided the asbestos exposure records of all employees during the past 50 years. The health insurer for the workers has provided claims data that documents all chest x-rays and diagnoses of mesothelioma among current workers and retirees. The study enrolled shipyard workers who were diagnosed with mesothelioma and shipyard workers who were not diagnosed with mesothelioma. All subjects in the study had to have chest xrays. Which of the following is the best rationale for selecting a comparison group that had chest x-rays?\n\nA. Address confounding\nB. Demonstrate causality\nC. Minimize ascertainment bias\nD. Reduce recall bias\n"

Ascertainment bias occurs when the exposure status of the study subjects is not accurately determined, leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationship between exposure and outcome. In this case, having chest x-rays for all subjects ensures that the exposure status ( (asbestos exposure) is accurately determined, thereby minimizing the risk of ascertainment bias."
