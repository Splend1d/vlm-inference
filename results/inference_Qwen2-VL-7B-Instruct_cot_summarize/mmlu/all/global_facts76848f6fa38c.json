It was a significant piece of legislation that established the framework for the modern Social Security system, which provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible individuals.\n\nThe exact percentage of Americans who were in favor of the Social Security Act in 1935 is difficult to determine with precision, as public opinion on such matters can be influenced by various factors and can change over time. However, it is generally understood that the Social Security Act was widely supported by the American public, as it addressed a pressing need for social welfare in the aftermath of the Great Depression.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 90%\nB. 70%\nC. 50%\nD. 30%\n\nThe most reasonable estimate would be:\n\nB. 70%\n\nThis is because the Social Security Act was a significant and popular piece of legislation that aimed to provide financial security to the elderly and disabled, which would likely have garnered widespread support among the American public."
