During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nWhich of the following in later years would be most likely to see themselves in Logan's position?\n\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s\nB. An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s\nD. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s\n"

                    "text": "To determine which of the given options would most likely see themselves in Logan's position, we need to analyze Logan's situation and the context of his speech. Logan was an Indian leader who sought revenge for the murder of his family members by a white man, Colonel Cresap. He expressed a desire for peace but also also sought revenge for the loss of his loved ones.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s:\n- Opponents of big government in the 1930s were often concerned with individual rights and freedoms, which could resonate with Logan's desire for revenge and his strong feelings about personal justice.\n\nB. An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s:\n- Opponents of consumerism in the 1950s were more focused on the negative impacts of consumer culture on society and personal values, which may not directly align with Logan's personal vendetta.\n\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s:\n- Supporters of liberalism in the 1960s were more focused on social justice, civil rights, and equality, which may not directly relate to Logan's personal vendetta.\n\nD. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s:\n- Supporters of feminism in the 1970s were more focused on gender equality and women's rights, which may not directly relate to Logan's personal vendetta.\n\nGiven the context of Logan's speech, his desire for revenge and his strong feelings about personal justice, the most likely person to see themselves in Logan's position would be someone who is concerned with individual rights and freedoms, such as an opponent of big government in the 1930s.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s"
