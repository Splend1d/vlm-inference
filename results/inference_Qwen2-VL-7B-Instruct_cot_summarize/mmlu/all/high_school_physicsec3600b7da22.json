Since the temperature remains constant, we can use the relationship PV = constant.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial pressure, P1 = 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n- Initial volume, V1 = 20 cm^3 = 0.02 L\n- Final volume, V2 = 5 cm^3 = 0.005 L\n- Temperature, T = 273 K\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n\nP1 * V1 = P2 * V2\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa * 0.02 L = P2 * 0.005 L\n\nSolve for P2:\n\nP2 = ( (1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa * 0.02 L) / 0.005 L\n\nP2 = 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nTherefore, the resulting pressure is 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa."
