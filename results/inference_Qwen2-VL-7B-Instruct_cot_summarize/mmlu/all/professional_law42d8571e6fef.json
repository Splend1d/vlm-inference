Two years after the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement with the landlord, he subleases the house to his cousin. Thereafter, the cousin defaults on the rental payments.

In this case, the landlord has a direct lease agreement with the original tenant, and the subtenant has a direct lease agreement with the cousin. Therefore, both privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the landlord and the subtenant, allowing the landlord to recover the past rent due from the cousin."
