                    "text": "The scenario described involves two distinct populations of pocket mice, each adapted to different environments: dark-colored mice on the black lava formations and light-colored mice in the light-colored sandy desert. This situation is best explained by the concept of natural selection, where different phenotypes are favored in different environments.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.\n- This statement is plausible but not necessarily the most accurate. While it is possible that the two populations share a common ancestor, the scenario does not provide enough information to confirm this.\n\nB. The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.\n- This statement is incorrect. The scenario does not indicate that the populations diverged into two species. Instead, it suggests that the populations have adapted to different environments.\n\nC. Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\n- This statement is correct. The scenario indicates that different phenotypes ( dark-colored mice on the lava and light-colored mice in the desert - are favored in their respective environments. This is a classic example of natural selection.\n\nD. Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.\n- This statement is incorrect. The scenario does not suggest that the color of of the mice changed due to environmental factors. Instead, it suggests that the mice have adapted to their environments through natural selection.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement about this scenario is:\n\nC. Selection favors some phenotypes over others."
