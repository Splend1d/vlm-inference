This is because shifting the graph of a function $f(x)$ to the right by $20$ units is equivalent to replacing $x$ with $x-20$ in the function $f(x)$, which is the definition of a period of $20$.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive $a$ such that if the graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ is shifted $a$ units to the right, then the resulting graph is identical to the original graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac o5\\right)$. This means that the function $f\\left(\\frac o5\\right)$ has a period of $5a$.\n\nSince the period of $f(x)$ is $20$, we have $5a=20$, which gives $a=4$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive $a$ such that if the graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac o5\\right)$ is shifted $a$ units to the right, then the resulting graph is identical to the original graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac o5\\right)$ is $4$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
