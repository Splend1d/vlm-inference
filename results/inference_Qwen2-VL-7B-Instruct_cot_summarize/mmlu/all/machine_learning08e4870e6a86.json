In fact, it is generally known that the training error of for a 1-nearest neighbor classifier can be high, especially in high-dimensional spaces or when the data is not linearly separable. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 2: As the number of data points grows to infinity, the MAP estimate approaches the MLE estimate for all possible priors. In other words, given enough data, the choice of prior is irrelevant.**\n\nThis statement is true. As the number of data points increases, the influence of the prior distribution on the Maximum A Posteriori ( (MAP) estimate diminishes. The Maximum Likelihood Estimate ( (MLE) is a special case of the MAP estimate where the prior distribution is uniform (i.e., it has no influence. Therefore, as the amount of data grows, the MAP estimate converges to the MLE estimate, making the choice of prior less significant.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. False, True**"
