Here's how each option contributes to this reconciliation:\n\nA. Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, can lead to diversification and research that may result in technological advancements. These advancements can bolster military programs, enhancing national security through improved capabilities and resilience.\n\nB. Environmental changes can undermine national security by weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. For example, if the natural capital base of an economy erodes, the long-term capacity of its armed forces may be compromised. However, any developments in response to these changes will be \"human\" in impact, meaning they will involve human efforts and resources to adapt and mitigate the effects of environmental changes.\n\nC. Environmental problems encountered by countries are not necessarily internal; they can also be external, such as climate change or resource scarcity that affect multiple nations. External threats can also be a concern, and countries may need to collaborate to address these issues, which can also contribute to national security through shared interests and cooperation.\n\nTherefore, all of these options highlight different aspects of how environmental changes can be reconciled with national security interests."
