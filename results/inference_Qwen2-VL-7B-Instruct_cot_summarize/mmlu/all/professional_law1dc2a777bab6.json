A few moments later, a train conductor shouted, \"All aboard!\" to indicate that the train was about to depart the station. At that moment, a man, carrying a large cardboard box, came running through the station toward the train \"Wait for me!\" he shouted as he ran toward the train. The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, \"You can make it,\" and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train. The rocket's collision caused a shelf on the wall to fall. A large container of coffee that was on the shelf fell and hit a customer who was sitting in the shop and enjoying a cup of coffee. The coffee shop customer suffered an injury to her shoulder as a result of being hit by the container of coffee. If the coffee shop customer asserts a negligence claim against the railroad, which of the following elements of her claim will the plaintiff be unable to satisfy?\n\nA. Duty.\nB. Breach.\nC. Cause-in-fact.\nD. Proximate or legal causation.\n"

                    "text": "The coffee shop customer asserts a negligence claim against the railroad. To successfully prove negligence, the customer must demonstrate that the railroad owed her a duty of care, breached that duty, and that the breach caused her injury. Let's analyze each element of the claim:\n\nA. **Duty**: The railroad has a duty to ensure the safety and security of passengers and the general public in and around the train station. This duty includes maintaining the station and its surroundings, ensuring that trains depart safely, and preventing accidents that could harm passengers.\n\nB. **Breach**: The railroad breached its duty by allowing the man with the fireworks to board the train despite the potential danger. The fact that the man was carrying fireworks and the box made a loud screeching noise indicates that the railroad should have been aware of the risk and taken appropriate action to prevent the incident.\n\nC. **Cause-in-fact**: The cause-in-fact element requires that the railroad's breach of duty was the direct cause of the customer's injury. The customer was hit by the falling container of coffee, which was caused by the rocket that ignited from the fireworks. The customer's injury was directly linked to the railroad's negligence.\n\nD. **Proximate or Legal Causation**: Proximate cause is the legal cause of the injury. It is the cause that is so close in time, place, and logic to the injury that it it is proper to hold one person responsible for the harm. In this case, the customer's injury was a direct result of the railroad's negligence in allowing the man with the fireworks to board the train.\n\nGiven the analysis, the coffee shop customer will be unable to satisfy the **proximate or legal causation** element of her claim. The customer's injury was caused by the rocket that ignited from the fireworks, which was a direct result of the man's actions, not the railroad's negligence in allowing the man to board the train. The customer's injury was not a direct result of the railroad's negligence but rather the man's actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Proximate or legal causation."
