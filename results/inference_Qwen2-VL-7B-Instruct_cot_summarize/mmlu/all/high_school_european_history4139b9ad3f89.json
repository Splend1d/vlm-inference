It mentions that the humanists scholars were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to produce anything of value. This suggests that the focus on the past and the study of ancient philosophers was more prominent during this period.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"Face with an unprecedented number of social and technological changes, the twentieth century embraced innovation as one of the most valued characteristics of life.\"\n- This option suggests that the twentieth century valued innovation. However, the passage does not discuss innovation or the value placed on it in the twentieth century. It focuses on the historical context of the study of ancient philosophers.\n\nB. \"Overwhelmed by the unprecedented number of social and technological changes, the twentieth century sought refuge in the longstanding traditions of the past.\"\n- This option suggests that the twentieth century sought refuge in past traditions. The passage does not explicitly state that the twentieth century sought refuge in past traditions. It focuses on the historical context of the study of ancient philosophers.\n\nC. \"After the devastation of World Wars I and II erased the possibility of finding a unified meaning to life, philosophers occupied themselves with finding small differences between the philosophies of past thinkers.\"\n- This suggest that philosophers after World Wars I and II focused on finding small differences between past thinkers. The passage does not discuss philosophers after World Wars I and II. it focuses on the historical context of the study of ancient philosophers.\n\nD. \"Nihilist typically find ways to doubt the postulations of those who came before them.\"\n- This option suggest that nihilists doubt the postulations of those who came before them. The passage does not discuss nihilism or the doubt of postulations of past thinkers. it focuses on the historical context of the study of ancient philosophers.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage best exemplifies the view of the twentieth century that focused on the study of ancient philosophers, which is not directly related to the options provided. However, the closest option that aligns with the passage is:\n\nC. After the devastation of World Wars I and II erased the possibility of finding a unified meaning to life, philosophers occupied themselves with finding small differences between the philosophies of past thinkers.\n\nThis option best exemplifies the view of the passage, which discusses the historical context of the study of ancient philosophers.\n\nFinal answer: C."
