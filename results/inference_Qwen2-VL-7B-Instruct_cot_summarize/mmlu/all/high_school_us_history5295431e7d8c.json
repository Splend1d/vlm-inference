This principle was most famously challenged and ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court in the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. The case was brought about by the Civil Rights Movement, which sought to end segregation and discrimination against African Americans.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement was a response to the unfulfilled promises of the Reconstruction era, which followed the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery. During Reconstruction, the federal government had promised to protect the rights of African Americans, including the right to vote and to receive equal treatment under the law. However, these promises were not fulfilled, and African Americans faced widespread discrimination and violence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Reconstruction"
