The operations in the quotient ring are defined as follows:\n- Addition: \\( (r_1 + I) + ( (r_2 + I) = ( (r_1 + r_2) + I \\)\n- Multiplication: \\( (r_1 + I) \\cdot ( (r_2 + i) = ( (r_1 \\cdot r_2) + I \\)\n\nFor a quotient ring to be commutative, the multiplication operation must be commutative. Since the original ring \\( R \\) is commutative, the multiplication in \\( R \\) is commutative. Therefore, the multiplication in the quotient ring \\( R/I \\) is also commutative. Hence, every quotient ring of a commutative ring is again a commutative ring.\n\n### Statement 2\n\"An ideal \\( N \\) in a ring \\( R \\) with unity 1 is all of \\( R \\) if and only if 1 is in \\( N \\).\"\n\nThis statement is false. An ideal \\( N \\) in a ring \\( R \\) with unity 1 is all of \\( R \\) if and only if \\( N \\) contains the unity 1 of \\( R \\). This is because the unity 1 of \\( R \\) must be in any ideal \\( N \\) of \\( R \\) for \\( N \\) to be an ideal. However, it is not necessarily true that \\( N \\) is all of \\( R \\) just because 1 is in \\( N \\). For example, consider the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) of integers and the ideal \\( 2\\mathbb{Z} \\) ( which consists of all even integers. \\( 2\\mathbb{Z} \\) contains 1 ( (since 1 is an odd integer and \\( 1 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\)), but \\( 2\\mathbb{Z} \\) is not all of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nStatement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. True, False"
