Security studies theory refers to the historical systematic distinction between strategic studies and security studies and the interrelation between general International Relations (IR) theory, security studies, and security theory.\nB. The centre of the security studies debate has been to give form to policy questions - strategy, economy of defence, decision making - and to the systematic division of labour that has governed those distinctions.\nC. Security theory is a specific subset of security studies and one whose development has gone through distinctive phases and divided more strongly than comparable fields, often without mutual recognition.\nD. Security debates structured scholarship centred on offensive versus defensive realism, the relative importance of ideational variables and the role of power and institutions in orders and empires.\n"

Security debates structured scholarship centred on offensive versus defensive realism, the relative importance of ideational variables and the role of power and institutions in orders and empires.\n\nSecurity studies theory is a branch of International Relations (IR) that focuses on the study of security, which includes the study of threats to national security, the role of military power, and the impact of security policies on international relations. The theory is concerned with the study of security in its various forms, including military, economic, and political security, and the ways in which these different forms of security interact with each other.\n\nThe theory is also structured by a number of debates, including the debate between offensive and defensive realism, the debate between the relative importance of ideational variables and the role of power and institutions in orders and empires, and the debate between the role of the state and the role of non-state actors in security. These debates have shaped the development of security studies theory and have led to the emergence of a number of different approaches to the study of security."
