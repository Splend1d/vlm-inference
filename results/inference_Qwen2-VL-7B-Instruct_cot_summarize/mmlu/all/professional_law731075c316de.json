The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: \"Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. \"After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?\n\nA. A tenancy at will was created.\nB. A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.\nC. A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.\nD. The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.\n"

This indicates that the parties intended to have a fixed-term lease, not a tenancy at will ( (option A), which is a tenancy without a fixed term.\n\n2. **Monthly Installments**: The lease agreement specifies monthly installments of $1,000, which is consistent with a periodic tenancy, but the term is fixed at three years, not month-to month ( (option B).\n\n3. **Equitable Term**: The term \"equitable\" suggests that the tenant had a reasonable expectation of the three-year term, which is supported by the lease agreement's explicit mention of a three-year term.\n\n4. **Legal Term**: The term \"legal\" indicates that the three-year term is enforceable and legally binding, which alignss with the fixed term specified in the lease agreement.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term."
