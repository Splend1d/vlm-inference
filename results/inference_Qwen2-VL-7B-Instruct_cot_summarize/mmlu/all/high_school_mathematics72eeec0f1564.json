This means $x = 0.177777...$.\n\nFirst, we'll multiply $x$ by 10 to shift the decimal point one place to the right, because the repeating part starts after the first decimal place. This gives us:\n\n\\[10x = 1.77777...\\]\n\nNext, we'll multiply $x$ by 100 to shift the decimal point two places to the right, because the repeating part starts after the second decimal place. This gives us:\n\n\\[100x = 17.77777...\\]\n\nNow, we'll subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the repeating part:\n\n\\[100x - 10x = 17.77777... - 1.77777...\\]\n\n\\[90x = 16\\]\n\nNow, we solve for $x$:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{16}{90}\\]\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{8}{45}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{8}{45}\\)"
