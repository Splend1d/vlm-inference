This means that for every 50 meters in the park, the model represents 1.5 centimeters.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many 50-meter segments are in 150 meters. We do this by dividing 150 meters by 50 meters:\n\n\\[ \\frac{150 \\text{ meters}}{50 \\text{ meters} = 3 \\]\n\nSo, there are 3 segments of 50 meters in 150 meters.\n\nNext, we multiply the number of segments by the scale factor (1.5 centimeters per segment:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 1.5 \\text{ centimeters} = 4.5 \\text{ centimeters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two trees on the model is 4.5 centimeters.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 4.5 centimeters."
