The key points are:\n\n1. The kings (Shapur, Hormizd, and Bahram) are described as \"King of Kings.\"\n2. Kerdir is given high rank and authority by the kings.\n3. The kings are involved in religious activities, such as performing divine services and establishing Warharan fires.\n4. The Mazdayanian religion and the magi (chief priests) are given great dignity and authority.\n5. The kings' actions are described as leading to the preeminence of the Mazdayanian religion and the prosperity of the magi.\n6. The kings' actions also to the punishment and abandonment of the teachings of Ahriman and the demons.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests.**\n   - This source mentions that the kings gave high rank and authority to Kerdir, the chief priest, and that the kings performed religious services. This source also that the Mazdayanian religion and the magi were given great dignity and authority. This source also that the the kings' actions led to the preeminence of the Mazdayanian religion and the prosperity of the magi.

This source supports this inference.\n\nB. **Rulers were limited in their political authority by powerful religious figures.**\n   - The source does not suggest that the kings were limited by powerful religious figures. Instead, it shows that the kings gave high rank and authority to the chief priest Kerdir and that the kings performed religious services.\n\nC. **Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through victories over foreign peoples.**\n   - The source does not mention any victories over foreign peoples. It focuses on the kings' actions related to religion and the chief priest.\n\nD. **Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through the consent of those they governed.**\n   - The source does not mention any consent from the governed. It focuses on the kings' actions related to religion and the chief priest.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that the source best supports the inference that rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests.\n\nFinal answer: A. Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests."
