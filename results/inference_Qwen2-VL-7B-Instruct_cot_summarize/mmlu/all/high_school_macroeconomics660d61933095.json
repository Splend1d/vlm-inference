In this case, the MPC is 0.90, which means that for every additional dollar of income, 90 cents are consumed and 10 cents are saved.\n\nWhen autonomous private investment increases by $100, the increase in consumption due to the MPC is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Consumption} = \\text{Autonomous Private Investment} \\times \\text{MPC} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Consumption} = \\$100 \\times 0.90 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Consumption} = \\$90 \\]\n\nThis $90 is the increase in aggregate demand due to the increase in consumption. However, the question asks for the total shift in aggregate demand, which includes both the increase in consumption and the increase in investment itself.\n\nSince the autonomous private investment is $100 and the increase in consumption is $90, the total shift in aggregate demand is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Shift in Aggregate Demand} = \\text{Autonomous Private Investment} + \\text{Increase in Consumption} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Shift in Aggregate Demand} = \\$100 + \\$90 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Shift in Aggregate Demand} = \\$190 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $900, which is the increase in consumption due to the MPC."
