Since each player weighs an average of 248 pounds, the expected value of the total weight of four players is:\n\n\\[ E(W) = 4 \\times 248 = 992 \\]\n\nThe standard deviation of the sum of random variables is the square root of the sum of their variances. The variance of a random variable is the square of its standard deviation. Since each player's weight is independent, the variance of the total weight of four players is:\n\n\\[ Var(W) = 4 \\times Var(X) \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the weight of a single player. Given that the standard deviation of a single player's weight is 47 pounds, the variance of a single player's weight is:\n\n\\[ Var(X) = ( 47^2 = 2209 \\]\n\nTherefore, the variance of the total weight of four players is:\n\n\\[ Var(W) = 4 \\times 2209 = 8836 \\]\n\nThe standard deviation of the total weight of four players is the square root of the variance:\n\n\\[ SD(W) = \\sqrt{8836} \\approx 94 \\]\n\nSo, the standard deviation of \\( W \\) is approximately 94 pounds.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 94 pounds"
