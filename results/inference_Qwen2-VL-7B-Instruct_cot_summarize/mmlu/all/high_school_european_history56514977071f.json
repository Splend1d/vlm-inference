                    "text": "To determine the desired outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651 by the Rump Parliament of England, we need to analyze the purpose and implications of the legislation. The Navigation Acts were a series of laws passed by the English Parliament that aimed to control and regulate trade and shipping in order to strengthen England's economy and military power.\n\n1. **Option A: To prevent England's colonies from being bombarded with cheap goods manufactured by their mainland European competitors**\n   - This the Navigation Acts were intended to protect English colonial trade by limiting the importation of goods from mainland Europe. This would prevent English colonies from being flooded with cheaper goods from mainland Europe, which could undermine English colonial trade and the economic interests of the English merchants.\n\n2. **Option B: to reclaim domination of the slave trade from Portugal in order to meet the growing need for slaves for sugar plantations in the English Caribbean colonies**\n   - While the slave trade was a significant aspect of colonial trade, the Navigation Acts were more broadly aimed at controlling trade and shipping rather than specifically targeting the slave trade. The legislation was more about regulating trade routes and ensuring that English ships were used for trade with colonies.\n\n3. **Option C: to end Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies as well as goods to and from England from other countries**\n   - The Navigation Acts were indeed aimed at limiting Dutch maritime trade. By requiring that goods imported into England and its colonies be carried in English ships, the legislation sought to weaken the Dutch East India Company's dominance in the trade between England and its colonies and with other countries.\n\n4. **Option D: to extricate the French from the Atlantic sea trade as well as the cod and whaling industries which at this time were dominated by the French**\n   - While the Navigation Acts did have implications for French trade, the primary focus was on controlling English trade and shipping rather than specifically targeting the French in the Atlantic sea trade or the cod and whaling industries.\n\nGiven the analysis, the desired outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651 by the Rump Parliament of England was to end Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies as well as goods to and from England from other countries.\n\n**Final Answer: C. to end Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies as well as goods to and from England from other countries**"
