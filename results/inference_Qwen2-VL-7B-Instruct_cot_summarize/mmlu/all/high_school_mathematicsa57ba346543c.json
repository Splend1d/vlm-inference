                    "text": " The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. The degree of the polynomial $(x^2+5x+6)^2+(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ is 2, which means the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial is 2.\n\nThe degree of the polynomial $(x^2+5x+6)^2$ is 2 because the degree of $x^2+5x+6$ is 2, and when you square a polynomial, the degree of the resulting polynomial is twice the degree of the original polynomial.\n\nThe degree of the polynomial $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ is 3 because the degree of $px+q$ is 1, and the degree of $x^3+7x^2+3x$ is 3, and when you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the sum of the degrees of the original polynomials.\n\nSince the degree of the resulting polynomial is 2, we must have that the degree of $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ is less than or equal to 2. This means that the degree of $px+q$ must be less than or equal to 1, which means that the degree of $px+q$ is 1. This means that $p$ must be 0 and $q$ must be 0.\n\nTherefore, $p+q = 0+0 = 0$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{-4}$."
