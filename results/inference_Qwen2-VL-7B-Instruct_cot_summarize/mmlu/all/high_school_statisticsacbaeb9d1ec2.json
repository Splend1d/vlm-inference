The shape is approximately normal with a mean of 210 and a standard deviation of 3.75.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Central Limit Theorem**: According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed as long as the sample size is sufficiently large, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In this case, the sample size is 16, which is considered large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply.\n\n2. **Mean of the Sampling Distribution**: The mean of the sampling distribution of the sample means will be the same as the population mean. Therefore, the mean of the sampling distribution is 210 mg/dL.\n\n3. **Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution ( (Standard Error)**: The standard deviation of the sampling distribution ( also the standard error of the mean ( (SE) is calculated as the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. In this case, the population standard deviation is 15 mg/dL, and the sample size is 16. So, the standard error of the mean is:\n\n\\[ SE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{16}} = \\frac{15}{4} = 3.75 \\]\n\nTherefore, the sampling distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal with a mean of 210 mg/dL and a standard deviation of 3.75 mg/dL."
