Fermentation studies in vitro, with human faeces, have shown that soluble and insoluble forms are fermented completely within 24 hours\nC. Fibre sources, such as hemicelluloses, pectins and inulin are rapidly fermented to short chain fatty acids, which have trophic effects on the colon\nD. Stool bulking occurs mainly through the action of insoluble fibres such as cellulose\n"
