Required reserves are typically a percentage of deposits, which is the reserve ratio. Since we don't have the exact reserve ratio, we can express the required reserves as a fraction of the deposits:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required Reserves} = \\text{Reserve Ratio} \\times \\text{Deposits} \\]\n\nGiven that excess reserves increase by $700, this means that the required reserves are $700. Now we can solve for the reserve ratio:\n\n\\[ 700 = \\text{Reserve Ratio} \\times 1000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Reserve Ratio} = \\frac{700}{1000} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Reserve Ratio} = 0.7 \\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n\n\\[ \\text{Reserve Ratio} = 0.7 \\times 100\\% = 70\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 70%."
