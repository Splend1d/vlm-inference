The parents of two students who attend a public high school in the state sue for a declaratory judgment and injunction in federal court, claiming that the state statute violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment. Assume that the federal court decides to hear the case on its merits. Which of the following is the state's LEAST persuasive argument for sustaining the validity of the statute?\n\nA. The state statute benefits the parents or guardians of all the children in private schools, religious and nonreligious.\nB. The primary effect of the state statute is not to advance or inhibit religion.\nC. The administration of the state statute by the department of education does not foster excessive governmental entanglement with religion.\nD. The state statute is a valid exercise of state regulatory action in the field of education.\n"

The state statute is a valid exercise of state regulatory action in the field of education.\n\nThis argument is least persuasive because it focuses on the regulatory aspect of the statute rather than addressing the core issue of whether the statute violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment. The establishment clause is concerned with the potential for government action to either advance or inhibit religion, and the regulatory nature of the statute does not directly address this concern. The other options ( A, B, and C, directly address the potential for the statute to advance or inhibit religion and the potential for excessive government entanglement with religion, which are central to the establishment clause analysis."
