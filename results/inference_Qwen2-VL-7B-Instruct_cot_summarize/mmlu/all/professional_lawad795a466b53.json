Hundreds of tourists poured into the area to work on the large block of ice. They made a gigantic ice palace for a variety of Disney princesses. To handle the needs of a great number of tourists, food vendors came from all over and set up their carts. To solve the problem of congestion, safety, and insufficient security, the town passed an ordinance restricting all street vendors to a specified parking lot area. The food vendors and others were losing money under the regulation. Would a commerce clause challenge to the parking lot requirement be successful by the food stand owners?\n\nA. No, because there is a legitimate state or local interest here which is promoted by an even-handed procedure to control the flow of traffic for public safety, and the impact on commerce is incidental.\nB. No, because the food stands do not have a significant commerce clause claim in that they are still able to sell food, and what they do does not affect interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the state is interfering with the food cart owners' legitimate business operations, which impact heavily on interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because the local interest is favored in a discriminatory manner against all of the food cart owners from other states.\n"

Yes, because the state is interfering with the food cart owners' legitimate business operations, which impact heavily on interstate commerce.\n\nThe commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution ( grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. This clause is often used to challenge state laws that discriminate against out-of-state businesses or interfere with interstate commerce. In this case, the ordinance restricting street vendors to a specified parking lot area could be seen as an interference with the food stand owners' legitimate business operations, particularly if it disproportionately affects out-of-state vendors. If the ordinance has a significant impact on interstate commerce, it could be challenged under the commerce clause."
