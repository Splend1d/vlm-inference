The shop owner sought $100,000 in damages for allegedly defective goods that the distributor had provided under the contract. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. The distributor brought in as a third-party defendant the wholesaler that had provided the goods to the distributor, alleging that the wholesaler had a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?\n\nA. No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.\nB. No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\nC. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.\nD. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.\n"

Yes, because there is no diversity of of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.\n\nFor a federal court to have subject-matter jurisdiction over a case, there must be diversity of citizenship between the parties. Diversity of citizenship requires that the parties are citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 ( (or $50,000 if the case involves a diversity of citizenship claim).\n\nIn this case, the shop owner is domiciled in State A, and the wholesaler is incorporated in State B with its principal place of business in State A. Since both the shop owner and the wholesaler are citizens of the same state (State A), there is no diversity of citizenship between them. Therefore, the federal court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the case, and the distributor's motion to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should be granted."
