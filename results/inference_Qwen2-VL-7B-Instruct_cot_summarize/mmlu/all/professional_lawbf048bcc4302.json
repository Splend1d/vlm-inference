To determine which concept will NOT help a statute or action to be free from establishment of religion suspicions, we need to analyze each option in the context of the three-pronged test under traditional analysis:\n\nA. **It must have a nonspiritual legislative purpose.**\n   - This is a crucial requirement. If a law has a nonspiritual legislative purpose, it means it is not primarily aimed at promoting or inhibiting religion. This helps in ensuring that the law is neutral and does not favor one religion over another.\n\nB. **The statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.**\n   - This requirement ensures that the government does not become too involved in religious matters, which could imply an establishment of of religion. Excessive entanglement can lead to the appearance of favoringing or disfavor towards any particular religion.\n\nC. **The statute must prohibit purely secular considerations.**\n   - This is not a requirement under the traditional three-prong test. The test focuses on whether the law has a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and whether it has a nonspiritual legislative purpose. Prohibiting purely secular considerations does not directly address these primary concerns.\n\nD. **The statute must have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion.**\n   - This is a key requirement of the test. The primary effect of the law must be neutral and neither promotes nor inhibits religion. This ensures that the law is not favoringing or disfavor towards any particular religion.\n\nGiven this analysis, the concept that will NOT help a statute or action to be free from establishment of religion suspicions is:\n\n**C. The statute must prohibit purely secular considerations.**"
