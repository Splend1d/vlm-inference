Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nBased on both passages, which of the following conclusions can be most reasonably made about revolutions?\n\nA. The new liberties gained by revolution are rarely worth the bloodshed.\nB. The new liberties gained by revolution typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities.\nC. The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently.\nD. The new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most reasonable conclusion about revolutions based on the provided passages, let's analyze each option carefully:\n\nA. The new liberties gained by revolution are rarely worth the bloodshed.\n- This option suggests that the benefits of revolution are not worth the sacrifices made during the revolution. However, the passages do not provide enough information to support this claim. They focus more on the distribution of benefits rather than the value of the sacrifices.\n\nB. The new liberties gained by revolution typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities.\n- While the passage by Olympe de Gouge mentions the struggle for women's rights and the passage by Halima Ghomri discusses the lack of benefits for women and peasants, it does not explicitly state that revolutions typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities. It only highlights specific instances.\n\nC. The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently.\n- This option is supported by both passages. Olympe de Gouge's passage mentions that women have not benefited from the Revolution, and Halima Ghomri's passage indicates that despite gaining independence, the benefits of the revolution have not been distributed equally among the population.\n\nD. The new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement.\n- This passage by Halima Ghomri explicitly states that \"nothing has changed\" in terms of economic conditions, despite gaining independence. This supports the idea that economic benefits were not achieved.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most reasonable conclusion based on the provided passages is:\n\nD. The new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement.\n\nFinal answer: D."
