Take this winter:\nThe Shanxi troops were never sent home.\nThe District Officers are demanding the land tax,\nBut where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!\nI honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,\nIt's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry\nAnd live with the neighbors next door.\nBut a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.\"\nDu Fu, \"Ballad of the Army Carts,\" ca. 750 C.E.\nThe succeeding Song dynasty differed from the Tang in that\n\nA. the Song abolished the Confucian civil service exams\nB. the Song sponsored Buddhism to the detriment of Taoism and Confucianism\nC. the Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy\nD. the Song dynasty was originally from outside of China\n"
