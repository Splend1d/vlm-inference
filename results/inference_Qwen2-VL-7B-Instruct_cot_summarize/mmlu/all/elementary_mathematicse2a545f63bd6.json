If there are 8 students remaining after half of the remaining students go to the computer lab, then before they went to the computer lab, there were \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) students.\n2. If there were 16 students before half of them went to the library, then before they went to the library, there were \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\) students.\n\nTherefore, the original number of students in the class was 32.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 32 students."
