Most of the coastline is privately owned by persons who have permanent or vacation residences on their coastal lands. A man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral (i. e. , coastal) land in the state. When the man bought the property, there was a narrow concrete walkway (about 20 feet in length and 5 feet in width) adjoining the land. The walkway, which was designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach, was owned by the State Coastal Commission. When the man moved into his beach house, he noticed that the walkway was rarely used. As a result, the man decided to enclose the walkway and construct a paddle ball court over the entire area. He did so without notifying the State Coastal Commission. He has continued to use this area in excess of the period required for adverse possession. In an appropriate action brought by the man to establish title to the walkway area, which of the following must he establish if he is to prevail?\n\nA. Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\nD. Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement the man must establish to prevail in his action to establish title to the walkway area, we need to analyze the legal principles involved. The man is attempting to establish title to the walkway area by adverse possession, which requires him to prove that he has acquired ownership through continuous, open, and notorious use of the property for a statutory period.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. **Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.**\n   - This statement is generally true but not directly relevant to the man's case. The man is not trying to establish that the state abandoned its interest in the walkway; rather, he is trying to establish his own title through adverse possession.\n\nB. **Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. An irrevocable license would not allow the man to acquire title through adverse possession. An irrevocable license typically grants permission to use the property but does not transfer ownership.\n\nC. **Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.**\n   - This statement is correct and directly relevant. Adverse possession is a legal doctrine that allows a person to acquire title to real property by occupying it openly, notoriously, and continuously for a statutory period, even if the property is owned by another entity. If the state did not use the walkway and the man occupied it continuously, he could potentially establish title through adverse possession.\n\nD. **Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The man is not arguing that there is a defect in the state's title; rather, he is arguing that he has acquired title through adverse possession.\n\nGiven the analysis, the man must establish that real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession ( if he is to prevail in his action to establish title to the walkway area.\n\n**Final Answer: C. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.**"
