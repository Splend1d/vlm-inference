In this case, the perimeter is given as $18$, and we know that the lengths of the two legs are $6$ and $a$, and the length of the hypotenuse is $c$. So we can write the equation for the perimeter as $6 + a + c = 18$.\n\nWe also know from the Pythagorean theorem that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs. So we can write the equation for the Pythagorean theorem as $c^2 = 6^2 + a^2$.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of $c$.\n\nFirst, let's solve the equation for the perimeter for $a$: $a = 18 - 6 - c = 12 - c$.\n\nThen, substitute this into the Pythagorean theorem equation: $c^2 = 6^2 + ( (12 - c)^2$.\n\nSimplify this equation: $c^2 = 36 + 144 - 24c + c^2$.\n\nSubtract $c^2$ from both sides: $0^2 - c^2 = 36 + 144 - 24c$.\n\nSimplify: $0 = 180 - 24c$.\n\nAdd $24c$ to both sides: $24c = 180$.\n\nDivide both sides by $24$: $c = \\frac{180}{24} = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\nSo the length of the hypotenuse $c$ is $\\frac{15}{2}$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}$."
