The neighbor's predecessor had received an easement from the woman's predecessor in title to cross the woman's land for access to the public highway. This access was desired even though the neighbor and his predecessor had other access to public roads. Recently, the woman erected a large solar collector on a portion of her land subject to the easement, even though the woman has other power resources. The location was essential to acquire the maximum sunlight. However, by erecting the collector there, the woman effectively cut off the neighbor's ability to use the easement. The local zoning code permits the use of solar collectors. The neighbor immediately sued to compel the woman to remove the solar collector. Must the solar collector be removed?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor has other means of access.\nB. No, because the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors.\nC. Yes, because the easement remains valid.\nD. Yes, because the woman has other power resources.\n"

Yes, because the easement remains valid.\n\nThe easement granted by the woman's predecessor to the neighbor's predecessor allows the neighbor to use the land for access to the public highway. By erectinging the solar collector, the woman has effectively blocked the neighbor's access to the public highway, which is in violation of the easement. Therefore, the court would likely order the woman to remove the solar collector to restore the neighbor's access to the public highway."
