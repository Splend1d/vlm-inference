In this case, the bank is required to hold $50 in reserves out of $500 in checking deposits, which is a reserve ratio of 10 percent.\nTo calculate the excess reserves, we need to subtract the required reserves from the total deposits. In this case, the excess reserves are $500 - $50 = $450.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 10 percent $450 in excess reserves."
