It indicated a shift towards military containment\n\nNSC 68, issued by the National Security Council in 1950, was a document that marked a significant shift in US Cold War foreign policy. It was a response to the perceived threat posed by the Soviet Union and its expansionist policies. The document advocated for a more aggressive approach to containing the spread of communism, which included increased military spending, a stronger defense posture, and a more assertive foreign policy. This marked a departure from the earlier containment strategy, which was more focused on economic and diplomatic measures."
