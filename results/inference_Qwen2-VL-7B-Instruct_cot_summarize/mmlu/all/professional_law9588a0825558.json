A discriminatory effect.\nD. A discriminatory motive.\n\nThe correct answer is C. A discriminatory effect.\n\nWhile discriminatory effects can be relevant in some cases, they alone are not sufficient to prove intent to discriminate. Intent to discriminate must be shown through evidence of discriminatory motive, facially discriminatory laws, or discriminatory application of neutral laws."
