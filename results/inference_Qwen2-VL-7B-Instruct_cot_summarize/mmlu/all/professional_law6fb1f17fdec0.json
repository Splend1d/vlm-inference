The door opened at 6 a.m. and hundreds of people rushed the entrance for a chance at a hugely discounted holiday gift. When defendant saw that there was a signed copy of a book written by his mother's favorite author, he jumped towards it, only to be blocked by a little old lady with a baseball bat. She was using the bat as a blocking tool, but he was determined to get the book, so he deliberately stuck his leg out in front of her and tripped her. She fell hard and in the process ended up with a blood clot in her leg, which traveled to her heart over a period of weeks, and ultimately caused her death. What crime can the defendant likely be convicted of?\n\nA. First degree murder\nB. Second degree murder\nC. Involuntary manslaughter\nD. voluntary manslaughter\n"

Voluntary manslaughter typically involves a killing that is the result of a sudden and intense passion caused by provocation. In this scenario, the defendant's desire to obtain a book led to a physical altercation with another person, which resulted in her death. The defendant's actions were intentional, but not premeditated, and were a direct result of the provocation (the little old lady with the baseball bat blocking his path. Therefore, the most appropriate charge would be:\n\nD. Voluntary manslaughter"
