The chemical shift is reported in parts per million ( (ppm) relative to a reference standard, typically tetramethylsilane ( (Tms). The chemical shift is affected by the pH of the solution, as the protonation state of the molecule changes with pH.\n\nIn the case of sodium phosphate, the 31P chemical shift is affected by the protonation state of the H2PO4\u203e and HPO42\u2013 ions. The pKa of H2PO4\u203e is approximately 2.12. At pH = pKa, the concentration of the undissociated form of the acid ( H2PO4\u203e is equal to the concentration of the dissociated form of the acid, HPO42\u2013.\n\nThe chemical shift of 31P is affected by the protonation state of the molecule. The chemical shift of H2PO4\u203e is 3.42 ppm, and the chemical shift of HPO42\u2013 is 5.82 ppm. The chemical shift of the undissociated form of the acid, H2PO4\u203e, is closer to the chemical shift of the undissociated form of the acid, H2PO4\u203e, than the chemical shift of the dissociated form of the acid, HPO42\u2013.\n\nTherefore, the chemical shift of the undissociated form of the acid, H2PO4\u203e, is closer to the chemical shift of the undissociated form of the acid, H2PO4\u203e, than the chemical shift of the dissociated form of the acid, HPO42\u2013. The chemical shift of the undissociated form of the acid, H2PO4\u203e, is 3.42 ppm, and the chemical shift of the dissociated form of the acid, HPO42\u2013, is 5.82 ppm.
