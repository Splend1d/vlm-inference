Which of the following is a necessary assumption?\n\nA. The population variances from each group are known.\nB. The population variances from each group are unknown.\nC.

The population of SAT scores from each group is normally distributed.\n\nThe t-test assumes that the data are normally distributed. While the sample size is relatively small ( (five applicants in each group), the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough, typically at least 30. However, for smaller samples, the normality assumption is more critical. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The population of SAT scores from each group is normally distributed."
