One morning, the law clerk came to the office at 9:00 a. m. and started preparing a brief for an upcoming trial. After completing his work at 5:00 p. m. that afternoon, he was about to leave the office when the senior partner of the law firm summoned him. The senior partner told the law clerk that the law firm was representing an important client on an urgent matter that needed immediate research. The law clerk was advised that he would be required to stay at the law office that night and prepare a memorandum. When the law clerk hemmed and hawed, the senior partner handed him the file and said, \"I don't care if you stay all night, but you better have this memo on my desk by 8:00 a. m. tomorrow. \"Following the senior partner's instructions, the law clerk stayed at the office until 2:00 a. m. preparing the memorandum. By the time he finished, the law clerk was totally exhausted after having worked a total of 17 hours that day. Afterward, the law clerk left the office and started to drive home. Because of his fatigue, he didn't see a pedestrian crossing the street.

The pedestrian loses, because the actions of the law firm were not a cause-in-fact of the pedestrian's injuries.\nD. The pedestrian loses, because the law firm is not responsible for the law clerk's negligence in these circumstances.\n"

The pedestrian loses, because the actions of the law firm were not a cause-in-fact of the pedestrian's injuries.\n\nIn tort law, the concept of \"cause-in-fact\" ( or \"proximate cause\" is crucial. This refers to whether the defendant's actions were a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff's injuries. In this case, the law clerk's actions ( staying at the office and finishing the memorandum - were a direct cause of the pedestrian's injuries. The law firm's requirement to stay and finish the memorandum was a contributing factor, but it was not the sole cause of the pedestrian's injuries. The pedestrian's injuries were also caused by the law clerk's actions, not the law firm's requirement."
