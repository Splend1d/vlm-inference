The woman discovered that the service was selling her personal profile information, and the information pertaining to thousands of other members, to third party purchasers for tracking of their Internet activities and buying habits. In her class action breach of contract action against the service, she alleged two theories of damages. First, she contended that she and the class members suffered \"embarrassment and humiliation\" from the disclosure, and second, that she and the others must be compensated for the market value of the information seized. Will the court likely recognize these allegations as sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract?\n\nA. Yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract.\nB. Yes, because these are common types of damages that are authorized in breach of contract cases.\nC. No, because Internet laws protect absolutely all communications and downloads of this nature as part of the service's guaranteed scope of free speech rights.\nD. No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.\n"

No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.\n\nIn a breach of contract case, the court would likely require a plaintiff to demonstrate that they suffered an economic loss or a specific type of damages that are typically recognized in contract law. Embarrassment and humiliation, while certainly distressing to the plaintiff, are generally damages that are not typically recognized in a breach of contract action. Additionally, the unauthorized collection of personal data may be actionable under privacy laws, but it would not typically be considered a breach of contract unless there was a specific contract term that was violated."
