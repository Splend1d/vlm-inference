The neighbor took it and returned with a bank check for the full amount, demanding that the deed be tendered. The property owner then decided that the terms were not reasonable and he returned the money and refused to tender a deed. Neighbor sued for specific performance. The property owner defended on the basis that the neighbor did not accept the agreement's terms and did not sign the document. Neighbor sued for specific performance of the transaction. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the neighbor?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor did not expressly state that he accepted the agreement.\nB. No, because the neighbor had to put his signature on the document to make it a binding contract.\nC. Yes, because neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\nD. Yes, because the property owner created a binding contract when he prepared an agreement containing the agreed terms.\n"

Yes, because neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\n\nIn the context of contract law, the neighbor's action of of tenderinging the full sale price to the property owner is considered a manifestation of assent to the terms of the agreement. This action is often seen as a form of acceptance in a contract, even if the formalities of a signed document were not strictly followed. The property owner's decision to return the money and refuse to tender the deed after the neighbor had already tendered the full sale price does not negate the existence of a contract. The court is likely to rule in favor of the neighbor because the neighbor's conduct of tenderinging the full sale price is sufficient to establish a binding contract."
