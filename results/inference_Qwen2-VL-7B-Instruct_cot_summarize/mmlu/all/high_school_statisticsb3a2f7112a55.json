This is true even if the original population distribution is not normal.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. The mean of the sampling distribution of x-is the same as the mean of the population.\n- This is true. The mean of the sampling distribution of the sample means ( (x\u0304) is equal to the mean of the population ( \u03bc.\n\nII. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of x-is the same as the standard deviation of x- divided by the square root of the sample size.\n- This is not true. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means ( (x\u0304) is equal to the standard deviation of the population ( \u03c3 divided by the square root of the sample size n.\n\nIII. If the sample size is large, the shape of the sampling distribution of x- is approximately normal.\n- This is true. According to the central limit theorem, if the sample size is large ( typically n > 30, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
