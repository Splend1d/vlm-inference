At sentencing the court made additional factual findings, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that resulted in the addition of a 10-year enhancement to the sentence, which was over and above the maximum provided for by the jury's verdict. Defense counsel objected that the judge-made enhancement was unconstitutional and denied his right to a jury trial on that issue. Does counsel have a valid constitutional argument?\n\nA. No, sentencing laws widely authorize the sentencing court to engage in fact-finding that is based on a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. No, it has never been decided that a defendant has a right to be judged on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nC. Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional for a court to use its discretion to fashioning a defendant's sentence.\n"

Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to a jury trial in criminal cases. This includes the right to have the jury determine the facts upon which the defendant's sentence will be based. When a judge makes additional factual findings that result in a sentence that exceeds the maximum allowed by the jury's verdict, it is essentially the judge determining the facts that should have been determined by the jury. This is a violation of the defendant's right to a jury trial, as it is the jury's role to find the facts upon which the sentence will be based, not the judge's."
