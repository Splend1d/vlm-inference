                    "text": "An actress went to a plastic surgeon for removal of an abnormal growth on her right cheek. Under a written contract, the plastic surgeon agreed to surgically remove the growth for $1,000. As the actress subsequently recalled, just before signing the agreement the parties orally agreed that if any additional medical procedures were required during surgery, they would be included in the $1,000 fee. The plastic surgeon, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. As agreed, the surgery was performed on an outpatient basis at the plastic surgeon's office. She applied a localized anesthesia that enabled the actress to remain conscious during surgery. While the operation was being performed, the plastic surgeon noticed another growth on the actress's neck. As the plastic surgeon subsequently recalled, she informed the actress about the growth and recommended that it be removed as well. According to the plastic surgeon's account, the actress orally agreed to have the growth removed for an additional $500. The actress has no recollection of any such oral agreement. The plastic surgeon performed both removal procedures satisfactorily. Following the surgery, the actress paid the plastic surgeon $1,000, but refused to pay any additional money for the removal of the second growth. After unsuccessfully attempting to collect the $500, the plastic surgeon brought suit against the actress to recover the additional fee. At trial, the plastic surgeon objected to the introduction of testimony regarding any oral agreement made before the written contract was signed. By the same token, the actress objected to the introduction of testimony concerning any oral agreement made during surgery. Will the plastic surgeon be entitled to recover the additional $500 if both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed?\n\nA. No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.\nB. No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\nC. Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\nD. Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n\nIn this case, the plastic surgeon performed an additional surgical procedure on the actress's neck without her consent or agreement. This constitutes a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing owed by the plastic surgeon to the actress. The plastic surgeon's failure to inform the actress about the additional growth and obtain her consent for the additional procedure is a violation of the duty of care owed to the patient.\n\nThe doctrine of unjust enrichment is a legal principle that seeks to prevent a person from benefiting at the expense of another without just cause. In this scenario, the plastic surgeon benefited from the additional surgery without the actress's consent or agreement, and the actress was not enriched by the additional surgery. Therefore, the plastic surgeon is entitled to recover the additional $500 from the actress to avoid unjust enrichment.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The oral agreements do not contradict each other. The plastic surgeon's account of the oral agreement is consistent with the actress's account of the oral agreement.\n\nB. The plastic surgeon did not perform a legal duty already owed to the actress. The duty of good faith and fair dealing is a separate duty that arises from the relationship between the parties, not a legal duty owed by the plastic surgeon to the actress.\n\nC. The oral modification of the prior written contract is not fair and equitable in view of the circumstances. The plastic surgeon's failure to inform the actress about the additional growth and obtain her consent for the additional procedure is a violation of the duty of care owed to the patient."
