According to the problem, we have:\n\n\\[3S = 2S + 14\\]\n\nSolving for \\(3S\\), we get:\n\n\\[3S - 2S = 14\\]\n\n\\[S = 14\\]\n\nSo, there are 14 subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements. Let's denote this number as \\(4S\\). The total number of subsets of X is \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in X. Since we know there are 14 subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements, we can use this information to find \\(n\\).\n\nThe number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{3}\\), which is equal to 14. So, we have:\n\n\\[\\binom{n}{3} = 14\\]\n\nWe know that \\(\\binom{n}{3} = \\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!}\\), so:\n\n\\[\\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} = 14\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} = 14\\]\n\n\\[n(n-1)(n-2) = 84\\]\n\nBy trial and error or by solving the equation, we find that \\(n = 6\\) is a solution, as \\(6 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 120\\), which is not correct.
