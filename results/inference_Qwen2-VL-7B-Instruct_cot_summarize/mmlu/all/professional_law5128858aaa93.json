Yes, he conspired to help the friend commit some unknown criminal act.\nB. Yes, he is held to the foreseeability that the friend was going to commit a crime.\nC. No, there was no agreement to conspire to rob a bank.\nD. No, a conspiracy would have required that the gun dealer go to the bank with the friend.\n"

Yes, he is held to the foreseeability that the friend was going to commit a crime.\n\nIn the context of conspiracy law, a person can be held liable for conspiracy even if they did not explicitly agree to commit a specific crime. Instead, they can be held liable if they agreed to commit an act that they knew or should have known would be used to further a criminal objective. In this case, the gun dealer loaned a machine gun to the friend, knowing that the friend needed it to \"make some money.\" The foreseeability of the friend committing a crime (such as robbing a bank with the machine gun) is sufficient to establish the gun dealer's liability for conspiracy to commit bank robbery."
