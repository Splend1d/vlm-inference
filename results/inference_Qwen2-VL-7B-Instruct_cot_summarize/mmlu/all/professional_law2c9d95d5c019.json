The state is willing to sell the crawfish to in-staters for $1 per pound and to out-of-staters who come to the state for $5 per pound. The state felt that the increased fee for out-of-staters was a reasonable contribution toward the protection they received from the state. Assume that the federal court decided to hear the case. The statute is likely to be found\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a valid exercise of the state's police power.\nB. constitutional, because the fee was a reasonable contribution toward the protection that the state government gave nonresidents.\nC. unconstitutional, because it places a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause under Article IV.\n"
