The migrating motor complex is chiefly responsible for peristaltic movement of food after a meal has been consumed\nB. The release of insulin after eating a meal will slow the emptying of the stomach\nC. At the start of a meal, the stomach increases its \"tone\" in order to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents, via the pylorus\nD. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, slows intestinal motility\n"

The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, slows intestinal motility.\n\nThis statement is correct because the presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum can slow down the movement of food through the intestines, as these nutrients require more time to be broken down and absorbed. This slowing down of motility allows for better absorption of nutrients from the food."
