I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nWhich of the following documents encouraged church membership in the Massachusetts Bay Colony?\n\nA.

It established a government for the Plymouth Colony and laid the foundation for self-governance. It does not directly relate to church membership or religious practices in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\n2. **The Fundamental Orders**: Adopted in 1639, this document established the first written constitution in the British colonies. It laid out the framework for government in the Connecticut Colony, which was part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's sphere of influence. It does not specifically address church membership but rather the governance structure.\n\n3. **The Halfway Covenant**: This document was adopted by the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1648. It was a compromise between the strict Puritan beliefs and the more moderate views of some of the colony's leaders. It allowed for a more inclusive church membership, recognizing both those who had been baptized as infants and those who had been baptized as adults. This document directly addresses church membership and its inclusivity.\n\n4. **The Cambridge Agreement**: This document was signed in 1643 and established a system of religious toleration in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It did not encourage church membership but rather the freedom of religious practice.\n\nGiven the analysis, the document that most directly encouraged church membership in the Massachusetts Bay Colony is:\n\n**C. The Halfway Covenant**"
