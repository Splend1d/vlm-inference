Delegates are generally more likely to register as third party voters at some point.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. While some delegates may register as third party voters, it is not a general characteristic of all delegates. Many delegates are loyal to the party they they represent and do not switch their registration.\n\nB. The majority of the general population is more educated than the delegates.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The education level of delegates can vary widely, and it is not accurate to generalize that the majority of the general population is more educated than the delegates.\n\nC. Delegates typically have little interest in politics.\n- This statement is not true. Delegates are chosen because they are active and interested in politics, as they represent the party's base and are expected to be knowledgeable about political issues.\n\nD. Typically, the general population is less ideological than the delegates.\n- This statement is true. Delegates are often chosen based on their ideological alignment with the party, and they are expected to be more ideologically consistent than the general population, which tends to be more diverse in its political views.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Typically, the general population is less ideological than the delegates."
