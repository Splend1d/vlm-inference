A hooded sweatshirt and bandana concealed the rest of his face. A few days later, while the victim waited to be interviewed, she observed the defendant being escorted through the courthouse, in jail clothing, and restrained by handcuffs and leg irons. She identified him as the perpetrator shortly thereafter. Will the court allow that identification into evidence?\n\nA. No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.\nB. No, because prior statements of identification are considered hearsay and never allowed into evidence.\nC. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.\nD. Yes, because the witness' recognition of someone is all that is needed; the reliability or credibility of it is subject to cross examination.\n"

Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.\n\nIn the United States, eyewitness identification is generally admissible in court, provided it meets certain reliability standards. The reliability of of an identification can be assessed by considering factors such as the witness's opportunity to observe the perpetrator, the witness's level of attention and alertness at the time of the offense, and the witness's ability to recall and describe the perpetrator accurately. In this case, the victim saw the perpetrator's eyes, which is considered a reliable basis for identification. Therefore, the court is likely to allow the identification into evidence."
