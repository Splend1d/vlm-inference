Yes, conversion is an intentional tort and the pizza owner acted intentionally to convert and did convert part of the burger business.\n\nExplanation: Conversion is an intentional tort that occurs when one person wrongfully appropriates another's personal property to his own use and benefit. In this scenario, the pizza owner's false statements about the burger restaurant's ingredients and the resulting loss of customers and business income can be considered as an intentional act to convert part of the burger business. The pizza owner's actions can be seen as an attempt to wrongfully appropriate the burger restaurant's business by causing harm to the burger restaurant's reputation and customer base. Therefore, the burger restaurant owner can sue for conversion."
