We are given that $F = \\$1.00$ per unit of volume.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Bright is $60\\%$ more expensive than Fresh, so $B = F + 0.6F = 1.6F$. We also know that Glow is $25\\%$ less expensive than Bright, so $G = B - 0.25B = 0.75B$. Substituting $B = 1.6F$ into the equation for $G$, we get $G = 0.75 \\times 1.6F = 1.2F$.\n\nWe also know that Glow has $33\\frac{1}{3}\\%$ more volume than Fresh, so $G = F + 0.33\\frac{1}{3}F = 1.33\\frac{1}{3}F$. We can substitute $F = \\$1.00$ into this equation to get $G = 1.33\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\$1.00 = \\$1.33\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nWe also know that Glow is $25\\%$ less expensive than Bright, so $G = B - 0.25B = 0.75B$.
