In hard cases judges generally decide cases on the basis of rights.\n- This proposition aligns with Dworkin's claim because it suggests that judges rely on rights to make decisions, implying that there is a single correct answer.\n\nB. The rights of the parties feature in the determination of most cases before the courts.\n- This proposition also aligns with Dworkin's claim because it suggests that rights are a significant factor in most legal decisions, implying that there is a single correct answer.\n\nC. Judges exercise strong discretion.\n- This proposition is inconsistent with Dworkin's claim. If judges exercise strong discretion, it implies that there might be multiple interpretations or answers to a legal question, which contradicts the idea that there is only one right answer.\n\nD. Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.\n- This proposition align with Dworkin's claim because it suggests that judges consider historical context, implying that there is a single correct answer.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the proposition that is most inconsistent with Dworkin's claim is:\n\nC. Judges exercise strong discretion.\n\nFinal answer: C. Judges exercise strong discretion."
