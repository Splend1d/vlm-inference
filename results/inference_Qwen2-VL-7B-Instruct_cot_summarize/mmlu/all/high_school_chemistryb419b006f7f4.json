This means that 50 grams of NaOH are dissolved in 100 grams of water. \n\nAssuming the density of water is 1 g/mL, we can calculate the volume of water as 100 mL. \n\nThe mmmol of NaOH can be calculated as:\n\n100 mL * 1 g/mL * 50 g/100 mL * 1 mol/40 g = 1.25 mol\n\nThe total mmol of the solution can be calculated as:\n\n1.25 mol NaOH + 100 mL * 1 g/mL * 1 mol/18 g = 6.94 mol\n\nThe mole fraction of NaOH can be calculated as:\n\n1.25 mol NaOH / 6.94 mol total = 0.180\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed in the options provided."
