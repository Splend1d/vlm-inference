According to the contract, settlement (or closing) was to take place on March 1 of the same year. On January 20, a barn on the property was destroyed by fire. When the buyer was notified of the loss the following day, he contacted the seller and told him that the deal was off because of the fire. As a result, the buyer filed suit against the seller on January 25 for a refund of his down payment of $5,000. In his suit, the buyer will be unsuccessful and will be obliged to complete the contract if the court determines that on January 20\n\nA. the buyer held the legal title to the farm.\nB. the seller held the legal title to the farm.\nC. the buyer held the equitable title to the farm.\nD. the seller held the equitable title to the farm.\n"

The equitable title is the buyer's right to possession and use of the property, while the legal title is the seller's right to transfer ownership.\n\nIn this scenario, the buyer had made a down payment and presumably had taken steps to secure the property, such as inspecting the property or make arrangements for financing. The fact that the buyer was notified of the loss the following day and immediately contacted the seller indicates that the buyer had a strong interest in the property and was actively engaged in the transaction. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the buyer held the equitable title to the farm on January 20.\n\nIf the court determines that the buyer held the equitable title to the farm on January 20, the buyer would be entitled to complete the contract and receive the property, even if the barn was destroyed by fire. The seller would be obligated to transfer ownership to the buyer, and the buyer would be responsible for any damages resulting from the fire."
