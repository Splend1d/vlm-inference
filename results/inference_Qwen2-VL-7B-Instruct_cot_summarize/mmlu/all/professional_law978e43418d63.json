Both requests are denied by the judge, and the defendant is found guilty. The maximum penalty for shoplifting is a $500 fine and six months in jail. The defendant is sentenced to three months in jail, which he is allowed to serve on weekends in the county detention center. The defendant claims that his constitutional rights have been violated. Is he correct?\n\nA. No, because his actual sentence was only three months.\nB. Yes, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.\nC. Yes, because the defendant was denied the right to a jury trial.\nD. Yes, because the defendant was denied both the right to counsel and the right to a jury trial.\n"
