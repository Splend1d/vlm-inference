Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ C = k \\cdot P \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the concentration of the dissolved gas ( (M), \\( k \\) is the Henry's law constant ( (M/L atm), and \\( P \\) is the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid ( (atm).\n\nGiven:\n- Henry's law constant \\( k = 30.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\cdot \\text{M}^{-1} \\)\n- Partial pressure of CO2 \\( P = 2.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\)\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for \\( C \\):\n\n\\[ C = k \\cdot P \\]\n\n\\[ C = 30.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\cdot \\text{M}^{-1} \\cdot 2.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\]\n\n\\[ C = 60.0 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nTherefore, the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the vessel is 60.0 M, which is not listed among the options provided.
