She left the store without paying for it. Unknown to the girl, the store security guard saw what she had done. He immediately ran outside, grabbed her arm, and accused her of stealing the candy bar. The girl broke down and started crying. She then told the security guard that she was hungry because she hadn't eaten any lunch. At a juvenile delinquency court hearing, the security guard proposes to testify to what the girl said. Upon objection by the girl's attorney, the strongest reason for admitting her statement will be because\n\nA. Miranda warnings need not be given to juveniles.\nB. the security guard's remark was an accusation, not an interrogation.\nC. the security guard was not employed by an agency of the government.\nD. the girl was not in custody.\n"

The girl was not in custody.\n\nIn the context of the Miranda warnings, which are designed to protect individuals from self-incrimination during custodial police interrogations, the statement made by the security guard does not constitute an interrogation. The security guard's action of of grabbing the girl's arm and accusing her of stealing the candy bar does not meet the criteria for custodial interrogation. Therefore, the Miranda warnings do not apply in this situation."
