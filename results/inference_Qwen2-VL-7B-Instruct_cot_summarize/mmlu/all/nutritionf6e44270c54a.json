The content of vitamin D in foods depends on the soil in which the food was grown so is not related to wealth or age.\nC. Most vitamin D in the body does not come from food so access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status.\nD.

Most vitamin D in the body does not come from food so access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status.\n\nVitamin D is primarily synthesized in the skin under the influence of sunlight, and it can also be obtained through dietary sources such as fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified foods. However, the majority of vitamin D in the body is produced endogenously through the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 ( (cholecalciferol) in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight. Therefore, access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status, as the body can produce sufficient vitamin D through sunlight exposure."
