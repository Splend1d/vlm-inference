In this case, the common prime factors are 2 and 5, with the lowest powers being \\(2^3\\) and \\(5^1\\).\n\nTherefore, the common factors are the numbers that can be formed by multiplying these common prime factors in all possible combinations. This means we can have \\(2^0\\), \\(2^1\\), \\(2^2\\), and \\(2^3\\) for the power of 2, and \\(5^0\\) and \\(5^1\\) for the power of 5. Multiplying these together gives us the possible combinations:\n\n- \\(2^0 \\times 5^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 5^0 = 2\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\times 5^0 = 4\\)\n- \\(2^3 \\times 5^0 = 8\\)\n- \\(2^0 \\times 5^1 = 5\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 5^1 = 10\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\times 5^1 = 20\\)\n- \\(2^3 \\times 5^1 = 40\\)\n\nSo, there are 8 positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 8."
