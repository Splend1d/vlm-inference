Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will.\n\nSavigny's notion of a Volksgeist emphasizes the idea that law is a reflection of the collective spirit or essence of a society, which is shaped by its culture and traditions. Therefore, it is least likely to follow logically from Savigny's notion that law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will, as this suggests a more individualistic and modern approach to lawmaking."
