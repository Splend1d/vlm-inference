There is a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin by at least 23 points in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual.\n\nExplanation:\nThe 95% confidence interval estimate of the difference in mean cholesterol level lowering between Lipitor and niacin is given as (18, 41). This means that we are 95% confident that the true difference in mean cholesterol level lowering between Lipitor and niacin lies somewhere between 18 and 41 points. \n\nOption C correctly interprets this confidence interval by stating that there is a 95% probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin by at least 23 points in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual. This is because the lower bound of the confidence interval is 18, and adding 23 to this lower bound gives 41, which is the upper bound of the confidence interval. Therefore, we can be 95% confident that Lipitor will outperform niacin by at least 23 points."
