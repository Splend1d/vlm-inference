                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the functionality of the \"Magic memory\" and determine which statements are true based on its operations.\n\n1. **Read operation**: Returns the number of Read operations since the last Clear operation.\n2. **Clear operation**: Sets the magic memory to zero and resets the count of of Read operations.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n**I. It can provide the functionality of an atomic Test-and-Set.**\n- The Test-and-Set operation involves setting a variable to a new value and then checking if it was set. The \"Magic memory\" does not have a direct mechanism to check if it was set. Therefore, it cannot provide the functionality of an atomic Test-and-Set.\n\n**II. It can be used to coordinate processes running on a shared-memory multiprocessor.**\n- The \"Magic memory\" can be used to coordinate processes by tracking the number of Read operations since the last Clear. This can be useful for synchronization purposes, such as ensuring that processes do not access the memory before it has been cleared.\n\n**III. It is only useful on a multiprocessor.**\n- While the \"Magic memory\" can be useful in a multiprocessor setting, it is not exclusive to multiprocessors. It can also be used in a single-processor system as well.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. II only**"
