This is crucial in multiprogrammed systems where multiple users can run different instances of the same program simultaneously.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. The program is a macro:\n- Macros are typically used for code generation and do not have the same level of reentrancy as programs. They are not designed to be called multiple times from different threads or processes.\n\nII. The program is recursive:\n- Recursive programs can be called multiple times from the same thread or process, but they do not inherently support sharing across different threads or processes without additional synchronization mechanisms. Recursive programs can be made reentrant by ensuring that they are thread-safe.\n\nIII. The program is reentrant:\n- A reentrant program is designed to be safely called multiple times from different threads or processes without causing any unintended side effects. This is essential for sharing programs among multiple users in a multiprogrammed system.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. III only\n\nThe program must be reentrant in order to be shared safely among multiple users in a multiprogrammed system."
