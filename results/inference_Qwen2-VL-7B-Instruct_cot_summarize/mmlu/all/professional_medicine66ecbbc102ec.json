On the second day after admission he developed a pneumothorax on the right side that required tube thoracostomy. An air leak is noted for the next 24 hours, which now has stopped. However, the patient has become restless and combative. Breath sounds are diminished in the right side of the chest and the patient now has tachycardia. Blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. After ordering a STAT portable x-ray of the chest, which of the following is the most appropriate step?\n\nA. Administer \u03b2-blocking medications\nB. Administer alprazolam\nC. Remove the patient from the ventilator and ventilate him with a bag-valve mask\nD. Reposition the chest tube\n"

Reposition the chest tube\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including restlessness, combative behavior, diminished breath sounds, and tachycardia, suggest that the pneumothorax has not fully resolved, and the air leak may have caused tension pneumothorax. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention. Repositioning the chest tube to ensure proper drainage and resolution of the pneumothorax. If the tension pneumothorax persists, the patient may require surgical intervention."
