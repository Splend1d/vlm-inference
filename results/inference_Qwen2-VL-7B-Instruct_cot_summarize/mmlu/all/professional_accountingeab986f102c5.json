Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence. Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?\n\nA. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\nB. Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\nC. No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\nD. No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n"

No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\n\nIn this scenario, Frost was declared incompetent, which means that Frost no longer had the legal capacity to enter into contracts. Since Long placed the order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf, and Grant was unaware of Frost's incompetence, the contract would not be binding on Frost. Instead, the contract would be binding on Long, who had the authority to place the order. Therefore, Grant would not be liable to Frost or Frost's legal representative."
