Carl baked a total of 18 pies, with 6 of those pies being for his family. The remaining pies were baked for the school fund-raisers.\n\nThe total number of pies baked for the school fund-raisers is \\(18 - 6\\), because we subtract the 6 pies baked for his family from the total. Since there were 4 school fund-raisers, and each raised the same number of pies, we can represent the number of pies baked for each fund-raiser as \\(p\\).\n\nTherefore, the equation to find \\(p\\) is:\n\n\\[4 \\times p = 18 - 6\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[4 \\times p = 12\\]\n\nSo, the correct number sentence to find the number of pies, \\(p\\), Carl baked for each of the school fund-raisers is:\n\n\\[4 \\times p = 12\\]\n\nThis matches option C: \\(4 + 6 \\times p = 18\\), but it's important to note that the correct form should be \\(4 \\times p = 12\\), which is not listed among the options provided. The closest correct option in the given choices is:\n\nC. \\(4 + 6 \\times p = 18\\)\n\nHowever, this is not the correct equation to solve for \\(p\\). The correct equation should be:\n\n\\[4 \\times p = 12\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided."
