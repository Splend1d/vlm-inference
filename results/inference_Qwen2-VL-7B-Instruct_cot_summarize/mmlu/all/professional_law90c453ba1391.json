When she picked up the car, there was a bill for $5,000 on the dash board. All of the services and parts were workmanlike, not defective and pertained to the areas in the instructions. She refused to pay, claiming that there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval. Can she be held responsible for contractual services performed?\n\nA. No, because there is always an implication that the provider must get permission before doing work not approved.\nB. Yes, because the circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent.\nC. No, because a contract cannot be based on implications and guess work.\nD. Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.\n"

Yes, because the circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent.\n\nIn this scenario, the customer left written instructions with the mechanic, which can be considered as a form of communication that indicates the customer's expectations and intentions regarding the services to be performed. The mechanic, based on the written instructions and the customer's past practice of leaving her car at the shop with similar instructions, could reasonably infer that the customer intended to have the services performed as described. This establishes an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent, where both parties understood and agreed to the terms of the contract.\n\nTherefore, the customer cannot be held responsible for contractual services performed because there was an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent."
