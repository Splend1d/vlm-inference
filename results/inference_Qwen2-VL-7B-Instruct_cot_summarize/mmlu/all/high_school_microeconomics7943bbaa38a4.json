The good is normal and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.\n\nWhen a price decrease occurs for a normal good, the income effect typically dominates the substitution effect. The income effect suggests that a decrease in price leads to an increase in purchasing power, which allows consumers to buy more of the good. The substitution effect suggests that a decrease in price makes the good relatively cheaper compared to other goods, leading consumers to substitute the cheaper good for the more expensive one. However, for a normal good, the income effect is generally stronger, causing consumers to buy more of the good even though its price has decreased. This results in an upward-sloping demand curve, where an increase in price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded."
