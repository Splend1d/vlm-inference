The mall has a Social Security Office and the real estate is owned by the state. The grocery store pays rent to the state. Any type of picketers are prevented from entering the mall to picket inside by the owners of the mall, who also pay rent to the state for the land, and there is no outside entrance of the store at the mall where the picketers could strike. If the picketers go before the court to claim violations of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, will state action likely be found against the store and the mall owners?\n\nA. No, under the mantle of authority test there are not enough connections between the state and the private actions of the mall and the store.\nB. No, because a private actor can never be held liable in a constitutional rights claim that requires state action.\nC. Yes, because the equal protection balancing test shows that there is state action in renting the property to private actors who are discriminating.\nD. Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.\n"

Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.\n\nIn the context of state action, the Supreme Court has established that state action can be found when the state has \"exerted[ed] a coercive influence over the private actor.\" This is known as the \"coercive influence\" test. In this case, the state's ownership of the mall and the Social Security Office, along with the fact that the grocery store pays rent to the state, suggests that the state has exerteded a coercive influence over the mall and the store. This influence is sufficient to cloak the mall and store with state action status, making the mall and store liable for any First Amendment violations that occur.\n\nTherefore, the picketers' claim of violations of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights is likely to be found to have state action, and the court may find that the mall and store are liable for any such violations."
