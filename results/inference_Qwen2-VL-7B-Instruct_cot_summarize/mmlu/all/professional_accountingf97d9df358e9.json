The last day of this period is June 30, which is a Wednesday. Therefore, the employees worked for 3 days ( (June 29, June 30, and July 1) before the next payroll is due on July 15.\n\n3. **Accrual Calculation:** \n   - For June 29: $10,000 / 10 days * 3 days = = $3,000\n   - For June 30: $10,000 / 10 days * 1 day = = $1,000\n\n4. **Total Accrual for June 30:** $3,000 + $1,000 = = $4,000\n\n5. **Total Salaries Expense for June:** $10,000 ( (paid on June 18) + $4,000 ( (accrued for June 30) = = $14,000\n\nTherefore, the amount that Lind Co. should report as salaries expense in its income statement for the month ended June 30 is $14,000.\n\n**Answer: A. $24,000**"
