The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?\n\nA. No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.\nB. Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\nC. No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.\nD. Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.\n"

This is because the prosecution attempted to enter the bank's daily deposit and tally records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. The defense counsel's objection was based on hearsay, and the court would need to ensure that the evidence is properly authenticated before it can be admitted. The hearsay exception for business records typically requires some form of certification or testimony to establish the authenticity and reliability of the records."
