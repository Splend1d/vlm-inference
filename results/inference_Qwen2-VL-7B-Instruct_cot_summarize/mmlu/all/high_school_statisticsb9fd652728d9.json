The manager takes a random sample of 10 salespeople from each location independently and records the sales revenue generated by each person during the last four weeks. He decides to use a t-test to compare the mean sales revenue at the two locations. Which of the following assumptions is necessary for the validity of the t-test?\n\nA. The population standard deviations at both locations are equal.\nB. The population standard deviations at both locations are not equal.\nC.

The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.\n\nThe t-test is a parametric test that assumes that the data are normally distributed. This assumption is crucial for the t-test to be valid, especially when the sample sizes are small ( as in this case ( (n=10 for each location). \n\nWhile the population standard deviations being equal ( (A) or not equal ( (B) can affect the choice of the t-test ( (t-test for equal variances or t-test for unequal variances), the normality assumption is fundamental for the t-test to be reliable. If the data are not normally distributed, the t-test may not be the most appropriate test to use, and alternative non-parametric tests might be considered."
