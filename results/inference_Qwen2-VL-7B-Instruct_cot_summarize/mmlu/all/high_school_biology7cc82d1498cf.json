Several codons code for the same amino acid.\n\nA point mutation can have no negative impact on the protein formed from a sequence in DNA if the mutation occurs in a codon that codes for the same amino acid as the original codon. This is because the genetic code is degenerate, meaning that multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. Therefore, a mutation in one of these codons will not change the amino acid that is incorporated into the protein."
