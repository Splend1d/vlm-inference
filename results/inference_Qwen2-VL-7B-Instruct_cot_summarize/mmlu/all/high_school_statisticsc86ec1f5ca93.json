Concerned that a production process change might have lowered the thrust, an inspector tests a sample of units, calculating a mean of 9350 pounds with a z-score of -2.46 and a P-value of 0.0069. Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion?\n\nA. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9350 pounds.\nB. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9500 pounds.\nC. 0.69% of the time an engine produced under the new process will have a thrust over 9500 pounds.\nD. There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.\n"

There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.\n\nThe z-score of -2.46 and the P-value of 0.0069 indicate that the sample mean of 9350 pounds is significantly lower than the mean thrust of of 9500 pounds. This suggests that the new process is likely producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds."
