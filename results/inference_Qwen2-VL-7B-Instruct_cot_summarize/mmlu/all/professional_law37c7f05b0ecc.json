During their conversation, the man said, \"So what if I killed him, big deal. \" The man's statement was overheard by the presiding judge as he was walking down the corridor to the rest room. The judge then informed the prosecuting attorney of the man's comment. After trial is reconvened, the prosecutor calls the judge as a witness to testify to what he heard the defendant tell his attorney. Upon objection by defendant's attorney, may the judge be called as a witness?\n\nA. No, because the man's statement was a confidential communication and protected under the attorney-client privilege.\nB. No, because a judge may not testify in a matter over which he or she is presiding.\nC. Yes, because a judge has a duty to disclose incriminating evidence to the prosecution.\nD. Yes, because the man's statement was not a confidential communication.\n"

No, because the man's statement was a confidential communication and protected under the attorney-client privilege.\n\nThe attorney-client privilege protects communications between a client and their attorney. This privilege is designed to encourage open and honest communication between attorneys and their clients, which is essential for effective legal representation. If the judge were to testify about the statement made by the defendant to his attorney, it would violate the attorney-client privilege and potentially undermine the integrity of the legal process."
