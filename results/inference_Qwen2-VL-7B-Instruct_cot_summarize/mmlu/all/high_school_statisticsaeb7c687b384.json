Volunteers who have had problems with such injuries were randomly assigned to use either a traditional keyboard or the new design. A significance test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis that a smaller proportion of those using the new keyboard will suffer injuries than those using the traditional keyboard. The resulting P-value was 0.07. Which is a correct interpretation of this P-value?\n\nA. The null hypothesis should be rejected.\nB. The null hypothesis should be accepted.\nC. There is a 7% chance that the null hypothesis is correct.\nD. There is a 7% chance of getting a difference between the two groups at least as large as the observed difference if the new keyboard is really no better at preventing injuries.\n"

There is a 7% chance of getting a difference between the two groups at least as large as the observed difference if the new keyboard is really no better at preventing injuries.\n\nThis interpretation is based on the understanding that a P-value is the probability of observing the data (or a more extreme result if the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the proportion of injuries between the two groups. A P-value of 0.07 suggests that if the new keyboard is no better at preventing injuries, there is a 7% chance of observing the difference in injury rates or a more extreme difference in the data. Since this P-value is greater than the commonly used significance level of 0.05, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis."
