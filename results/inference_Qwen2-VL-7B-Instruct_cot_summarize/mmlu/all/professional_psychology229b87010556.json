The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( X \\) is the score,\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean,\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nLet's calculate the z-scores for each exam:\n\n1. **English Exam:**\n   - Score: 150\n   - Mean: 125\n   - Standard Deviation: 20\n   - Z-score: \\( \\frac{{(150 - 125)}{20} = \\frac{25}{20} = 1.25 \\)\n\n2. **Math Exam:**\n   - Score: 100\n   - Mean: 90\n   - Standard Deviation: 10\n   - Z-score: \\( \\frac{({100 - 90})}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1 \\)\n\n3. **Chemistry Exam:**\n   - Score: 55\n   - Mean: 45\n   - Standard Deviation: 5\n   - Z-score: \\( \\frac{({55 - 45})}{5} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\)\n\n4. **History Exam:**\n   - Score: 30\n   - Mean: 30\n   - Standard Deviation: 5\n   - Z-score: \\( \\frac{({30 - 30})}{5} = \\frac{0}{5} = 0 \\)\n\nNow, let's compare the z-scores:\n- English: 1.25\n- Math: 1\n- Chemistry: 2\n- History: 0\n\nThe highest z-score is for the Chemistry Exam (2. Therefore, the young man performed best on the Chemistry Exam.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. Chemistry"
