On October 31, the owner entered into a written contract with a worker that provided that the worker would be employed for the months of November and December to work at the retail store for $2,000 per month. At the end of November, the owner noticed that business had not increased as much as he had expected. The owner informed the worker that unless he agreed to take a cut in his salary, he would be fired. Reluctantly, on December 1, the worker orally consented to a salary reduction of $500 for the month of December. Which of the following statements regarding the December 1 agreement between the owner and the worked is most accurate?\n\nA. It effectuated a valid reformation of their original written contract.\nB. It effectuated a valid modification of their original written contract.\nC. It effectuated a novation of their original written contract.\nD. It did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract.\n"

It effectuated a valid modification of their original written contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the original written contract was for the worker to be employed for the months of November and December at a salary of $2,000 per month. However, due to a change in business expectations, the owner and the worker agreed to modify the original contract by reducing the salary for December to $1,500. This modification was made orally on December 1, which is a valid way to modify a written contract as long as both parties agree to the new terms.\n\nA reformation of the contract would typically involve correcting a mistake in the original contract, which is not the case here. A novation would involve a new contract replacing the old one, which is also not the case here as the original contract terms were not replaced but modified. The original contract terms were not altered, so option D is incorrect."
