(i) and (iii) only.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\ni) The acf and pacf will always be identical at lag one whatever the model.\n- This statement is false. The acf and pacf can be different at lag one depending on the model. For example, in an AR(p model, the acf will decay exponentially, while the pacf will drop to zero at lag one.\n\nii) The pacf for an MA(q) model will in general be non-zero beyond lag q.\n- This statement is false. The pacf for an MA(q) model will be zero beyond lag q.\n\niii) The pacf for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p.\n- This statement is true. The partial autocorrelation function (pacf) for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p.\n\niv) The acf and pacf will be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model.\n- This statement is false. The acf and pacf will not be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
