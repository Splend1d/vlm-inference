Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe author of the above passage claims: \"Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest.\" What does he mean by this?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine what the author means by \"Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest,\" we need to carefully analyze the passage and understand the context.\n\nThe passage discusses the decline of the Roman Empire, attributing it to the natural and inevitable effects of its greatness. It explains that as the empire grew in size and prosperity, the causes of its decay multiplied. The author suggests that the empire's success led to a weakening of its internal structures and discipline, which eventually led to its downfall.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown.\n- This option is not directly supported by the passage. The passage does not specifically mention that the rulers became too rich and were overthrown.\n\nB. The empire became too large to control effectively.\n- This option aligns with the passage. The author suggests that as the empire expanded, the causes of its destruction multiplied, implying that the empire became too large to control effectively.\n\nC. Decay begins the minute something begins to grow.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not claim that decay starts immediately upon growth but rather that it is a natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.\n\nD. Conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not suggest that conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive but rather that they are part of the natural and inevitable decline of the empire.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate interpretation of the author's claim is:\n\nB. The empire became too large to control effectively.\n\nFinal answer: B. The empire became too large to control effectively."
