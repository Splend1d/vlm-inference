The phases of the Earth that you would see would be:\n\nA. New, first quarter, full, third quarter, and last quarter.\n\nThis is because Venus orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the Earth, so it would appear to be moving in the opposite direction as well. As a result, the phases of the Earth would appear to be in reverse order from what we see from Earth."
