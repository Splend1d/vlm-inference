The husband was present and denied the allegation. Police asked for permission to search the premises for drugs, which was consented to by the wife. The husband, however, refused to consent to the search. The police went ahead anyway and found drugs in the husband's belongings. After being arrested on drug charges, the husband filed a motion for suppression of the evidence based on lack of consent. What should be the likely decision of the trial court?\n\nA. The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.\nB. The search was valid because the cases say that one occupant's consent to the search overrules the other occupant's refusal to consent.\nC. The search was valid because the wife's statement established probable cause that a crime was being committed \u0080\u0093 this created exigent circumstances for the search.\nD. The search was invalid because, even though consent was given, the police must first attempt to get a search warrant to enter a home.\n"

The search was valid because the wife's statement established probable cause that a crime was being committed, which created exigent circumstances for the search.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Probable Cause and Exigent Circumstances**: The wife's statement that her husband was a heavy cocaine user and abusive provided probable cause for the police to believe that a crime was being committed. This probable cause, combined with the immediate threat of danger (due to the domestic dispute and the potential for further abuse, created exigent circumstances that justified the warrantless search.\n\n2. **Consent of Co-Occupant**: The presence of the husband and his refusal to consent to the search does not necessarily invalidate the search. The exigent circumstances doctrine allows the police to bypass the requirement of obtaining a warrant when there is a substantial and immediate threat to public safety or the safety of the police officers.\n\n3. **Consent of the Wife**: The wife's consent to the search, even if given under duress or coercion, can still be considered valid if it was given voluntarily and not under duress or coercion. In this case, the wife's statement and the circumstances surrounding the domestic dispute suggest that her consent was given voluntarily and in the context of exigent circumstances.\n\n4. **Police Action**: The police acted reasonably in the circumstances, given the probable cause and the exigent circumstances present. They did not need to obtain a warrant before proceeding with the search.\n\nTherefore, the trial court is likely to find that the search was valid under the exigent circumstances doctrine, and the evidence found during the search should not be suppressed."
