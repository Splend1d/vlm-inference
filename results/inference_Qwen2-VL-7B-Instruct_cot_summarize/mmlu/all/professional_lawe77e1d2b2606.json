                    "text": "The strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise would be unenforceable is:\n\nA. It was not supported by new consideration.\n\nIn contract law, a promise must be supported by new consideration for it to be enforceable. Consideration is something of value exchanged between the parties. In this case, the debtor's promise to pay the $750 debt on September 1 was not supported by any new consideration from the creditor. The creditor did not promise to do anything in return for the debtor's promise. Therefore, the promise lacks the necessary consideration to make it enforceable.\n\nThe other options are less compelling:\n\nB. It was violative of the statute of frauds.\nThe statute of frauds requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. However, the debt in this case was already barred by the statute of limitations, so the statute of frauds is not relevant.\n\nC. the debt was already barred by the statute of limitations.\nThe debt was already barred by the statute of limitations, so the debtor's promise to pay it would not revive the debt. However, this does not make the promise unenforceable.\n\nD. there was no mutuality of obligation.\nMutuality of obligation means that both parties must have a legal obligation to perform. In this case, the debtor had a legal obligation to pay the debt, and the creditor had a legal obligation to accept the payment. Therefore, there was mutuality of obligation."
