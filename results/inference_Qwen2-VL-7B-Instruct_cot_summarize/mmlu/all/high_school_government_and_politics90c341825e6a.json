Fewer than 5% of petitions for writs of certiorari are granted by the Supreme Court.\n\nThis statement is accurate because the Supreme Court grants certiorari very selectively, typically only taking a small fraction of the cases that are petitioneded to them. The other options are not accurate:\n\nB. The Supreme Court grants writs of certiorari only when there is a \"circuit split.\"\n- This is not accurate. The Supreme Court may grant certiorari for other reasons as well, such as to resolve a conflict of law or to address a significant constitutional issue.\n\nC. The lower court's ruling is overturned if the Supreme Court denies a writ of certiorari.\n- This is not accurate. The denial of a writ of certiorari does not automatically overturn the lower court's ruling. The Supreme Court's decision to deny certiorari is not a final ruling on the merits of the case.\n\nD. Only the solicitor general may petition for a writ of certiorari.\n- This is not accurate. Any party to a case may petition for a writ of certiorari, not just the solicitor general."
