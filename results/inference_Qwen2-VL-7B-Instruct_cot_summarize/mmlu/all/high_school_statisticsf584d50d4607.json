From past experience, the agency knows that 20% of all the workers it places will no longer be at the position in which they were placed after one year; however, only 5% of those remaining after the first year leave during the next year. At the start of a year an employer hires 100 workers using this agency, then at the start of the next year the employer hires 100 more.

It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the choices provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be 76, which is not among the given options (A. 140, B. 144, C. 152, D. 156.\n\nIf the question or the choices are indeed correct, then there might be an error in the question or the choices provided."
