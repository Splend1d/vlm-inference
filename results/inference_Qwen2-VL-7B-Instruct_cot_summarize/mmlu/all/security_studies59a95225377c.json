The most obvious issue of joint concern during the 2000s was terror and order, although fast- rising concerns over environmental/climate security could easily provide another big linking issue.\nB. The fate of security studies depends on its ability to prevail in the general debates in the discipline of IR. It is very unlikely that the internal dynamics of the theory debate will be decided by a general prevalence of one of the current debates.\nC. Both the US and European analysts will be working on the role and nature of technology, globalization, risk society and the international economic order.

All of these options.\n\nThe future of security studies faces multiple challenges, including the evolving nature of threats such as terrorism and the increasing importance of environmental and climate security. The discipline's ability to prevail in the broader debates within international relations ( (IR) is also a significant concern, as the internal dynamics of theory debates are unlikely to be decided by a general prevalence of one of the current debates. Additionally, the role and nature of technology, globalization, the risk society, and the international economic order are areas of significant interest and potential points of contact between currently disconnected fields of theory."
