In other words, people act in ways that benefit themselves, even if it appears altruistic.\n\nThe story about Abraham Lincoln involves him giving away a significant portion of his personal fortune to help others. This act of generosity might initially seem to contradict psychological egoism, as it appears to be motivated by a desire to help others rather than oneself.\n\nHowever, psychological egoism does not necessarily rule out selfless acts. It only claims that such acts are still motivated by self-interest, even if that self-interest is not immediately apparent. For example, Lincoln might have been motivated by a desire for personal satisfaction, recognition, or a sense of moral duty, which are all forms of self-interest.\n\nGiven this analysis, the story about Abraham Lincoln does not provide clear evidence for or against psychological egoism. It does not necessarily show that self-interest is the driving behind his actions, nor does it definitively prove that his actions were not motivated by self-interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. provides no evidence for or against psychological egoism."
