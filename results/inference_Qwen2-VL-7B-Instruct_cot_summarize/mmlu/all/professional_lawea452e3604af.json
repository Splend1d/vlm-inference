                    "text": "A husband and wife divorced after 17 years of marriage. They had one son, aged 10. As part of the divorce decree, the wife was given custody of the son, while the husband was entitled to weekend visitation. Thereafter, the husband accepted a new job in a neighboring state. Before relocating, the husband met with an attorney to seek his advice about how he could gain full custody of his son. The attorney told the husband that his new state did not give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings in his former state of residence. As a consequence, the attorney advised the husband that he could take the son to live with him and not be in violation of the law. This was erroneous legal advice, and his new state, in fact, did honor and give full faith and credit to other states' divorce decrees. When his next scheduled visitation took place, the husband picked up his son at his ex-wife's home. Instead of returning his son, he took him to live with him in his new state. After refusing to return his son to his ex-wife, the husband was subsequently arrested and charged with kidnapping. The applicable statute is defined as \"knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location. \"Should the husband be found guilty of kidnapping?\n\nA. Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree.\nB. Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.\nC. No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.\nD. No, because he received erroneous legal advice.\n"

                    "text": "The husband should be found guilty of kidnapping. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Violation of the Divorce Decree**: The husband took his son to live with him in a neighboring state, which directly violates the terms of the divorce decree that gave the wife custody of the son and allowed the husband weekend visitation. This is a clear violation of the court's order.\n\n2. **Mistake of Law**: The defense of mistake of law is generally not a valid defense in criminal cases. Even if the husband believed he could take the son without violating the law, the fact that he did so and then refused to return the son to his ex-wife constitutes kidnapping.\n\n3. **State of Mind**: The husband's state of mind is irrelevant. The crime of kidnapping is based on the act of moving a person to another location without their consent, regardless of the husband's intentions or beliefs.\n\n4. **Legal Advice**: The erroneous legal advice the husband received from the attorney does not negate his responsibility for the actions he took. The husband is still legally bound by the terms of the divorce decree and the law of the state where he lived at the time of the kidnapping.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree."
