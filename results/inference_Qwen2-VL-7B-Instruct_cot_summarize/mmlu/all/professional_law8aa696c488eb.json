An undercover police officer knocked on the woman's door and told her that he was willing to pay for usable credit cards. When the woman asked if he was a police officer, the officer replied, \"No,\" giving her a false name and saying, \"You can call Harvey \u0080\u0094he'll vouch for me.\" The woman admitted him to her house. After she left the room to call Harvey, the officer lifted some papers off a desk and underneath discovered three credit cards bearing different names. He seized the cards, and when the woman returned, he arrested her. The woman has moved to suppress the evidence seized on the ground that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\n\nA. No, because it was immediately apparent that the cards were stolen.\nB. No, because the woman assumed the risk that the officer would seize items in plain sight.\nC. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer lifted the papers.\nD. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n"

Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. The principle of \"plain view\" allows law enforcement officers to seize evidence that is immediately apparent to them without a warrant. However, the Fourth Amendment also not only protects against searches but also also against seizures obtained as the result of an illegal entry into a person's home or place of business.\n\nIn this case, the police officer obtained entry into the woman's home by deceit. This deceitful entry is a violation of the woman's Fourth Amendment rights. Even if the evidence (the stolen credit cards) was in plain view, the manner in which the officer gained access to the property was illegal. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to suppress the evidence seized on the ground that the woman's Fourth Amendment rights were violated."
