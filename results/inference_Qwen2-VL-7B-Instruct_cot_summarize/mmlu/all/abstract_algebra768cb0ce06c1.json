However, it is also also possible that at least two of them are isomorphic. For example, if we have two non-abelian groups and one of them is \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\) or \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), then at least two of the groups are isomorphic.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 1:** The statement is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2\nIf \\( \\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s \\) is isomorphic to a subgroup \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), then \\( r \\) divides \\( m \\) and \\( s \\) divides \\( n \\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The direct sum \\( \\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{rs} \\) if \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) are coprime ( (i.e., \\( \\gcd(r, s) = 1 \\)).\n- If \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{rs} \\) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), then \\( rs \\) must divide \\( mn \\).\n\nHowever, the statement that \\( r \\) divides \\( m \\) and \\( s \\) divides \\( n \\) is not necessarily true. For example, consider \\( r = 2 \\), \\( s = 3 \\), \\( m = 6 \\), and \\( n = 9 \\). Here, \\( rs = 6 \\) divides \\( 9 \\), but \\( r \\) does not divide \\( n \\) and \\( s \\) does not divide \\( n \\).\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 2:** The statement is **False**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe correct answer is:\nC. True, False"
