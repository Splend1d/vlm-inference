For the logit model, the marginal effect of a change in one of the explanatory variables is simply the estimate of the parameter attached to that variable, whereas this is not the case for the probit model.\n\nExplanation:\n- A. Both logit and probit models use a different method of transforming the model to ensure that the predicted probabilities lie between zero and one. This is true for both models.\n- B. The logit model can indeed result in too many observations falling at exactly zero or exactly one, especially when the model is overfitted or when there is a high degree of separation in the data. This is a concern for both models, but it is more pronounced in the logit model.\n- C. This statement is correct. In the logit model, the marginal effect of a change in one of the explanatory variables is simply the estimate of the parameter attached to that variable. However, in the probit model, the marginal effect is not simply the parameter estimate but requires the calculation of the derivative of the cumulative normal distribution with respect to the explanatory variable.\n- D. The probit model is based on a cumulative normal distribution, not a logistic distribution. This statement is incorrect."
