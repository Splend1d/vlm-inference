A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.\n- This statement is true. A syllogism can be valid (meaning its structure is logically sound, but its conclusion can still be false if the premises are false or the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nB. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.\n- This statement is false. A syllogism can be valid without being true. For example, if the premises are false, the conclusion can still be logically valid but not true.\n\nC. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.\n- This statement is true. If the premises are true and the syllogism is valid, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nD. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.\n- This statement is true. Formal validity ensures the logical structure is sound, but it does not guarantee the truth of the premises or the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is **not** true is:\n\nB. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true."
