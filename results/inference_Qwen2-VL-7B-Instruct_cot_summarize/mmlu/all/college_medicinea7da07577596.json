The ideal gas law is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWe are given that the gas occupies 0.1L at 200atm. We want to find the volume at 1atm. We can rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for V:\n\nV = ( nRT/P\n\nSince the number of moles (n, the gas constant R, and the temperature T are all constant, we can see that the volume is directly proportional to the pressure. This means that if the pressure is reduced, the volume will increase.\n\nTherefore, the volume at 1atm will be slightly more than 0.1L.\n\nThe answer is C."
