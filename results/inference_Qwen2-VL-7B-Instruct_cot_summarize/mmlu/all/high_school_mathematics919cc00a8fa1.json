We are given that the ladder is 26 feet long, so we have:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = 26^2\\]\n\nWe are also given that the foot of the ladder is moving away from the building at a rate of 3 feet per second. This means that \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 3\\) feet per second.\n\nWe are asked to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down, which is \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\), when the foot of the ladder is 10 feet from the building.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) when \\(x = 10\\). Plugging \\(x = 10\\) into the Pythagorean theorem equation, we get:\n\n\\[10^2 + y^2 = 26^2\\]\n\n\\[100 + y^2 = 676\\]\n\n\\[y^2 = 576\\]\n\n\\[y = 24\\]\n\nNow, we have \\(x = 10\\) and \\(y = 24\\). We can differentiate the Pythagorean theorem equation with respect to time \\(t\\) to find the relationship between \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\), \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\), \\(x\\), and \\(y\\):\n\n\\[2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nPlugging in the values we know:\n\n\\[2(10)(3) + 2(24)\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\n\\[60 + 48\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\n\\[48\\frac{dy}{dt} = -60\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{60}{48}\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{5}{4}\\]\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is moving down at a rate of \\(-\\frac{5}{4}\\) feet per second. The negative sign indicates that the top of the ladder is moving downward.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 5/4"
