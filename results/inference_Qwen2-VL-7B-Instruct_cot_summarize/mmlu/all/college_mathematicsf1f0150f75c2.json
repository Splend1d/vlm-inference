Count the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial.\n2. The number of positive real roots is either equal to the number of sign changes or less than that by an even number.\n\nFor the polynomial \\(2x^5 + 8x - 7\\), there is one sign change (from \\(+8x\\) to \\(-7\\). Therefore, there is either one positive real root or no positive real roots.\n\nNext, let's consider the Intermediate Value Theorem:\n\n1. Evaluate the polynomial at two points where the sign changes.\n2. If the polynomial changes sign between these two points, there must be at least one real root between them.\n\nLet's evaluate the polynomial at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\):\n\n- At \\(x = 0\\), \\(2(0)^5 + 8(0) - 7 = -7\\).\n- At \\(x = 1\\), \\(2(1)^5 + 8(1) - 7 = 3\\).\n\nSince the polynomial changes sign between \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\), there must be at least one real root between these two points.\n\nCombining the results from Descartes' Rule of Signs and the Intermediate Value Theorem:\n\n- There is either one positive real root or no positive real roots.\n- There is at least one real root between \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\(2x^5 + 8x - 7\\) has at least one real root.
