In logical terms, this is represented as:\n\\[ (G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\((G \u2283 H) \u2228 I\\)\n- This option suggests that either George implies Harry or Ira is true. This does not match the structure of the original sentence.\n\nB. \\((G \u2228 H) \u2283 I\\)\n- This option suggests that if George or Harry enrolls, then Ira enrolls. This is the opposite of what the original sentence states.\n\nC. \\((G \u2283 H) \u2228 ~I\\)\n- This option suggests that either George implies Harry or Ira does not enroll. This does not match the structure of the original sentence.\n\nD. \\((G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I\\)\n- This option suggests that if George or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll. This matches the structure of the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\n\nD. \\((G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I\\)"
