The functional form of \\( f \\)'s decision boundary is the same as \\( h \\)'s, but with different parameters. e.g., if \\( h \\) was a linear classifier, then \\( f \\) is also a linear classifier.\"\n\nThis statement is generally true. Boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost, typically combine multiple weak learners ( \\( h \\) into a strong learner \\( f \\). The decision boundary of \\( f \\) is indeed a combination of the decision boundaries of the individual weak learners \\( h \\), but with different parameters. For example, if each \\( h \\) is a linear classifier, then \\( f \\) will also be a linear classifier, but with a different set of parameters.\n\n**Statement 2:**\n\"Cross validation can be used to select the number of iterations in boosting; this procedure may help reduce overfit.\"\n\nThis statement is also true. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model and to select the optimal number of iterations in boosting algorithms. By using cross-validation, one can assess the model's performance at different numbers of iterations and choose the number of iterations that minimizes overfitting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
