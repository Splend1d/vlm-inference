This principle helps us find the total number of elements in the union of two sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets and then subtractinging the size of their intersection.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(P\\) as the set of boxes containing pencils.\n- \\(N\\) as the set of boxes containing pens.\n- \\(B\\) as the set of boxes containing both pencils and pens.\n- \\(T\\) as the total number of boxes.\n\nWe are given:\n- \\(|P| = 13\\) ( (boxes with pencils)\n- \\(|N| = 9\\) ( (boxes with pens)\n- \\(|B| = 3\\) ( (boxes with neither pencils nor pens)\n- \\(|T| = 20\\) ( (total boxes)\n\nWe want to find \\(|B|\\), the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils.\n\nFirst, we find the number of boxes that contain either pencils or pens or both. This is the union of sets \\(P\\) and \\(N\\), which is \\(P \\cup N\\). According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the size of the union of two sets is given by:\n\n\\[|P \\cup N| = |P| + |N| - |P \\cap n|\\)\n\nWhere \\(|P \\cap n|\\) is the size of the intersection of \\(P\\) and \\(n\\), which is the number of boxes that contain both pencils and pens. We know that \\(|P \\cup N| = |T| - |B|\\), because the boxes that contain neither pencils nor pens are not part of the union.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[|P \\cup N| = 20 - 3\\]\n\n\\[|P \\cup N| = 17\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the values we know into the formula for the union:\n\n\\[17 = 13 + 9 - |B|\\]\n\n\\[17 = 22 - |B|\\]\n\n\\[|B| = 22 - 17\\]\n\n\\[|B| = 5\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 5."
