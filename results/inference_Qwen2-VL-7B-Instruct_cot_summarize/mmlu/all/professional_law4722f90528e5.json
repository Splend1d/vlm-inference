An amendment to that act extends coverage to the states as employers. The federal district court allowed an injunction to prevent further discrimination but refused to allow money damages and legal fees against the state on the basis of 11th Amendment sovereign immunity. The plaintiffs appealed. What should the Court of Appeals decide based on the established jurisprudence regarding sovereign immunity?\n\nA. There is no sovereign immunity due to the First Amendment rights of the women to protest against discrimination.\nB. There is sovereign immunity that protects a state from any lawsuit by private citizens that the state does not authorize.\nC. There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\nD. There is sovereign immunity under the Supremacy Clause and it would take a new constitutional amendment to abrogate the immunity granted to the states.\n"

There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\n\nThe Court of Appeals should decide that there is no sovereign immunity in this case because Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides a remedy to women who have experienced discrimination in the workplace. This remedy is intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states, which means that the state is subject to suit under Title VII. Therefore, the state is not protected by sovereign immunity in this case."
