One year later, while still employed by the hotel, the employee died. In an action by the employee's widow against the hotel to recover the sum of $5,000, which of the following, if established, is the strongest argument against enforcement of the certificate agreement?\n\nA. The widow was unaware of the certificate agreement until after the employee died.\nB. There was no privity of contract between the widow and the hotel.\nC. The widowin no way relied on the hotel's promise to pay the $5,000.\nD. There was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement.\n"

There was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement.\n\nIn contract law, consideration is a crucial element that must be present for a contract to be enforceable. Consideration refers to something of value exchanged between the parties. In this case, the hotel issued the certificate to the employee in appreciation of his faithful service, but there was no additional exchange of value from the hotel to the employee. The certificate was described as \"purely gratuitous,\" meaning it was given without any expectation of receiving something of value in return. Since there was no additional consideration provided by the hotel, the court would likely find that there was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement, making it unenforceable."
