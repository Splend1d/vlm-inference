Information is not important to decision making in economic theory; rather, it is an actor's perceptions of situations that will inform their decision making process.\nB. Information has no special significance to economic decision making, which is guided more by external forces that coerce actors than their own rational choices.\nC. Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.\nD. Information has become an important resource in the 21st century and can be sold and traded as a market commodity.\n"

Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.\n\nIn economic science, the role of information is crucial. Economic theory often assumes that actors are rational and make decisions based on their own best interest. However, for these decisions to be rational, actors must have access to relevant and accurate information. Without sufficient information, actors may make decisions that are not in their best interest, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, the availability and quality of information are critical factors in economic decision making."
