The dominance of Western ideologies can be regarded as contemporary imperialism.\n- This is a valid reason because it implies that liberalist principles, which are often associated with Western values, might be seen as an imposition by other countries, which could be perceived as imperialism.\n\nB. Liberalism advocates the enforcement of certain values that are not shared by all political regimes.\n- This is also a valid reason because it suggests that liberalist principles might impose values that are not accepted by all regimes, leading to resistance.\n\nC. The fear that cooperation may be recurring.\n- This is not a valid reason because it does not directly address the core principles of liberalism. Cooperation is a fundamental aspect of liberalist principles, and the fear of recurring cooperation does not necessarily mean that cooperation is undesirable or that it would lead to resistance.\n\nD. Adherence to liberalism does not guarantee the favored treatment of state regimes over its citizens; other states may threaten regime security in their efforts to secure societal security.\n- This is a valid reason because it suggests that liberalist principles might not protect the regime's's interests, potentially leading to resistance.\n\nTherefore, the option that is not a valid reason for a governmental regime's reluctance to fully join the liberalist camp is:\n\nC. The fear that cooperation may be recurring."
