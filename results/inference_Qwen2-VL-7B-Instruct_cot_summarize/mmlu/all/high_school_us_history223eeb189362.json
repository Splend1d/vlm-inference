He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nWhich of the following statements best describes Eric Foner's argument about President Abraham Lincoln's views on slavery?\n\nA. President Lincoln was a consistent supporter of the abolitionist cause.\nB. President Lincoln was reluctant to be ideologically associated with advocates like Frederick Douglass.\nC. In his ambition to become president, Abraham Lincoln declared his desire to use his constitutional powers to end slavery.\nD.

He maintained a distinction between his personal wish for all men to be free and his official duties as a legislator and president within the legal and constitutional framework of the time. He also continued to prefer gradual abolition even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\n3. **Analyze each option:**\n   - **Option A:** \"President Lincoln was a consistent supporter of the abolitionist cause.\"\n     - This option suggests that Lincoln was consistently in favor of abolitionism. However, the passage states that Lincoln was not an abolitionist and did not claim to be one.\n   \n   - **Option B:** \"President Lincoln was reluctant to be ideologically associated with advocates like Frederick Douglass.\"\n     - This option suggests that Lincoln was hesitant to be associated with abolitionists leaders. The passage does mention Lincoln's reluctance to be associated with abolitionists leaders, but it does not state that he was reluctant to be associated with them in general.\n   \n   - **Option C:** \"In his ambition to become president, Abraham Lincoln declared his desire to use his constitutional powers to end slavery.\"\n     - This the passage does not mention Lincoln's ambition to become president or his desire to use constitutional powers to end slavery. The focus is on his views on slavery and his actions as president.\n   \n   - **Option D:** \"President Lincoln had continually changing views on slavery and abolition that did not always fit into the prevailing political categories.\"\n     - This option suggests that Lincoln's views on slavery and abolition were constantly changing and did not fit into the prevailing political categories. The passage does mention that Lincoln's views on slavery changed during the Civil War, but it does not state that his views were continually changing.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer:**\n   The statement that best describes Eric Foner's argument about President Abraham Lincoln's views on slavery is:\n\n   **D. President Lincoln had continually changing views on slavery and abolition that did not always fit into the prevailing political categories.**"
