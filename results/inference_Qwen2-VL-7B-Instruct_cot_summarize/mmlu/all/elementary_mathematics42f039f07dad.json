The correct ratio for the American flag is 10 to 19.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio for each option:\n\nA. 30 ft by 53 ft\n- Ratio: \\( \\frac{30}{53} \\approx 0.566 \\)\n\nB. 27 ft by 53 ft\n- Ratio: \\( \\frac{27}{53} \\approx 0.510 \\)\n\nC. 27 in by 57 in.\n- First, convert both measurements to the same unit. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 27 feet = 324 inches.\n- Ratio: \\( \\frac{324}{57} \\approx 5.714 \\)\n\nD. 30 in. by 57 in.\n- Ratio: \\( \\frac{30}{57} \\approx 0.526 \\)\n\nNow, let's compare these ratios to the correct ratio of 10 to 19:\n\n- Option A: 0.566\n- Option B: 0.510\n- Option C: 5.714\n- Option D: 0.526\n\nNone of these options exactly match the ratio of 10 to 19. Therefore, none of the given dimensions are in the correct ratio for the American flag.\n\nHowever, if we consider the closest approximation, Option D ( 30 in. by 57 in. is the closest to the correct ratio of 10 to 19, with a ratio of approximately 0.526.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 30 in. by 57 in."
