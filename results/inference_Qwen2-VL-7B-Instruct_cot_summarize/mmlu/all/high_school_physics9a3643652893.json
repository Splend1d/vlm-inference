The normal force is the force perpendicular to the surface and is equal to the weight of the object.\n\nThe weight of an object is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ W = mg \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the object and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe normal force \\( N \\) is equal to the weight \\( W \\) because the object is in contact with the surface:\n\n\\[ N = W = mg \\]\n\nThe coefficient of friction \\( \\mu \\) is a constant for a given pair of materials and is independent of the size of the object.\n\nThe frictional force \\( f \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ f = \\mu N \\]\n\nSince the coefficient of friction \\( \\mu \\) is constant, the frictional force is directly proportional to the normal force. If the height of the block is halved and the length is doubled, the area of the block increases by a factor of 2 ( (since area is proportional to the product of length and height). The weight of the block, which is proportional to its volume ( (since weight is proportional to mass, and mass is proportional to volume), also also increases by a factor of 2.\n\nTherefore, the normal force \\( N \\) increases by a factor of 2:\n\n\\[ N_{\\text{new}} = 2N \\]\n\nThe frictional force \\( f \\) is directly proportional to the normal force:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{new}} = \\mu N_{\\text{new}} = \\mu ( 2N = 2f \\]\n\nSo, the frictional force experienced by the block with half the height and twice the length is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. 2f} \\]"
