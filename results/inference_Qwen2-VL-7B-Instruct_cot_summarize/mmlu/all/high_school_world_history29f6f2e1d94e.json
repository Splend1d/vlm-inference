The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.\nOf Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone\u2014it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\n*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.\nWhich of the following best describes the origins of epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and the information provided about the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient Mesopotamian poem that tells the story of a king named Gilgamesh. The passage describes the construction of Uruk and the Eanna temple, which were significant achievements attributed to Gilgamesh. The passage also mentions the gods' involvement in the creation of Gilgamesh and his subsequent accomplishments.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems\n- This option suggests that the rise of a literate class allowed for the recording of poems. This is plausible since the Epic of Gilgamesh is a written work, and the presence of a literate class would facilitate the recording and preservation of such stories.\n\nB. The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art\n- This option suggests that the rise of a merchant class sponsored the creation of original art. While merchants might have supported artistic endeavors, the passage does not specifically mention sponsorship of poetry or epic tales.\n\nC. The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-King\n- This option suggests that a religious caste was solely responsible for recording the deeds of a God-King. While religious figures might have been involved in the creation of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the passage does not explicitly state that a religious caste was solely responsible.\n\nD. The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording\n- This This option suggest that the rise of a warrior elite led to the recording of their deeds. While the passage mentions Gilgamesh's accomplishments, it does not specifically state that the rise of a warrior elite was the primary reason for the creation of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most plausible answer is:\n\nA. The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems\n\nThis option aligns well with the context of the Epic of Gilgamesh being a written work and the need for a literate class to record and preserve such stories."
