The moment is calculated as the product of the force ( (mass times acceleration due to gravity, g) and the distance from the fulcrum.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( m \\) as the mass of the girl,\n- \\( 2m \\) as the mass of the boy,\n- \\( d \\) as the original distance from the fulcrum to each child,\n- \\( g \\) as the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe moment on the girl's side is \\( -a \\cdot g \\cdot d \\) ( (negative because it tilts in favor of the boy).\nThe moment on the boy's side is \\( 2m \\cdot g \\cdot d \\).\n\nFor balance, these moments must be equal:\n\n\\[ -a \\cdot g \\cdot d = 2m \\cdot g \\cdot d \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[ -a = 2m \\]\n\nSince \\( a = m \\), we have:\n\n\\[ -m = 2m \\]\n\nThis is not possible, indicating that the current configuration is already unbalanced.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option to see which one would not balance the see-saw:\n\nA.
