                    "text": "To find the solubility product (K_sp) for lead iodide (PbI2) at 25\u00b0C, we need to use the given information about the maximum amount of PbI2 that can be dissolved in 1.00 L of pure water and the fact that PbI2 is completely dissociated in water.\n\nThe dissociation of PbI2 in water can be represented as:\n\nPbI2(s) \u2192 Pb2+(aq) + 2I-(aq)\n\nThe solubility product (K_sp) is defined as the product of the mquilibrium concentrations of the ions raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients in the dissociation equation. In this case, the dissociation equation is:\n\nK_sp = [Pb2+][I-]^2\n\nGiven that the maximum amount of PbI2 that can be dissolved in 1.00 L of pure water is 1.0 mmol, we can assume that the concentration of Pb2+ ions is equal to the concentration of I- ions, which is also 1.0 mmol/L.\n\nTherefore, the solubility product K_sp) is:\n\nK_sp = [Pb2+][i-]^2\nK_sp = ( (1.0 mmol/L)^2\nK_sp = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-6\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1.0 \u00d7 10^-6"
