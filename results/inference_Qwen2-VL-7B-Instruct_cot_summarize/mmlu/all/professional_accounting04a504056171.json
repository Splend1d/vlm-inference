Since King owns 70% of Simmon's outstanding common stock, King has a controlling interest in Simmon.\n\nThe intercompany note payable from Simmon to King should be eliminated in the consolidation process. This means that the $100,000 note payable from Simmon to King should be removed from both companies' liabilities.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n1. King's liabilities: $450,000\n2. Simmon's liabilities: $200,000\n3. Intercompany note payable ( (eliminated): $100,000\n\nTotal liabilities in the consolidated financial statements = King's liabilities + Simmon's liabilities - Intercompany note payable\n\nTotal liabilities = $450,000 + $200,000 - $100,000\n\nTotal liabilities = = $550,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $550,000"
