Therefore, 60% of the computation can potentially benefit from parallel execution.\n\n2. **Single Processor Execution**: The program takes 100 seconds on a single processor.\n\n3. **Parallel Execution with 2 Processors**:\n   - Since 60% of the computation can benefit from parallel execution, 40% will remain sequential.\n   - With 2 processors, the sequential part will still take 40% of the time, but the parallel part can be executed in parallel.\n   - The sequential part takes 40% of 100 seconds = 40 seconds.\n   - The parallel part takes 60% of 100 seconds = 60 seconds.\n   - Since the parallel part can be executed in parallel, the total time will be the time of the sequential part plus the time of the parallel part divided by the number of processors.\n   - Total time = ( 40 seconds ( + 60 seconds / 2 = 40 seconds + 30 seconds = 70 seconds.\n\n4. **Parallel Execution with 4 Processors**:\n   - With 4 processors, the sequential part will still take 40% of the time, but the parallel part can be executed in parallel.\n   - The sequential part takes 40% of 100 seconds = 40 seconds.\n   - The parallel part takes 60% of 100 seconds = 60 seconds.\n   - Since the parallel part can be executed in parallel, the total time will be the time of the sequential part plus the time of the parallel part divided by the number of processors.\n   - Total time = 40 seconds + 60 seconds / 4 = 40 seconds + 15 seconds = 55 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the theoretically best possible elapsed times for the program running with 2 and 4 processors, respectively, are 70 and 55 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 70 and 55 seconds."
