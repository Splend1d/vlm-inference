The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s?\n\nA. Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n"

It highlights how the Mongol domains facilitated trade routes, economic development, and the spread of ideas and inventions across different civilizations.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Russia was excluded from Western European developments like the Renaissance.\n- This option suggests that Russia was isolated from Western European developments. However, the passage does not mention any exclusion from Western European developments. Instead, it emphasizes the integration and exchange of ideas.\n\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\n- This option suggests that Russia became the center of Mongol political activity. While the Mongols did establish a presence in Russia, the passage does not specifically mention Russia becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\n\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\n- This option suggests that Islam became the dominant religion in Russia. The passage does not mention any significant change in the religious landscape of Russia due to the Mongol conquest.\n\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n- This option suggests that Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy. The passage does not mention any development of a centralized bureaucracy in Russia as a result of the Mongol conquest.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most fitting long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1220s is:\n\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\n\nThus, the final answer is B."
