It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nThe Communist Manifesto can be understood as an example of the influence of which mode of modern European thinking?\n\nA.

It emphasizes the economic determinism and class struggle, which are central themes in materialism and economic determinism.\n\n1. **The Oxford Movement**: This was a 19th-century religious movement within the Church of England that emphasized the importance of the historical and scriptural basis of Christianity. It does not align with the economic and class-based themes of The Communist Manifesto.\n\n2. **Materialism and Economic Determinism**: This philosophical and economic theory holds that material conditions and economic factors are the primary determinants of human behavior and social structures. The text's focuses on the economic determinants of class struggles and the development of societies, which aligns with this theory.\n\n3. **Hegelian Idealism**: This is a philosophical system developed by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, which emphasizes the role of ideas and consciousness in shaping reality. The text does not focus on ideas or consciousness but rather on material conditions and economic factors.\n\n4. **The rationalism of the Scottish Enlightenment**: This refers to the philosophical movement in Scotland in the 18th century that emphasized reason and logic. While it is a significant philosophical movement, it does not directly address the economic determinism and class struggle as the main themes of The Communist Manifesto.\n\nGiven the analysis, the mode of modern European thinking that influenced The Communist Manifesto is best described by:\n\n**B. Materialism and economic determinism**"
