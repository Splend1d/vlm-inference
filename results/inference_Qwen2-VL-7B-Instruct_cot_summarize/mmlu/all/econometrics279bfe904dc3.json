(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nThe Box-Jenkins approach to diagnostic testing for ARMA models involves several steps, including model identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking. Here's a breakdown of the statements:\n\n(i) The tests will show whether the identified model is either too large or too small.\n   - This statement is true. Diagnostic checking involves assessing the adequacy of the model. If the model is too large, it means it has too many parameters, which can lead to overfittingting. If the model is too small, it means it has too few parameters, which can lead to underfittingting.\n\n(ii) The tests involve checking the model residuals for autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality.\n   - This statement is true. Diagnostic checking typically involves examining the residuals for these properties. Autocorrelation in the residuals suggests that the model is not capturing all the information in the data, heteroscedasticity indicates that the variance of the errors is not constant, and non-normality suggests that the errors do not follow a normal distribution.\n\n(iii) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the acf and pacf for the residuals should show no additional structure.\n   - This statement is true. If the model is appropriate, the autocorrelation function ( (ACf) and partial autocorrelation function ( ( pacf) of the residuals should not show any significant structure beyond what is expected for white noise.\n\n(iv) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the coefficients on the additional variables under the overfit fit approach will be statistically insignificant.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The significance of the coefficients depends on the specific model and the data. Overfittingting models may have coefficients that are statistically significant, even if the model is not appropriate.\n\nTherefore, statements (i), (ii), and (iii) are true concerning the Box-Jenkins approach to diagnostic testing for ARMA models."
