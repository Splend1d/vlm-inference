This reflects a situation where Kongo people are being exploited and taken away from their homeland, which is a direct consequence of European trade activities.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods\n- This option suggests a positive aspect of trade, but the letter focuses on the negative impact of trade on Kongo people.\n\nB. Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest\n- The letter does not mention any resistance to conquest but rather focuses on the exploitation of people through trade.\n\nC. The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline\n- While this option is true, it does not directly address the exploitation of Kongo people as the main concern of the letter.\n\nD. The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa\n- This option is not directly related to the content of the letter, which focuses on the exploitation of people rather than state consolidation.\n\nGiven the context and the specific issue raised in the letter, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest\n\nThis option best reflects the tone of the letter, which highlights the negative impact of European trade on Kongo people."
