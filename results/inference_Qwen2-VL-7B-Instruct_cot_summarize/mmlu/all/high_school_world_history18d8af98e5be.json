It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nThe political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways?\n\nA. It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority.\nB. It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology.\nC. It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past.\nD. It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries.\n"

The text discusses the balance between being loved and feared by subjects and concludes that it is safer to be feared. This reflects a pragmatic approach to governance rather than an ethical or religious ideology.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority.\n- This is not the primary focus of the text. The text does not explicitly discuss the justification of monarchs's authority but rather focuses on the balance between being loved and feared.\n\nB. It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology.\n- This discusses the balance between being loved and feared by subjects and concludes that it is safer to be feared. This reflects a pragmatic approach to governance rather than an ethical or religious ideology.\n\nC. It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past.\n- The text does not explicitly mention looking back to the classical past. It focuses more on the practical aspects of governance rather than historical references.\n\nD. It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries.\n- The text does not discuss class boundaries or equality. It focuses on the balance between being loved and feared by subjects.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most accurate statement about the political philosophy espoused in the text is:\n\nB. It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
