                    "text": "On June 1, an owner of a business that built mobile homes was visited by a representative of a company that manufactured propane tanks. Propane tanks were an essential component of the mobile homes produced by the builder. The representative told the owner that the company could supply propane tanks at $50 per tank, a substantial savings over what the owner currently paid for propane tanks. The owner asked if the company could supply 1,000 propane tanks by the end of the month, and the representative assured him that they could. The owner stated that he would think about it and decide what to do within a week. On June 3, the owner sent the following memo to the company headquarters at the address provided by the representative: \"I am happy to confirm my order of 1,000 propane tanks, to be delivered by June 30. I have always received a 10 percent discount for cash payment, so I will assume you will grant me the same discount. I will have $45,000 cash ready to give to your representative at the time of delivery. \"On June 30, the company delivered 1,000 propane tanks to the owner. The representative accompanied the delivery and presented the owner with a bill for $50,000. The owner refused to pay any more than$45,000. Which of the following accurately states the legal rights of the parties?\n\nA. The contract price was $45,000, because the June 3 memo was an effective integration of their agreement.\nB. The contract price was $45,000, because the company did not specifically object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo.\nC. The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\nD. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n"

                    "text": "The legal rights of the parties in this situation can be determined by analyzing the elements of a contract and the principles of offer and acceptance. Here's a breakdown of the options provided:\n\nA. **The contract price was $45,000, because the June 3 memo was an effective integration of their agreement.**\n   - This option suggests that the June 3 memo effectively integrated the agreement, making the contract price $45,000. However, the memo does not explicitly state that the offer was accepted on the terms of the June 3 memo. The offer was made by the company, and the acceptance was made by the owner. The memo does not necessarily integrate the offer and acceptance.\n\nB. **The contract price was $45,000, because the company did not specifically object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo.**\n   - This option suggests that the company did not object to the discount, so the contract price is $45,000. However, the lack of objection does not necessarily mean that the offer was accepted on the terms of the June 3 memo. The offer was made by the company, and the acceptance was made by the owner. The company's silence does not necessarily mean that the offer was accepted on the terms of the June 3 memo.\n\nC. **The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.**\n   - This option suggests that the contract price is $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer. However, the offer was made by the company, and the acceptance was made by the owner. The company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein. The discount term in the owner's June 3 memo does not necessarily materially alter the terms of the company's offer.\n\nD. **The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.**\n   - This option suggest that the the contract price is $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein. This option is the most accurate. The offer was made by the company, and the acceptance was made by the owner. The company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein. The discount term in the owner's June 3 memo does not necessarily materially alter the terms of the company's offer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.**"
