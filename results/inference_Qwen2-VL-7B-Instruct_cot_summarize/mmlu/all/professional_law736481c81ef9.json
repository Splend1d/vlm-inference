The city manual requires that newcomers pay a higher contribution to the city's employee betterment fund for the first three years of employment. Newcomer refuses to pay a higher contribution than other employees, whereupon she is terminated. Can she make a successful equal protection argument to fight for her job?\n\nA. No, she is not a member of a suspect class as there cannot be a \"class-of-one\" in the employment law context.\nB. No, the request for the contribution was not unreasonable and cannot support an equal protection argument.\nC. Yes, she can claim a class of one who is being discriminated against.\nD. Yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are coming and are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time.\n"

Yes, she can claim a class of one who is being discriminated against.\n\nIn the context of equal protection, a \"class of one\" argument can be made when an individual claims that they have been treated differently from others in a similar situation without a rational basis for the differential treatment. In this case, the newcomer argues that she is being treated differently from other employees because she is a newcomer and is required to pay a higher contribution to the city's employee betterment fund for the first three years of employment. This differential treatment, if not justified by a rational basis, could be seen as discriminatory and thus support an equal protection argument."
