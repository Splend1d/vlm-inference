After settling with the hotel, the guest sued the manufacturer of the carpet that was in her room and elsewhere in the hotel. The carpet caused the fire to spread rapidly due to its easy flammability. Evidence proved that the manufacturer knew of the product's flammability and that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures. The manufacturer argued that the hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist were both superseding causes, thus abrogating the manufacturer's liability as a matter of law. How did the trial court most likely rule on that issue?\n\nA. The intervening causes relieved the manufacturer of liability.\nB. The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability.\nC. The intervening causes were irrelevant due to the strict liability of the manufacturer.\nD. By not suing the arsonist first, the guest waived her right to sue the manufacturer.\n"

The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability.\n\nIn tort law, the concept of \"superseding cause\" or \"superseding intervening cause\" generally refers to situations where an intervening event ( occurs after the initial negligent act and contributes to the harm, potentially absolving the original negligent party of liability. However, this concept is typically applied in cases where the intervening cause is unforeseeable or independent of the original negligence.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer knew of the carpet's flammability and that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures. The fact that the hotel had no sprinkler systems or smoke detectors does not absolve the manufacturer of liability. The manufacturer's knowledge and the use of the carpet in a building with inadequate safety measures are both elements that contribute to the harm caused by the fire. Therefore, the trial court is most likely to rule that the the intervening causes ( the arsonist's criminal act and the hotel's negligence did not relieve the manufacturer of liability."
