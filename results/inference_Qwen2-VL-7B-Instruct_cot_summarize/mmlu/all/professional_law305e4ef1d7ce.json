An organization of influential city residents began an intensive lobbying effort to persuade the city council to deny the owner a permit to operate any type of nude- dancing facility at any time or in any place in the city. The owner has sued the city in an appropriate federal court, seeking an injunction that would prohibit the city council from considering the organization's views, on the ground that if the organization is successful in its lobbying efforts, the owner's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights would be violated. The city has moved to dismiss the action. Should the court dismiss the owner's action?\n\nA. No, because nude dancing is symbolic speech and is therefore protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nB. No, because the organization does not seek a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation of nude dancing, but instead seeks a total ban on the owner's opening any type of nude-dancing facility at any time or in any place in the city.\nC. Yes, because the action is not ripe.\nD. Yes, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not protect obscenity, and nude dancing is obscene.\n"

Yes, because the action is not ripe.\n\nThe action is not ripe because the city council has not yet made a decision on the zoning permit application. The owner has not yet been denied a permit, and therefore, there is no concrete action taken by the city council that would violate the owner's rights. The court cannot issue an injunction before the city council has made a decision on the permit application."
