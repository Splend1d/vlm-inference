Does the parol evidence rule apply to preclude the buyer's testimony regarding what kind of salmon the parties' intended by the term \"quality salmon\" in the written contract?\n\nA. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply to preclude testimony in cases such as this one where the testimony would explain what the parties meant by the terms they used.\nB. Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the testimony would add to or contradict the final signed writing.\nC. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply because the contract was reduced to writing.\nD. Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the terms of the contract were not recorded and preserved at the time of signing the contract.\n"

However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the written contract is ambiguous or incomplete, or when the parties have agreed to a different meaning than what is written.\n\nIn this case, the buyer and seller signed a written contract for the sale of ten thousand pounds of \"quality salmon\" for $50,000. The buyer was surprised to find an assortment of pacific wild salmon, domestic salmon raised in captivity, and mixed east coast salmon. In prior discussions, the parties agreed on all pacific wild salmon for fulfillment of the order, and none of the other inferior types were discussed. \n\nThe buyer's testimony regarding what kind of salmon the parties intended by the term \"quality salmon\" in the written contract would explain what the parties meant by the terms they used. This testimony would not add to or contradict the final signed writing, but rather would clarify the meaning of the term \"quality salmon\" as agreed upon by the parties.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply to preclude testimony in cases such as this one where the testimony would explain what the parties meant by the terms they used."
