The deadweight loss in this market would decrease.\n\nWhen a monopoly is regulated to produce at the allocative efficient quantity, it means that the government sets the price and quantity such that the marginal cost equals the marginal benefit. This is the point where the market would naturally operate in a competitive market without any inefficiencies. By doing so, the government eliminates the deadweight loss that would otherwise occur in a monopoly market, where the quantity produced is less than the allocative efficient quantity. This results in a more efficient allocation of resources and a higher level of welfare for society."
