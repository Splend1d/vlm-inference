When John borrowed the car from Mary, he had a duty to return it to her, which alignss with Mary's right to have her property returned to her. The other options do not directly relate to a right to goods and services:\n\nB. John's duty to allow Mary to pursue goals that she values - This is more about freedom of choice and autonomy rather than a right to goods and services.\n\nC. John's duty to not harm Mary - This is a duty to protect Mary's safety and well-being, which is related to her right to life and safety, but not specifically to goods and services.\n\nD. John's duty to not commit suicide - This is a duty to protect one's own life, which is related to the right to life, but not specifically to goods and services."
