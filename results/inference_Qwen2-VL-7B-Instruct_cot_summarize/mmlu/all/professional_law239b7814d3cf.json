The gift violates the equal protection rights of secular organizations.\nB. The gift violates the establishment clause.\nC. The gift is a taking of federal property without just compensation.\nD.

The gift violates the establishment clause.\n\nThe establishment clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from establishing an official religion. In this context, the law that grants buses to a religious organization for the purpose of spreading a moral message of sexual abstinence to teenagers at school assemblies could be seen as establishing an official religion or endorsing a particular religious viewpoint. This would violate the establishment clause, as it would be using government resources to promote a specific religious message, which is not permissible under the Constitution."
