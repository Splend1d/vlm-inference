This is because a recession in Japan would likely lead to a decrease in demand for U.S. goods and services, as Japanese consumers and businesses would have less disposable income to spend on imports. \n\nAs for the value of the dollar and yen, it is difficult to predict with certainty how they would change. However, it is possible that the value of the dollar could increase, as the U.S. economy may become relatively stronger compared to the Japanese economy. On the other hand, the value of the yen could decrease, as the Japanese economy may become relatively weaker compared to the U.S. economy. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nA.
