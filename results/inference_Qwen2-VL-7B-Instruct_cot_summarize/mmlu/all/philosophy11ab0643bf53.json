Nagel, arises because:\n\nD. our theories of human action are hopelessly off track.\n\nNagel argues that moral luck challenges traditional theories of moral responsibility because it can undermine the idea that individuals are responsible for their actions based on their intentions and choices. Moral luck refers to the influence of factors over which an individual has no control, such as circumstances or chance, that affect the moral evaluation of their actions. This can lead to situations where individuals are held morally responsible for actions that, in reality, were not under their control, thus questioning the validity of traditional moral theories."
