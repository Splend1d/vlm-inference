During a fraternity party, the defendant pulled out a gun, pointed it at the other student and said, \"Beg for your life, sucker. \" The student, who knew that the defendant had a reputation as a practical joker, said, \"Get lost, you jerk. \" The defendant then pulled the trigger and shot the student to death. A statute in this jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing with malice aforethought is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is any killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a serious or inherently dangerous felony. Manslaughter includes all other types of unlawftil homicide and unjustifiable killings. \"The defendant was subsequently prosecuted for killing the student. At trial, the defendant testified that a fellow fraternity member gave him the gun before the shooting and told him that it was unloaded.

This is because the defendant's actions were not premeditated or intentional, and there was no malice aforethought. Therefore, the defendant's actions did not meet the criteria for first-degree murder or second-second degree murder. However, the defendant's actions did result in the death of another person, which makes it a type of unlawful homicide. Therefore, the defendant should be found guilty of manslaughter."
