Since the vacation pay is a liability that has been incurred but not yet paid, it should be reported as an expense in the financial statements.\n\n4. **Report the Liability and Expense:**\n\n   - Liability: $0 ( (Since the vacation pay has not yet been paid, there is no liability reported)\n   - Expense: $2800\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. $0 $2800"
