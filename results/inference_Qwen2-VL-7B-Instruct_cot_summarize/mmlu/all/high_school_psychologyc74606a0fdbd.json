Consider the initial testing experience positive.\n\nResearch in psychology, particularly in the field of positive psychology, suggests that a positive mindset can enhance memory and cognitive performance. When a participant is exposed to positive words and maintains a positive attitude during the initial testing experience, it is more likely that they will retain and recall those words more effectively a week later. This phenomenon is often referred to as the \"positive affect\" effect, where positive emotions can improve memory and learning outcomes.\n\nOption A ( is tested by a researcher who deliberately exhibits a positive attitude, while potentially beneficial, does not directly relate to the participant's own positive experience during the initial exposure to the words.\n\nOption B, being in a positive mood when initially exposed to the words, is related but not as specific as option D. It is the participant's own positive experience that matters, not necessarily the mood of of the researcher.\n\nOption C, considering oneself a \"positive\" person, regardless of mood during the experience, does not directly address the immediate positive experience during the initial testing.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D. Consider the initial testing experience positive."
