The 64th percentile means that Mary scored higher than 64% of the test-takers, and the 56th percentile means that Pam scored higher than 56% of the test-takers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mary scored eight more points than Pam.\n- We don't have any information about the actual scores of Mary and Pam, so we cannot determine if this statement is true.\n\nB. Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's.\n- Similar to option A, we don't have the actual scores to determine if this statement is true.\n\nC. Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The percentiles do not provide information about the distribution of scores between Pam and Mary. It is possible that Pam scored higher than Mary, or they could have scored the same.\n\nD. Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The percentiles do not provide information about the total number of test-takers or the distribution of scores among them. It is possible that more or fewer than thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\n\nGiven the information provided, none of the statements can be definitively proven true based solely on the percentiles. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNone of the statements are necessarily true based on the information provided."
