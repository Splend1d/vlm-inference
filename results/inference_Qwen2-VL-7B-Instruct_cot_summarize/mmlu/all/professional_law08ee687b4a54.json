The contract stipulated that no money would be due until the owner's caretaker approved the work done by the painter. The painter completed the painting of all six cottages. Two days after the painter had finished the painting, a wildfire destroyed the six cottages. Although the caretaker had inspected four of the cottages to his approval, he had not inspected the other two cottages prior to their destruction. Which of the following is the LEAST accurate statement with respect to the caretaker's approval of the painting of the cottages?\n\nA. The owner would only be obligated to pay for the painting of the four cottages that the caretaker approved.\nB. The caretaker's approval of the painting of the two cottages destroyed by the wild fire would be excused.\nC. The owner would be obligated to pay for the painting of all of the cottages.\nD. The impossibility of securing the caretaker's approval would render the owner absolutely liable for all of the painting.\n"

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the contract stipulation and the events that occurred. The key points are:\n\n1. The contract stipulates that no money would be due until the owner's caretaker approved the work done by the painter.\n2. The painter completed the painting of all six cottages.\n3. Two days after the painter had finished the painting, a wildfire destroyed the six cottages.\n4. The caretaker had inspected four of the cottages to his approval, but had not inspected the other two cottages prior to their destruction.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The owner would only be obligated to pay for the painting of the four cottages that the caretaker approved.\n- This statement is accurate because the contract stipulates that payment is due only after the caretaker approves the work. Since the caretaker approved four cottages, the owner would be obligated to pay for those four cottages.\n\nB. The caretaker's approval of the painting of the two cottages destroyed by the wild fire would be excused.\n- This statement is accurate because the caretaker had not inspected the two cottages that were destroyed, so their approval would be excused.\n\nC. The owner would be obligated to pay for the painting of all of the cottage.\n- This statement is inaccurate because the contract stipulates that payment is due only after the caretaker approves the work. Since the caretaker did not approve the painting of the two cottages that were destroyed, the owner would not be obligated to pay for those two cottage.\n\nD. The impossibility of securing the caretaker's approval would render the owner absolutely liable for all of the painting.\n- This statement is inaccurate because the contract stipulates that payment is due only after the caretaker approves the work. The caretaker's approval is a condition precedent to payment, and the impossibility of securing the caretaker's approval does not make the owner absolutely liable for all of the painting.\n\nTherefore, the least accurate statement is:\n\nC. The owner would be obligated to pay for the painting of all of the cottage."
