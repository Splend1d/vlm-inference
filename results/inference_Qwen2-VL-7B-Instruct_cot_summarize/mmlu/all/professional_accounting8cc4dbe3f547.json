Stock A:\n   - Shares: 100\n   - Fair value per share at the end of the year: $51\n   - Fair value of Stock A at the end of the year: 100 shares * $51 per share = $5,100\n\n2. Stock B:\n   - Shares: 200\n   - Fair value per share at the end of the year: $49\n   - Fair value of Stock B at the end of the year: 200 shares * $49 per share = $9,800\n\nNow, we sum up the fair values of both stocks to get the total amount to be reported in the year-end statement of financial position:\n\nTotal amount = Fair value of Stock A + Fair value of Stock B\nTotal amount = $5,100 + $9,800\nTotal amount = $14,900\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. $14,900"
