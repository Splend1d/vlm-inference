It dissociates in water as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3(aq) \\rightarrow 2\\text{Na}^+(aq) + \\text{CO}_3^{2-}(aq)\n     \\]\n   - The carbonate ion (CO3^2-) is a weak base and can react with water to produce hydroxide ions (OH-:\n     \\[\n     \\text{CO}_3^{2-}(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(lq) \\rightarrow \\text{HCO}_3^-(aq) + \\text{OH}^-(aq)\n     \\]\n   - This reaction increases the pH of the solution.\n\n2. **Na3PO4 Sodium Phosphate**\n   - Sodium phosphate (Na3PO4) is a weak base and a strong base. It dissociates in water as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Na}_3\\text{PO}_4(aq) \\rightarrow 3\\text{Na}^+(aq) + \\text{PO}_4^{3-}(aq)\n     \\]\n   - The phosphate ion (PO4^3-) is a weak base and can react with water to produce hydroxide ions (OH-:\n     \\[\n     \\text{PO}_4^{3-}(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(lq) \\rightarrow \\text{HPO}_4^{2-}(aq) + \\text{OH}^-(aq)\n     \\]\n   - This reaction increases the pH of the solution.\n\n3. **Na2S Sodium Sulfide**\n   - Sodium sulfide (Na2S) is a weak base and a strong base. It dissociates in water as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Na}_2\\text{S}(aq) \\rightarrow 2\\text{Na}^+(aq) + \\text{S}^{2-}(aq)\n     \\]\n   - The sulfide ion (S^2-) is a weak base and can react with water to produce hydroxide ions (OH-:\n     \\[\n     \\text{S}^{2-}(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(lq) \\rightarrow \\text{HS}^{-}(aq) + \\text{OH}^-(aq)\n     \\]\n   - This reaction increases the pH of the solution.\n\n4. **NaCl Sodium Chloride**\n   - Sodium chloride (NaCl) is a strong electrolyte and dissociates completely in water as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{NaCl}(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{Na}^+(aq) + \\text{Cl}^-((aq)\n     \\]\n   - Sodium chloride does not produce any hydrogen ions (H+) in water, so it does not affect the pH.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the solution with the lowest pH is the one that does not produce any hydrogen ions. Therefore, the solution with the lowest pH is:\n\n**D. NaCl ( Sodium Chloride**"
