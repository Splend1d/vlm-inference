The bill created a great deal of controversy, both in and outside the state government. Several leaders of the minority party in the legislature decided to oppose the legislation. One member of the minority party disagreed with his party's opposition to the bill and publicly announced his support for the legislation. The minority party leaders called a caucus to discuss and determine their legislative strategy for floor debate on the bill. When the disagreeing member appeared at the door of the caucus room, he was denied admission because of his anti-party stance. He was also informed that he would be removed from all of his committee assignments. During the caucus, the party members discussed other means of disciplining the member for his party insubordination. It was suggested that they issue a press release in which the party would publicly castigate him for his actions. The leader of the party said that \"the member is a cutthroat politician who is only looking out for where his next buck will come from. \"Which of the following constitutional provisions would give the ousted member his best grounds for challenging his exclusion from the party caucus?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\nC. The speech and debate clause.\nD. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no state shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" In this context, the member's exclusion from the party caucus could be seen as a deprivation of his liberty, as he was denied the opportunity to participate in a critical decision-making process within his political party. The due process clause would likely be invoked to argue that the member was denied a fair process for his exclusion, which could be a violation of his constitutional rights."
