The brothers took the wife hostage, pointed a gun at her head, and demanded that she drive them in her car to their hideout. As the wife was driving down the street, a woman pushing her baby in a stroller suddenly stopped in the middle of the intersection. In order to avoid hitting the woman and her child, the wife veered the car to the left, and intentionally struck a bystander, instantly killing him.

In this scenario, the wife was being held hostage and threatened with violence by the two brothers. The threat of harm to herself and her family was so severe that it it could be argued that she was compelled to commit the act of veering the car to avoid hitting the woman and her child. Therefore, she would most likely be found not guilty by reason of duress."
