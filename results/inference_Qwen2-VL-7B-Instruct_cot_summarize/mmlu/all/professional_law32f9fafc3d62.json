At the time, no one was in the treatment room except the doctor and the child; the mother had left the room to get a cup of coffee. Two weeks later, when the child told her mother what had occurred in the treatment room, the mother suffered severe emotional distress that caused her to become physically ill. In an action against the doctor by the mother on her own behalf to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress, is the mother likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the mother was contributorily negligent in leaving the child alone with the doctor during treatment.\nB. No, because the mother was neither the direct victim of the doctor's conduct nor a contemporaneous witness.\nC. Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.\nD. Yes, because the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.\n\nIn the context of intentional infliction of emotional distress ( (IIED), the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's conduct was outrageous and that it caused the plaintiff to suffer severe emotional distress. The fact that the mother was not in the treatment room at the time of the incident does not necessarily preclude her from recovering for IIED. The key issue is whether the doctor's conduct was outrageous and whether it caused the mother to suffer severe emotional distress.\n\nThe mother's emotional distress and subsequent physical illness are likely to be considered as severe emotional distress, and the doctor's conduct was likely to be considered as outrageous, given the circumstances. Therefore, the mother is likely to prevail in her action against the doctor for intentional infliction of emotional distress."
