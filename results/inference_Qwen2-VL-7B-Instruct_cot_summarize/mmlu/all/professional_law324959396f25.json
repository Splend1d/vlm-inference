This income tax exempts taxable income earned outside of the state by photographers who live in the state. Moreover, resident-photographers of the state are not taxed on their in-state earned income. A photographer who operates a studio in the state but is a resident of another state, challenges the constitutionality of this tax. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The commerce clause.\nD. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\n"

The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis clause is relevant because it involves a state taxing nonresident photographers differently than resident photographers, which could potentially be seen as a violation of the equal protection clause if the tax is not applied uniformly or if it disproportionately burdens nonresidents. The challenge is based on the argument that the tax discriminates against nonresidents compared to residents, which is a core concern under the equal protection clause."
