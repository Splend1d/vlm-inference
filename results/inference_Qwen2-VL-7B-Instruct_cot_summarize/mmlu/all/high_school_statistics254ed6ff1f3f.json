First, we need to convert the score of 740 into a z-score, which is the number of standard deviations away from the mean. The formula for the z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the score we're interested in ( (740), \\(\\mu\\) is the mean ( (650), and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation ( (45).\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(740 - 650)}{45} = \\frac{90}{45} = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the area under to the left of \\(z = 2\\) in the standard normal distribution, which represents the percentage of scores below 740. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the area to the left of \\(z = 2\\) is approximately 0.9772.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of applicants with scores below 740 is:\n\n\\[ 100 \\times 0.9772 = 97.72\\% \\]\n\nNone of the provided options (A, B, C, or D) match this result.
