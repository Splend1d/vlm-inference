When an employee in one of those categories sought a promotion, the government required him or her to undergo a program of providing urine specimens for analysis. The union claimed that these searches were in violation of the Fourth Amendment's right to privacy and to be free from unreasonable searches. The union lost the case in the lower federal court and in the Court of Appeals, but the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear it. What will the Supreme Court decide?\n\nA. The drug testing policy is unconstitutional because the searches are made without probable cause or suspicion.\nB. The drug testing policy is unconstitutional in that it violates the employees' legitimate expectations of privacy.\nC. It is reasonable to conduct suspicionless testing of employees who are involved in drug interdiction or the handling of firearms.\nD. It is reasonable for a government employer to conduct suspicionless searches under any circumstances.\n"

This is because the Court has previously upheld similar policies in cases involving the military and other government agencies, finding that such testing is necessary to ensure the safety and security of the workplace and the public. The Court may also consider the nature of the job and the potential risks associated with it, as well as the need to maintain a drug-free workplace."
