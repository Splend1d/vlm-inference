Fallacy of Composition\n\nThis fallacy occurs when someone assumes that what is true for the whole must also be true for the parts, or vice versa. In this case, the student assumes that because the class as a whole was the best class Professor Jones had ever had, each individual student must also be the best student he had ever had. This is a fallacy of composition because it being the best class does not necessarily mean that each individual student is the best student."
