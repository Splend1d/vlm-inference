The student would not eat any more pizza.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The marginal utility of the third slice is still positive (3 util, which means the student would still benefit from eating more pizza.\n\n   **B. The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be 0.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The marginal utility of the 4th slice is not provided, and it could be positive, negative, or zero.\n\n   **C. The student should have stopped eating pizza after 2 slices.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The student should stop eating pizza when the marginal utility of the next slice becomes zero or negative. Since the third slice has a positive marginal utility, the student should continue eating.\n\n   **D. The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 20 util.**\n   - This statement is true. The total utility is calculated as the sum of the marginal utilities of all slices consumed, which is 20 util.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**D. The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 20 util.**"
