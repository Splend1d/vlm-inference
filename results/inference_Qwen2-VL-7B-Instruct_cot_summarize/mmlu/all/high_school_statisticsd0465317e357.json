The mean income is $20,500, and the standard deviation is $3,750.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-scores for $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( X \\) is the income value\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean income\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation\n\nFor $13,000:\n\\[ z_1 = \\frac{(13,000 - 20,500)}{3,750} = \\frac{-7,500}{3,750} = -2 \\]\n\nFor $28,000:\n\\[ z_2 = \\frac{(28,000 - 20,500)}{3,750} = \\frac{7,500}{3,750} = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of an income between $13,000 and $28,000. This corresponds to the area under to the z-scores of -2 and 2 in a standard normal distribution.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n- The probability of a z-score being less than -2 is approximately 0.0228.\n- The probability of a z-score being less than 2 is approximately 0.9772.\n\nThe probability of a z-score being between -2 and 2 is:\n\\[ P(-2 < z < 2) = p(z < 2) - p(z < -2) \\]\n\\[ p(-2 < z < 2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the number of employees with incomes between $13,000 and $28,000:\n\\[ \\text{Number of employees} = p(-2 < z < 2) \\times \\text{Total number of employees} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of employees} = 0.9544 \\times 400 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of employees} \\approx 381.76 \\]\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an employee, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 382.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is:\nD. 390"
