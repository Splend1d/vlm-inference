Finally, the woman hired a handyman to build a wooden stake fence between her property and her neighbor's property for $10,000. The handyman built the fence as agreed, and the woman paid him the sum of $10,000. Two weeks later, the neighbor was operating his lawn mower near the property line between his and the woman's property when a section of the fence suddenly fell on top of him, seriously injuring him. A subsequent investigation revealed that the handyman did not properly reinforce the fence. Which of the following is the handyman's best defense in a contract action brought against him by the neighbor, in which the only damages alleged are those for the neighbor's personal injuries?\n\nA. Damages for personal injuries cannot be recovered in a contract action.\nB. Damages for personal injuries to the neighbor were not within the contemplation of the woman and the handyman at the time they entered into their agreement.\nC. The neighbor is only an incidental beneficiary of the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\nD. The neighbor has no standing to assert such an action, since he was not a party to the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\n"

Damages for personal injuries to the neighbor were not within the contemplation of the woman and the handyman at the time they entered into their agreement.\n\nThis defense is based on the principle of \"contra proferentem,\" which means that when there is ambiguity in a contract, the court will interpret the contract against the party who drafted it. In this case, the handyman did not properly reinforce the fence, which led to the injury. If the agreement was clear and specific, it would have likely stated that the handyman would be responsible for any damages resulting from the fence falling. However, since the agreement did not contemplate such damages, the handyman can argue that the neighbor's personal injuries were not within the scope of the contract.\n\nThe other options are not as strong defenses in this context:\n\nA. Damages for personal injuries cannot be recovered in a contract action.\n- This is incorrect because personal injuries can be recovered in a contract action if they are a foreseeable result of the breach of contract.\n\nC. The neighbor is only an incidental beneficiary of the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\n- This is not a valid defense because the neighbor is not an incidental beneficiary but rather a direct victim of the breach of contract.\n\nD. The neighbor has no standing to assert such an action, since he was not a party to the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\n- This is incorrect because the neighbor is a direct victim of the breach of contract and has standing to assert the action.\n\nTherefore, the best defense is option B."
