At trial, the insurer called as an expert witness an engineer, who testified that the pipe had burst because of age rather than freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that five years earlier, he had been convicted of tax fraud, even though he had asserted that it was his accountant's error. In response, the insurer calls a witness, who is well acquainted with the engineer and his reputation, to testify that (1) in the witness's opinion, the engineer is a truthful person, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person. How much, if any, of the witness's testimony is admissible?\n\nA. All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.\nB. Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\nC. Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.\nD. None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.\n"

Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.\n\nIn the context of the case, the witness's testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility. The portion of the testimony that states the witness's opinion that the engineer is truthful is admissible as it it is an opinion of the witness's own character. However, the portion of the testimony that reports the neighbors' comments about the engineer's truthfulness is hearsay. Hearsay is generally inadmissible in court because it it is not based on personal knowledge of the witness. Therefore, only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character is admissible, but the portion concerning the neighbors' comments is not."
