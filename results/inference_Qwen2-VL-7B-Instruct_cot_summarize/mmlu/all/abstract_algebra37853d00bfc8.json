In this case, we are asked to find the index of the subgroup <p> in S_5, where p is a permutation in s_5.\n\nFirst, let's find the order of p. The order of a permutation is the smallest positive integer n such that p^k = e, where e is the identity permutation. In this case, p = ( (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) = is a product of two disjoint cycles, one of length 4 and one of length 2. The order of p is the least common multiple of the lengths of these cycles, which is lcm(4, 2) = 4.\n\nNow, let's find the order of s_5. The order of a symmetric group S_n is n! ( In this case, the order of s_5 is 5! = 120.\n\nFinally, we can find the index of <p> in s_5 by dividing the order of s_5 by the order of p. In this case, the index of <p> in s_5 is 120 / 4 = 30.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not listed in the options provided."
