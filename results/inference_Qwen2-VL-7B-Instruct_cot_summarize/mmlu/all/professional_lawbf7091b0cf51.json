When the art collector described a painting by a well-known artist, the woman indicated she might like to buy that painting. The art collector said, \"I'll sell you the painting for $10,000. I'll give you 30 days to decide whether you want the painting. \" On March 25, the art collector wrote to the woman and stated that the offer of March 15 was withdrawn. The woman received the March 25 letter on March 26. On March 27, the woman wrote the art collector the following letter:\"Please be advised that I hereby accept your offer of March 15. \" The art collector received this letter on March28. Thereafter, the art collector and the woman engaged in several telephone discussions. On April 10, the woman, in a telephone conversation, told the art collector that she would pay $15,000 if the painting was delivered on or before April 15. The art collector agreed to deliver the painting for $15,000. On April 15, the art collector tendered the painting, but the woman refused to pay more than $10,000. If the art collector asserts a claim against the woman for breach of contract, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The art collector is obligated to sell the woman the painting for $10,000, because the woman, as offeree, had the right to accept the initial offer within the 30-day period.\nB. Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.\nC. Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting.\nD. An enforceable contract does not exist between the parties, because of mutual mistake of fact.\n"

Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Offer and Acceptance**: The art collector initially offered to sell the painting for $10,000 with a 30-day acceptance period. The woman accepted this offer on March 27, which was within the 30-day period. This acceptance created a binding contract between the parties.\n\n2. **Revocation of Offer**: On March 25, the art collector withdrew the offer. However, this withdrawal was not effective until it was received by the offeree (the woman. The woman received the withdrawal letter on March 26, but it was not until March 27 that she accepted the offer. Therefore, the withdrawal was not effective at the time of acceptance.\n\n3. **Subsequent Agreement**: On April 10, the woman and the art collector engaged in a telephone conversation where the woman agreed to pay $15,000 if the painting was delivered by April 15. This this conversation, the parties entered into a subsequent modification of the original contract. This this modification, the woman was obligated to pay $15,000 for the painting.\n\n4. **Breach of Contract**: When the art collector tendered the painting on April 15, the woman refused to pay more than $10,000. This this refusal, the woman breached the subsequent agreement.\n\nTherefore, the art collector can assert a claim against the woman for breach of contract based on the subsequent agreement, which obligated the woman to pay $15,000 for the painting."
