Conservation of mass indicates that if a single new particle were created in the reaction, it must have a total mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron.\nB. Conservation of charge indicates that all new particles created in the reaction would have no electric charge.\nC. Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created.\nD. Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.\n"

Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.\n\nThis is because when a positron ( (which has a positive charge) and an electron ( (which has a negative charge) interact, they can annihilate each other, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of gamma rays. This process is known as electron-positron annihilation. The energy released is equal to the rest energy of the positron and the electron, which is approximately 1.0 MeV ( (megaelectronvolts). The stationary electron would remain unaffected by this process, as it is not involved in the annihilation reaction."
