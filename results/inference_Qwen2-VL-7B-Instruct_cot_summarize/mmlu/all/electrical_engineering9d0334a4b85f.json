The holding current of a thyristor is the minimum current that must be maintained to keep the thyristor in the on state. The latching current is the minimum current that must be applied to the thyristor to turn it thyristor on from the off state.\n\nThe latching current is typically much higher than the holding current. The latching current is usually several orders of magnitude higher than the holding current. This is because the latching current is required to overcome the internal resistance of the thyristor and to generate the necessary voltage to turn the thyristor on.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B."
