Micah ate an even number of strawberries.\n2. Micah ate an odd number of apples.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. sSSSS; AAA\n- This option has 5 strawberries ( (sSSSS) and 3 apples ( (AAA). 5 is an odd number, and 3 is an odd number. This option does not meet the criteria of having an even number of strawberries.\n\nB. sSSSS; AAAA\n- This option has 5 strawberries ( (sSSSS) and 4 apples ( (AAAA). 5 is an odd number, and 4 is an even number. This option does not meet the criteria of having an even number of strawberries.\n\nC. sSSSSSSS; AAAA\n- This option has 8 strawberries ( (sSSSSSSS) and 4 apples ( (AAAA). 8 is an even number, and 4 is an even number. This option does not meet the criteria of having an odd number of apples.\n\nD. sSSSSSSS; A\n- This option has 8 strawberries ( (sSSSSSSS) and 1 apple ( (A). 8 is an even number, and 1 is an odd number. This option meets the criteria of having an even number of strawberries and an odd number of apples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. sSSSSSSS; A"
