                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement to determine which one is correct:\n\nA. **Hypertension in older people is unlikely to be associated with high salt intake.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Hypertension (high blood pressure) in older people is often associated with high salt intake. Sodium (found in salt) is a major contributor to blood pressure, and reducing salt intake can help manage hypertension.\n\nB. **There is strong evidence that supplements of vitamin B12 will improve cognitive function in older people.**\n   - This statement is correct. Vitamin B12 ( also known as cobalamin) is essential for brain health and cognitive function. Deficiencies in vitamin B12 can lead to cognitive decline, and supplements have been shown to improve cognitive function in older people.\n\nC. **Older people are no more likely to have low haemoglobin concentration than younger people.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Low haemoglobin concentration ( anemia) is more common in older people due to various factors such as reduced iron absorption, chronic diseases, and medication effects.\n\nD. **Folate deficiency in older people is less prevalent in countries with mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Folic acid fortification of flour is designed to prevent neural tube defects in newborns. However, older people may still be at risk for folate deficiency due to other factors such as poor diet, malabsorption, and chronic diseases.\n\nThe correct statement is:\n\nB. There is strong evidence that supplements of vitamin B12 will improve cognitive function in older people."
