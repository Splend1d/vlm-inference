After the dishwasher had been installed in the buyer's home, it functioned properly for the first month. Then it began to make a loud rattling noise whenever it was in use. The buyer called the appliance store, and a manager there assured her that it was not uncommon for the dishwasher to make such a noise. Moreover, he indicated that the machine's clamorous sound would eventually disappear with continued use. One week later, after a dinner party, the buyer placed her most expensive china set in the dishwasher and turned on the machine. After the dishwasher had been in operation for a few minutes, the buyer heard the rattling noise followed by the sound of breaking china. She immediately stopped the machine. Upon looking inside, she saw that a blade from the dishwasher had broken, destroying her entire china set. If the buyer asserts a claim for strict products liability against the appliance company, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\nB. Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.\nC. No, because the buyer was not personally injured.\nD. No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.\n"

Strict products liability is a legal doctrine that holds manufacturers liable for injuries caused by defective products, regardless of fault. The buyer's claim hinges on proving that the dishwasher was defective and that this defect caused the injury (\u2014in this case, the destruction of her china set.\n\nThe key elements for the buyer to prove in this case are:\n\n1. **Defectiveness of the Product**: The dishwasher was found to have a blade that broke, which is a defect in the product.\n2. **Proximate Cause**: The defect in the dishwasher (the broken blade) caused the injury (\u2014the destruction of the china set.\n3. **Lack of Fault**: The buyer does not need to prove that the appliance company was negligent or that the company knew about the defect before the injury occurred. The liability is strict and applies regardless of fault.\n\nGiven these elements, the buyer has a strong case for strict products liability. The fact that the manager assured her that the noise would disappear with continued use does not negate the defectiveness of the product. The manager's statement does not address the potential for the blade to break, which is the actual defect that caused the injury.\n\nTherefore, the buyer would likely prevail in her claim for strict products liability."
