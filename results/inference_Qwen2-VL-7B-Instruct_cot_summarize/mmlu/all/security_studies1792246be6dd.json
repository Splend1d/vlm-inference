Fission nuclear weapons are gun-type devices that require a relatively small amount of fissile uranium-235 material to produce a comparatively large explosion because mass and energy becomes interchangeable in the barrel. Implosion devices however are unable to sustain the reaction; the neutron generator is unable to set off the interchange being destroyed in the explosion.\nB. Implosion fissure devices are constructed with relative ease because unlike the gun-type fissure device it uses high-explosive shaped lenses to compress the fissile material to critical tolerance. Detonation is highly volatile with a high potential of \"going critical\".\nC. Fissile weapons are produced by the rapid rearrangement of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in a chamber, striking each other at high velocities the friction sparking a chemical explosion.\nD. Gun-type devices are of rugged design using two sub-critical masses fired down a barrel at very high velocities with a high probability of producing a reaction. Implosion devices are more complex, requiring the assembling of shaped charges to compress the fissile material to critical tolerances, and are detonated with more than split-second timing.\n"

Fission is the process by which a heavy nucleus, such as uranium-235, is split into two lighter nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This energy is harnessed to create a nuclear explosion.\n\nThere are two main types of fission nuclear weapons: gun-type devices and implosion devices. Gun-type devices use a relatively small amount of fissile material to produce a large explosion. The fissile material is contained in a barrel, and two sub-critical masses are fired down the barrel at very high velocities. The high velocity of the masses causes them to collide with each other, causing the fissile material to undergo fission and release a large amount of energy in the form of an explosion.\n\nImplosion devices, on the other hand, use high-explosive shaped lenses to compress the fissile material to critical tolerances. The high-explosive lenses are designed to focus the energy of the explosion on the fissile material, causing it to undergo fission and release a large amount of energy in the form of an explosion. Implosion devices are more complex than gun-type devices, as they require the assembling of shaped charges to compress the fissile material to critical tolerances, and are detonated with more than split-second timing.\n\nIn summary, fission nuclear weapons are a type of nuclear weapon that relies on the process of nuclear fission to produce a large amount of energy in the form of an explosion.
