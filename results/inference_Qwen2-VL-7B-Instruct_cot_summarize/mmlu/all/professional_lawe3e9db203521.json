After exhausting his appeals, he filed for post-conviction relief, alleging that he had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. He established that his counsel had not advised him of the benefits of plea bargaining, and had withheld several offers for guilty pleas from the government. The offers expired for lack of a response. The sentence he received was at least seven to eight years more than if he had entered a guilty plea. Will the court likely decide that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel?\n\nA. Yes, because plea bargaining is a critical stage of a criminal case and an attorney who ignores that process is constitutionally ineffective.\nB. No, because plea bargaining is not a critical necessity in a criminal case and counsel has no duty to discuss such options with the defendant.\nC. When the defendant indicates he wants to fight the charges, there is no need for counsel to relay plea offers or discuss the options with him.\nD. Because this defendant was convicted at a fair trial he didn't lose any rights and was not prejudiced by his lawyer's mistakes.\n"

Yes, because plea bargaining is a critical stage of a criminal case and an attorney who ignores that process is constitutionally ineffective.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to the effective assistance of counsel. This means that a defendant has a right to counsel who provides competent representation. In the context of plea bargaining, which is a critical stage of a criminal case, an attorney's failure to inform the defendant of plea offers and the benefits of plea bargaining can be seen as a failure to provide effective assistance of counsel. The fact that the defendant received a sentence that was at least seven to eight years more severe than if he had entered a guilty plea supports the argument that the defendant was prejudiced by his attorney's failure to inform him of plea offers. Therefore, the court is likely to decide that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel."
