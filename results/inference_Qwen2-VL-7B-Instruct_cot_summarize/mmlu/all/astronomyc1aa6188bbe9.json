The flux \\( F \\) from a star is inversely proportional to the square of the distance \\( d \\) from the star. This relationship is given by the inverse square law:\n\n\\[ F \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2} \\]\n\nGiven that the current solar flux on Earth is \\( 1380 \\text{ W/m}^2 \\) and Europa is at a distance of 5 AU from Jupiter, we can set up the following equation to find the required brightness \\( B \\) of the Sun for Europa to receive the same flux:\n\n\\[ \\frac{B}{1380} = \\left(\\frac{5}{1}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ B = 1380 \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{1}\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ B = 1380 \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ B = 34500 \\]\n\nNow, we need to compare this to the current brightness of the Sun, which is approximately \\( 1380 \\text{ W/m}^2 \\). To find how many times brighter the Sun would have to be, we divide the required brightness by the current brightness:\n\n\\[ \\text{Brightness ratio} = \\frac{34500}{1380} \\approx 25 \\]\n\nTherefore, the Sun would have to be approximately 25 times brighter for Europa to receive the same solar flux as Earth.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. 25 times brighter"
