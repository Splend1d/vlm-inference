Having students determine whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal\n\nThis task is best targeted at teaching students to compare quantities because it involves directly comparing the number of red apples to the number of yellow apples. It requires students to count or estimate the number of apples of each color and then compare those quantities. This activity helps students develop an understanding of quantity comparison, which is a foundational mathematical skill."
