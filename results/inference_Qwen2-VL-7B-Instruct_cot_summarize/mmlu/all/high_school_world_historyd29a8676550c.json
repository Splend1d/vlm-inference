Let's analyze each option in the context of the historical and religious background of India during the Mauryan period.\n\n1. **Option A: The rise of Sikhism as a syncretic faith**\n   - Sikhism originated in the 15th century, long after the Mauryan period ( (circa 6th century BCE to 3rd century BCE). Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.\n\n2. **Option B: The arrival of Islam as a new religion borne by external invaders**\n   - Islam was introduced to India during the 7th century CE, centuries after the Mauryan period. Hence, this is not a correct answer.\n\n3. **Option C: The eradication of traditional Hinduism by armed force**\n   - This is historically inaccurate. The Mauryan Empire, under led by Ashoka, did not engage in widespread destruction of religious sites or eradication of traditional Hinduism. Instead, Ashoka is known for his conversion to Buddhism and his efforts to spread Buddhist teachings.\n\n4. **Option D: The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts**\n   - This is a correct answer. Ashoka, the Mauryan emperor, is well-known for his conversion to Buddhism and his efforts to spread Buddhist teachings. He issued edicts that promoted Buddhist principles and encouraged the construction of Buddhist monuments and monasteries.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts**"
