The property consisted of a single-family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. During her occupancy, the boss paid $3,500 each year in insurance and property taxes. In addition, the premises on the property had a fair market value during this period of $1,500 each year. Following her mother's death, the boss's daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. As the administratrix of the boss's estate, the daughter sought to collect from the co-worker one- half of the cost of insurance and property taxes that the boss paid. Conversely, the co-worker claimed that he was not liable for any of the expenses. Furthermore, the coworker's attorney advised him that the daughter did not own any interest in the property and that since the boss's death, he (the co-worker) owned the entire property. The attorney also informed the co-worker that the daughter owed him rent for the entire period of her occupancy, and if she continued to occupy the premises, then she would be liable for insurance and property taxes as well. In an appropriate action to determine the title of the property, what, if any, interest does the daughter have in the said property?\n\nA. None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship.\nB. An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.\nC. An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.\nD. An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole.\n"

An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.\n\nIn this case, the property was devised to both the co-worker and the boss as \"community property.\" Community property is a type of ownership in which both spouses have equal rights to the property, and it is typically used in states that recognize community property laws. In a community property state, if one spouse dies, the surviving spouse typically retains their half of the property, and the deceased spouse's half is transferred to their heirs.\n\nSince the boss and the co-worker were siblings and not married, the property was likely held as a tenancy by the entirety. In a tenancy by the entirety, both siblings had equal rights to the property, and either could make a testamentary disposition of the property. Therefore, when the boss died intestate, her half of the property would have descended to her daughter as her sole heir.\n\nThus, the daughter has an undivided one-half interest in the property, as she inherited her mother's half of the property."
