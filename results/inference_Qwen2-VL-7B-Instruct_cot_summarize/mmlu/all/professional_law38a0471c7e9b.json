The written lease agreement specified that rent should be paid at a rate of $2,000 per month and provided that the tenants were required to pay two months rent initially, of which one half, or $2,000, should be held by the landlord as a security deposit. In addition, the lease contained the following provision:\"The duration of this lease shall be month-to-month and either party may have the right to terminate on thirty (30) days notice. \"The lease agreement did not specify whether notice of termination must be in writing, but it did provide that the deposit could be applied, at the landlord's option, to unpaid rent and to reimbursement for damage done by the tenant(s) to the apartment or the fixtures attached thereto. On January 1, the husband and wife paid the landlord $4,000 and moved in. The tenants then paid the $2,000 rent on the first of each of the months of February, March, and April, and all rents were duly accepted by the landlord. On February 1, the city enacted a housing code applicable to all multiple dwellings in the city. A provision of that code required that in \"any building having a main or central entrance that is open and accessible to the public directly from a public street, a doorkeeper shall be maintained on duty at all times. \" Although the landlord's building has such an entrance, the landlord failed to comply with the requirement. On March 15 and again on April 1, the husband and wife lodged complaints with the city's housing authority relating to the landlord's failure to hire a doorkeeper in violation of the code regulation. On April 5, the landlord orally gave notice to the tenants that he was terminating the lease and demanded that they vacate the premises by May 5. No damage was done to the apartment, furnishings, or fixtures. There is no statute applicable to cover any landlord \u0080\u0094tenant dispute except those related to housing and building codes. In the landlord's action to evict, the husband and wife have contested the landlord's right to terminate on May 5. If the tenants prevail, it will probably be because\n\nA. there was no damage to the apartment, furnishings, or fixtures.\nB. the statute of frauds requires that the notice of termination be in writing.\nC. the jurisdiction recognizes that retaliatory actions are a defense.\nD. the husband and wife have the option to apply their $2,000 deposit to cover May's rental.\n"

The landlord then terminates the lease and demands that the tenants vacate the premises by May 5. If the tenants prevail in the eviction action, it will probably be because the jurisdiction recognizes that retaliatory actions are a defense. This retaliatory action is a defense because the landlord's termination of the lease and demand for vacature may be seen as a retaliatory action against the tenants for lodging complaints with the housing authority."
