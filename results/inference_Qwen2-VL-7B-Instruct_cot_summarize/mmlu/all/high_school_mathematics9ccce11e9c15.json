                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and solve for $x$ and $y$.\n\nFirst, let's find the rates at which Rowena and Ruby paint. Rowena's rate is $\\frac{1}{14}$ of the room per hour, and Ruby's rate is $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the room per hour.\n\nWhen Rowena paints for $x$ hours and Ruby paints for $y$ hours, they finish half of the painting. This means:\n\\[x \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + y \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nWhen Ruby paints for $x$ hours and Rowena paints for $y$ hours, they paint the whole room. This means:\n\\[y \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 1\\]\n\nLet's solve these equations.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[x \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + y \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\\[6x + 14y = 21\\]  (Equation 1\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[y \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 1\\]\n\\[6y + 14x = 21\\]  Equation 2\n\nNow, let's solve this system of equations. We can multiply Equation 1 by 6 and Equation 2 by 14 to eliminate $y$:\n\\[36x + 84y = 126\\]\n\\[154x + 196y = 294\\]\n\nSubtractinging the first equation from the second gives:\n\\[118x + 112y = 168\\]\n\\[118x + 112y = 168\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[0 = 0\\]\n\nThis indicates that the equations are dependent and represent the same line, meaning there are infinitely many solutions. However, we need to find the specific solution that matches the given options. Let's go back to our original equations and try to solve them directly or use a different approach.\n\nGiven the complexity of directly solving the system, let's try a different approach by substituting or simplifying the equations. However, upon reevaluation, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the approach to directly solve the system of equations as presented. Let's correct the approach by directly solving the system of equations:\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\\[6x + 14y = 21\\]\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\\[14x + 6y = 21\\]\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 7 and the second by 3 to eliminate $y$:\n\\[42x + 98y = 147\\]\n\\[42x + 18y = 63\\]\n\nSubtractinging the second equation from the first gives:\n\\[80y = 84\\]\n\\[y = \\frac{84}{80} = \\frac{21}{20}\\]\n\nSubstitute $y = \\frac{21}{20}$ into one of the original equations to solve for $x$. Using Equation 1:\n\\[6x + 14(\\frac{21}{20}) = 21\\]\n\\[6x + \\frac{294}{20} = 21\\]\n\\[6x = 21 - \\frac{294}{20}\\]\n\\[6x = \\frac{420 - 294}{20}\\]\n\\[6x = \\frac{126}{20}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{126}{120}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{21}{20}\\]\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is $x = \\frac{21}{20}$ and $y = \\frac{21}{20}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the ordered pair $(x,y)$ is:\nB. $(\\frac{231}{20}, \\frac{21}{20})$"
