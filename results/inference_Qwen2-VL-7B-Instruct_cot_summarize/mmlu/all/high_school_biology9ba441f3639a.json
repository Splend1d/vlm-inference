Allopatric speciation**.\n\nAllopatric speciation occurs when two populations of the same species become geographically isolated from each other, leading to the evolution of reproductive barriers between them. In this scenario, the original fern population and the new variant population are geographically separated, preventing hybridization between them. The new variant can breed among themselves, but not with the original population, indicating the development of reproductive isolation."
