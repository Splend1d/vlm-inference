After losing a large amount of money, the defendants accused the victim of cheating. When the victim tried to leave, the defendants beat him with their fists and, as the victim fell to the ground, they continued by kicking him in the head. The victim suffered a fractured skull in the beating and died as a result of severe head trauma. Thereafter, the defendants reached into the victim's pocket and stole his wallet. The defendants were arrested and charged with the murder of the victim. Prior to trial, the prosecutor admitted that it was impossible to determine which defendant was responsible for actually fracturing the victim's skull. If the defendants are prosecuted for felony murder, which of the following would provide their best defense?\n\nA. The jurisdiction adheres to the inherently dangerous felony requirement.\nB. The jurisdiction follows the independent felony murder rule.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the proximate cause theory.\nD. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory.\n"

The jurisdiction follows the agency theory.\n\nThe agency theory holds that if one person commits an act that causes death while another person is aiding or abetting the act, both persons are liable for the murder. In this case, the defendant was present during the beating and was involved in the act of stealing the victim's wallet. Therefore, under the agency theory, the defendant would be held responsible for the murder even if it was impossible to determine which defendant was responsible for fracturing the victim's skull.\n\nThe other options are less likely to provide a strong defense:\n\nA. The inherently dangerous felony requirement is not applicable here because the defendant was not committing an inherently dangerous felony.\nB. The independent felony murder rule would require that the defendant committed an independent felony that caused the death, which is not the case here.\nC. The proximate cause theory would require that the defendant's actions were the direct cause of the death, which is not necessarily the case here."
