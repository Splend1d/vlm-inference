                    "text": " Let's denote the two positive even integers as $a$ and $b$. Since they are both even, their sum and product will also be even. \n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of $a$ and $b$. Since they are both less than $15$, the possible values for $a$ are $2, 4, 6, 8, 10$ and the possible values for $b$ are $2, 4, 6, 8, 10$. \n\nHowever, since the two numbers are not necessarily distinct, we need to consider the cases where $a$ and $b$ are the same. \n\nSo, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. $a = 2$ and $b = 2$: The sum is $2 + 2 = 4$ and the product is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. So, the result is $4 + 4 = 8$.\n2. $a = 2$ and $b = 4$: The sum is $2 + 4 = 6$ and the product is $2 \\times 4 = 8$. So, the result is $6 + 8 = 14$.\n3. $a = 2$ and $b = 6$: The sum is $2 + 6 = 8$ and the product is $2 \\times 6 = 12$. So, the result is $8 + 12 = 20$.\n4. $a = 2$ and $b = 8$: The sum is $2 + 8 = 10$ and the product is $2 \\times 8 = 16$. So, the result is $10 + 16 = 26$.\n5. $a = 2$ and $b = 10$: The sum is $2 + 10 = 12$ and the product is $2 \\times 10 = 20$. So, the result is $12 + 20 = 32$.\n6. $a = 4$ and $b = 4$: The sum is $4 + 4 = 8$ and the product is $4 \\times 4 = 16$. So, the result is $8 + 16 = 24$.\n7. $a = 4$ and $b = 6$: The sum is $4 + 6 = 10$ and the product is $4 \\times 6 = 24$. So, the result is $10 + 24 = 34$.\n8. $a = 4$ and $b = 8$: The sum is $4 + 8 = 12$ and the product is $4 \\times 8 = 32$. So, the result is $12 + 32 = 44$.\n9. $a = 4$ and $b = 10$: The sum is $4 + 10 = 14$ and the product is $4 \\times 10 = 40$. So, the result is $14 + 40 = 54$.\n10. $a = 6$ and $b = 6$: The sum is $6 + 6 = 12$ and the product is $6 \\times 6 = 36$. So, the result is $12 + 36 = 48$.\n11. $a = 6$ and $b = 8$: The sum is $6 + 8 = 14$ and the product is $6 \\times 8 = 48$. So, the result is $14 + 48 = 62$.\n12. $a = 6$ and $b = 10$: The sum is $6 + 10 = 16$ and the product is $6 \\times 10 = 60$. So, the result is $16 + 60 = 76$.\n13. $a = 8$ and $b = 8$: The sum is $8 + 8 = 16$ and the product is $8 \\times 8 = 64$. So, the result is $16 + 64 = 80$.\n14. $a = 8$ and $b = 10$: The sum is"
