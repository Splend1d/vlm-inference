He assigned in writing 25 percent of any future royalties, when and if the screenplay was made into either a movie or a stage play, to his friend, who had subsidized him during his early years as a struggling writer. Shortly after the screenplay was completed, the author was killed in an auto accident. A movie studio then purchased the screenplay from the executors of the author's estate and filmed the movie Quiet Winter, which was a great success. In an action against the executors of the author's estate to recover her percentage of the movie royalties, the friend will most likely\n\nA. lose, because under the circumstances an assignment of future rights is unenforceable.\nB. lose, because the attempted gift of royalties failed for non-delivery.\nC. win, because she was an intended beneficiary.\nD. win, because the assignment of future rights is enforceable.\n"

The fact that the author was killed shortly after the screenplay was completed does not negate the validity of the assignment. The friend had a legal right to receive the assigned royalties, and the executors of the author's estate are obligated to honor this assignment. Therefore, the friend is likely to win the action against the executors to recover her percentage of the movie royalties."
