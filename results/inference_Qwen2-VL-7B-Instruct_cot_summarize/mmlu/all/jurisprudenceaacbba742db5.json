Law as medium' describes law as a body of formal, general rules that control the state and the economy; 'law as institution' inhabits the 'lifeworld' and expresses its shared values and norms in institutional form.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas distinguishes between 'law as medium' and 'law as institution' to highlight different roles and functions of law within society. 'Law as medium' refers to the formal, general rules that control the state and the economy, often seen as a tool for maintaining social order and economic stability. On the other hand, 'law as institution' refers to the way in which law is embedded within the 'lifeworld'\u2014the everyday social life of individuals\u2014expressinging shared values and norms in institutional form. This distinction emphasizes the dual role of law in both structuring society and reflecting and shaping social life."
