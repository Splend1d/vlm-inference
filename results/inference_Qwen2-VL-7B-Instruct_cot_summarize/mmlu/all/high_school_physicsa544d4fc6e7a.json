                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling.\n\nThe constant acceleration equations of kinematics are based on the assumption that the acceleration due to gravity is constant. However, in reality, the acceleration due to gravity can vary slightly with altitude due to the Earth's rotation and the Earth's shape. This variation is very small, but it can lead to a noticeable difference in the predicted and measured velocities over long distances or time.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The ball changes its shape while falling: This is unlikely to cause a significant difference in the velocity of a tennis ball falling a short distance.\n\nC. Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball: Air resistance would typically decrease the acceleration of the ball, not increase it.\n\nD. The acceleration of the balls varies with the velocity: This is not a correct statement. The acceleration due to gravity is constant and does not change with the velocity of the object.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation for the large percent difference between the predicted and measured velocities is that the acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling."
