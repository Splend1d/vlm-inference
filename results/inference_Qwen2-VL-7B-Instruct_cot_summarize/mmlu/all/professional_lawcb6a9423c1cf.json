It is constitutional because Congress can demonstrate that such a subsidy is rationally related to a legitimate public interest.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to levy taxes and spend the proceeds for the \"general welfare\" of the nation. In this case, Congress enacted a statute that taxes the sale of automobiles and appropriates the proceeds for an education fund aimed at educating people about the importance of mass transportation as an alternative to automobiles, which is considered a major source of pollution. This is a legitimate public interest, and Congress can demonstrate that the subsidy to the education fund is rationally related to this public interest. Therefore, the appropriation is constitutional."
