Securing the sustainable development of the state was dependent on societal security as an independent interest that was not secondary or dependent on the other sectors, including the military.\nB. The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security. Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.\nC. Societal security referred to the sustainable development of traditional patterns of military capabilities. Military threats could be subdivided to include the infrastructural strength, the technology, personnel, the economic base and the political base of the military security sector.\nD. Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object. Security was dependent on factors beyond geographically conceived survival: survival of the state was superseded by survival of the nation (ethnic) state.\n"

This shift was influenced by the end of the Cold War, which allowed for a reevaluation of security studies. Buzan and others sought to include non-military factors such as resources, the environment, and other referent points for analysis, thereby broadening the scope of security studies. This approach recognizes that security is not solely dependent on the military but encompasses a wider range of factors that contribute to the overall stability and well-being of a society."
