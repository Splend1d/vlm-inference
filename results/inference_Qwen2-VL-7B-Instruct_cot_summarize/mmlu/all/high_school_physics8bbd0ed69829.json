Since the distance between the balls remains the same, the force will change only if the charges change.\n\nGiven that the mass of one of the balls is doubled, but the charge remains the same, the new force \\( F' \\) between the balls can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ F' = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \\]\n\nSince the charge of each ball remains the same, the product \\( q \\) remains the same. Therefore, the force will remain the same as well.\n\nThus, the new electric force between the balls is:\n\n\\[ F' = 50 \\, \\text{\u03bcNN} \\]\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 50 \u03bcN"
