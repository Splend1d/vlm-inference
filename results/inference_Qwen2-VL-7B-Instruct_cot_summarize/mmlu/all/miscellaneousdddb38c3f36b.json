Asking students to use pencils to measure the length of a desk\n\nThis activity best meets the teacher's goal of introducing students to nonstandard units of measurement. By using pencils, which are not precise or standardized, students will learn about the variability and limitations of nonstandard units. This hands-on experience will help them understand that nonstandard units can be approximate and not universally consistent."
