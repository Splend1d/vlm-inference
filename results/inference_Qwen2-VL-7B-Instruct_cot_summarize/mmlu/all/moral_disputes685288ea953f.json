This involves a counter-argument to a premise.\n\n2. **Comprehend the context and the core of the question**: The core of the question is to identify the response that Lee and George would give to the argument that embryos are not persons because they do not exercise higher mental capacities.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Embryos actually do exercise higher mental capacities.\" This option directly contradicts the premise that embryos do not exhibit higher mental capacities. If Lee and George were to argue this, it would be a direct response to the claim.\n   - **Option B**: \"It doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities.\" This option is a philosophical stance rather than a direct response to the argument. It does not directly address the claim that embryos do not have higher mental capacities.\n   - **Option C**: \"The argument is sound, but its validity fails due to a common logical fallacy.\" This option suggests that the argument is logically sound but flawed due to a fallacy. This does not directly address the claim about higher mental capacities.\n   - **Option D**: \"To have killed a human embryos that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.\" This option introduces a hypothetical scenario about the moral implications of killing embryos, which is not directly addressing the argument about higher mental capacities.\n\n4. **Conclude with a clear answer**: The most direct and relevant response to the argument that embryos are not persons because they do not exercise higher mental capacities would be:\n\n**A. embryos actually do exercise higher mental capacities.**"
