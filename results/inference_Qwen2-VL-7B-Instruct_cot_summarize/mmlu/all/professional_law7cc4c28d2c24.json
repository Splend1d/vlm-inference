The 16-year-old was developmentally disabled and his mannerisms were a magnet for malicious bullies. One day the boy stole his father's licensed handgun and shot one of the bullies dead. The district attorney announced prosecution of the teen as an adult and asked for the death penalty due to aggravating circumstances. The trial court certified the boy over to adult criminal court. The boy was convicted and sentenced to death. An appeal was taken on his behalf all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on the merits. Will the Court affirm the sentence of death?\n\nA. Yes, children aged 14 and older are treated as adults and, as adults, they are subject to the same capital punishment penalty as other adults.\nB. No, a minor under 16 cannot be tried in adult court because the Eighth Amendment clause against cruel and unusual punishment forbids it, and the whole prosecution was unconstitutional.\nC. Yes, when a crime is committed by malice aforethought, the age of the perpetrator doesn't matter because the same criminal intent requires the same punishment.\nD. No, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between an adolescent and an adult.\n"

                    "text": "The Supreme Court's decision in this case would likely hinge on the interpretation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" The Court has previously ruled that the Eighth Amendment applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and that it includes a prohibition on the death penalty for crimes committed by individuals under the age of 18.\n\nGiven this context, the most likely outcome is:\n\nD. No, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between an adolescent and an adult.\n\nThe Supreme Court has established that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment extends to the death penalty for crimes committed by individuals under the age of 18. This is based on the bright-line test, which holds that the death penalty is impermissible for individuals who were under 18 at the time of the crime. This test is grounded in the recognition that adolescence is a distinct stage of development with different cognitive, emotional, and social capacities compared to adulthood. Therefore, the Court is likely to affirm that the death penalty for the 16-year-old is unconstitutional under the age of 18."
