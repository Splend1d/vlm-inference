The program initializes `sum` to `numList[1]`, which is `0` in this case.\n2. The `FOR EACH` loop iterates through each value in `numList` and adds it to `sum`.\n3. The initial value of `sum` is `0`, and the first iteration adds `0` to `sum`, making `sum` `0`.\n4. The second iteration adds `1` to `sum`, making `sum` `1`.\n5. The third iteration adds `4` to `sum`, making `sum` `5`.\n6. The fourth iteration adds `5` to `sum`, making `sum` `10`.\n\nThe program displays `10`, which is the correct sum of the numbers in the list `[0, 1, 4, 5]`.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The conclusion is incorrect; the program does not display the correct value for the test case [0, 1, 4, 5]."
