Involuntary manslaughter.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter is a crime that occurs when a person's death is caused by the reckless or negligent actions of another person, without any intent to cause death. In this case, the defendant was speeding, which is a reckless act, and this contributed to the victim's death. While the defendant did not have the intent to kill, the reckless behavior leading to the death is sufficient to charge the defendant with involuntary manslaughter."
