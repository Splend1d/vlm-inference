There are 16 1s.\n\nThe total number of bits in the string is 32. To find the percentage of occupied tracks, we divide the number of 1s by the total number of bits and multiply by 100:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of occupied tracks} = \\left( \\frac{16}{32} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.5 \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the percentage to the nearest percent, and 50% is already the nearest whole number, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 25%"
