By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nWhat traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?\n\nA. That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies\nB. That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation\nC.

It highlights that in Europe, early cannons were found to be useful in sieges and were thus developed and improved upon. In contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, faced threats from highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons were not effective. Instead, China focused on improving its horse archer units to combat these threats.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies\n- The passage does not make a general comparison of China's technological adeptness with other Afro-Eurasian societies. It focuses specifically on the context of gunpowder weaponry in China and Europe.\n\nB. That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation\n- The passage does not mention anything about China's form of government or its impact on innovation. It only discusses the practical utility of gunpowder weapons in different contexts.\n\nC. That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts\n- The passage does not discuss any religious fundamentalism or its impact on modernization efforts in China. It is focused on the practical utility of gunpowder weapons.\n\nD. That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change\n- The passage suggests that China's focus on horse archers instead of gunpowder weapons was due to the nature of their threats ( steppe nomads. This implies that China's choice was not due to a lack of technological innovation but rather due to the practical utility of their chosen weapons in their specific context.\n\nGiven this analysis, the passage challenges the traditional view that China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change.\n\nFinal answer: D. That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change"
