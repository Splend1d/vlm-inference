Marine birds absorb water from the environment through specialized salt-exchange glands and produce large volumes of dilute urine in the kidneys.\n\nThis strategy allows marine birds to maintain their internal osmolarity at a level that is hypoosmotic to seawater. By absorbing water and excretinging salts, they can effectively dilute their body fluids and maintain a stable internal environment."
