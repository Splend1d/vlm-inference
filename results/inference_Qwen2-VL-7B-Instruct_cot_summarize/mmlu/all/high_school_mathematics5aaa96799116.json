We can set up the equation:\n\n$(a+bi)(5+3i) = 32-8i$\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n$(5a - 3b + ( (5b+3a)i = 32-8i$\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts on both sides, we get:\n\n$5a - 3b = 32$ and $5a + 3a = -8$\n\nSolving these two equations, we find that $a = 4$ and $b = -4$. \n\nSo, Ramanujan picked the number $\\boxed{4-4i}$."
