This approach is reflected in option B, which describes the security paradigm of the US-led strategy as undertaking short-term measures, many of which are drawn from research of the peace studies community. These measures focus on peace-keeping, peace-making, and structural change for preventing further conflict.\n\nWhile this approach has been an important response to the immediate aftermath of the attacks, it may not be an adequate response to the underlying causes of the problems. Option C describes this reversion to \"liddism\"; keeping the lid on a potentially fractured international system, without redress to the critical underlying cause of the problems. This approach may not address the root causes of terrorism and may not be sustainable in the long term.\n\nOption A describes the development of multi-level analysis to aid the understanding of disempowerment and to promote peace research involvement by NGOs, policy-makers, and the academic community. While this approach is important, it may not be the dominant approach in security studies.\n\nOption D describes the dominant approach to security studies as a US-led initiative which recognizes the need to undertake responsibility for inter-governmental cooperation, particularly for the commitment towards ethical intervention and for securing peaceful transformations alongside demilitarization of the international community.
