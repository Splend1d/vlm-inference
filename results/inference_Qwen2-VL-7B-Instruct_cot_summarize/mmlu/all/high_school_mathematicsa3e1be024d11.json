There are 8 vertices in total, and each vertex is labeled with a product of three numbers. \n\nThe sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to $1001$, so we have the equation:\n\n$a \\cdot b \\cdot c + a \\cdot b \\cdot d + a \\cdot b \\cdot e + a \\cdot b \\cdot f + a \\cdot c \\cdot d + a \\cdot c \\cdot e + a \\cdot c \\cdot f + a \\cdot d \\cdot e + a \\cdot d \\cdot f + a \\cdot e \\cdot f + b \\cdot c \\cdot d + b \\cdot c \\cdot e + b \\cdot c \\cdot f + b \\cdot d \\cdot e + b \\cdot d \\cdot f + b \\cdot e \\cdot f + c \\cdot d \\cdot e + c \\cdot d \\cdot f + c \\cdot e \\cdot f + d \\cdot e \\cdot f = 1001$\n\nThis equation can be simplified to:\n\n$(a + b + c + d + e + f) \\cdot ( = 1001$\n\nwhere $n$ is the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to each vertex. \n\nSince each face of the cube is adjacent to three other faces, each face appears in the sum $n$ three times. Therefore, the sum of the numbers on the faces is $3(a + b + c + d + e + f)$.\n\nWe know that $n = 1001$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\n$3(a + b + c + d + e + f) = 1001$\n\nSolving for $a + b + c + d + e + f$, we get:\n\n$a + b + c + d + e + f = \\frac{1001}{3} = 333.666...$\n\nSince the sum of the numbers on the faces must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is $334$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the numbers written on the faces is $\\boxed{334}$."
