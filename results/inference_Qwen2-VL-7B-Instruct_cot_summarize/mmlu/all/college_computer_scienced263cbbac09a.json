The jobs have service times of 25, 15, 5, 3, and 2 time units. We will evaluate the average completion time for each of the given options.\n\n### Option A: Shortest Job First ( (SJF)\n\n1. Sort the jobs by their service times in ascending order:\n   - 2, 3, 5, 15, 25\n\n2. Schedule the jobs in this order:\n   - Job 2 ( (2 time units)\n   - Job 3 ( (3 time units)\n   - Job 5 ( (5 time units)\n   - Job 15 ( (15 time units)\n   - Job 25 ( (25 time units)\n\n3. Calculate the completion times:\n   - Job 2: 2 time units\n   - Job 3: 2 + 3 = 5 time time units\n   - Job 5: 5 + 5 = 10 time time units\n   - Job 15: 10 + 15 = 252 time units\n   - Job 25: 25 + 25 = 502 time units\n\n4. Calculate the average completion time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average completion time} = \\frac{2 + 5 + 10 + 25 + 50}{5} = \\frac{92}{5}\n   \\]\n\n### Option B: First-Come, First-Served ( (FCFS)\n\n1. Schedule the jobs in the order they are available:\n   - Job 25 ( (25 time units)\n   - Job 15 ( (15 time units)\n   - Job 5  ( (5 time units)\n   - Job 3  ( (3 time units)\n   - Job 2  ( (2 time units)\n\n2. Calculate the completion times:\n   - Job 25: 25 time units\n   - Job 15: 25 + 15 = 40 time units\n   - Job 5 : 40 + 5 = 45 time units\n   - Job 3 : 45 + 3 = 48 time units\n   - Job 2 : 48 + 2 = 50 time units\n\n3. Calculate the average completion time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average completion time} = \\frac{25 + 40 + 45 + 48 + 50}{5} = \\frac{218}{5}\n   \\]\n\n### Option C: Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)\n\n1. Sort the jobs by their remaining service times in ascending order:\n   - Job 2 ( (2 time units)\n   - Job 3  (3 time units)\n   - Job 5  (5 time units)\n   - Job 15 ( (15 time units)\n   - Job 25 ( (25 time units)\n\n2. Schedule the jobs in this order:\n   - Job 2: 2 time units\n   - Job 3: 2 + 3 = 5 time units\n   - Job 5: 5 + 5 = 10 time units\n   - Job 15: 10 + 15 = 25 time units\n   - Job 25: 25 + 25 = 50 time units\n\n3. Calculate the completion times:\n   - Job 2: 2 time units\n   - Job 3: 2 + 3 = 5 time units\n   - Job 5: 5 + 5 = 10 time units\n   - Job 15: 10 + 15 = 25 time units\n   - Job 25: 25 + 25 = 50 time units\n\n4. Calculate the average completion time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average completion time} = \\frac{2 + 5 + 10 + 25 + 50}{5} = \\frac{92}{5}\n   \\]\n\n### Option D: Round Robin ( (RR) with a time quantum of 1\n\n1. Schedule the jobs in a a round robin manner with a time quantum of 1:\n   - Job 2: 2 time units\n   - Job 3: 3 time units\n   - Job 5: 5 time units\n   - Job 15: 12 time units\n   - Job 25: 25 time units\n\n2. Calculate the completion times:\n   - Job 2: "
