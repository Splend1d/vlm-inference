No other kinds of posters or literature are subject to this prohibition, nor are any other types of commercial establishments in the state subject to similar prohibitions. Is this law constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it treats barbershops differently from other commercial establishments.\nB. No, because it imposes a restriction on the content or subject matter of speech in the absence of any evidence that such a restriction is necessary to serve a compelling state interest.\nC. Yes, because it leaves political candidates free to communicate their campaign messages to voters by other means.\nD. Yes, because the operation of a licensed barbershop is a privilege and therefore is subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by the state.\n"

The law does not prohibit the display of posters or distribution of literature in general, only it it only specifically targets posters and literature in support of current candidates for public office. This allows political candidates to communicate their campaign messages through other means, such as personal appearances, social media, and other forms of advertising."
