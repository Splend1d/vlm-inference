ADF is a single equation approach to unit root testing while PP is a systems approach\nB. PP tests reverse the DF null and alternative hypotheses so that there is stationarity under the null hypothesis of the PP test\nC. The PP test incorporates an automatic correction for autocorrelated residuals in the test regression\nD. PP tests have good power in small samples whereas DF tests do not.\n"

The Phillips-Perron (PP) test incorporates an automatic correction for autocorrelated residuals in the test regression.\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller (DF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests are both used to test for the presence of a unit root in a time time series, which is a key step in determining whether a time time series is stationary or non-stationary. The main difference between the two tests lies in how they handle autocorrelation in the data.\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller test assumes that the residuals from the regression are white noise, which means they are uncorrelated and have a constant variance. However, in many real-world datasets, the residuals may exhibit autocorrelation, which can lead to incorrect conclusions about the presence of a unit root.\n\nThe Phillips-Perron test addresses this issue by incorporating an automatic correction for autocorrelation in the test regression. This correction allows the PP test to be more robust to the presence of autocorrelated residuals, making it a more reliable test for detecting unit roots in many cases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
