After approving the license to the utility company, the city council then passed a measure by which the utility company was required to insert in its monthly billing statements a letter from a private consumer group criticizing the high cost of electrical service. The cost of printing and mailing the monthly letter was paid entirely by the consumer group. Nonetheless, the utility company vehemently objected to having such a critical letter enclosed in their monthly billing statements. However, the city council warned the utility company that unless it complied with the directive, the city would revoke its license for electrical service. The utility company filed suit in federal court seeking a hearing prior to its license being revoked by the city council. Which of the following constitutional provisions would provide the utility company with the strongest grounds with which to challenge the city council measure?\n\nA. The due process clause.\nB. The equal protection clause.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\nD. The commerce clause.\n"

This is because the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no person shall be \"deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" In this case, the utility company is being deprived of its property ( (its license to provide electrical service) without due process of law, as it is being revoked without a fair hearing or opportunity to be heard. The due process clause would provide the utility company with the strongest grounds to challenge the city council measure."
