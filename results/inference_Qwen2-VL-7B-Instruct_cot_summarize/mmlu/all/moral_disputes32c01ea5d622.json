The ontological argument - This argument attempts to prove the existence of God by reasoning about the nature of existence. It does not directly address the moral standing of animals or any criterion for full moral standing.\n\nB. The argument from cosmology - This argument considers the structure and evolution of the universe to infer the existence of a designer or a purpose behind the universe. It also does not directly address the moral standing of animals or any criterion for full moral standing.\n\nC. The argument from marginal cases - This argument suggests that if we grant moral standing to certain beings that are considered marginal ( (e.e., animals), we should also grant it to other beings that are even more marginal. This argument poses a challenge to any criterion that excludes animals from full moral standing because it implies that if we include animals, we should also include other beings that are even more marginal.\n\nD. None of the above - This option is not supported by the analysis of the arguments.\n\nGiven this analysis, the argument from marginal cases (C) poses a formidable challenge to any proposed criterion of full moral standing that excludes animals.\n\nFinal answer: C. the argument from marginal cases"
