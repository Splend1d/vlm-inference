Upon approaching the car, the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol and immediately asked whether the driver had been drinking. The driver admitted having had several alcoholic drinks that evening. The driver, charged with driving while intoxicated, moved to suppress the officer's testimony regarding the driver's statement about his drinking. The driver argued that the officer had elicited the statement without providing the requisite Miranda warnings. The prosecutor has responded that the statement The prosecutor has responded that the statement should be allowed in the prosecution's case-in- chief or, at a minimum, should be allowed as impeachment in the event the driver testifies and denies drinking. How should the court rule regarding the driver's statement admitting his drinking?\n\nA. The statement should be allowed, because although the driver was in custody, the officer's spontaneous utterance upon smelling alcohol did not rise to the level of interrogation.\nB. The statement should be allowed, because the driver was not in custody for Miranda purposes when the admission was made.\nC. The statement should be suppressed both in the prosecution's case-in-chief and as impeachment evidence, even if the driver testifies.\nD. The statement should be suppressed in the prosecution's case-in-chief, but it may be prosecution's case-in-chief, but it may be used as impeachment evidence if the driver testifies.\n"

However, the Supreme Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona established that individuals in custody must be informed of their rights before any questioning can occur. The driver was not in custody at the time of the statement, but the officer's questioning about drinking after noticing the odor of alcohol could be considered an interrogation.\n\n2. **Spontaneous Utterance**: The officer's statement about the odor of alcohol does not rise to the level of interrogation. However, the driver's admission of drinking was made in response to the officer's question about drinking, which is a form of interrogation.\n\n3. **Miranda Violation**: The driver's statement was made after the officer's spontaneous utterance about the odor of alcohol, which could be considered an interrogation. Since the driver was not in custody at the time of the statement, the Miranda warnings were not required. However, the statement was made in response to the officer's question, which could be considered an interrogation.\n\n4. **Suppression of Statement**: Given that the statement was made in response to an interrogation and the driver was not in custody, the statement should be suppressed. The driver's statement should not be allowed in the prosecution's case-in-chief or as impeachment evidence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The statement should be suppressed both in the prosecution's case-in-chief and as impeachment evidence, even if the driver testifies."
