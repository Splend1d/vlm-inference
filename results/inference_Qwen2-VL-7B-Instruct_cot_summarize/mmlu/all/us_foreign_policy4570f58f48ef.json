The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy\n\nDuring World War I, the United States emerged as a major economic power due to its role as a creditor country and financial center. The war spending of European nations, particularly Germany, created a significant demand for US goods and services, which boosted the US economy. Additionally, the US provided financial assistance to European nations, further strengthening its economic position. This economic growth and the US's role in financing the war contributed to the shift in economic power from Europe to the United States."
