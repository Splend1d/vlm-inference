                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Nearly all of the enzyme molecules are interacting with acetaldehyde molecules.\n\nAt the maximal rate of reaction, the enzyme is fully saturated with acetaldehyde molecules. This means that almost all of the enzyme molecules are bound to acetaldehyde, and the reaction rate is limited by the availability of enzyme molecules rather than the concentration of acetaldehyde. This is known as the Michaelis-Menten saturation curve, where the reaction rate increases with increasing substrate concentration until it reaches a maximum (Vmax), after which further increases in substrate concentration do not increase the reaction rate.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n\nB. The activation energy of the reaction decreases.\n- Activation energy is a constant for a given reaction and does not change with the concentration of the substrate.\n\nC. The change in free energy of the reaction decreases.\n- The free energy change (\u0394G is a thermodynamic constant for a given reaction and does not change with the concentration of the substrate.\n\nD. The enzyme is no longer specific for acetaldehyde.\n- The enzyme is still specific for acetaldehyde, even at the maximal rate of reaction. The specificity of the enzyme for its substrate does not change with the concentration of the substrate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
