The key factors are the initial velocity of the cannonball (v0, the angle of launch \u03b8, and the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial velocity of the cannonball (v0 = 50 m/s\n- Horizontal speed of the truck (v_truck = 5 m/s\n- The goal is to maximize the horizontal distance traveled by the ball before it hits the ground.\n\nThe horizontal distance (x_max can be expressed as:\n\\[ x_{max} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity of the cannonball\n- \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of launch\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity ( approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\nThe horizontal component of the velocity is:\n\\[ v_x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) + v_{truck} \\]\n\nThe vertical component of the velocity is:\n\\[ v_y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nThe time of flight (t can be calculated using the vertical motion:\n\\[ t = \\frac{2v_y}{g} \\]\n\nThe horizontal distance traveled is:\n\\[ x = v_x \\cdot t \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( v_x \\) and \\( v_y \\) into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = ( (v_0 \\cos(\\theta) + v_{truck}) \\cdot \\frac{2v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\]\n\nTo maximize \\( x \\), we need to maximize \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\). The maximum value of \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) is 1, which occurs when \\( 2\\theta = 90\u00b0 \\) or \\( \\theta = 45\u00b0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the operator should point the cannon at an angle of 45\u00b0 from the horizontal to launch the ball as far as possible before it hits the ground.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 45\u00b0"
