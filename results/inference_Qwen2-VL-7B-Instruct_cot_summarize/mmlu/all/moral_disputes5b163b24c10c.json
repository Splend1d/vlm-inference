It requires comprehension and critical thinking.\n\n2. **Comprehend the context and the core of the question**: The article is titled \"Will Cloning Harm People?\" and the options suggest different philosophical approaches to evaluating cloning.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **A. to use consequentialist arguments to show that cloning is immoral**: This option suggests that Pence uses consequentialist arguments to argue against cloning. Consequentialism evaluates actions based on their outcomes.\n   - **B. to object to consequentialist arguments against cloning**: This option suggests that Pence is responding to or opposing arguments that use consequentialist reasoning to argue against cloning.\n   - **C. to use Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is immoral**: This option suggests that Pence uses Kant's humanity formulation, which is a moral principle that emphasizes the inherent dignity and worth of all human beings, to argue against cloning.\n   - **D. to use Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is morally acceptable**: This option suggests that Pence uses Kant's humanity formulation to argue that cloning is morally acceptable.\n\nGiven the title and the context, it seems Pence is more likely to be arguing against cloning rather than for it. Therefore, the most fitting option is:\n\n**B. to object to consequentialist arguments against cloning**\n\nThis option alignss with the title and suggests that Pence is responding to arguments that argue cloning is immoral based on its consequences."
