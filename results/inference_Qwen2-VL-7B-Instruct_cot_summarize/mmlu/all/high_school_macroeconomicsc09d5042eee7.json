It is composed of the Board of Governors, which is the central body of the Fed, and 12 Federal Reserve Banks, which are regional banks that implement monetary policy and provide banking services to commercial banks.\n\nThe Board of Governors consists of seven members who are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. Members of the Board of Governors serve 14-year terms, with each member serving a term of seven years. This means that every two years, one-third of the Board of Governors' members will be up for reappointment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 14 7"
