However, this is not necessarily the case. The buyer's mistake in typing the price does not necessarily mean that there was no agreement on the price term. The owner accepted the offer, which implies an agreement on the price.\n\n**Option B: There is no enforceable contract, because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption.**\n- This option suggestssthat there is no enforceable contract because of a mutual mistake regarding the basic assumption of the price. However, the mistake here is not mutual; the buyer made the mistake, and the owner accepted the offer. The mistake does not negate the formation of a contract.\n\n**Option C: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended.**\n- This option suggeststhat there is a contract formed at the price the buyer intended, which is $2,000 per acre. However, the acceptance of the offer by the owner does not necessarily mean that the contract was formed at the buyer's intended price. The offer and acceptance must be considered together to determine the price agreed upon.\n\n**Option D: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.**\n- This option suggeststhat there is a contract formed at the price the buyer offered, which is $2,200 per acre. This option is the most plausible given the standard principles of contract law. The acceptance of the offer by the owner implies that the parties agreed on the price offered, regardless of the buyer's true intention.\n\nTherefore, the most probable legal consequence of the correspondence between the parties is:\n\n**D. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.**"
