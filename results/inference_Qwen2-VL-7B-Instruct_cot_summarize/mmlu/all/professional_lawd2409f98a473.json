Maybe she'll go home where she belongs.\" Is the plaintiff's proposed testimony admissible?\n\nA. No, because the janitor's statement is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, because the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement is a statement of his then-existing state of mind.\nD.

Yes, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are statements concerning a matter within the scope of their employment.\n\nIn the context of a sex discrimination lawsuit, the plaintiff's proposed testimony is admissible if it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule. The statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are considered within the scope of their employment, which means they are relevant to the plaintiff's claim of sex discrimination. Therefore, these statements are admissible as they are within the scope of their employment and are relevant to the case."
