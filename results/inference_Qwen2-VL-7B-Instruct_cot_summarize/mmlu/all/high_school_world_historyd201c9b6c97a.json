Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the outcomes listed below followed the delivery of Lin Zexu's letter?\n\nA. Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West\nB. A successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories\nC. Violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority\nD. The expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory\n"

                    "text": "To determine which outcome followed the delivery of Lin Zexu's letter, we need to analyze the context and the content of the letter itself. Lin Zexu, a Chinese trade commissioner, wrote a letter to Queen Victoria in 1839, expressing concerns about the opium trade and its negative impacts on China. The letter argues that the foreigners' actions is not motivated by destructive intentions but rather by their greed for profit, which leads them to disregard the harm they cause to China.\n\nGiven this context, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West**: This outcome is not directly related to the letter's content. The letter focuses on the moral and ethical implications of the opium trade, not on military defeats or trade agreements.\n\nB. **A successful ban of the the opium trade in all Chinese territories**: This outcome is plausible. Lin Zexu's letter was part of a broader effort to address the opium trade issue. The letter likely contributed to the eventual ban of the opium trade in China, which was a significant outcome of the broader anti-opium campaign.\n\nC. **Violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority**: This outcome is not directly related to the letter's content. The letter does not mention any specific uprisings or the involvement of the pro-British Muslim minority.\n\nD. **The expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory**: This This outcome is not directly related to the letter's content. The letter does not mention any specific actions against foreigners or the expulsion of foreigners from Chinese territory.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible outcome that followed the delivery of Lin Zexu's letter is:\n\n**B. A successful ban of of the opium trade in all Chinese territories**."
