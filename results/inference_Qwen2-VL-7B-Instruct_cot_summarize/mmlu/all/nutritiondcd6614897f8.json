Low income so decreased ability to purchase nutrient-rich foods.\n\nWhile low income can indeed contribute to a decreased ability to purchase nutrient-rich foods, it is not the primary reason for increased risk of vitamin or mineral deficiencies among older people in high income countries. The other options listed ( decreased mobility and little time spent outdoors in the sunshine, decreased intrinsic factor in the stomach, and high nutrient requirements for tissue turnover\u2014are more directly related to the physiological changes that occur with aging and can lead to nutrient deficiencies."
