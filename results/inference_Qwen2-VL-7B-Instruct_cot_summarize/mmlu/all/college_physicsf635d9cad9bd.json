                    "text": "The observed redshift in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 indicates that the quasar is moving away from Earth at a significant velocity. The redshift is a result of the Doppler effect, which occurs when the source of light is moving relative to the observer. In this case, the redshift is so large that the wavelengths of the hydrogen lines are three times as long as those observed in the laboratory on Earth.\n\nThe relationship between the observed wavelength (\\(\\lambda_o\\)) and the emitted wavelength (\\(\\lambda_e\\)) due to the Doppler effect is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\lambda_o}{\\lambda_e} = 1 + \\frac{v}{c} \\]\n\nwhere \\(v\\) is the relative velocity of the source ( (3C9) and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the observed wavelength is three times the emitted wavelength (\\(\\lambda_o = 3\\lambda_e\\)), we can substitute this into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3\\lambda_e}{\\lambda_e} = 1 + \\frac{v}{c} \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n\\[ 3 = 1 + \\frac{v}{c} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ v = 2c \\]\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar 3C9 is \\(2c\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c"
