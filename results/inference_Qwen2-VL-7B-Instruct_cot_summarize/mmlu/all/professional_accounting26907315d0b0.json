Neither Rose nor Jave.\n\nUnder the equity method of accounting, an investor must have significant influence over the investee to account for the investment using the equity method. Significant influence is typically defined as having the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies of the investee. Since Goll Co. does not have a 25% or greater interest in either Rose Co. or Jave Co., it does not have significant influence over either company. Therefore, Goll Co. should account for neither of these investments using the equity method."
