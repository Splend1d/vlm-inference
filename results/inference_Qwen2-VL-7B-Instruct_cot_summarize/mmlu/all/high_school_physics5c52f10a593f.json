This means that as the temperature increases, the circumference also increases.\n   - The relationship between the circumference and temperature can be expressed as \\( C = kT \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Cubing of Circumference ( \\( C^3 \\) and Temperature:**\n   - If we cube the circumference, we get \\( C^3 = ( (kT)^3 = k^3 t^3 \\).\n   - This shows that \\( C^3 \\) is directly proportional to \\( T^3 \\).\n\n3. **Nature of the Relationship:**\n   - Since \\( C^3 \\) is directly proportional to \\( T^3 \\), the relationship between \\( C^3 \\) and \\( T \\) is cubic.\n   - Therefore, the student should expect a cubic relationship between \\( C^3 \\) and \\( T \\).\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nA. a cubic relationship between \\( C^3 \\) and \\( T \\)"
