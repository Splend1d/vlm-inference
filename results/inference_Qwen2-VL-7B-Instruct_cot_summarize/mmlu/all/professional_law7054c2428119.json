The parties agreed that the employment would be on an at-will basis. At the end of her first week of work, the employee was given a booklet entitled \"Employment Manual,\" with instructions to read the book in its entirety by the end of the following week. That evening, the employee began reading the manual. The first few pages described the history of the company and provided a personal biography of its president. On page 20, the manual stated that the company treats its employees \"as family\" and that employees will be discharged \"only with good cause. \" The employee finished reading the manual as requested. The employee interpreted the statement on page 20 as insuring continued employment unless good cause existed for termination. Over the next two months, the employee continually complained to her supervisor that the lighting in the accounting department was insufficient. Finally the supervisor, fed up with the complaints, fired the employee. The employee then sued the company, seeking to recover on grounds of promissory estoppel. Which of the following facts, if true and provable, would be most helpful for the employee's cause of action?\n\nA. At the time when the company hired the employee, the company subjectively intended that the employee be given job security.\nB. The employee interpreted the clause in the manual stating that company employees would be treated \"as family\" to mean that she would have job security and could only be fired for good cause.\nC. Just prior to receiving the manual, the employee seriously considered quitting, but continued to work for the company in reliance on the provisions contained on page 20 of the manual.\nD. The employee's complaints regarding the insufficient lighting were factually true and justifIable.\n"

To establish a claim, the employee must demonstrate that she relied on the promise in the manual and that her reliance was reasonable.\n\nLet's analyze each option to determine which fact would be most helpful for the employee's cause of action:\n\nA. At the time when the company hired the employee, the company subjectively intended that the employee be given job security.\n- This fact is about the company's subjective intent at the time of hiring, but it does not directly address the employee's reliance on the promise in the employment manual.\n\nB. The employee interpreted the clause in the manual stating that company employees would be treated \"as family\" to mean that she would have job security and could only be fired for good cause.\n- This fact directly addresses the employee's reliance on the promise in the manual. It shows that the employee reasonably interpreted the statement as providing job security and that she relied on this interpretation.\n\nC. Just prior to receiving the manual, the employee seriously considered quitting, but continued to work for the company in reliance on the provisions contained on page 20 of the manual.\n- This fact also shows reliance, but it is more about the employee's decision to stay with the company rather than the specific promise in the manual.\n\nD. The employee's complaints regarding the insufficient lighting were factually true and justifiable.\n- This fact is about the truthfulness and justification of the complaints, but it does not directly address the employee's reliance on the promise in the employment manual.\n\nGiven the analysis, the fact that would be most helpful for the employee's cause of action is:\n\nB. The employee interpreted the clause in the manual stating that company employees would be treated \"as family\" to mean that she would have job security and could only be fired for good cause.\n\nThis fact directly demonstrates that the employee reasonably relied on the promise in the employment manual, which is the core requirement for establishing a claim of promissory estoppel."
