During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The appellate court should\n\nA. affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.\nB. affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.\nC. reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.\nD. reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.\n"

                    "text": "The appellate court should:\n\nB. affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Conviction Affirmation**: The defendant was convicted by a jury, which is the standard procedure for a felony case. The defendant's desire for a non-jury trial was not granted, and the court proceeded with a jury trial. The defendant's appeal on this point is based on the right to a non-jury trial, which is not a constitutional right in all jurisdictions, but rather a matter of state law. If the state law allows for a jury trial in felony cases, the defendant's appeal on this point would likely fail. Therefore, the conviction should be affirmed.\n\n2. **Reimbursement Order Reversal**: The defendant was ordered to reimburse the state for the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant's appeal on this point is based on the right to represent himself, which was denied by the court. However, the court's decision to appoint an attorney was based on the defendant's lack of previous legal experience and his expressed distrust of lawyers. The court's decision to appoint an attorney was reasonable under the circumstances, and the defendant's appeal on this point would likely fail. Therefore, the reimbursement order should not be reversed.\n\nIn summary, the appellate court should affirm the conviction because the defendant was convicted by a jury, which is the standard procedure for a felony case. The court's decision to appoint an attorney was reasonable under the circumstances, and the defendant's appeal on this point would likely fail. Therefore, the court should not reverse the reimbursement order."
