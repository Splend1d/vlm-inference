Rent was payable on the first day of each month, and the landlord retained the right to terminate the lease if the tenant defaulted. The lease term ended 18 months ago. However, the tenant has stayed in possession of the building and has continued to pay the rent on time. The landlord has continued to accept the rent. The fair rental value of the building is now substantially more than what the tenant has been paying, and the landlord recently found a third party who will pay the higher rent. When the tenant paid the rent six weeks ago, the landlord accepted paid the rent six weeks ago, the landlord accepted the rent but told the tenant in writing that she had to vacate at the end of the month. The tenant, who is still in possession of the building, has informed the landlord that she does not want to move and is willing to pay the current fair rental value. The landlord has asked his lawyer for advice regarding the right to possession. Who should the lawyer say is entitled to possession?\n\nA. The landlord, because he gave proper notice to terminate the tenancy.\nB. The landlord, because he retained the right to reenter.\nC. The tenant, because she has stated that she is willing to pay the current fair rental value.\nD. The tenant, because the landlord has not shown good cause to terminate the tenancy.\n"

                    "text": "The lawyer should say that the tenant is entitled to possession. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Termination Notice**: The landlord gave proper notice to terminate the tenancy, which means the landlord has the right to reclaim possession of the property at the end of the notice period. However, this notice period has already expired, and the landlord has not yet taken action to reclaim possession.\n\n2. **Continued Payment**: The tenant has continued to pay rent on time, and the landlord has accepted these payments. This indicates that the landlord has not taken any action to terminate the tenancy based on the tenant's default.\n\n3. **Fair Rental Value**: The fair rental value of the building is now substantially more than what the tenant has been paying. This does not affect the landlord's right to reclaim possession based on the notice given, but it does indicate that the landlord may have a financial incentive to terminate the tenancy.\n\n4. **Third Party**: The landlord found a third party who will pay the higher rent. This does not affect the tenant's right to possession based on the notice given, but it does indicate that the landlord may have a financial incentive to terminate the tenancy.\n\n5. **Tenant's Position**: The tenant has informed the landlord that she does not want to move and is willing to pay the current fair rental value. This indicates that the tenant has no intention to vacate the property and is willing to continue paying rent.\n\nGiven these points, the lawyer should advise that the tenant is entitled to possession because the landlord has not shown good cause to terminate the tenancy and the tenant has no intention to vacate. The landlord's right to reclaim possession based on the notice given has already expired, and the landlord has not taken any action to terminate the tenancy."
