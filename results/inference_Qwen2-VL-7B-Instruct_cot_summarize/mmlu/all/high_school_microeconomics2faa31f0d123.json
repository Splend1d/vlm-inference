The total revenue is the price per pool multiplied by the number of pools cleaned per day, and the total cost is the sum of the total variable cost (Tvc) and the total fixed cost ( tfc).\n\nGiven:\n- Price per pool = $10\n- Number of pools cleaned per day = 9\n- Total variable cost ( tvc = $80\n- Total fixed cost = $20\n\nFirst, calculate the total revenue:\n\\[ TR = \\text{Price per pool} \\times \\text{Number of pools cleaned per day} = \\$10 \\times 9 = \\$90 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the total cost:\n\\[ TC = \\text{Total variable cost} + \\text{Total fixed cost} = \\$80 + \\$20 = \\$100 \\]\n\nNow, compare the total revenue with the total cost:\n\\[ TR = \\$90 \\]\n\\[ TC = \\$100 \\]\n\nSince the total revenue is less than the total cost, Jason is incurring economic losses. The economic loss is the difference between the total cost and the total revenue:\n\\[ \\text{Economic Loss} = TC - TR = \\$100 - \\$90 = \\$10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $10. The correct answer is:\n\nB. Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $10."
