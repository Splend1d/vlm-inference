Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 10 will not create a contract.\n\nExplanation:\n- The offer was made on April 1 and stated it would not be revocable for ten days. Therefore, the offer was still open until April 10.\n- Fred's acceptance on April 10 would be within the ten-day period, so it would create a contract.\n\nB. Fred's acceptance on April 5 will not create a contract if James dies on April 4.\n\nExplanation:\n- If James dies before April 5, the offer would be considered revoked because it would no longer be open for acceptance.\n\nC. Fred stating on April 5, \"I accept your offer, but will pay only $90,000\" creates a contract.\n\nExplanation:\n- Acceptance must be unconditional. Fred's counter-offer would not be considered an acceptance but rather a new offer, which would not create a contract.\n\nD. Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 15 will not create a contract.\n\nExplanation:\n- The offer was open until April 10. Acceptance on April 15 would be after the ten-day period, so it would not create a contract."
