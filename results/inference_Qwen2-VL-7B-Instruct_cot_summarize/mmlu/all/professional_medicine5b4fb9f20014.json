A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?\n\nA. Chance of a type I error\nB. Chance of a type II error\nC.

Chance of a type II error.\n\nIn a statistical study, a type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it should be ( (i.e., a false negative). The power of a study is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. It is calculated as 1 - \u03b2, where \u03b2 is the probability of a type II error.\n\nThe power of a study is influenced by several factors, including sample size, effect size, alpha level, and variability. In this case, the sample size is reduced from 1000 to 500 patients. A smaller sample size generally make it more difficult to detect a true effect, which would increase the chance of a type II error ( because the study would be less likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome of reducing the sample size from 1000 to 500 patients would be an increase in the chance of a type II error."
