Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The passage from Edward Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" discusses the decline of the Roman Empire, attributing it to several factors including the decline of the military, the corruption of the discipline of the victorious legions, and the influx of Barbarians. These factors can be applied to other classical empires that faced similar challenges.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Tang and Ottoman:\n- The Tang Dynasty in China and the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East both faced significant external pressures and internal corruption. The Tang Dynasty was weakened by internal rebellions and external invasions, while the Ottoman Empire faced challenges from the rise of European powers and internal conflicts.\n\nB. Ming and Aztec:\n- The Ming Dynasty in China and the Aztec Empire in Mmerica both faced significant external pressures and internal corruption. The Ming Dynasty was weakened by internal rebellions and external invasions, while the Aztec Empire was conquered by the Spanish and faced internal conflicts.\n\nC. Han and Gupta:\n- The Han Dynasty in China and the Gupta Empire in India both faced significant external pressures and internal corruption. The Han Dynasty was weakened by internal rebellions and external invasions, while the Gupta Empire faced challenges from external invasions and internal conflicts.\n\nD. Qin and Etruscan:\n- The Qin Dynasty in China and the Etruscan Empire in Italy both faced significant external pressures and internal corruption. The Qin Dynasty was weakened by internal rebellions and external invasions, while the Etruscan Empire faced challenges from external invasions and internal conflicts.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nC. Han and Gupta\n\nBoth the Han Dynasty and the Gupta Empire faced similar challenges of internal corruption and external invasions, which led to their decline."
