                    "text": "The excerpt describes the establishment of new provisions and regulations for improving revenue and extending commerce between Great Britain and its American colonies, which were recently enlarged by the peace treaty. The goal is to raise revenue in the American colonies to cover the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing them. This is indicative of the British government's efforts to assert control over its colonies and ensure financial stability.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Antitrust reforms of the Progressive Era: These reforms were aimed at breaking up monopolies and promoting fair competition, which is not relevant to the goal of raising revenue and asserting control over colonies.\n\nB. Free trade policies of the 1970s: These policies were about reducing trade barriers and promoting free trade, which is not directly related to the goal of raising revenue in the colonies.\n\nC. Increasing federal income tax rates after World War I: This was a policy aimed at raising revenue for the federal government, which aligns with the goal of raising revenue in the colonies.\n\nD. Decreasing federal income tax rates in the 1980: This was a policy aimed at reducing the burden on taxpayers, which is not related to the goal of raising revenue in the colonies.\n\nGiven the context of the excerpt, the most relevant option is:\n\nC. Increasing federal income tax rates after World War I"
