The dongle provides a secure way to authenticate the user's identity, which is not accessible to malware.\n\nStatement 2 is false because a server using U2F cannot reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request. U2F is designed to verify the user's identity using a second-factor authentication mechanism, but it does not provide information about the location or device from which the login request is sent."
