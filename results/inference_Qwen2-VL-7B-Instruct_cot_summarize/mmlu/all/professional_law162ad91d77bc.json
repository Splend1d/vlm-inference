She alleges various acts of negligence on the part of the facility owner in causing the release of the contaminants into the ground. She also alleges that employees of the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently spilling some of the solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank at the facility. The solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was any contamination, the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination and that therefore the homeowner cannot show how much damage each has inflicted on her. There is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert. Should the court grant the summary judgment motion?\n\nA. No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\nB. No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.\nC.

No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\n\nIn this case, the homeowner has alleged acts of negligence by both the facility owner and the solvent supplier, and she is seeking to hold them both liable for the contamination. The solvent supplier's motion for summary judgment is based on the argument that if there was any contamination, the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination, making it impossible to determine how much damage each has inflicted on her. However, under concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury, meaning that the homeowner can hold both parties liable for the entirety of the damages caused by the contamination. Therefore, the court should deny the solvent supplier's motion for summary judgment."
