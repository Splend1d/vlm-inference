In general, $a_n = 2^{n-1}$ for $n \\geq 1$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $n$ such that $a_n > 5000$. So we need to solve the inequality $2^{n-1} > 5000$.\n\nTaking the base-2 logarithm of both sides, we get $n-1 > \\log_2 5000$. Solving this inequality to find $n > 1 + \\log_2 5000$.\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that $\\log_2 5000 \\approx 12.288$. So $n > 1 + 12.288 = 13.288$. Since $n$ must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 13.288 is 14.\n\nTherefore, the first term of the sequence that exceeds 5000 is $a_{14} = 2^{14-1} = 2^{13} = 8192$.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
