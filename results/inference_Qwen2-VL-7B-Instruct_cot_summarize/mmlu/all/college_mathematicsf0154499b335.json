This is because the closure of a set includes the set itself and all its limit points, and if the original set is connected, then adding the limit points does not disconnect it.\n\nStatement 2 is False. The statement is a variant of the Intermediate Value Theorem, which is true for continuous functions on a closed interval, but not necessarily for open intervals. For example, consider the function map \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\) for \\( x \\in ( (0, 1) \\). This function is continuous on \\( ( ( 0, 1) \\) but does not have a fixed point in \\( ( ( 0, 1) \\) because there is no \\( x \\) in \\( ( ( 0, 1) \\) such that \\( f(x) = x \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. True, False"
