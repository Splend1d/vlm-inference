The other book is dragged horizontally across the table surface, and it acceleration of the book is determined by the friction force between the book and the table surface. The friction force is proportional to the normal force, which is equal to the weight of the book. Therefore, the acceleration of the book is proportional to the weight of the book and the coefficient of friction between the book and the table surface. Since the coefficient of friction is always less than one, the acceleration of the book is always less than g."
