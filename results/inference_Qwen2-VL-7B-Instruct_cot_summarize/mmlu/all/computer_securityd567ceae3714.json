Blinding prevents the server from using the CRT optimization, which is essential to the timing attack.\nB. Blinding changes the p and q primes that are used, so an adversary cannot learn the server\u2019s true p and q values.\nC. Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary\u2019s input and the timing differences.\nD. Blinding adds a random amount of time to the decryption due to the multiplication and division by the blinding random value r, which obscures the timing differences used in the attack.\n"

Blinding adds a random amount of time to the decryption due to the multiplication and division by the blinding random value r, which obscures the timing differences used in the attack.\n\nBlinding is a technique used to protect against side-channel attacks, including timing attacks. It works by introducing randomness into the decryption process, which makes it difficult for an attacker to correlate the timing of the decryption process with the specific input being decrypted. This is because the timing differences observed during the attack are obscured by the randomization introduced by the blinding process."
