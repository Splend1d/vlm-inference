A pediatrician informed the infant's father that unless his daughter received immediate medical treatment, she would die. The father, who was very religious, refused to permit the pediatrician to administer the necessary treatment. He explained that his faith in his religion would restore his daughter to good health. As a consequence, the pediatrician sought an order from the state court, where the father was present, permitting the pediatrician to provide the necessary medical treatment to the infant. Which of the following is the father's strongest constitutional argument against the court order?\n\nA. The order violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The order violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The order violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe father's strongest constitutional argument against the court order would be based on the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which protects the freedom of an individual to exercise their religion. The Fourteenth Amendment incorporates this clause, meaning that states cannot interfere with an individual's freedom to practice their religion. In this case, the father's refusal to permit medical treatment is based on his religious beliefs, and the court order would be seen as an interference with his right to practice his religion."
