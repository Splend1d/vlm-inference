Each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of one of these square cross-sections. The side length of each square is equal to the distance between the curve \\(x^2 = 4y\\) and the line \\(y = 2\\). Since the curve is \\(x^2 = 4y\\), we can solve for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\):\n\n\\[x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{y}\\]\n\nThe side length of the square is \\(2\\sqrt{y}\\), so the area of the square cross-section is:\n\n\\[A(y) = ( (2\\sqrt{y})^2 = 4y\\]\n\nNow, we need to integrate this area function from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\) to find the volume of the solid:\n\n\\[V = \\int_{0}^{2} A(y) dy = \\int_{0}^{2} 4y dy\\]\n\n\\[V = [2y^2]_{0}^{2} = 2(2^2) - 2(0^2) = 2(4) = 8\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid is 8 cubic units, which corresponds to option A."
