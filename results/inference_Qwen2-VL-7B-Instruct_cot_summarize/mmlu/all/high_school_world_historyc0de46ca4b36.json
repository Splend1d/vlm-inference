A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nThe passage is most clearly an example of which of the following?\n\nA. Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa\nB. A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa\nC. A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world\nD. Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa\n"

It also mentions the need for Africa to command respect from the world based on size and influence, and highlights the need for unity to address issues like the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the United Nations' handling of the Congo crisis.\n\n2. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **A. Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa**: The passage does not discuss specific failed attempts at unification. It focuses on the potential benefits of unification rather than past failures.\n   - **B. A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa**: While the passage mentions the United Nations, it does not specifically call for intervention. Instead, it discusses the need for Africa to unite and the importance of its unity.\n   - **C. A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world**: This option alignss well with the passage's emphasis on Africa's need to unite and command respect from the world based on its size and influence.\n   - **D. Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa**: The passage does not discuss capitalism or its influence in Africa. It focuses on political unity and the world's perception of Africa.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage is most clearly an example of a proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world.\n\n**Final Answer: C. A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world**"
