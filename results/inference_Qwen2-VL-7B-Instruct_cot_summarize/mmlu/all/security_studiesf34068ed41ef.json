A failure to address the importance of a wide range of actors in the decision-making processes of the international system.\n\nLiberalism, as an approach in international relations, does not inherently pose great difficulty in defining when the use of force would be justified or necessary ( (A). It does not necessarily lead to internal inconsistency ( (B), and while it may reflect Western dominance, this is not a limitation of the approach itself but rather a critique of its application ( (D). The limitation highlighted in option C is more about the theoretical framework of liberalism rather than a limitation of the approach itself."
