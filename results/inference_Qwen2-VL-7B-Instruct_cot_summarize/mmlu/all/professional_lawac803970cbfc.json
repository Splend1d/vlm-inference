On July 1, not June 1, the creditor will be entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $12,000.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Statute of Limitations**: The creditor had to file a suit by September 30 of last year to collect on the promissory note. Since the suit was not filed by that deadline, the creditor's right to collect on the debt was barred by the statute of limitations as of September 30.\n\n2. **Letter from the Debtor**: On June 1, the debtor offered to pay $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of the debt. This offer was made after the statute of limitations had expired, so the offer was not legally binding and did not revive the creditor's right to collect the full amount.\n\n3. **Failure to Pay**: The debtor failed to make the payment on July 1, which means the offer was not fulfilled.\n\n4. **Suit Filed by the Creditor**: On August 1, the creditor brought a suit against the debtor. At this point, the creditor's right to collect the full amount of the debt ($12,000) was was not barred by the statute of limitations, as the suit was filed within the time frame allowed by the statute of limitations.\n\nTherefore, the creditor is entitled to a judgment against the debtor for the full amount of the debt ($12,000) as of the time the suit was filed, which was on August 1."
