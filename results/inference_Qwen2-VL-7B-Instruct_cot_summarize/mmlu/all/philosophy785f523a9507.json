The death of two people is always worse than the death of one.\n- This claim suggests that the loss of two individuals is inherently more severe than the loss of one. This is a strong assertion that implies a linear relationship between the number of deaths and the severity of the loss.\n\nB. The death of two people is sometimes less bad than the death of one.\n- This claim suggests that there are scenarios where the loss of two individuals is less severe than the loss of one. This implies that the relationship between the number of deaths and the severity of the loss is not always linear.\n\nC. The death of two people is always exactly as bad as the death of one.\n- This claim suggests that the loss of two individuals is exactly the same in terms of severity as the loss of one. This implies that the relationship between the number of deaths and the severity of the loss is constant.\n\nD. The notion of the sum of two people\u2019s losses should be rejected.\n- This claim suggests that the idea of adding up the losses of two individuals to determine the overall severity of the loss should be disregarded. This implies that the severity of the loss is not additive.\n\nGiven these options, Taurek's claims seem to be about the nature of the relationship between the number of deaths and the severity of the loss. \n\nOption B seems to be the most nuanced and flexible, suggesting that the severity of the loss can vary depending on the context. This aligns with the idea that the loss of two individuals might not always be twice as bad as the loss of one, depending on the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible claim by Taurek is:\n\nB. The death of two people is sometimes less bad than the death of one."
