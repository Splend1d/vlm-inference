A State is 'injured' if the obligation breached was owed to it individually or if it was owed to a group of States, including that State, and it was specially affected.\n\nIn the law of international responsibility, a State is considered 'injured' when it has suffered a damage from the internationally wrongful conduct of another State. This concept is often referred to as the \"incurring of damage\" or \"sufferinging of injury\" by the injured State. The injury must be caused by the internationally wrongful conduct of another State, and it must be a damage that the injured State has suffered as a result of that conduct."
