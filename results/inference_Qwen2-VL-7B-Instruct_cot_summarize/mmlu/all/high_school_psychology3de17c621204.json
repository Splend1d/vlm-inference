In a sample of 30 supporters, it was discovered that 22 of them gave $60, six of them gave $1,000, and two of them gave $10,000.

Median\n\nThe median is the middle value when the data is ordered from least to greatest. It is less affected by outliers and provides a better representation of the typical contribution amount in this case. The presence of a few very high contributions ($10,000) could skew the mean, making it less representative of the typical supporter's contribution. The mode ( (B) would be $60, but it doesn't provide information about the distribution of contributions. A histogram ( (C) would show the distribution of contributions but not a single value that represents the typical contribution. ANOVA ( (D) is a statistical test used to compare means across multiple groups, not a measure of central tendency."
