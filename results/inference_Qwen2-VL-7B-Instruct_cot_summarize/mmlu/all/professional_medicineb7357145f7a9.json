She is not in pain but is afraid to move her bowels for fear that the problem will worsen. She tells you that she moved away from home more than a year ago and that her parents contribute nothing to her support. She has a 6-month-old child and lives with a 28-year-old female cousin. She has never been married and does not work or attend school. She has no other symptoms. In order to follow the correct procedure for treating a minor, which of the following is the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem?\n\nA. Accept the girl's consent as sufficient\nB. Obtain a court order permitting evaluation\nC. Obtain the written consent of at least two licensed physicians\nD. Obtain written consent from at least one of her parents\n"

This is to ensure that the parents are aware of the medical condition and can make informed decisions about their child's care. In this case, the girl is 15 years old, which means she is a minor and requires parental consent for medical treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem would be to obtain written consent from at least one of her parents."
