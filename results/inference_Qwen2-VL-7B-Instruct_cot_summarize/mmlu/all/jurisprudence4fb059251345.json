What is the strongest reason for regarding this remark as unfair?\n\nA. Because American realism was not concerned with the predictions of what courts will do but more interested in the rights and duties of parties involved in litigation.\nB. Because American realists were preoccupied with the concept of justice and its application in American courts.\nC. Because the American realists exposed the limitations of a doctrinal account of law without a proper empirical investigation of the way it functions thereby paving the way to a sociological approach to law.\nD. Because the principal focus of the American realist 'school' was legal education.\n"

Because the American realist exposed the limitations of a doctrinal account of law without a proper empirical investigation of the way it functions thereby paving the way to a sociological approach to law.\n\nThis option highlights that Hart's dismissal overlooks the broader intellectual contributions of American realism, which went beyond merely criticizing the doctrine of law. Instead, American realism sought to understand law through empirical and sociological lenses, which Hart's statement does not adequately reflect."
