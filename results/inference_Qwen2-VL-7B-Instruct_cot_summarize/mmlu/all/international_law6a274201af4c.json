Treaties should always be designated as such and assume a particular form\n\nThis is because treaties are legally binding agreements between states or other international entities, and they must be clearly identified as treaties to ensure their legal status and enforceability. The form of a treaty can vary, but it must be designated as such to be recognized as a legally binding agreement."
