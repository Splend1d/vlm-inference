Some information is lost every time a file is saved from one location on a computer to another location.\n\nWhen a file is saved from one location to another on a computer, the data is often compressed or decompressed, which can lead to some information being lost. This process is known as lossy compression, and it is used to reduce the file size, which can result in a lower sound quality. Lossless compression, on the other hand, does not lose any information, but it is not the case here since the student noticed a decrease in sound quality."
