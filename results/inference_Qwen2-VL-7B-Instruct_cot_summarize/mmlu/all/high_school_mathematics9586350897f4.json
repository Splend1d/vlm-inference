By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $x^2 + x^2 = 10^2$, or $2x^2 = 100$, so $x^2 = 50$ and $x = \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. In this case, the base and the height are both $5\\sqrt{2}$, so the area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 5\\sqrt{2} \\times 5\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 = 25$ square inches.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
