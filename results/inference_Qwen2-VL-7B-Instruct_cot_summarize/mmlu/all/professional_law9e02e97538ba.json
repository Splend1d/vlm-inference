The purpose of these rules is to assist the agency in attaining the clean water standards required by the statute. After the agency issued such rules, several states filed an action challenging the rules on the sole ground that they are unconstitutional. Should the court uphold the constitutionality of the agency's rules?\n\nA. No, because the federal government may not compel a state legislature to enact into state law a federally mandated regulatory program.\nB. No, because the Tenth Amendment grants states immunity from all direct federal states immunity from all direct federal regulation.\nC. Yes, because the rules serve an important purpose, and the requirements they impose on the states are only temporary and do not excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments.\nD. Yes, because the supremacy clause of Article VI requires states to enforce federal law.\n"

Yes, because the rules serve an important purpose, and the requirements they impose on the states are only temporary and do not excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments.\n\nThe court should uphold the constitutionality of the agency's rules based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Purpose of the Rules**: The rules are designed to assist the agency in achieving the clean water standards required by the statute. This purpose is clearly and directly related to the federal government's legitimate interest in protecting the environment and public health.\n\n2. **Temporary Nature**: The rules are described as requiring laws of limited duration. This suggests that they are temporary measures, which is generally permissible under federal law. Temporary regulations are often used to address immediate or urgent issues without the need for permanent legislative changes.\n\n3. **Excessive Interference**: The rules do not appear to excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments. They are focused on a specific and limited area (water pollution from gasoline-powered boat motors) and do not seem to unduly burden the states' ability to govern themselves.\n\n4. **Supremacy Clause**: While the Supremacy Clause does require states to enforce federal law, it does not necessarily mean that states must enact federal regulations into their own laws. The Supremacy Clause primarily addresses the relationship between federal and state laws, not the direct imposition of federal regulations on state legislatures.\n\nTherefore, the court should uphold the constitutionality of the agency's rules based on their purpose, temporary nature, and lack of excessive interference with state governance."
