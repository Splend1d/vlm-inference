(P \u2022 ~B) \u2283 U\n- This option suggests that if the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it, then the university raised tuition. This is not the correct interpretation because the sentence does not imply that the university raised tuition because the president approved and the board didn't prevent it.\n\nB. (U \u2283 P) \u2022 B\n- This option suggests that if the university raised tuition, then the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it. This is not the correct interpretation because the sentence does not imply that the university raised tuition because the president approved and the board didn't prevent it.\n\nC. U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B)\n- This option suggest that if the university raised tuition, then the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it. This is the correct interpretation because the sentence states that the university raised tuition, and this implies that the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it.\n\nD. U \u2283 (P \u2228 ~B)\n- This option suggest that if the university raised tuition, then either the president approved of it or the board didn't prevent it. This is not the correct interpretation because the sentence does not imply that the university raised tuition because the president approved or the board didn't prevent it.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\n\nC.
