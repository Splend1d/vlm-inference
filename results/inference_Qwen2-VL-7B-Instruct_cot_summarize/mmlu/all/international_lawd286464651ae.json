It is named after the case \"Lotus\" ( (1927) which established that customary international law is formed by the general practice of states and their opinio juris ( (the belief that a particular practice is obligatory).\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The so-called Lotus principle is that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris\n\nThis option accurately reflects the essence of the Lotus principle, which is about the formation of customary international law through the practices of states and their collective belief in the necessity of those practices."
