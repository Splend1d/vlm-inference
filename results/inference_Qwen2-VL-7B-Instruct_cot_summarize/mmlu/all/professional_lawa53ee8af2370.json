She was smoking marijuana, blowing it out the open window, and not sharing it with the driver. The driver fell asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and go into a ditch where it landed upside-down. Both the driver and passenger were seriously injured. She sued the operator for negligence. The operator filed a counterclaim asking for damages against the passenger by arguing that the passenger was herself negligent by \"smoking weed\" and causing him to fall asleep. Is the court likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim?\n\nA. Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\nB. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.\nC. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.\nD. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.\n"

Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\n- The concept of a joint enterprise is typically used when two or more individuals act together with a common purpose to achieve a specific result. In this case, the driver and the passenger were not acting together with a common purpose to cause the accident. The passenger's actions (smoking marijuana and blowing it out the window) were not directly contributing to the driver's falling asleep and the accident. Therefore, the court is likely to dismiss the counterclaim based on the lack of joint enterprise.\n\nB. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.\n- This statement is incorrect. While it is generally true that the driver is primarily responsible for the operation of of the vehicle, passengers can be held liable for their actions that contribute to the accident. However, the court would need to determine if the passenger's actions were a significant contributing factor to the accident.\n\nC. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.\n- The driver's claim of a joint enterprise is not supported by the facts. The passenger's actions were not part of a joint effort to cause the accident, and she was not actively participating in the driving.\n\nD. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.\n- While the passenger's actions were illegal, breaking the law does not necessarily make her negligent per se. Negligence per se is a legal doctrine that makes a person liable for negligence without the need to prove the defendant's breach of duty. However, the court would need to determine if the passenger's actions were a significant contributing factor to the accident.\n\nGiven the facts, the court is most likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim based on the lack of joint enterprise and the driver's failure to prove that the passenger's actions were a significant contributing factor to the accident."
