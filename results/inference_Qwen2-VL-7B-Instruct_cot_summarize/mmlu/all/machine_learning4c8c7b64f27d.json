In traditional machine learning, it is often assumed that the training and test sets are independent and identically distributed ( (i.i.d.). This assumption is made to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nStatement 2: \"In 2017, COCO models were usually pretrained on ImageNet.\"\n- This statement is false. The COCO ( Common Objects in Context) dataset was introduced in 2014, and it was not until later that COCO models were pretrained on ImageNet. ImageNet was a widely used dataset for pretraining models before the introduction of COCO.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
