'De facto organs' are the persons, which are, in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct attributable to the State.\n\nIn the context of international law, 'de facto organs' refer to individuals or entities that are not officially recognized as organs of the state but who, in practice, act on behalf of the state. These individuals or entities are considered as 'de facto organs' because they are effectively exercising governmental authority or carrying out state functions, even though they may not be formally authorized to do so. This concept is particularly relevant in situations where a state is divided or where there is a lack of effective central authority, and individuals or groups assume roles that are typically reserved for state organs."
