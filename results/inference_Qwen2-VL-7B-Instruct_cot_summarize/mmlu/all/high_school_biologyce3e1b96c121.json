                    "text": "A frameshift mutation is a type of genetic mutation that occurs when a segment of DNA is added or deleted, causing the reading frame of the genetic code to shift. This can result in a completely different sequence of amino acids in the resulting protein.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HAS HIT\n- This option shows a single base deletion (\"HIS\" is missing), which would cause a frameshift mutation.\n\nB. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HSH ISA\n- This option shows a single base insertion (\"SH\" is added), which would also cause a frameshift mutation.\n\nC. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HIS HAT\n- This option shows a single base deletion (\"S\" is missing) and a single base insertion (\"T\" is added), which would cause a frameshift mutation.\n\nD. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT WAS HIT\n- This option shows a single base deletion (\"S\" is missing) and a single base insertion (\"W\" is added), which would cause a frameshift mutation.\n\nAll of the options show a frameshift mutation because they involve the addition or deletion of a single base pair, which would shift the reading frame of the genetic code. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HAS HIT\nB. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HSH ISA\nC. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HIS HAT\nD. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT WAS HIT"
