She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, a long history of hypertension, and chronic renal failure presumed secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Reversible causes of renal failure have been excluded. She underwent a tonsillectomy at age 9 years and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at age 68 years. Serum creatinine concentration on admission was 6.0 mg/dL. Her current therapy includes a low-sodium, low-protein American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet, enalapril, and acetaminophen. She is a retired seamstress. She and her husband live on a farm 90 miles from the nearest dialysis facility. In considering longterm treatment options for this patient, which of the following is the most appropriate factor to consider?\n\nA. Her eligibility to receive Medicare\nB. Her history of an abdominal operation\nC. Her history of arthritis\nD. Her suitability for home dialysis\n"

Her suitability for home dialysis\n\nGiven the patient's history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic renal failure, along with her current serum creatinine concentration of 6.0 mg/dL, it is essential to consider her suitability for home dialysis as a long-term treatment option. Home dialysis can provide greater convenience and quality of life compared to in-center dialysis, especially for patients living far from dialysis facilities. However, her age and overall health status should also be considered to ensure she is a suitable candidate for home dialysis."
