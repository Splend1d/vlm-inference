By regarding security as a socially constructed concept, constructivists assert that militarization is the result of governmental decisions based on shared values and cultural norms that underpin their conception of what constitutes a security risk. Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways.\nB. Social constructivists tend to focus on the population rather than military as an area for study, thus regarding the process of militarization largely in terms of its impact on human security.\nC. Social constructivists assert that the process follows a popular recognition of empirically definable threats; when it is recognized that an issue poses a real and valid threat, it warrants militarization.\nD. In their uniform advocacy of human security and adoption of a human-centric approach to security studies, social constructivists regard militarization as a process that is detrimental to achieving wider security goals and actively encourage the demilitarization of the security system.\n"

By regarding security as a socially constructed concept, constructivists assert that militarization is the result of governmental decisions based on shared values and cultural norms that underpin their conception of what constitutes a security risk. Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways.\n\nSocial constructivism is a theoretical framework in international relations that emphasizes the role of social and cultural factors in shaping international politics. According to this approach, security is not an objective, universal concept but rather a socially constructed one. This means that different societies and governments may have different perceptions of what constitutes a security threat, leading to different policies and actions.\n\nIn the context of militarization, social constructivists argue that governments will identify different threats and react in different ways based on their shared values and cultural norms. This can lead to different levels of militarization and different approaches to security. For example, some governments may see terrorism as a greater threat than others, leading to different policies and actions to address it."
