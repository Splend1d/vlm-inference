The postorder traversal visits nodes in the reverse order of their encounter during the traversal.\n   - Given that \\( \\text{pre}((\\text{u}) < \\text{pre}((\\text{v}) \\), it means \\( u \\) is visited before \\( v \\) in the preorder traversal.\n   - Since \\( u \\) is visited before \\( v \\) in preorder, \\( v \\) must be visited after \\( u \\) in postorder. Therefore, \\( \\text{post}((\\text{u}) < \\text{post}((\\text{v})) \\).\n\n2. **Statement II: u is an ancestor of v in T**\n\n   - In a depth-first search tree (T, the order of visiting nodes during preorder traversal corresponds to the order of parent-child relationships in the tree.\n   - Since \\( \\text{pre}((\\text{u}) < \\text{pre}((\\text{v})) \\), it means \\( u \\) is visited before \\( v \\) in preorder. This implies that \\( u \\) is an ancestor of \\( v \\) in the tree \\( T \\).\n\n3. **Statement III: If w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, then w = u**\n\n   - The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in \\( T \\) is the deepest node in \\( T \\) that has both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) as descendants.\n   - Given that \\( u \\) is an ancestor of \\( v \\) in \\( T \\), it means \\( u \\) is a possible candidate for the LCA.\n   - However, the statement \\( w = u \\) is not necessarily true. The LCA could be any node that is an ancestor of both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), not necessarily \\( u \\) itself.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. II only**"
