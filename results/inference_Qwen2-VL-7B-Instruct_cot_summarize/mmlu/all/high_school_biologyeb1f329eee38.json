                    "text": "The problem at hand involves understanding the mechanism of evolution and the development of resistance in mosquitoes to the pesticide DDT. The context provided indicates that mosquitoes resistant to DDT appeared in India within 15 years of the widespread spraying of the insecticide. This scenario is a classic example of natural selection and the development of resistance to pesticides.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\n- This option suggests that a mutation occurred in some mosquitoes after exposure to DDT, making them resistant. This mutation allowed them to survive and reproduce, leading to an increase in their population. This is consistent with the concept of natural selection and the development of resistance.\n\nB. Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\n- This option suggests that some mosquitoes were already resistant before DDT was sprayed. While this could explain the presence of resistant mosquitoes, it does not explain how the resistance arose. It does not address the mechanism of resistance development.\n\nC. DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly.\n- This option suggests that DDT is generally effective, but it does not explain how resistant mosquitoes arose. It does not address the mechanism of resistance development.\n\nD. Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.\n- This option suggests that DDT is not effective against mosquitoes, which contradicts the context provided. The context indicates that mosquitoes resistant to DDT appeared after the widespread spraying of DDT.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis of each option, the best explanation for how the resistant mosquitoes arose is:\n\nA. Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\n\nFinal answer: A."
