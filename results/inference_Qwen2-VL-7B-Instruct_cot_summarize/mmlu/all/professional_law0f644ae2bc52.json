The newborn calves need constant attention and care. One day one of the employees inadvertently leaves the fence door open and a newly-born calf breaks free and goes to his neighbor's land. The breeder went to the neighbor's land to retrieve the calf for its safety and to make sure it was unharmed. However, he was arrested on a trespass charge after entering the land. The breeder appealed. Will the court dismiss the charge?\n\nA. Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\nB. Yes, because the tender pet doctrine allows temporary entry to retrieve baby animals.\nC. No, because the neighbor had a right to keep any living chattels that crossed onto his land.\nD. No, because his status as a breeder made him unqualified for a limited license.\n"

Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\n\nThe tender pet doctrine generally allows temporary entry onto another's property to retrieve a pet or livestock that has wandered onto the property. In this case, the breeder had a legitimate reason to enter the neighbor's land to retrieve the calf, as it was his property and needed care. The court would likely consider this a reasonable and necessary action to prevent harm to the calf and would likely dismiss the trespass charge."
