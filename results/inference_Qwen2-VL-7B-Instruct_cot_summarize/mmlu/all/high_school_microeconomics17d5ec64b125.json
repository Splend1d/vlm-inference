Tax the production of electricity.\n\nA negative externality occurs when an economic activity imposes a cost on a third party who is not involved in the transaction. In this case, the power plant is emitting air pollution that is blowing downwind and harming the trees in the community. This is a negative externality because the community is bearing the cost of the pollution without being involved in the production of electricity.\n\nTo eliminate this negative externality, the government could tax the production of electricity. This would make it more expensive for the power plant to emit pollution, which would encourage them to reduce their emissions. This would benefit the community by reducing the harm caused by the pollution."
