So, 22 is not divisible by 4.\n\nB. 26\n26 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 2. So, 26 is not divisible by 4.\n\nC. 28\n28 divided by 4 is 7 with no remainder. So, 28 is divisible by 4.\n\nD. 30\n30 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 2. So, 30 is not divisible by 4.\n\nTherefore, the only total number of batteries that Mrs. Kinney could have bought is:\n\nC. 28"
