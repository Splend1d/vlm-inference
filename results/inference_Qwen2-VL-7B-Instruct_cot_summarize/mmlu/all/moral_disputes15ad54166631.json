Sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire.\n\nFrances Kamm's discussion centers on the ethical implications of an action being permissible despite being motivated by a bad desire. In this case, the scientist's motivation is a bad desire for mastery, yet the action of finding a cure for congenital blindness is considered permissible. This aligns with the idea that an action can be morally acceptable even if it is driven by an undesirable motive."
