We are looking for the number of ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, with the condition that all three cards must be of different suits.\n\nFirst, let's consider the number of ways to choose the suits. Since there are 4 suits in a standard deck ( (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades), and we need to choose 3 different suits, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / ( (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 4 ( (the number of suits) and k = 3 ( (the number of suits we need to choose). So, we have:\n\nC(4, 3) = 4! / ( (3!(4-3)!) = = 4! / ( (3!1!) = = 4 / 3 = = 4\n\nNow, we need to consider the number of ways to choose the cards within each suit. Since there are 13 cards in each suit, and we need to choose 1 card from each suit, we can use the combination formula again:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / ( (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 13 ( (the number of cards in each suit) and k = 1 ( (the number of cards we need to choose). So, we have:\n\nC(13, 1) = = 13! / ( (1!(13-1)!) = = 13! / ( (1!12!) = = 13\n\nSince we need to choose 1 card from each of the 3 suits, we multiply the number of ways to choose the suits by the number of ways to choose the cards within each suit:\n\n4 * 13 * 13 * 13 = 2197\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 2197."
