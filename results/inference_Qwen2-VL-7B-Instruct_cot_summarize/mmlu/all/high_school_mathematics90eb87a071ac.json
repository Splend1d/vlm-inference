The equation $\\log_8 2 = x$ can be rewritten as $8^x = 2$.\n\nNow, we need to express 2 as a power of 8. Since $8 = 2^3$, we can rewrite the equation as $(2^3)^x = 2$. This simplifies to $2^{3x} = 2^1$.\n\nFor the equation $2^{3x} = 2^1$ to hold true, the exponents must be equal, so $3x = 1$. Solving for $x$:\n\n\\[3x = 1\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\nTherefore, $\\log_8 2 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe correct answer is D. $\\frac{1}{3}$."
