When the parties were unable to agree on the terms of a the parties were unable to agree on the terms of a final contract, the producer made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to hire another singer before abandoning the production. If the producer sues the singer, what will he likely recover?\n\nA. Expectation damages in the form of the profits that the production would have made if it had been performed.\nB. Reliance damages in the form of the actual expenses the producer incurred while negotiating with the singer.\nC.

This means that the producer did not have a legally binding agreement to perform with the singer. Therefore, the producer cannot recover any damages for the expenses incurred during the negotiation process, as these expenses were incurred under the assumption that there would be a contract, which was not legally binding.\n\nExpectation damages ( (A) and reliance damages ( (B) are typically awarded in cases where there is a legally binding contract, and the party who breached the contract is required to compensate the other party for the losses incurred due to the breach. In this case, there was no legally binding contract, so these types of damages are not applicable.\n\nRestitution ( (C) is a legal remedy that may be available in some cases, but it is not typically awarded for the abandonment of a production due to the failure to reach a contract agreement. Instead, the focus is on the legal obligations and rights of the parties involved under a legally binding contract.\n\nTherefore, the producer is likely to recover nothing because the producer did not have a legally binding agreement with the singer, and the expenses incurred during the negotiation process were not recoverable under the producer knew that there was no enforceable obligation until a final, signed contract was in place."
