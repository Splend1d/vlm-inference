In the motion, Defendant raises arguments that were not raised at trial. Plaintiff's counsel objects to the court even hearing the motion to set aside the verdict. Should the court consider the motion?\n\nA. Yes, because Defendant has raised new grounds.\nB. Yes, because Defendant had ten days after the jury returned its verdict within which to move to set aside the verdict.\nC.

Yes, because Defendant had ten days after the jury returned its verdict within which to move to set aside the verdict.\n\nIn a civil trial, a party may move for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence. If the court denies the motion, the trial continues, and the jury returns a verdict. After the jury returns its verdict, the court enters judgment for the prevailing party. If a party wishes to challenge the verdict, they must file a motion to set aside the verdict within ten days of the entry of judgment. This is a procedural requirement to ensure that the party has a timely opportunity to challenge the verdict.\n\nIn this scenario, the court denied the motion for directed verdict after the jury returned its verdict. The jury then returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the court entered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant then moved to set aside the verdict one week later, which is within the ten-day period allowed by the rules of civil procedure. Therefore, the court should consider the motion to set aside the verdict because it was filed within the required timeframe."
