I'll pay you $275 if you will change the oil, replace the oil filter, and adjust the carburetors by February 10. \"The mechanic received the man's letter on February 3. That same day, he telephoned an auto supply company and ordered the necessary materials to perform the repair work. Two days later, the mechanic met the man at a party and this conversation took place:The man: \"Disregard the letter I sent you last week. \"The mechanic: \"No way, man, I already ordered the materials on from the auto supply company. \"The man: \"Sorry, but I sold my car yesterday, so forget the repair work. \"If the mechanic initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is the man's strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the parties?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the man and the mechanic, we need to analyze the situation based on the principles of contract law, specifically focusing on the formation of a contract and the concept of acceptance.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - The man initially offered to pay $275 for the mechanic to perform certain tasks on his car.\n   - The mechanic accepted the offer by ordering the necessary materials.\n   - The man later revoked his offer by saying he sold his car and no longer needed the repair work.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Option:**\n\n   **A. The mechanic had not completed performance before the man revoked his offer.**\n   - This option suggests that the mechanic had not yet started the repair work. However, the mechanic had already accepted the offer by ordering the materials, which constitutes a binding acceptance. Therefore, this option does not address the core issue of the revocation of the offer.\n\n   **B. The man's offer could only be accepted by a return promise.**\n   - This option suggests that the offer could only be accepted by a return promise. However, the mechanic accepted the offer by ordering the materials, which is a form of acceptance. This. Therefore, this option does not address the revocation of the offer.\n\n   **C. Because the man made his offer by letter, the mechanic could accept only in the same manner.**\n   - This. This. Therefore, this option does not address the revocation of the offer.\n\n   **D. Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.**\n   - This option suggests that the mechanic had not yet begun the repair work when the man revoked his offer. However, the mechanic had already accepted the offer by ordering the materials, which is a binding acceptance. Therefore, this option does not address the revocation of the offer.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   The strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the man and the mechanic is that the mechanic had already accepted the offer by ordering the materials, and the man's revocation of the offer occurred after the mechanic had already accepted the offer. Therefore, the mechanic had already begun the acceptance process when the man revoked his offer.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.**"
