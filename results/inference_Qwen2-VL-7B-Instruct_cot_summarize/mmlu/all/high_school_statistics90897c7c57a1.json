Yes, but only if there is a single entrance to the school.\nC. Yes, because the 24 out of every 25 students who are not selected will form a control group.\nD. No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n"

Instead, it selects every 25th student entering the school, which means that students who enter the school at different times have different probabilities of being included in the sample. Therefore, this method does not result in a simple random sample."
