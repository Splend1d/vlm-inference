In 1994, thelandowner delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000,a deed signed by the landowner, naming the son andhis heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the landowner-to-son deed, sought out the landowner and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the vineyard from the landowner to the farmer and his heirs. The landowner executed such a deed, and the farmer promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the vineyard by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the vineyard. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the vineyard to an investor and, for $15,000, paid by the investor, signed and delivered a deed of the vineyard in favor of the investor and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the investor made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a vintner paid the farmer $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the vintner a deed of the vineyard in favor of the vintner and his heirs. The vintner had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior landowner-to-son instrument. Although the vintner did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the vineyard twice a week. The vintner recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a farmer, the investor signed and delivered a deed of the vineyard naming the farmer and his heirs as grantees. Before the farmer had paid the investor and taken his deed, the farmer visited the vineyard and observed the fence. However, the vintner was not present when the farmer visited the property, and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094if anyone \u0080\u0094was using it. In any case, the farmer did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. The farmer then recorded the deed.

The recording act states that every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.\n\nLet's analyze the timeline and the relevant parties involved:\n\n1. **1993**: The landowner had good record title to the vineyard in fee simple absolute.\n2. **1994**: The landowner delivered a deed to his son, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, but the son neglected to record the deed.\n3. **1998**: The farmer, aware of the existence of the landowner-to-son deed, sought out the landowner and asked to buy the vineyard. The landowner executed a deed to the farmer and recorded it promptly.\n4. **1999**: The son presented his deed to an investor and sold the vineyard to the investor for $15,000. The investor did not search the title, examine the property, or record the deed.\n5 **2003**: The vintner paid the farmer $20,000 and received a deed from the farmer. The vintner examined the property, searched the title, and recorded his deed.\n6. **2007**: The investor sold the vineyard to the farmer for $25,000. The farmer visited the vineyard and observed the fence but the vintner was not present when the farmer visited the property. The farmer did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase and recorded the deed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options based on the recording act:\n\n**Option A**: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the farmer, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he is the last in time to record.\n- This option is incorrect because the farmer did not record his deed first in time. The vintner recorded his deed first.\n\n**Option B**: In a pure race jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he purchased the property for value and recorded first in time.\n- This option is incorrect because the farmer did not record his deed first in time. The vintner recorded his deed first.\n\n**Option C**: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the vintner, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior landowner-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he recorded his deed first in time.\n- This option is incorrect because the vintner did not purchase the vineyard for value and did not record his deed first in time.\n\n**Option D**: In a pure race jurisdiction, the vintner, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior landowner-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he recorded his deed first in time.\n- This option is correct because the vintner purchased the vineyard for value and recorded his deed first in time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the present state of title to the vineyard is:\n\n**D. In a pure race jurisdiction, the vintner, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior landowner-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he recorded his deed first in time.**"
