The time it takes for the Sun to make one circuit of our sky is one solar day.\n- This statement is true. A solar day is defined as the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky, which is approximately 24 hours.\n\nB. A solar day is 4 minutes longer than a sidereal day.\n- This statement is true. A sidereal day is the time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation relative to the stars, which is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds. Therefore, a solar day is indeed 4 minutes longer than a sidereal day.\n\nC. A solar day represents more than 360\u00b0 of rotation for the Earth.\n- This statement is true. The Earth rotates 360\u00b0 ( or 360 degrees - 360 degrees = 0 degrees, which is not correct. The correct statement should be that a solar day represents 360\u00b0 of rotation for the Earth.\n\nD. The time it takes for the Moon to make one circuit of our sky is one solar day.\n- This statement is not true. The time it takes for the Moon to make one circuit of our sky is one sidereal month, not a solar day. A solar day is related to the Sun's position in the sky, while a sidereal day is related to the stars.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is:\n\nD. The time it takes for the Moon to make one circuit of our sky is one solar day."
