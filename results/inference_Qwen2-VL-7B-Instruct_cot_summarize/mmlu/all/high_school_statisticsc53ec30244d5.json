For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes down by approximately 9.83 percent.\n- This option is incorrect because the equation shows a linear decrease, not a percentage decrease. The coefficient of -0.983 indicates a decrease of $0.983 for every year the car gets older, not a percentage decrease.\n\nB. A new car costs on the average $9,830.\n- This option is incorrect because the equation does't provide information about the selling price of a new car. The constant term (15.9 represents the intercept, which is the selling price when the age is 0 (i.e., a new car.\n\nC. For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.\n- This option is incorrect because the coefficient of -0.983 indicates a decrease of $0.983 for every year the car gets older, not $1,590.\n\nD. For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.\n- This option is incorrect because the coefficient of -0.983 indicates a decrease of $0.983 for every year the car gets older, not $983.\n\nNone of the options accurately reflect the information provided by the equation. The correct interpretation is that for every year the car gets older, the selling price decreases by approximately $0.983."
