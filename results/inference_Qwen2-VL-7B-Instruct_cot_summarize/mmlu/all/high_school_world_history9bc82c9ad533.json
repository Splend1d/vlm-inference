The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.\nOf Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone\u2014it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\n*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.\nWhich of the following statements about ancient cities is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph?\n\nA. Ancient cities lacked effective fortifications against attack.\nB. Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.\nC.

                    "text": "To determine which statement about ancient cities is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph of the Epic of Gilgamesh, we need to carefully analyze the information provided.\n\nThe passage describes the construction and features of Uruk, a city in ancient Mesopotamia. Here are the key points from the passage:\n\n1. **Construction of Uruk**: The passage mentions that Gilgamesh built the outer and inner walls of Uruk, which are described as gleaming with the brilliance of copper and none could rival. This indicates that Uruk had effective fortifications.\n\n2. **Sacred Eanna Temple**: The passage describes the Eanna temple, which is the dwelling place of Ishtar, the goddess of love and war. It is mentioned that the temple is a holy sanctuary and that the threshold stone is from ancient days. This suggests that Uruk had areas dedicated to worshipping their patron deities.\n\n3. **City Layout**: The passage also mentions that Uruk was divided into three parts: one-third for the city, one-third for a garden, one-third for a field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. This indicates that Uruk had a planned layout with specific areas designated for different purposes.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Ancient cities lacked effective fortifications against attack.**\n   - The passage clearly states that Uruk had effective fortifications, so this statement is not supported.\n\nB. **Ancient cities featured area for worshipping their patron deities.**\n   - The passage mentions the Eanna temple, which is the dwelling place of Ishtar, indicating that Uruk had an area for worshipping their patron deity. This is supported.\n\nC. **Ancient cities commonly decorated their temples in modest ways.**\n   - The passage describes the Eanna temple as a holy sanctuary with a threshold stone from ancient days, suggesting that the temple was not modestly decorated. This is not supported.\n\nD. **Ancient cities featured area for training their armies.**\n   - The passage does not mention any specific area for training armies, so this statement is not supported.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph is:\n\n**B. Ancient cities featured area for worshipping their patron deities.**"
