One can have comparative advantage in producing both goods.\n\nExplanation:\n- Comparative advantage refers to the ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost compared to another good.\n- Absolute advantage refers to the ability to produce a good more efficiently than another good, regardless of opportunity cost.\n- It is possible to have comparative advantage in producing both goods, as long as one good can be produced more efficiently relative to the other good.\n- It is also possible to have both an absolute advantage and a comparative advantage in producing a good, as long as the good can be produced more efficiently than any other good.\n- it is also possible to have absolute advantage and no comparative advantage in producing a good, as long as the good can be produced more efficiently than any other good, but not necessarily more efficiently than the other good.\n- it is also possible to have comparative advantage and no absolute advantage in producing a good, as long as the good can be produced more efficiently relative to the other good, but not necessarily more efficiently than the other good."
