Management places the same degree of reliance on the files as they do on files generated from mainframe systems.\n\nExplanation: When end-user computing (EUC) files are not properly controlled and validated, there is a risk that management might rely on these files as if they were as reliable as those generated from mainframe systems. This could lead to incorrect decisions or actions based on flawed data, potentially causing significant harm to the organization."
