This is because such actions can be seen as a form of abuse of process, which can lead to a stay of proceedings. This is because the courts may consider the abduction to be a violation of the principles of due process and fair trial, which are fundamental to the administration of justice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Such abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings"
