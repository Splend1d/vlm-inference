Dr. Ramchandran found that patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20 the number of cavities in their teeth as those who didn't brush.\n2. The newswriter reported that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.\n- This statement suggests that the writer's statement is justified if the study involved at least 100 patients. However, the research only indicates a statistical relationship between brushing teeth after lunch and fewer cavities, not a causal relationship. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nB. If a minimum of 500 patient were studied, the writer's statement is justified.\n- Similar to option A, this statement implies that the writer's statement is justified if the study involved at least 500 patients. Again, the research does not provide a minimum sample size for the statement to be justified. Thus, this statement is also not necessarily true.\n\nC. At least 100 of the patient needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.\n- This statement suggests that the writer's statement is justified if at least 100 patients brushed their teeth after lunch. However, the research does not specify a minimum number of patients who brushed their teeth after lunch for the statement to be valid. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nD. No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.\n- This statement implies that the writer's statement is not justified regardless of the number of participants. However, the research does not provide any information that would conclusively prove that brushing teeth after lunch does not prevent cavities. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the statements are conclusively justified based on the provided information. However, the closest option to a true statement based on the given data is:\n\nC. At least 100 of the patient needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.\n\nThis option is the most plausible based on the given information, as it aligns with the research indicating a statistical relationship between brushing teeth after lunch and fewer cavities. However, it is important to note that the research does not provide a specific minimum sample size for the statement to be justified."
