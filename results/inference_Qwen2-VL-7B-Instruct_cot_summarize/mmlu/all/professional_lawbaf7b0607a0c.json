Yes, for the deaths of both the manager and the clerk.\n\nFelony murder is a legal doctrine that holds a defendant criminally liable for the death of a person caused by the defendant's commission of or attempt to commit a felony. In this case, the man was attempting to rob the store, which is a felony. The man's actions, including the use of the gun, led to the deaths of both the store manager and the clerk. Therefore, the man can be properly convicted of felony murder for both deaths."
