(2) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the ranch. (3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the borrower delivered to his daughter, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter by a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. (4) In 2008, the borrower delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. If the borrower thereafter defaulted on the mortgage and the mortgage company brought an in personam action against the daughter to recover the amount due on the mortgage debt, the mortgagee will probably\n\nA. succeed, because the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter.\nB. succeed, because there was an implied delegation of duties to the daughter.\nC. not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\nD. not succeed, because the law does not permit the mortgagor to delegate duties under this type of a property transfer.\n"

However, the quitclaim deed delivered by the borrower to the daughter made no reference to the mortgage. Since the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt, the mortgage company cannot rely on the daughter's promise to pay the debt as a basis for recovery. Therefore, the mortgage company's in personam action against the daughter to recover the amount due on the mortgage debt is likely to fail."
