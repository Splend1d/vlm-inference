                    "text": "The thermic effect of food, also known as the thermic effect of feeding ( (TEF), is the increase in metabolic rate that occurs immediately after eating. It is a small but significant portion of the total energy expenditure of the body. Here's a breakdown of each option:\n\nA. **Is substantially higher for carbohydrate than for protein**: This statement is incorrect. The thermic effect of food is generally higher for protein than for carbohydrate. Protein requires more energy to digest and assimilate compared to carbohydrates, which explains why the TEF is higher for protein.\n\nB. **Is accompanied by a slight decrease in body core temperature**: This statement is incorrect. The thermic effect of food is associated with an increase in body temperature, not a decrease. The increased in metabolic rate leads to more heat production, which can cause a slight rise in body temperature.\n\nC. **Is partly related to sympathetic activity stimulation in the postprandial phase**: This statement is correct. The thermic effect of food is partly due to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which increases metabolic rate and heat production in the body.\n\nD. **Is not attenuated by food malabsorption**: This statement is incorrect. Food malabsorption can indeed affect the thermic effect of food. When food is not properly digested and absorbed, the body may not be able to utilize the nutrients efficiently, which can lead to a reduced thermic effect.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C."
