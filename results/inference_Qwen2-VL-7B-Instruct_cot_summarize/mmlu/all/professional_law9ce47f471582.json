Instead, it is a situation where a court is asked to provide an opinion on a hypothetical or abstract question, rather than addressing a concrete case or controversy. This is not a requirement for federal court jurisdiction, as the court must still have a case or controversy to address. \n\nThe other options listed ( B. The issue has to be ripe, C. The issue can't be moot, and D. A person must have a concrete stake in the outcome, are all limitations on federal court jurisdiction. These ensure that the court is addressing a real and live controversy, not a hypothetical one, and that there is a concrete interest at stake in the outcome."
