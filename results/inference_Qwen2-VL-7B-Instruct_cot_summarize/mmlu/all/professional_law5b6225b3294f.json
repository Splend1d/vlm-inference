She brought a Title VII civil rights action in federal court for gender discrimination against the employer. At trial, a former co-worker of the woman was not allowed to testify that she heard the human relations manager saying in an informal meeting that the plaintiff and her predecessor were both fired due to what the manager described as \"pregnancy complications.\" The proposed witness had been a vice-president of the company and a close adviser to the president. Without the benefit of that vital testimony, the jury entered a verdict for the defendant employer. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the testimony should have been allowed and that it was not hearsay under the federal rules. Will the court likely grant the appeal, and order a new trial?\n\nA. No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable.\nB. No, because it was based on things that the co-worker heard from others, making double-hearsay that is never admissible.\nC. Yes, because that kind of testimony is reliable and not excludable as hearsay.\nD. Yes, because it was admissible under the \"spontaneous utterance\" exception to the hearsay rules.\n"

Yes, because that kind of testimony is reliable and not excludable as hearsay.\n\nThe court is likely to grant the appeal and order a new trial because the testimony in question appears to be admissible under the \"spontaneous utterance\" exception to the hearsay rules. This exception allows for the admission of statements made in the course of an emergency, where the declarant's state of mind is relevant to the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the statement by the human relations manager appears to be a spontaneous utterance made in the course of an emergency, as it was made in an informal meeting and was relevant to the truth of the matter asserted (the reason for the plaintiff's predecessor's termination. Therefore, the court is likely to find that the testimony was admissible and order a new trial."
