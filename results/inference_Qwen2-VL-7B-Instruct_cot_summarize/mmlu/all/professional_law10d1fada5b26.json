A friend of the woman had known the woman for years and knew that she was an easily excitable person. The friend also hated the woman's husband. Knowing that the woman was present, the friend drew a pistol and threatened to kill the husband. The woman suffered severe emotional distress as a result of witnessing this incident and soon afterward had a miscarriage. In an action by the woman against the friend for mental anguish resulting in her miscarriage, the woman will\n\nA. lose, because the friend did not intend for the woman to suffer a miscarriage.\nB. lose, because the friend's actions were directed against the husband, not the woman.\nC. win, because it was highly probable that the friend's extreme and outrageous conduct would cause emotional distress to the woman.\nD. win, because she is the husband's wife.\n"

In this case, the friend's conduct\u2014threatening to kill the woman's husband with a gun\u2014was clearly extreme and outrageous. Given that the woman was present and experienced severe emotional distress as a result, it is highly probable that such conduct would cause emotional distress to the woman. Therefore, the court is likely to find that the friend's actions were sufficiently outrageous to warrant liability for the woman's miscarriage."
