Productivity of labor is defined as the output per worker.\n\nFor Country X:\n- Output = 30,000 units\n- Workers = 3,000\n\nProductivity of labor in Country X = Output / Workers = 30,000 / 3,000 = 10 units per worker.\n\nFor Country Z:\n- Output = 40,000 units\n- Workers = 8,000\n\nProductivity of labor in Country Z = Output / Workers = 40,000 / 8,000 = 5 units per worker.\n\nNow, let's compare the productivity of labor between the two countries:\n\nA. The productivity of labor in Country Z is 33 percent higher than in Country X.\n- To check this, we calculate the percentage increase: ((5 - 10) / 10) * 100% = -50%. This means Country Z's productivity is 50% lower than Country X's, not 33% higher.\n\nB. The productivity of labor in Country Z is 25 percent higher than in Country X.\n- To check this, we calculate the percentage increase: ((5 - 10) / 10) * 100% = -50%. This means Country Z's productivity is 50% lower than Country X's, not 25% higher.\n\nC. The productivity of labor in Country X is 33 percent higher than in Country Z.\n- To check this, we calculate the percentage increase: ((10 - 5) / 5) * 100% = 100%. This means Country X's productivity is 100% higher than Country Z's, not 33% higher.\n\nD. The productivity of labor in Country X is twice as much as Country Z.\n- To check this, we compare the productivity directly: 10 units per worker in Country X is not twice 5 units per worker in Country Z.\n\nNone of the options A, B, C, or D are correct based on the calculations. The correct statement would be:\n\nThe productivity of labor in Country X is 100% higher than in Country Z."
