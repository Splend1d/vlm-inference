In letters to prospective employers, the witness has described the defendant as very honest and dependable.\n\nThis area of questioning is likely to be considered beyond the proper scope of cross-examination because it involves the witness's personal opinion about the defendant's honesty and dependability, which is not directly related to the facts of the traffic accident or the plaintiff's injuries. The witness's opinion about the defendant's character does not provide relevant information about the accident or the plaintiff's injuries.\n\nHere's a brief analysis of each option:\n\nB. The defendant recently filed an action against the witness for breach of contract.\n- This is relevant because it involves a potential conflict of interest or bias that could affect the witness's testimony.\n\nC. The plaintiff's injuries were not as serious as the plaintiff is claiming.\n- This is relevant because it directly relates to the plaintiff's injuries and the credibility of the plaintiff's testimony.\n\nD. The witness has been falsifying his income tax returns.\n- This is relevant because it involves the witness's credibility and could affect the reliability of his testimony.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
