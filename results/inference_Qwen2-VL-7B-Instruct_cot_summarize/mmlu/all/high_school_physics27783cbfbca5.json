According to Archimedes' principle, an object will float in a fluid when the weight of the fluid displaced by the object is equal to the weight of the object.\n\nGiven:\n- Volume of the object, \\( V = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\)\n- Weight of the object, \\( W = 6 \\, \\text{N} \\)\n\nThe weight of the water displaced by the object is equal to the weight of the object, which is 6 N. This means that the volume of water displaced by the object is equal to the volume of the object, since the density of water is approximately \\( 10^3 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\) and the weight of water displaced is equal to the weight of the object.\n\nTherefore, the volume of water displaced is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{water}} = V = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nThe volume of the object that is above the surface of the water is the total volume of the object minus the volume of water displaced:\n\\[ V_{\\text{above}} = V - V_{\\text{water}} = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m}^3 - 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m}^3 = 0 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nSince the volume of the object that is above the surface of the water is 0 m^3, the percentage of the object's volume that is above the surface of the water is:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{V_{\\text{above}}}{V} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0}{2 \\times 10^{-3}} \\times 100\\% = 0\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. 12%"
