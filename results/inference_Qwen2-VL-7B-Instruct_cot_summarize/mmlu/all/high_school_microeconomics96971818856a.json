The supply of daycare rises, lowering the market price.\n\nWhen the county government sends each parent a coupon that can be used to subsidize the cost of sending each child to daycare, it is likely that the cost of daycare will decrease for parents. This will make daycare more affordable for parents, which will increase the demand for daycare. As the demand for daycare increases, the market price of daycare will likely rise. However, since the cost of daycare has decreased for parents, the supply of daycare will also likely rise. This will cause the market price of daycare to fall."
