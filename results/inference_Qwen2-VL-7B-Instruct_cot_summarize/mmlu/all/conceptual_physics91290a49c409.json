This means that after each hour, the amount of the sample is halved.\n\nFrom noon to 3:00 pm, 3 hours have passed.\n\nStarting with 1.000 gram of the sample at noon, we can calculate the amount remaining at 3:00 pm as follows:\n\n1. After 1 hour ( (noon to 1:00 pm): 1.000 g / 2 = 0.500 g\n2. After 2 hours ( (1:00 pm to 2:00 pm): 0.500 g / 2 = 0.250 g\n3. After 3 hours ( (2:00 pm to 3:00 pm): 0.250 g / 2 = 0.125 g\n\nTherefore, at 3:00 pm, 0.125 grams of the sample remains.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.125 g"
