Here's how each option aligns with this general trend:\n\nA. **Voters are more likely to support government-enforced affirmative action programs**: Higher education often leads to a greater understanding of social justice issues and the need for affirmative action to address historical inequalities.\n\nB. **Voters are more likely to support environmental protection efforts**: Educated individuals are more likely to be aware of environmental issues and the importance of protecting the environment.\n\nD. **Voters are less likely to support restrictions on abortion rights**: Higher education can lead to a more nuanced understanding of reproductive rights and the ethical considerations involved, potentially leading to more support for reproductive freedoms.\n\nC. **Voters are more likely to support public prayer in schools**: This statement is less aligned with the general trend of higher education influencing voting habits. While some might argue that higher education leads to a greater appreciation for religious diversity, the direct correlation between higher education and support for public prayer in schools is less clear and less commonly observed. In fact, many people with higher education might be more critical of religious practices in public spaces, viewing them as a separation of church and state.\n\nTherefore, the statement about supporting public prayer in schools is the exception to the general trend that higher education influences voting habits."
