The security guard knew that the barber, an elderly man, had a history of significant heart problems. The security guard decided to play a joke on his friend. The security guard took out his gun, burst through the door of the barber shop, pointed the gun at the friend, and shouted, \"Don't move or I'll shoot!\" The barber, thinking that an armed intruder was about to shoot the friend, suffered a heart attack and collapsed. If the barber brings suit against the security guard for infliction of emotional distress and seeks recovery for damages arising from the heart attack, he should\n\nA. prevail, because the security guard knew the barber was present.\nB. prevail, because the security guard assaulted the friend.\nC. not prevail, because the barber was not a member of the friend's immediate family.\nD. not prevail, because the resulting harm was unforeseeable.\n"

Therefore, the resulting harm was unforeseeable and the security guard should not be held liable for the damages arising from the heart attack."
