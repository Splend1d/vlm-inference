A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nBased on the speech, the French saw Africa as which of the following?\n\nA.

The speech is by Kwame Nkrumah, the Ghanaian leader, in 1961.\n2. The speech discusses the importance of Africa avoiding disunity and creating a political union to project the African personality and command respect from the world.\n3. It mentions the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the U.N.'s involvement in the Congo, highlighting the callous disregard of African independence by the Great Powers.\n\nGiven this context, the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the U.N.'s involvement in the Congo suggest that the French were more interested in exploiting Africa's natural resources and maintaining control over it rather than respecting its independence or promoting its political unity.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. A collection of republics tottering into anarchy\n- This option does not align with the speech's emphasis on the importance of unity and avoiding disunity.\n\nB. A resource for enhance French power in the Cold War\n- This option aligns with the speech's criticism of the French atomic tests in the Sahara, which suggests that the French were more interested in exploiting Africa's natural resources.\n\nC. Important due to the Sahara's natural resources\n- This option is partially correct but does not fully capture the broader context of the speech.\n\nD. A strong political union\n- This option contradicts the speech's emphasis on avoiding disunity and creating a political union.\n\nBased on the analysis, the French saw Africa as a resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War.\n\nFinal answer: B. A resource for enhance French power in the Cold War"
