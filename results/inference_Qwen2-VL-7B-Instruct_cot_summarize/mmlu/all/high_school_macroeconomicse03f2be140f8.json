If inflation is high in the EU and the price level in the United States is stable, the value of the dollar appreciates.\n- This statement is true. When inflation is high in the EU, the purchasing power of the euro decreases relative to the dollar. Since the price level in the United States is stable, the dollar becomes relatively more valuable, leading to appreciation.\n\nB. If the Fed decreases the money supply, the value of the dollar depreciates.\n- This statement is false. Decreasing the money supply typically leads to higher interest rates, which can attract foreign investors and thus increase the value of the dollar.\n\nC. If EU consumers are less inclined to purchase American goods, the dollar appreciates.\n- This statement is true. A decrease in demand for American goods from EU consumers would likely lead to a decrease in the demand for dollars, causing the dollar to depreciate.\n\nD. If U.S. income levels are higher relative to incomes in the EU, the euro depreciates.\n- This statement is false. Higher U.S. income levels relative to the EU would likely lead to increased demand for dollars, causing the euro to depreciate against the dollar.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. If inflation is high in the EU and the price level in the United States is stable, the value of the dollar appreciates."
