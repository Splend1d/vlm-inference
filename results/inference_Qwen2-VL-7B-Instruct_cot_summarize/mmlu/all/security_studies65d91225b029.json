The Ideal Policy framework provides the analytical tools for understanding the contextual factors influencing the use of coercive diplomacy, for example why a policymaker takes the decision to, or not to, implement the Ideal Policy.\n\nThis option highlights the framework's ability to analyze the various factors that influence the decision-making process of policymakers regarding the use of coercive diplomacy. By understanding these factors, practitioners can better predict and influence outcomes.\n\nB. The Ideal Policy framework focuses on the use of coercive diplomacy to counter aggression. The Ideal Policy explains and predicts outcomes with a minimum of success conditions on the basis of the coercer's actions only.\n\nThis option emphasizes the framework's focus on coercive diplomacy as a means to counter aggression. While this is a significant aspect of the Ideal Policy framework, it does not fully capture the comprehensive nature of the framework.\n\nC. The Ideal Policy provides an expansive framework, firstly for the examination of a maximum number of probable causal conditions and secondly to make the conditions applicable to the contextual factors relating to the use of coercive diplomacy.\n\nThis option correctly identifies the framework's comprehensive approach, which includes examining a wide range of causal conditions and making them applicable to the contextual factors of coercive diplomacy. This expansive nature allows for a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing the use of coercive diplomacy.\n\nD. The Ideal Policy framework recognizes that to make non-compliance too costly, the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary or to deny the targets objectives. The condition for success is pivotal on the coercer's threat of force.\n\nThis option correctly identifies the framework's recognition of the importance of making non-compliance too costly through threats of force. However, it does not fully capture the framework's broader scope and the examination of various causal conditions.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive and accurate statement of how the Ideal Policy framework provides an analytical framework for practitioners' success is:\n\nC. The Ideal Policy provides an expansive framework, firstly for the examination of a maximum number of probable causal conditions and secondly to make the conditions applicable to the contextual factors relating to the use of coercive diplomacy."
