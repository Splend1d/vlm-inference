Women look to context, whereas men appeal to neutral, abstract notions of justice.'\n\nDifference feminism argues that women and men have different experiences and perspectives, and that these differences should be taken into account in the development of policies and practices. The quote \"Women look to context, whereas men appeal to neutral, abstract notions of justice\" captures this idea by suggesting that women are more likely to consider the specific circumstances and experiences of individuals when making decisions, while men are more likely to rely on abstract principles and universal standards."
