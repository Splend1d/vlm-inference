The defendant purchased a ski mask and then went into the liquor store, put his gun into the face of the clerk, and demanded the money from the register. Terrified, the clerk gave him the money from the register. The defendant pocketed the money, grabbed a bottle of tequila off the shelf for his celebration, and then ran back to the car and drove off. About an hour later, the defendant was slowly approaching his hideout in the outskirts of town when a young child suddenly darted in front of the defendant's car. He applied the brakes but couldn't stop in time. The car struck the child, killing her. For the child's death, the defendant should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Felony murder.\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\nC. Voluntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

Felony murder**.\n\nFelony murder is a legal doctrine that holds a person criminally responsible for a death that occurs during the commission of a felony, even if the death was not intended. In this case, the defendant committed a robbery, which is a felony, and during the commission of that robbery, a death occurred. Therefore, the defendant is subject to the felony murder rule."
