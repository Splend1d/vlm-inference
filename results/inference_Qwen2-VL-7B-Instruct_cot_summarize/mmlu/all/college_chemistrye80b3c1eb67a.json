Therefore, the titration results are not accurate.\n\n**Precision**:\nThe standard deviation of the titrations (0.001 M) is a measure of how close the individual results are to each other. A standard deviation of 0.001 M indicates that the results are very close to each other, suggesting high precision.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Precise but not accurate"
