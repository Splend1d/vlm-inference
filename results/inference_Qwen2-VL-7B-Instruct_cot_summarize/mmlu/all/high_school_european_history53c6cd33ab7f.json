It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nWhat was the primary impact of \"Humanism ceas[ing] to be the exclusive privilege of the few\"?\n\nA. The populous demanded rights from the state.\nB. People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.\nC. Latin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.\nD. European literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the primary impact of \"Humanism ceas[ing] to be the exclusive privilege of the few,\" we need to carefully analyze the context and the information provided in the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses Erasmus's work, the Adagia, and its influence on the spread of humanism. It mentions that Erasmus introduced the classic spirit to the people, not just to the educated classes. This suggests that the primary impact was the broader dissemination of humanist ideas and knowledge.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The populous demanded rights from the state.\n- This, the passage does not mention any direct demand for rights from the populace. It focuses on the spread of humanist ideas.\n\nB. People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.\n- This, the passage implies that the spread of humanist ideas would allow people to question the Church more widely. This is a plausible impact of the broader dissemination of humanist ideas.\n\nC. Latin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.\n- While the passage mentions that Erasmus wrote in Latin, it does not state that Latin replaced vulgar languages. It focuses on the spread of humanist ideas.\n\nD. European literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity.\n- This, the passage does not mention stagnation in literature. It focuses on the spread of humanist ideas and the influence of Erasmus's work.\n\nGiven the passage's emphasis on the broader dissemination of humanist ideas, the most accurate answer is:\n\nB. People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale."
