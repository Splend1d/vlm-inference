This is because the homeowner wrongfully terminated the contract, and the builder was not able to complete the project as planned. The builder's actual loss is the cost of the materials and labor already expended, which is $10,000 ($9,000 for framing and $1,000 for materials not yet incorporated into the greenhouse). The builder's expected profit on the project is the additional $5,000 that the builder would have made if the project had been completed. Therefore, the builder's total loss is $15,000 ($10,000 for materials and labor already expended and $5,000 for the expected profit). However, the builder also also resold the unused materials that he had already purchased for the greenhouse to another contractor for $1,000, which is a loss avoided by the breach. So, the builder's actual loss is $14,000 ($15,000 total loss minus $1,000 loss avoided by the resale of of the unused materials). Therefore, the builder is likely to recover $14,000, which is the total cost expended by the builder ($10,000) plus the builder's expected profit ($5,000), minus the loss avoided by the resale of of the unused materials ($1,000)."
