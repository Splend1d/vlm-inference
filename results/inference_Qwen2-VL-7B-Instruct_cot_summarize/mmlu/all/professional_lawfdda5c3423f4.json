In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees. Before the professor had paid the rancher and taken his deed, the professor visited the farm and observed the fence. However, the teacher was not present when the professor visited the property, and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094f anyone \u0080\u0094was using it. In any case, the professor did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. The professor then recorded the deed. Note: This jurisdiction uses Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Indices and has no Tract IndexThe jurisdiction's recording act provides: \"Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded. \"In 2008, in an action to quiet title to the farm, which of the following parties would have priority of title?\n\nA. The professor.\nB. The investor.\nC. The teacher.\nD. The rancher.\n"

                    "text": "In this scenario, we need to determine which party would have priority of title to the farm based on the given facts and the jurisdiction's recording act. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Priority of of Title**: The priority of of title is determined by the date of recording of the deed.\n2. **Recording Act**: The jurisdiction's recording act states that every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.\n\nLet's analyze each party's claim:\n\n- **Professor**: Purchased in 2007 for $25,000, recorded the deed in 2007.\n- **Investor**: Purchased in 1998 for $10,000, recorded the deed in 1998.\n- **Teacher**: Purchased in 1998 for $20,000, recorded the deed in 1998.\n- **Rancher**: Purchased in 1999 for $15,000, did not record the deed.\n\nBased on the recording act, the deed must be recorded to be effective against subsequent purchasers in good faith. The investor and the teacher both recorded their deeds in 1998, which is prior to the professor's purchase in 2007. The rancher did not record the deed, so it is void against subsequent purchasers.\n\nTherefore, the priority of of title would be:\n\n- **Investor**: Purchased in 1998, recorded in 1998.\n- **Teacher**: Purch purchase in 1998, recorded in 1998.\n- **Professor**: Purch purchase in 2007, recorded in 2007.\n\nSince the investor and the teacher both recorded their deeds in 1998, they have priority over the professor. However, the investor purchased the farm first (in 1998) and recorded it first ( in 1998), so the investor would have priority of title.\n\nThus, the correct answer is the investor.\n\n**Final Answer: B. The investor.**"
