This is not correct because it does not capture the \"or\" part correctly.\n\nC. \\( (H \u2228 ~G) \u2283 J \\)\n- This option correctly represents the sentence as \"If either Harry enrolls or George does not enroll, then Jim enrolls.\"\n\nD. \\( (H \u2283 ~G) \u2228 J \\)\n- This option suggest that if Harry enrolls, then George does not enroll, and Jim enrolls.
