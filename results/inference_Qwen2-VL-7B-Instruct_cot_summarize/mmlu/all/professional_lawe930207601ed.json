As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?\n\nA. He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\nB. He intended only to wound the friend.\nC. He was unaware of the elements of malice.\nD. The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the defendant's best defense, we need to analyze the elements of first-degree murder as defined by the relevant statutes and see which option would most effectively negate those elements.\n\nFirst-degree murder, as defined by Section 169, requires:\n1. The unlawful and intentional killing of a human being.\n2. With malice aforethought.\n\nSection 170 specifies that malice is expressed when there is a deliberate intention to take away the life of another.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.**\n   - This option suggests that the defendant's intent was to harm the friend, not the daughter. If true, it would negate the element of malice because there was no deliberate intention to take the life of the daughter.\n\nB. **He intended only to wound the friend.**\n   - This option suggests that the defendant's intent was to injure the friend, not to kill. While this might mitigate the severity of the crime, it does not negate the element of malice because the intent to harm another person is still present.\n\nC. **He was unaware of the elements of malice.**\n   - This option suggests that the defendant was unaware of the legal definition of malice. However, ignorance of the law does not negate the intent or the act itself. The defendant's state of mind regarding malice is irrelevant to the charge of first-degree murder.\n\nD. **The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.**\n   - This option suggests that the defendant's act was a result of negligence. While this might mitigate the severity of the crime, it does not negate the element of of malice because the defendant still intended to harm the friend.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best defense would be:\n\n**A. He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.**\n\nThis option directly negates the element of malice, as it would show that the defendant did not have the deliberate intention to take the life of the daughter."
