The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is the radius at which the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, and for a black hole of the same mass as the Sun, this radius would be approximately 3,000 kilometers. \n\nGiven this Schwarzschild radius, the black hole would have a strong gravitational pull, which would affect the orbits of the planets. The planets would not move directly toward the black hole, as they would be unable to escape the gravitational pull. Instead, they would be pulled into the black hole, and their orbits would be disrupted.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. The planets would move in spiral orbits."
