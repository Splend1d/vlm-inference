Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?\n\nA. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.\nB. The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.\nC. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\nD. The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.\n"

In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\n\nHydrangea flowers exhibit a phenomenon known as environmental plasticity, where the expression of a trait (\u2014 in this case, flower color\u2014can vary depending on the environmental conditions. The type of soil in which the plant is grown can influence the pH level, which in turn affects the color of of the flowers. This is a classic example of how environmental factors can alter the phenotype of an organism without changing the genotype."
