                    "text": "In this scenario, the priority of of the claims will be determined based on the nature and timing of the security interests and the financing contingency in the contract of sale.\n\n1. **Financing Contingency**: The contract of sale contained a financing contingency for a certain percentage of the purchase price. This means that the buyer was required to secure financing for a portion of the purchase price before the closing could occur.\n\n2. **Bank's Loan**: The buyer obtained the requisite financing from a bank and used the bank loan proceeds to apply to the purchase price of the property. The bank promptly recorded its mortgage, which indicates that the bank's loan was secured by a purchase money mortgage.\n\n3. **Seller's Note**: The buyer executed a note to the seller for a portion of the purchase price, which note was not secured by a mortgage. The bank had actual knowledge of the prior note to the seller.\n\n4. **Priority of Claims**: The priority of claims is determined by the timing and nature of the security interests. In this case, the bank's loan was secured by a purchase money mortgage, which typically has priority over other claims.\n\nGiven these points, the bank's loan, secured by a purchase money mortgage, has priority over the seller's note, which was not secured by a mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The bank, because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage."
