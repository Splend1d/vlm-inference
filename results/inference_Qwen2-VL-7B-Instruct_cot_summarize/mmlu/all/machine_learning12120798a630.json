The use of prior distributions on the parameters in a probabilistic model.**\n\nBayesian statisticians incorporate prior distributions to reflect existing knowledge or beliefs about the parameters before seeing the data. This approach allows for the updating of these beliefs as new data is observed, leading to posterior distributions that combine the prior knowledge with the information from the data.\n\nFrequentists statisticians, on the other hand, do not use prior distributions. Instead, they focus on the properties of estimators and tests under repeated sampling from the same population. Frequentists methods are based on the idea of long-run frequencies and do not incorporate subjective beliefs about parameters.\n\nTherefore, the use of prior distributions is a fundamental point of disagreement between the two approaches."
