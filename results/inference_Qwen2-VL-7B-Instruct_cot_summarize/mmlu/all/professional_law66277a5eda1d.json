By the terms of the lease, the tenant expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the student would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. The student failed to pay the taxes on the property. The new owner, after paying the taxes, brought suit against the student for the amount paid. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the new owner.\nB. the student, because he did not contract with the tenant to pay the taxes on the property.\nC. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not \"run with the land,\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.\nD. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and does not \"run with the land. \"\n"

However, the covenant to pay taxes is a condition that must be fulfilled by the tenant for the lease to continue. When the tenant assigns the lease to the student, the covenant to pay taxes does not automatically transfer to the new lessee unless there is a clear expression of intent in the assignment agreement. Since the assignment agreement was silent on the payment of taxes, the covenant to pay taxes does not \"run with the land\" to the new owner. Therefore, the new owner is not liable for the unpaid taxes, and the judgment should be for the student."
