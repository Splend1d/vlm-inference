Therefore, this pair will result in overflow.\n\nB. 00000001, 10000000\n- Adding these two numbers: 00000001 + 10000000 = 10000001\n- The result is 10000001, which is within the range of 127. Therefore, this pair will not result in overflow.\n\nC. 11111111, 10000001\n- Adding these two numbers: 11111111 + 10000001 = 101111110\n- Since the result is 101111110, which is 254 in decimal, it exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an 8-bit two's-complement number (127. Therefore, this pair will result in overflow.\n\nD. 10000001, 10101010\n- Adding these two numbers: 10000001 + 10101010 = 101010111\n- Since the result is 101010111, which is 259 in decimal, it exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an 8-bit two's-complement number (127. Therefore, this pair will result in overflow.\n\nSo, the pairs that will result in overflow are:\n\nA. 11111111, 00000001\nC. 11111111, 10000001\nD. 10000001, 10101010"
