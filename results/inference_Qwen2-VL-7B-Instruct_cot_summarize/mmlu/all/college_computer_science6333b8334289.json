It does not help us determine the condition under which one takes less time than the other.\n\nC. x > y\n- This option does not help us determine the condition under which one takes less time than the other.\n\nD. 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z\n- This is the correct condition because it directly relates to the inequality we derived. It ensures that the total time for N_1N_2N_3 is less than the total time for N_1(N_2 N_3).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z"
