This exchange is more likely to occur between genes loci that are relatively close to each other on the same chromosome, such as those on the X chromosome in females ( (situation C). \n\nIn contrast, situations A, B, and D involve genes loci that are either on the same chromosome but far apart or on different chromosomes, which are less likely to undergo crossover."
