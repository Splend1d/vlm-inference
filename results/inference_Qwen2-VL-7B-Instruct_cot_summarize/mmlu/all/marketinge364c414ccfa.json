Conceptual equivalence: This refers to ensuring that the meaning of a concept or idea is the same across different cultures or languages. It involves understanding how a concept is perceived and understood in different contexts.\n\nB. Functional equivalence: This involves ensuring that the product or service functions in the same way across different markets. It is about making sure that the product or service meets the same needs and performs the same functions in different cultural settings.\n\nC. Translation equivalence: This refers to the process of translating content from one language to another while maintaining the original meaning and context. It is about ensuring that the translated text is understandable and conveys the same message as the original.\n\nD. Market equivalence: This is not one of the equivalences. Market equivalence is not a recognized term in the context of international market research. Instead, the focus is on ensuring that the research methods, concepts, and data are comparable across different markets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Market equivalence."
