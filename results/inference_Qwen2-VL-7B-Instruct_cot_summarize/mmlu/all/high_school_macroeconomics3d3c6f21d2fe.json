This relationship is often depicted as a downward-sloping curve.\n\nLet's analyze each option to determine which one creates the trade-off depicted by the Phillips curve:\n\nA. A rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve\n- A rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve indicates an increase in the supply of at each price level. This typically leads to lower prices and higher unemployment, not the trade-off between inflation and unemployment.\n\nB. An increase in input costs that corresponds with an increase in unemployment\n- An increase in input costs generally leads to higher prices and lower output. This does not directly relate to the trade-off between inflation and unemployment as described by the Phillips curve.\n\nC. An increase in output that corresponds with a decrease in the price level\n- An increase in output generally leads to higher prices and lower unemployment. This does not directly relate to the trade-off between inflation and unemployment as described by the Phillips curve.\n\nD. A rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve\n- A rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve indicates an increase in demand at each price level. This typically leads to higher prices and lower unemployment, which is the trade-off depicted by the Phillips curve.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. A rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve"
