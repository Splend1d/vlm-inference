In a jurisdiction that follows the common law with respect to criminal offenses, of what crime can the man properly be convicted?\n\nA. Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse.\nB. Larceny, because he made no threat to use force.\nC. Robbery, because he physically took the purse from the woman's presence.\nD. Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse.\n"

Robbery, because he physically took the purse from the woman's presence.**\n\nRobbery is typically defined as the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force and/or by deception. In this case, the man took the purse from the woman's presence, which constitutes the act of taking the property. The fact that he did not use force initially but used force to push the woman out of the way and run away with the purse does not negate the initial act of taking the purse from her presence. Therefore, the man's actions meet the criteria for robbery."
