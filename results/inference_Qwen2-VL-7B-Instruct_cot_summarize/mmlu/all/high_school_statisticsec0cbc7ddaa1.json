The smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models.\n\nThe 68-95-99.7 Rule, also known as the empirical rule, applies specifically to the normal distribution. It states that for a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% falls within two standard deviations, and 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. This rule does not apply to t-distributions, which are used when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. As the degrees of freedom ( (df) increase, the t-distribution approaches the shape of the normal distribution. Therefore, the 68-95-99.7 Rule is not applicable to t-distributions, regardless of the df."
