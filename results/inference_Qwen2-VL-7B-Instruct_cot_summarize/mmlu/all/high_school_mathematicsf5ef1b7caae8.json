In particular, the graph of $y=f(x)$ lies below the line segment connecting $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$. This means that for any $x$ between $-2$ and $2$, we have $f(x) < \\frac{9-5}{2-(-2)}(x-(-2)) + 5 = 2x+5$. In particular, $f(1) < 2(1)+5 = 7$. Therefore, the range of all possible values for $f(1)$ is $\\boxed{(-\\ininfty, 7)}$. The answer is: D. (-inf, 7)"
