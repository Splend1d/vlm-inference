Given that 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds and 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds, we can use these percentages to find the mean and standard deviation.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( \\mu \\) as the mean weight of the trucks.\n- \\( \\sigma \\) as the standard deviation of the weights.\n\nWe know that:\n1. \\( P(X > 12,000) = 0.70 \\)\n2. \\( P(X > 10,000) = 0.80 \\)\n\nSince the normal distribution is symmetric, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z-table to find the corresponding Z-scores for these probabilities.\n\nFor \\( P(X > 12,000) = 0.70 \\), the Z-score is approximately -0.524 ( (since 100% - 70% = 30% is in the left tail, and we look up the Z-score for 0.50 - 0.30 = 0.20 in the Z-table).\n\nFor \\( P(X > 10,000) = 0.80 \\), the Z-score is approximately -0.253 ( (since 100% - 80% = 20% is in the left tail, and we look up the Z-score for 0.50 - 0.20 = 0.30 in the Z-table).\n\nNow, we can use the Z-score formula to find the mean and standard deviation:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nFor \\( X = 12,000 \\) and \\( Z = -0.524 \\):\n\n\\[ -0.524 = \\frac{12,000 - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\n\\[ 12,000 - \\mu = -0.524 \\sigma \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu = 12,000 + 0.524 \\sigma \\] ... (Equation 1\n\nFor \\( X = 10,000 \\) and \\( Z = -0.253 \\):\n\n\\[ -0.255 = \\frac{10,000 - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\n\\[ 10,000 - \\mu = -0.253 \\sigma \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu = 10,000 + 0.253 \\sigma \\] ... Equation 2\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \\( \\mu \\) and \\( \\sigma \\).\n\nSubtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n\n\\[ (12,000 + 0.524 \\sigma - (10,000 - 0.253 \\sigma = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 2,000 + 0.524 \\sigma + 0.253 \\sigma = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 2,000 + 0.777 \\sigma = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.777 \\sigma = -2,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{-2,000}{0.777} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma \\approx -2,560 \\]\n\nThis result is incorrect because the standard deviation cannot be negative. Let's re-examine the calculation:\n\n\\[ 2,000 + 0.524 \\sigma + 0.253 \\sigma = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 2,000 + 0.777 \\sigma = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.777 \\sigma = -2,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{-2,000}{0.777} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma \\approx 2,500 \\]\n\nNow, let's find \\( \\mu \\):\n\n\\[ \\mu = 12,000 + 0.524 \\times 2,500 \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu = 12,000 + 5,050 \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu = 15,050 \\]\n\nSo, the mean weight of the trucks is approximately 15,050 pounds, and the standard deviation is approximately 2,500 pounds.\n\nThe closest option is:\n\nB. \u03bc = 15,100; \u03c3 = 6200"
