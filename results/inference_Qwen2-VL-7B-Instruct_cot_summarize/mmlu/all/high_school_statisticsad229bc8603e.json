By the law of large numbers, the next toss is more likely to be an odd number than another even number.\nB. Based on the properties of conditional probability the next toss is more likely to be an even number given that three in a row have been even.\nC. Dice actually do have memories, and thus the number that comes up on the next toss will be influenced by the previous tosses.\nD. The probability that the next toss will again be even is 0.5.\n"
