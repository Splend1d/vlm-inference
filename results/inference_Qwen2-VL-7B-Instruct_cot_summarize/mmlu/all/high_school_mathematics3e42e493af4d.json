There are 3 such outcomes: all apples, all oranges, or all bananas.\n\nTherefore, the number of outcomes where Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruit is $27 - 3 = 24$.\n\nSo, the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit is $\\frac{24}{27} = \\frac{8}{9}$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{B}}$."
