A stratified random sample provides information about each stratum in the population as well as an estimate for the population as a whole, and a simple random sample does not.\n\nStratified random sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups (or strata, and then randomly sampling from each stratum. This method can provide more precise estimates of population parameters because it ensures that all important subgroups are represented in the sample. Simple random sampling, on the other hand, does not involve dividing the population into strata, and thus may not adequately represent all subgroups, potentially leading to biased estimates."
