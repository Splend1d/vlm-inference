The defendant may not introduce evidence of truthfulness unless it is inquired into on cross-examination.\n\nIn the context of a trial, character evidence is generally not admissible to prove conduct in a particular instance. However, there are exceptions to this rule. One such exception is when the prosecution has introduced evidence of the defendant's bad character or propensity to commit the crime in question. In such a case, the defendant may introduce evidence of good character to rebut the prosecution's case. This is known as the \"rebuttal\" rule. \n\nIn this case, the prosecution has objected to the introduction of evidence of the defendant's good character. Therefore, the defendant may not introduce evidence of truthfulness unless it is inquired into on cross-examination."
