They are often used in situations where we need to quickly find an element based on a key. However, hash tables are not always the best choice for all problems. For example, they are not the best choice for range search. In a range search, we need to find all the records whose key value is in a certain range. This is a problem that is not well suited for hash tables because hash tables are designed to find a single element based on a key, not a range of elements."
