When a preliminary injunction hearing could not be scheduled within the original 14-day period, the court extended the TRO for another 30 days. The lender appealed the court's order extending the TRO. The homeowner has moved to dismiss the appeal. Is the appellate court likely to dismiss the appeal?\n\nA. No, because a TRO is immediately appealable.\nB. No, because the 30-day extension makes the TRO equivalent to a preliminary injunction and therefore appealable.\nC. Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\nD. Yes, because there is no final judgment from which an appeal may be taken.\n"

Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\n\nA temporary restraining order (TRO is generally not considered a final judgment and therefore is not immediately appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute. The statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b, allows for appeals of certain interlocutory orders, but a TRO is typically not one of the orders that falls under this category. The extension of the TRO does not change its status as a TRO, and thus it is not appealable. Therefore, the appellate court is likely to dismiss the appeal."
