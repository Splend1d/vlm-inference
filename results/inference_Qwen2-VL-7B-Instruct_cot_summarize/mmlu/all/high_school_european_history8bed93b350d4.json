In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following religions that started around the same time as Calvinism was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism?\n\nA.

Huguenots - The Huguenots were a French Protestant group that emerged in the 16th century. They were persecuted for their religious beliefs, but they were not destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism.\n\nB. Lutherans - The Lutheran Church was founded by Martin Luther in the 16th century. Lutherans did not support adult baptism and pacifism, and they were not destroyed for these beliefs.\n\nC. Presbyterians - The Presbyterian Church was founded in the 17th century, later than Calvinism. Therefore, they did not start around the same time as Calvinism.\n\nD. Anabaptists - The Anabaptists movement emerged in the 16th century, around the same time as Calvinism. They were known for their support of adult baptism and pacifism, and they were persecuted and sometimes destroyed for these beliefs.\n\nGiven the information, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Anabaptist"
