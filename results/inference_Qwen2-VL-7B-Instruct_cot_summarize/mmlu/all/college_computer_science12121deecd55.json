An Euler circuit exists in an undirected graph if and only if the graph is connected and every vertex has an even degree.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. A complete graph with 12 vertices:\n- A complete graph is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.\n- A complete graph with 12 vertices has 12 vertices and \\(\\binom{12}{2} = 66\\) edges.\n- In a complete graph, every vertex has a degree of \\(11\\) ( (since each vertex is connected to every other vertex).\n- Since all vertices have an even degree ( (11 is odd), this graph does not have an Euler circuit.\n\nII. A complete graph with 13 vertices:\n- A complete graph with 13 vertices has 13 vertices and \\(\\binom{13}{2} = 78\\) edges.\n- In a complete graph, every vertex has a degree of \\(12\\) ( (since each vertex is connected to every other vertex).\n- Since all vertices have an even degree ( (12 is even), this graph has an Euler circuit.\n\nIII. A tree with 13 vertices:\n- A tree is a connected graph with no cycles and \\(n-1\\) edges, where \\(n\\) is the number of vertices.\n- A tree with 13 vertices has \\(13 - 1 = 12\\) edges.\n- In a tree, the degrees of the vertices are either 1 or 2 ( (since it has no cycles).\n- Since not all vertices have an even degree ( (some vertices have degree 1 and some have degree 2), this graph does not have an Euler circuit.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only graph that must have an Euler circuit is:\n\nII. A complete graph with 13 vertices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. II only"
