The June, July, and August shipments were delivered on time and duly paid for. Then, on August 16, the lumber mill informed the store that the mill would not be able to meet the September 1 delivery date, because its lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill then asked the store to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment failed to arrive, the store immediately brought suit for breach of contract. How would the court hold?\n\nA. Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.\nB. Judgment for the store, because the mill should have foreseen such a contingency occurring.\nC. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.\nD. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.\n"

Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.\n\nThe court would likely hold that the lumber mill's duties of performance would not be excused due to the forest fire. The store had a reasonable expectation that the mill would continue to deliver the plywood on time, and the mill's failure to do so constitutes a breach of contract. The court would likely find that the mill's failure to deliver the plywood on time was a material breach of the contract, and the store is entitled to damages for the breach."
