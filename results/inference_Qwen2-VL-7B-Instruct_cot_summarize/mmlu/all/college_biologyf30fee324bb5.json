Eukarya utilize the general transcription factors TBP (TATA-binding protein) and TFIIB in transcription, whereas Bacteria do not. At least one member of Archaea has a protein similar to TBP and a protein similar to TFIIB. Based on this observation, which of the following scenarios is most likely?\n\nA. Archaea and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Bacteria.\nB. Archaea and Bacteria diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Eukarya.\nC.

This is consistent with the observation that the proteins similar to TBP and TFIIB are found in Archaea, indicating a shared ancestor with Eukarya.\n   - **Option B**: Archaea and Bacteria diverge after their common ancestor diverges from Eukarya.\n     - This option suggests that the divergence of Archaea and Bacteria occurred after the divergence of Eukarya. However, this contradicts the observation that the proteins similar to TBP and TFIIB are found in Archaea, indicating a shared ancestor with Eukarya.\n   - **Option C**: Bacteria and Eukarya diverge after their common ancestor diverges from Archaea.\n     - This option suggests that the divergence of Bacteria and Eukarya occurred after the divergence of Archaea. This is consistent with the observation that the proteins similar to TBP and TFIIB are found in Archaea, indicating a shared ancestor with Eukarya.\n   - **Option D**: Archaea, Eukarya, and Bacteria diverge simultaneously from a common ancestor.\n     - This option suggests that all three domains diverged at the same time. However, the observation that the proteins similar to TBP and TFIIB are found in Archaea, indicating a shared ancestor with Eukarya, contradicts this option.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely scenario is:\n\n**Option A**: Archaea and Eukarya diverge after their common ancestor diverges from Bacteria."
