The P generation mother is X-X.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily supported by the pedigree. The P generation mother could be either X-X or X-Y, depending on whether she is affected or not. The information provided does not specify her genotype.\n\n   **B. The P generation father is X-Y.**\n   - This statement is also not necessarily supported by the pedigree. The P generation father could be either X-X or X-Y, depending on whether he is affected or not. The information provided does not specify his genotype.\n\n   **C. If parents 1 and 2 in row II have another child, the chance that the child would be afflicted with alkaptonuria is 25%.**\n   - This statement is supported by the pedigree. Since alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive trait, the chance of having an affected child ( (X) from two carriers ( (X-X and X-Y) is 25% ( (1/4).\n\n   **D. The genotype of woman 1 is X-X.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily supported by the pedigree. The genotype of woman 1 could be either X-X or X-Y, depending on whether she is affected or not. The information provided does not specify her genotype.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe statement that is supported by the information given in the pedigree is:\n\n**C. If parents 1 and 2 in row II have another child, the chance that the child would be afflicted with alkaptonuria is 25%.**"
