H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which results from the crystalline framework that forms due to hydrogen bonds.\n\nIn the phase diagram for water, the negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line indicates that as the temperature decreases ( (the solid phase ( ice) forms at lower pressures. This is because the crystalline structure of ice is less dense than the liquid water, which is due to the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. These hydrogen bonds form a three-dimensional network in ice, which is less dense than the random arrangement of water molecules in liquid water. Therefore, ice forms at lower pressures as the temperature decreases, which is why the line slopes downward on the phase diagram."
