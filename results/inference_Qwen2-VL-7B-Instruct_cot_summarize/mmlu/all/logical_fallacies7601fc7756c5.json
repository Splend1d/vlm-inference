The speaker acknowledges that discrimination is a natural part of human behavior, such as in food, music, and friendships, but then argues that laws against discrimination are unnecessary because discrimination is inevitable. This inconsistency is evident because the speaker cannot logically maintain that discrimination is both a natural part of human behavior and something that should be prohibited by law."
