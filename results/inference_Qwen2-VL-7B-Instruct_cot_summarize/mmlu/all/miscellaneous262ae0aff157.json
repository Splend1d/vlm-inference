Lower feed efficiency\n\nThis is because the return per $100 of feed fed has decreased from $151 to $130. If feed costs were stable, the lower return suggests that the hogs are not converting feed into meat as efficiently as before. This could be due to various factors such as changes in the hogs' health, diet, or management practices."
