Elastic demand refers to a situation where a small change in price leads to a relatively large change in the quantity demanded. This is often seen in highly differentiated products where consumers have many alternatives. White Ford minivans are a specific specific type of vehicle, and there are many other minivans available on the market, making it easier for consumers to switch to a different model or brand if the price of white Ford minivans increases. \n\nIn contrast, options B, C, and D represent more general categories of goods. The demand for automobiles, Ford automobiles, and American-made automobiles is likely to be less elastic because there are fewer substitutes available within these categories. Consumers may be less likely to switch to a different type of car if the price of Ford automobiles increases, for example, because they may not have many other options that meet their needs."
