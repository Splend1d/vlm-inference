It had a contingency clause requiring him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time. It said that time was of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion as to whether he would qualify. The seller told the purchaser that she rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?\n\nA. Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.\nB. Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval \u0080\u0093 the first notice communicated is the effective one.\nC. No, because the amount of time that he was late was a \"de minimus\" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.\nD. No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.\n"

This means that the completion of the mortgage application was a critical condition for the sale to proceed.\n\n2. **Purchaser's Failure**: The purchaser failed to make the mortgage application within the agreed time. This failure is a breach of the contingency clause, which means the sale is subject to rescission.\n\n3. **Selling's Right to Rescind**: The seller has the right to rescind the sale if the purchaser fails to meet the conditions specified in the contingency clause. The seller's rescission is valid because the purchaser did not meet the condition of making a completed mortgage application within the specified time.\n\n4. **Subsequent Approval**: The purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but this does not negate the initial breach of the contingency clause. The approval is a subsequent event and does not affect the validity of the rescission.\n\n5. **Legal Precedents**: In many jurisdictions, a breach of a contingency clause can lead to the rescission of the contract, even if the subsequent events (like approval of a mortgage application, might seem favorable to the seller.\n\nTherefore, the seller is likely to prevail in rescinding the transaction because the purchaser failed to meet the critical condition of the mortgage application within the agreed time, and the rescission was made prior to the approval of the mortgage application."
