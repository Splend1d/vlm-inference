                    "text": "To determine which intellectual trend the passage exemplifies, let's analyze the content and context of the passage by Albert Camus.\n\nThe passage discusses the idea of meaning in life and the limitations of human understanding. Camus questions whether there is a transcendent meaning that exists beyond human comprehension and acknowledges that understanding meaning is limited to human terms. This reflects a modernist tendency to question traditional values and the validity of faith-based moralities.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. A postwar reassertion of traditional religious values - This option suggests a return to traditional religious values, which is not the focus of the passage. The passage does not discuss a resurgence of religious values.\n\nB. An expression of patriotic pride thanks to victory in World War II - This option suggests a sense of national pride following the war, which is not relevant to the passage's focus on existential questions and human understanding.\n\nC. A modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities - This option aligns with the passage's questioning of transcendent meaning and the limitations of human understanding, which is characteristic of modernist thought.\n\nD. An increased willingness to embrace radical Marxism - This option suggests a shift towards radical Marxism, which is not discussed in the passage. The passage does not address political ideologies.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage best exemplifies a modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities.\n\nFinal answer: C. A modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities"
