CT scan of the abdomen\n\nA CT scan of the abdomen is the most appropriate imaging study to evaluate for possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as gallstones, pancreatitis, or other abdominal conditions. The patient's history of intermittent nausea, abdominal pain, and the timing of the symptoms after eating suggest that these symptoms could be related to gastrointestinal issues. The CT scan can provide detailed images of the abdominal organs and help identify any underlying causes of the patient's symptoms."
