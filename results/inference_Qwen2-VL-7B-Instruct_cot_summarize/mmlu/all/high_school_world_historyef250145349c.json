This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid.

                    "text": "To determine the best inference for why the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line, let's analyze the context and the treaty itself.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas was a 1494 agreement between Spain and Portugal to divide the newly discovered lands outside Europe. The line was drawn to ensure that Portugal would have control over lands to the east, while Spain would have control over lands to the west. The treaty was motivated by the desire to secure Spanish access to the wealth and resources of the New World, particularly the Americas.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The Spanish desired to convert the Barbary states to Catholicism.\n- This is not directly related to the division of the New World. The Barbary states were North African coastal regions, not part of the New World.\n\nB. The Spanish believed Portugal did not know about their discovery of the New World.\n- This This is incorrect. The Spanish knew about Portugal's discoveries and were trying to secure their own claims.\n\nC. The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.\n- This This is a plausible inference. By controlling the western lands, Spain could maintain a buffer zone against Portuguese expansion, which would help protect their interests and influence in the New World.\n\nD. The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World.\n- This This is not directly relevant to the division of the New World. The focus of the treaty was on the Americas, not India.\n\nGiven the context of the treaty and the need to secure Spanish interests in the New World, the best inference is:\n\nC. The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.\n\nFinal answer: C."
