Fine's response to Wellman's argument would likely be that the liberal state cannot claim to be primarily an intimate or expressive association. This is because the liberal state is supposed to protect the rights and freedoms of its citizens, and excluding individuals from certain rights or privileges would be a violation of those rights. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
