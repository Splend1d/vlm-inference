In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High\u2014the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere\u2014its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood\u2014of 'peace and good will amongst men.'\"\nJohn L.

                    "text": "To determine which principle best states the principle described in the passage, let's analyze the context and core message of the passage by John L. O'Sullivan.\n\nThe passage describes a vision of America's future greatness, emphasizing its destiny to manifest divine principles, establish a sacred temple, and govern itself according to natural and moral laws of equality and brotherhood. It envisions a future where America will be a beacon of excellence and a model for the rest of the world.\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\nA. Colonists were destined to leave the British Empire because of the distance between the New World and England.\n- This option refers to the idea of the distance between the New World and England leading to the colonists's desire to leave the British Empire. While this may be true, it does not capture the broader vision of America's future greatness and divine principles.\n\nB. Women are biologically predestined to lives of child rearing and domestic labor.\n- This option discusses the biological roles of women, which is not relevant to the passage's vision of America's future greatness and divine principles.\n\nC. America's expansion to the West Coast was inevitable and divinely sanctioned.\n- This option alignss with the passage's idea of America's destiny to expand and manifest divine principles. It captures the notion of America's expansion being divinely sanctioned.\n\nD. The abolition of slavery in the United States was certain to come about because slavery was immoral.\n- This option discusses the moral aspect of slavery, which is relevant but does not capture the broader vision of America's future greatness and divine principles.\n\nGiven the analysis, the principle that best states the principle described above is:\n\nC. America's expansion to the West Coast was inevitable and divinely sanctioned."
