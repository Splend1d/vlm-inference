Every field is indeed a ring because a field is a set equipped with two operations (addition and multiplication, which satisfy the field axioms, including the ring axioms. Therefore, every field is a ring.\n\nStatement 2 is False. Not every ring has a multiplicative identity. A ring with a multiplicative identity is called a ring with unity or a unital ring. There are rings that do not have a multiplicative identity, such as the ring of of all integers, where there is no element that acts as a multiplicative identity because no integer multiplied by any other integer gives 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
