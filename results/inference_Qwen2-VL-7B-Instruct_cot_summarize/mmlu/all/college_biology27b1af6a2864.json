This is because the hypothesis is centered around the ants' role in defending the plant from these insects.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.**\n   - This experiment directly tests the hypothesis by removing the ants and observing if the leaf damage increases, indicating that the ants are defending the plant from leaf-feeding insects.\n\nB. **Remove oil-rich bodies and measure subsequent ant density.**\n   - This experiment tests the relationship between the oil-rich bodies and ant density, but it does not directly test the ants' role in defending the plant from leaf-feeding insects.\n\nC. **Remove the thorns and measure subsequent density of ants.**\n   - This experiment tests the relationship between the thorns and ant density, but it does not directly test the ants' role in defending the plant from leaf-feeding insects.\n\nD. **Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.**\n   - This experiment tests the relationship between leaf-feeding insects and ant density, but it does not directly test the ants' role in defending the plant from these insects.\n\nTherefore, the best experiment to test the hypothesis is:\n\n**A. Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.**"
