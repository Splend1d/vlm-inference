The man was subsequently tried, convicted, and sentenced to a prison term for the burglary. Three years later, while the man was serving his prison sentence for the burglary, a police detective from a nearby town questioned him about an unsolved homicide. The detective did not know that the man had invoked Miranda at an earlier time. that the man had invoked Miranda at an earlier time. The man waived his Miranda rights and made several incriminating statements to the detective. When he was later charged with the homicide, the man moved to suppress these statements, claiming that his earlier refusal to waive his Miranda rights should have been honored. Should the court suppress the statements?\n\nA. No, because the detective was unaware that the man had originally invoked his Miranda rights.\nB. No, because the man's prior invocation of his Miranda rights did not preclude the later interrogation.\nC. Yes, because the man had earlier invoked his Miranda rights, and the police were not permitted to resume questioning, even after a time lapse of years.\nD. Yes, because the man was incarcerated, and his earlier invocation of his Miranda rights shielded him from further questioning until shielded him from further questioning until he was released.\n"

Once a person invokes their Miranda rights, the police must cease questioning until the individual waives their rights again. However, the Miranda rule does not prevent the police from resuming questioning after a sufficient time has passed, provided that the individual is not in custody at the time of the new interrogation. \n\nIn this case, the man was in prison for the burglary when the new interrogation took place.
