While CPUs were historically used for training large neural networks due to their lower cost and availability, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) have become the standard for training large neural networks due to their ability to perform many calculations in parallel. GPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive parallel computations required for training deep neural networks efficiently.\n\nStatement 2: \"The ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters.\"\n- This statement is generally true. The ResNet-50 model, which is a variant of the ResNet architecture, indeed has a very large number of parameters. The exact number of parameters can vary slightly depending on the specific implementation, but it is indeed in the billions.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
