For each type of interconnection of n processors, a figure of merit can be formed as the product of the number of links required for the network times the worst-case path length connecting any two processors.

For \\( n \\) processors, the number of links is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Worst-Case Path Length**: In a fully interconnected network, the worst-case path length is 1, because any two processors are directly connected.\n\n3. **Figure of Merit**: The figure of merit is the product of the number of links and the worst-case path length:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Figure of Merit} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Ring Network\n\n1. **Number of Links**: In a ring network, each processor is connected to two other processors. For \\( n \\) processors, the number of links is \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Worst-Case Path Length**: In a ring network, the worst-case path length is \\( n-1 \\), because the longest path is from one processor to the processor \\( n \\) away.\n\n3. **Figure of Merit**: The figure of merit is the product of the number of links and the worst-case path length:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Figure of Merit} = n \\times (n-1) = n(n-1)\n   \\]\n\n### Ratio of Figure of Merits\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network to that of the ring network:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}{n(n-1)} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]"
