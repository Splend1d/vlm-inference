This is because the area of a triangle is maximized when the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle at the vertex opposite the longest side.\n\nThe radius of the circle is 1, so the hypotenuse of the right triangle is 2 ( (the diameter of the circle). By the Pythagorean theorem, the other two sides of the right triangle are both 1. The area of the triangle is then $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo the greatest possible area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
