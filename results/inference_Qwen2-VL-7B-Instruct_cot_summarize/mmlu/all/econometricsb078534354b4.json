The PRF is a description of the process thought to be generating the data.\n\nThe population regression function (PRF) represents the theoretical relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables in the population. It is the model that we aim to estimate from the data. The sample regression function (SRF) is the estimated model based on the sample data, which is used to make inferences about the population regression function. The goodness of of the model can be determined by comparing the SRF and the PRF, but this is not a direct comparison between the two functions."
