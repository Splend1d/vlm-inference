She parked in the store's parking lot, and while walking toward the building two masked males assaulted and raped her. The lot was poorly lit, had no security personnel, and was frequented by gang members. The police had several incident reports in the past 12 months documenting prior criminal activities, including some personal robberies and assaults, in the lot. The store itself had even more reports than the police. The woman sued the store for her injuries, claiming that it breached its duty to make the premises reasonably safe for its customers. Will she likely prevail?\n\nA. Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers.\nB. No, the store owes no special duty of care to eliminate crime on the parking lot; it was up to the police to perform that task.\nC. No, the occurrence of a rape of a customer was not a foreseeable event and the store had no duty to try and discover that such a potential danger could exist.\nD. Yes, a store owner is the guarantor to every customer that he or she will be protected and safe when walking in the parking lot.\n"

No, the occurrence of a rape of a customer was not a foreseeable event and the store had no duty to try and discover that such a potential danger could exist.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman is likely to have a difficult time proving that the store breached its duty to make the premises reasonably safe for its customers. The store had no reason to foresee that a rape would occur in the parking lot, and it was not their responsibility to prevent crime in the area. The store's duty of care is limited to the safety of its premises, and it was not responsible for the actions of others in the parking lot."
