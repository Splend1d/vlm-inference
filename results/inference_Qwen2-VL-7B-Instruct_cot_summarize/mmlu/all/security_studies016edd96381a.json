They have also also helped to broaden the scope of security studies and to include a wider range of actors and interests in the analysis of security problems. The next generation of security studies scholars is likely to continue to engage with policy questions and to interact with policymakers and think tanks, as this has been a key aspect of the development of the field. The theoretical context of security studies is likely to continue to be shaped by the interaction between US and European thinkers, and the field is likely to continue to be located between the IR discipline and technical experts and practitioners."
