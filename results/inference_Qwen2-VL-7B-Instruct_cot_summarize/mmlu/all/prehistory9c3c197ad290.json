Burials contain bones indicating that people were segregated based on gender, stature, and personal capabilities, including artistic abilities.\n\nArchaeological evidence of social stratification and inequality often includes the differentiation in the treatment of burials. This can manifest in various ways, such as the presence of exotic grave goods, which are items that are not commonly found in the area and are often associated with wealth or status. When burials with exotic grave goods also also contain bones indicating that they engaged in less strenuous labor, it suggests a higher social status for those individuals. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that people with less strenuous labor were also also buried without exotic grave goods, which does not necessarily indicate social stratification.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that people with less strenuous labor were also also buried with exotic grave goods, which contradicts the idea of social stratification.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that all burials contain equal amounts of exotic grave goods, which does not indicate social stratification.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer as it indicates that people were segregated based on gender, stature, and personal capabilities, including artistic abilities, which is a clear sign of social stratification and inequality."
