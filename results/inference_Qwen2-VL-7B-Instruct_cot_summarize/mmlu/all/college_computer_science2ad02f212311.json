It divides memory into units of equal size.\n   - This statement is true. In a purely segmented memory system, memory is divided into units of equal size, which are called segments.\n\n II. It permits implementation of virtual memory.\n   - This statement is false. Virtual memory is a technique that allows a computer to use more memory than is physically available by using a combination of physical memory and disk space. This is not a property of a purely segmented memory system.\n\n III. It suffers from internal fragmentation.\n   - This statement is false. Internal fragmentation is a problem that occurs in contiguous memory allocation, where some memory is wasted because it is not allocated in contiguous blocks. Segmented memory systems do not suffer from internal fragmentation because memory is allocated in non-contiguous segments.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I only"
