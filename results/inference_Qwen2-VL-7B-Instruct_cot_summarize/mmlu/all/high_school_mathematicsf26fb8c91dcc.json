According to the problem, five years ago, a computer that worked half as fast as the current computer cost twice as much money. Therefore, the speed of the older computer was \\(\\frac{S}{2}\\), and its price was \\(2P\\).\n\nThe speed to price ratio for the current computer is \\(\\frac{S}{P}\\), and for the older computer, it is \\(\\frac{\\frac{S}{2}}{2P} = \\frac{S}{4P}\\).\n\nTo find the percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio that the current computer's speed to price ratio is, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{S}{P}}{\\frac{S}{4P}} \\times 100 = \\frac{4}{1} \\times 100 = 400\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the current computer's speed to price ratio is 400% of the older computer's speed to price ratio.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 400."
