The woman continued to take powerful pain medication for several weeks after she returned home. During her recovery, she offered to sell her car for $450 to her neighbor, who owned a house-cleaning service. The neighbor said, \"That's great! I need a car to transport all the people who work for me to their job sites.\" In fact, the woman's car was worth $3,000, and the neighbor knew this. He was also aware that the woman had undergone surgery and noted that she seemed \"out of it\" because of the medication she was taking. Several days later, the woman's son found out about the deal and contacted the neighbor, telling him that the woman would sell him the car, but for $3,450. The next day, when the neighbor tendered $450 and demanded that the woman give him the car, she refused. If the neighbor sues the woman for breach of contract, will he be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the contract was voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity.\nB. No, because the woman put nothing in writing.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor's reliance on the otherwise voidable contract made it enforceable.\nD. Yes, because the woman's offer and the neighbor's acceptance created an enforceable contract.\n"

Yes, because the neighbor's reliance on the otherwise voidable contract made it enforceable.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Voidable Contract Due to Incapacity**: The woman's apparent incapacity due to the pain medication she was taking could make the contract voidable. However, this does not necessarily mean the contract is void. It means the contract can be voidedable, which means it can be voidedable if the other party (the neighbor in this case\u2014relied on the contract and acted in good faith.\n\n2. **Reliance by the Neighbor**: The neighbor relied on the contract by accepting the offer and tendered the $450. This reliance is a critical factor in making the contract enforceable.\n\n3. **Enforcement of Voidable Contracts**: In many jurisdictions, a contract made by a person who is mentally incapacitated can be enforced if the other party has relied on the contract and acted in good faith. This is because the law recognizes that the person who is incapacitated should not be allowed to benefit from their incapacity by reneging on a contract they entered into.\n\nTherefore, the neighbor's reliance on the contract, coupled with the fact that the contract was voidable due to the woman's incapacity, makes the contract enforceable."
