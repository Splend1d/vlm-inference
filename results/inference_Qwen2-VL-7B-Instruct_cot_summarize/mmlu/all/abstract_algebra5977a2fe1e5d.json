We can rewrite it as \\( \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\sqrt{3}} \\). Since \\( \\sqrt{\\sqrt{3}} \\) is not a rational number, we cannot simplify it further in terms of rational numbers.\n\nNow, let's consider the field extension \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2\\sqrt{3}) \\). This field contains all the rational numbers and all the numbers that can be obtained by adding, subtractinging, multiplying, and dividing rational numbers with \\( \\sqrt{2\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nTo find the degree of this field extension, we need to find the minimal polynomial of \\( \\sqrt{2\\sqrt{3} \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). Let \\( x = \\sqrt{2\\sqrt{3} \\). Then, \\( x^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} \\), and squaring both sides again, we get \\( x^4 = 12 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the minimal polynomial of \\( x \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). The minimal polynomial is the monic polynomial of least degree that has \\( \\sqrt{2\\sqrt{3}} \\) as a root. In this case, the minimal polynomial is \\( x^4 - 12 \\).\n\nThe degree of the field extension \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2\\sqrt{3}}) \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is the degree of the minimal polynomial, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 4"
