                    "text": "To determine the most probable values for the ionization energy and atomic radius of sodium based on periodic trends and the given data for magnesium, we need to consider the general trends in the periodic table.\n\n1. **Atomic Radius**:\n   - Magnesium (Mg: 160 pm\n   - Sodium (Na: The atomic radius of sodium is generally smaller than that of magnesium because sodium is in the same group (Group 1A (1) but one period lower in the periodic table. Sodium is in the third period, while magnesium is in the second period. The atomic radius decreases as we move down a group due to the increase in nuclear charge, which pulls the electrons closer to the nucleus.\n\n2. **First Ionization Energy**:\n   - Magnesium (Mg: 737 kJ/mol\n   - Sodium (Na: The first ionization energy of sodium is generally higher than that of magnesium because sodium has one more electron to be removed. Sodium has a higher nuclear charge due to being in the third period, which attracts the electrons more strongly.\n\nGiven these trends, we can infer the following:\n- The atomic radius of sodium will be smaller than that of magnesium.\n- The first ionization energy of sodium will be higher than that of magnesium.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol\n   - This option suggests a larger atomic radius and a lower ionization energy, which contradicts the trends.\n\nB. 186 pm, 898 kJ/mol\n   - This option suggests a larger atomic radius and a higher ionization energy, which also also contradicts the trends.\n\nC. 135 pm, 523 kJ/mol\n   - This option suggest a smaller atomic radius and a lower ionization energy, which aligns with the trends.\n\nD. 147 pm, 523 kJ/mol\n   - This option suggest a smaller atomic radius and a lower ionization energy, which aligns with the trends.\n\nBetween options C and D, option C (135 pm, 523 kJ/mol is more consistent with the general trends observed in the periodic table.\n\nTherefore, the most probable values for the ionization energy and atomic radius of sodium are:\n\n**C. 135 pm, 523 kJ/mol**"
