The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?\n\nA. This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.\nB. This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.\nC. This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.\nD. This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n"

This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n\nIn this scenario, the researcher is dividing the population of school principals into smaller, manageable groups (the school districts, and then taking a random sample from each of these groups. This is a stratified sampling method, where the population is divided into distinct, non-overlapping subgroups (strata, and a random sample is taken from each stratum. This approach allows for more precise estimates and can provide comparative information that might not be available from a simple random sample, especially if there are significant differences between the districts."
