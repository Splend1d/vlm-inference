Wellman's response needs to address this objection directly.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. There is no freedom of association in the marital context.\n- This option contradicts the objection, which implies that freedom of association is important in the marital context. Therefore, it is not a suitable response.\n\nB. His argument does not require that marital and political freedom of association be equally important.\n- This option directly addresses the objection by stating that Wellman's argument does not necessitate that the two types of freedom of association be equally important. This alignss with the objection's claim that freedom of association is more important in the marital context.\n\nC. Freedom of association is equally important in both contexts.\n- This option contradicts the objection, which implies that freedom of association is more important in the marital context. Therefore, it is not a suitable response.\n\nD. None of the above.\n- This option is not a suitable response because option B directly addresses the objection.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate response is:\n\nB. His argument does not require that marital and political freedom of association be equally important.\n\nFinal answer: B."
