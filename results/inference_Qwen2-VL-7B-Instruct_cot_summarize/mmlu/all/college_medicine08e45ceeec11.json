A baseball player hits baseballs from a tee in order to build muscle memory.\nB. A concert flute player falls short of finishing a piece that has a very complex ending without mistakes\nC.

In this context, the high diver is in the zone of proximal development because she is receiving instruction from her coach to improve her form, which is helping her to develop skills that she cannot yet do independently."
