The agreed upon price was $250,000, with construction to be completed within four months. Two weeks after the building contract was formed, the builder contacted a lumber yard to purchase wood necessary for the construction of the house. The builder and the owner of the lumber yard entered into a valid written agreement whereby the lumber yard was to supply the necessary lumber in exchange for $10,000, payable by the builder within 30 days. One week later, a fire destroyed a good portion of the lumber yard's supply of lumber. As a result, the lumber yard refused to supply lumber to the builder. The builder was unable to find another supplier of lumber and therefore notified the woman that he would be unable to complete her building on time. If the woman sues the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because by operation of law the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract.\nB. Yes, but only if the builder's contract with the owner of the lumber yard was not discharged by the fire.\nC. No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\nD. No, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard.\n"

No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\n\nPrivity of contract refers to the direct relationship between the parties to a contract. In this scenario, the woman hired the builder to construct a house according to her plans and specifications. The agreement between the woman and the builder is the primary contract. The agreement between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard is a separate contract. The woman is not a party to the agreement between the builder and the lumber yard owner, and therefore, she does not have privity of contract with the lumber yard owner. As a result, she cannot sue the lumber yard owner for breach of contract."
