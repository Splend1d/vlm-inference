                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the charge on a capacitor changes over time. The problem states that the capacitor loses half of its remaining charge every second. This means that the charge decreases by a factor of 2 every second.\n\nGiven that the charge is q after five seconds, we can work backwards to find the initial charge. Since the charge is halved every second, we can divide the final charge by 2 for each second that passes.\n\nLet's calculate the initial charge step by step:\n\n1. After 5 seconds, the charge is q.\n2. After 4 seconds, the charge would be \\( \\frac{q}{2} \\).\n3. After 3 seconds, the charge would be \\( \\frac{\\frac{q}{2}}{2} = \\frac{q}{4} \\).\n4. After 2 seconds, the charge would be \\( \\frac{\\frac{q}{4}}{2} = \\frac{q}{8} \\).\n5. After 1 second, the charge would be \\( \\frac{\\frac{q}{8}}{2} = \\frac{q}{16} \\).\n\nSo, the initial charge was \\( \\frac{q}{16} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 16q."
