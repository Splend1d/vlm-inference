Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.\nB. Methane did not exist in the solar nebula at the radii of Jupiter and Saturn when the planets formed.\nC. The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\nD. Methane reacts with the abundant ammonia clouds in Jupiter and Saturn and is removed from the atmosphere.\n"

The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\n\nUranus and Neptune have slower rotational speeds compared to Jupiter and Saturn. This slower rotation allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere, where it can condense into clouds. In contrast, Jupiter and Saturn's faster rotation prevents methane from migrating to higher levels in the atmosphere, so it does not condense into clouds."
