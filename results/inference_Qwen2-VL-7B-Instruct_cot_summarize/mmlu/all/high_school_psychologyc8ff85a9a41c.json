In Group I, each rat was raised in isolation with no toys, while in Group II, rats were divided into small groups and given toys to play with. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the probable findings of this study?\n\nA. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh more than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nB. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh less than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nC. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will not be noticeably different from the brains of the rats raised in Group II.\nD. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will consist of more white matter, while the brains of the rats raised in Group II will consist of more gray matter.\n"

The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh less than those of the rats raised in Group II.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the understanding that social interaction and environmental stimulation, which are provided in Group II, are known to positively influence brain development. Isolation and lack of toys ( as in Group I, are likely to result in less brain development, particularly in the forebrain, which is responsible for higher cognitive functions. Therefore, the forebrains of the rats in Group I are expected to be smaller compared to those in Group II."
