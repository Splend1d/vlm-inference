The contract stipulated that the work had to be completed by December 1 (the anticipated opening date for the resort), and that the electrician would be paid $5,000 upon completion of the job. Before accepting the job, the electrician had inspected the property and determined that 500 lighting fixtures would be needed to adequately light the pathways. By November 15, the electrician had installed 150 lighting fixtures. That evening, the owner inspected the property and discovered that the lighting fixtures installed by the electrician did not provide adequate lighting. The next day, the owner immediately discharged the electrician and hired a lighting specialist to complete the installation work at $20 per fixture. The lighting specialist installed the remaining 350 fixtures, completing the work on December 1. The electrician filed suit against the owner. If it is determined that the owner was legally justified in discharging the electrician, which of the following is the electrician's proper measure of recovery?\n\nA. $7,000. 00\nB. $3,500. 00\nC. Quantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services rendered in installing the 150 fixtures.\nD. Nothing, because the electrician did not complete performance of the entire job.\n"

Since he had installed 150 lighting fixtures, the owner would be required to pay him for the work done up to that point. The reasonable value of the services rendered would be based on the cost of installing those 150 fixtures, which would be a portion of the $5,000 stipulated in the contract."
