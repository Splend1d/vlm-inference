The mass of the moon is not directly related to the minimum and maximum distances from the planet's center or the moon's maximum orbital speed.\n\nB. **Mass of the planet**: The mass of the planet can be calculated using the formula for the gravitational force between two masses bodies:\n\\[ F = \\frac{G M}{r^2} \\]\nwhere \\( F \\) is the gravitational force, \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( m \\) is the mass of the moon, \\( p \\) is the mass of the planet, and \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of the two bodies. However, this formula requires the mass of the moon, which is not provided.\n\nC. **Minimum speed of the moon**: The minimum speed of the moon can be calculated using the formula for the orbital speed:\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\]\nwhere \\( v \\) is the orbital speed, \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the planet, and \\( r \\) is the distance from the planet's center. The minimum speed can be calculated if the mass of the planet is known.\n\nD. **Period of the orbit**: The period of the orbit can be calculated using Kepler's's third law:\n\\[ \\frac{r^3}{T^2} = \\text{constant} \\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the average distance from the planet's center, and \\( t \\) is the period of the orbit. The period can be calculated if the average distance from the planet's center is known.\n\nGiven the measurements of the moon's minimum and maximum distances from the planet's center and the moon's maximum orbital speed, we can calculate the mass of the planet, the minimum speed of the moon, and the period of the orbit. However, we cannot calculate the mass of the moon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Mass of of the moon**"
