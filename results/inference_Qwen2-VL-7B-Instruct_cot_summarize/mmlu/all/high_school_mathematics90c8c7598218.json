So we want to find the smallest $n$ such that $n^{d(n)/2} = n^6$.\n\nThis means that $d(n) = 12$. The number of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\\cdots(e_k + 1)$. So we want to find the smallest $n$ such that $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\\cdots(e_k + 1) = 12$.\n\nThe prime factorization of 12 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^1$. The smallest $n$ that has this number of divisors is $2^2 \\cdot 3^1 = 12$. However, 12 is not a prime number, so it does not have the smallest number of divisors.\n\nThe next smallest number that has 12 divisors is $2^3 \\cdot 3^1 = 24$. This is a prime number, so it has the smallest number of divisors.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$ is 24. The answer is: $24$"
