Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nFrom the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore\n\nA. seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\nB. should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.\nC. can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\nD. was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\n"

The massacre was seen as a rebellion against this perceived dominance. Thus, this option aligns with the perspective that the British were betrayed by the local population.\n   - **Option B**: \"should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.\"\n     - This passage does not suggest that the massacre was avoidable or regrettable. Instead, it portrays it as a result of the British dominance and the desire for revenge.\n   - **Option C**: \"can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\"\n     - While the passage does not explicitly state that the British brought it on themselves, it does imply that the massacre was a result of the British dominance and the desire for revenge.\n   - **Option D**: \"was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\"\n     - The passage does not mention that the massacre was seen as a religious duty by the killers.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer**: Based on the analysis, the perspective of William Howard Russell seems to align most closely with the idea that the massacre was a result of the British dominance and the desire for revenge.\n\n**Final Answer**: C. can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves."
