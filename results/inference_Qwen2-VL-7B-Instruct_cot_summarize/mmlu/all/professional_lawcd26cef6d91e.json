                    "text": "In 1985, a landowner, the undisputed owner of an apartment building, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the landowner died leaving no heirs. In her will, the landowner left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America. The apartment building was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the landowner died, the tenant, having learned of the landowner's death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts of America organization was unaware of the landowner's gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Girl Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the apartment building. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. In an ejection action by the Girl Scouts of America against the tenant, the organization will prevail\n\nA. because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\nB. if the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.\nC. if the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\nD. because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. If the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\n\nIn the context of adverse possession, the tenant's belief that the lease was still in effect after the landowner's death is crucial. Adverse possession typically requires the possession of property by the claimant to be open, notorious, and continuous for a statutory period. In this case, the statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. The tenant's belief that the lease was still in effect means that the tenant continued to occupy the property in a manner consistent with the lease, which could potentially satisfy the conditions for adverse possession.\n\nThe other options do not directly relate to the legal principles of adverse possession. Option A is incorrect because the discontinuation of rent payments alone does not necessarily establish adverse possession. Option B is irrelevant because the tenant's actions while in military service do not affect the legal status of the lease. Option D is incorrect because paying taxes on the property does not necessarily establish adverse possession; it is the tenant's possession and use of the property that matters.\n\nTherefore, the tenant's belief that the lease was still in effect after the landowner's death is the key factor that could potentially allow the tenant to prevail in the ejection action."
