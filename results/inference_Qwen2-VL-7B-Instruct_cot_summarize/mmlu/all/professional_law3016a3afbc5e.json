When the man allowed the neighbor to \"think it over,\" he effectively extended the time for the neighbor to respond to the offer. Once the neighbor decided to accept the offer, the man was bound to sell the barbecue to the neighbor at the agreed price of $100. Since the man sold the barbecue to his brother instead, he breached the contract and the neighbor is entitled to sue for breach of contract."
