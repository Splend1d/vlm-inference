Each vertical tangency corresponds to a full cycle of the vertical input signal. Since there are 2 vertical tangencies, this means the vertical input signal completes 2 cycles in the same time it the horizontal input signal completes 1 cycle.\n\nThe frequency of the horizontal input is given as 100 Hz. The frequency of the vertical input ( (f_v) can be calculated using the relationship between the frequencies of the two inputs:\n\n\\[ f_v = \\frac{f_h}{n} \\]\n\nwhere \\( f_h \\) is the frequency of the horizontal input, and \\( n \\) is the number of vertical tangencies.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( f_h = 100 \\) Hz\n- \\( n = 2 \\)\n\n\\[ f_v = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\] Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the vertical input is 50 Hz.\n\nNone of the provided options (A, B, C, or D match the calculated frequency of 50 Hz. It seems there might be a mistake in the options or the question."
