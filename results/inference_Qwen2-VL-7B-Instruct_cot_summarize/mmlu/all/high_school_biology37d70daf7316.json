Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms.\n\nTay-Sachs disease is caused by a recessive allele, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele ( (one from each parent) to develop the disease. However, individuals who are heterozygous ( (one copy of the recessive allele and one copy of the dominant allele) will not show symptoms of the disease. These heterozygous individuals are carriers of the recessive allele and can pass it on the gene to their offspring. This is why the allele and its associated disease can be preserved in the population, even though individuals with the genetic disorder usually do not survive more than a few years and are not able to reproduce and pass on the gene."
