The company will be able to provide a human representative for any incoming call.\n- This is not a likely benefit of an upgraded system. An automated system might not be able to handle every call, especially those requiring complex or nuanced responses that require human expertise.\n\nC. Customers are likely to spend less time listening to information not relevant to their issue.\n- This is a potential benefit of an automated system, as it can direct customers to the relevant information or department more efficiently.\n\nD. Customers will be unable to mistakenly select the incorrect department for their particular issue.\n- This is a potential benefit of an automated system, as it can guide customers to the correct department based on their issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that is least likely to be provided by the upgraded system is:\n\nB.
