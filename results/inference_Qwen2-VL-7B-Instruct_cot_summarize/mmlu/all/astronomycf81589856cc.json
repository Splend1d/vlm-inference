Most rocks on the Moon's surface are older than those on the Earth's surface.\n\nThe Giant Impact Hypothesis suggests that the Moon was formed from debris left over after a large asteroid collided with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains several features of the Moon, including its relatively small size, its iron-poor core, and its composition of materials that are not found on Earth. \n\nOption A is consistent with the hypothesis, as the Moon's size relative to Earth's size is indeed larger than most other moons relative to their planets. \nOption C is also consistent with the hypothesis, as the Moon's iron core is much smaller than Earth's iron core, which is expected if the Moon formed from debris left over after a large impact.\nOption D is also consistent with the hypothesis, as the Moon was once entirely molten, which is consistent with the idea that it formed from debris left over after a large impact.\nOption B is not consistent with the hypothesis, as it would suggest that the Moon's rocks are younger than Earth's rocks, which is not what the Giant Impact Hypothesis predicts."
