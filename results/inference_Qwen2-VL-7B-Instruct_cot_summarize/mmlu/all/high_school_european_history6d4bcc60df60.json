A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which option would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned in the governmental report, we need to carefully analyze the context and the specific conditions described in the report.\n\nThe report describes a situation where people are dying of famine due to a lack of food. It mentions that the staple dish is mice, roots that animals cannot eat, and other desperate measures to find food. It also notes that the population is so desperate that they are turning to human herds and even eating the bodies of animals that have died of disease.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The elimination of the Black Plague in Europe during the seventeenth century\n- The Black Plague, which occurred in the fourteenth century, had a significant impact on Europe. However, the report is set in the seventeenth century, and the Black Plague would not have been a relevant factor at that time. Therefore, this option is not applicable.\n\nB. The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century\n- The agricultural revolution, which began in the late sixteenth century and continued into the eighteenth century, involved improvements in farming techniques and the use of fallow fields. This would have led to more efficient food production and better food yields. This would have likely reduced the problems of hunger described in the report.\n\nC. The creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work\n- The putting-out system, which involved workers being paid to produce goods at home, was not a significant factor in the seventeenth century. It was was not a major economic system at that time. Therefore, this option is not applicable.\n\nD. A declining population during the seventeenth century that led to better food yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized\n- While a declining population could potentially lead to better food yields, the report does not mention a declining population as a cause of the famine. it rather describes a situation where the population is so desperate that they are turning to human herds and eating the bodies of animals that have died of disease. Therefore, this option is not applicable.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most responsible factor for ending the problems of hunger mentioned in the report would be:\n\nB. The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century"
