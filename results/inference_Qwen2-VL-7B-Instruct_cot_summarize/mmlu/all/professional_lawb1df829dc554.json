Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\n\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the president\u00d5s conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the president\u00d5s conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\n"

Yes, because the cancer, not the president's conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\n\nThe proximate cause of death is the event that is the direct and immediate cause of the death. In this case, the cancer was the underlying condition that led to the patient's death. The president's conduct, while negligent, did not cause the cancer itself but rather the defective medication, which was a contributing factor to the patient's death. Therefore, the president's conduct was not the direct and immediate cause of the patient's death."
