We can rewrite these equations as $a^2 = b$, $b^2 = 2c$, and $c^2 = 3a$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $a^2 = b$ into the equation $b^2 = 2c$ to get $(a^2)^2 = 2c$, or $a^4 = 2c$.\n\nSimilarly, we can substitute $c^2 = 3a$ into the equation $b^2 = 2c$ to get $(c^2)^2 = 2(3a)$, or $c^4 = 6a$.\n\nNow, we have two equations: $a^4 = 2c$ and $c^4 = 6a$. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of $a$ and $c$.\n\nFirst, we can express $c$ in terms of $a$ from the equation $a^4 = 2c$, or $c = \\frac{{a^4}{2}$.\n\nThen, we substitute $c = \\frac{a^4}{2}$ into the equation $c^4 = 6a$, or $\\left(\\frac{a^4}{2}\\right)^4 = 6a$, or $\\frac{a^{16}}{16} = 6a$.\n\nSolving this equation for $a$, we get $a^{16} = 96a$, or $a^{15} = 96$.\n\nTaking the 15th root of both sides, we get $a = 96^{1/15}$.\n\nNow, we can check which of the given options matches $96^{1/15}$.\n\nWe can see that $96^{1/15} = 12^{1/7}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
