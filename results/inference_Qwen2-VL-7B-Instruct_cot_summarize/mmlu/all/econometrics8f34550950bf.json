(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nAutocorrelation in residuals can occur due to several reasons:\n\ni) Slowness of response of the dependent variable to changes in the values of the independent variables: This can lead to a lag in the dependent variable's reaction to changes in the independent variables, resulting in autocorrelated residuals.\n\nii) Over-reactions of the dependent variable to changes in the independent variables: This can cause the dependent variable to overshoot or undershoot its equilibrium value, leading to autocorrelated residuals.\n\niii) Omission of relevant explanatory variables that are autocorrelated: If the omitted variables are autocorrelated, their effects can be captured in the residuals, leading to autocorrelation.\n\niv) Outliers in the data: While outliers can affect the model's fit and lead to biased estimates, they do not directly cause autocorrelation in the residuals. Autocorrelation typically arises from the model's inability to capture the underlying structure of the data, not from the presence of outliers.\n\nTherefore, options i), ii), and iii) are correct, while option iv) is incorrect."
