                    "text": "To determine which statements must be true about a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law, let's analyze each statement in the context of Raoult's law.\n\nRaoult's law states that the vapor pressure of a component in a binary liquid mixture is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid mixture. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ P_i = x_i \\cdot P_i^{\\text{pure}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( P_i \\) is the vapor pressure of component \\( i \\) in the mixture,\n- \\( x_i \\) is the mole fraction of component \\( i \\) in the mixture,\n- \\( P_i^{\\text{pure}} \\) is the vapor pressure of component \\( i \\) in its pure state.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n**I. The partial pressure of each component at equilibrium is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid mixture.**\n\nThis statement directly follows from Raoult's law. The vapor pressure of each component is indeed proportional to its mole fraction in the mixture. Therefore, statement I is true.\n\n**II. The volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of the volumes of each component before mixing.**\n\nRaoult's law does not provide any information about the volume of the mixture. The volume of the mixture is not necessarily equal to the sum of the volumes of each component before mixing. Therefore, statement II is not necessarily true.\n\n**III. Intermolecular interactions in the mixture are identical to intermolecular interactions in the pure components.**\n\nRaoult's law does not provide any information about the nature of intermolecular interactions. The interactions in the mixture can be different from those in the pure components. Therefore, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true about a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law is statement I.\n\nThe final answer is:\nA. I only"
