Attempted sale of narcotics and false pretenses.**\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- **Attempted sale of narcotics:** The defendant attempted to sell an ounce of marijuana to a partygoer, which is a crime under the law. The fact that the defendant knew the bag contained oregano rather than marijuana does not negate the attempt to sell narcotics.\n  \n- **False pretenses:** The defendant used a false representation (that the bag contained marijuana when it actually contained oregano. This is a crime of false pretenses, as the defendant deceived the partygoer about the contents of the bag.\n\nTherefore, the defendant is guilty of both attempting to sell narcotics and committing false pretenses."
