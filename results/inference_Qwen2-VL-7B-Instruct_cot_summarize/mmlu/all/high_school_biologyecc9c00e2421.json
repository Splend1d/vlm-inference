Well-adapted individuals leave more offspring, and thus contribute more to the next generation's gene pool, than do poorly adapted individuals.\n\nThis statement is most correct because it encapsulates the essence of natural selection. Natural selection occurs when individuals with traits that are better suited to their environment (i.e., well-adapted individuals - are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those advantageous traits to their offspring. Over generations, this leads to the evolution of species better adapted to their environments."
