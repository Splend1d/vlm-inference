Shuffling of alleles is responsible for the greatest variation in humans.\n\nExplanation: The statement \"Except for identical twins, no two people are genetically identical\" implies that genetic variation is common among humans. This variation is primarily due to the shuffling of alleles during meiosis, which is the process of cell division that produces gametes ( (sperm and eggs). This shuffling leads to genetic diversity, which is essential for the survival and evolution of species."
