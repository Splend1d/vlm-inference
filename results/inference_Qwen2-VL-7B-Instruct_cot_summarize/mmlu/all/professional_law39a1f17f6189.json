The owner told the woman that he was sorry but it was his policy not to cash Social Security checks. Terribly upset, the woman reached into her pocketbook and said, \"Listen, buddy, I've got a bomb in here, and if you don't give me the money, I'm going to blow up this joint. \" Actually, the woman did not have a bomb in her possession. The owner, who was not deceived by her threat, felt sorry for the woman and agreed to cash the check. The woman, who walked with the assistance of a cane, took the money and limped out of the store. After she left, the owner noticed that the woman had not endorsed the check. The woman has committed which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Robbery.\nC. Attempted robbery.\nD. False pretenses.\n"

Attempted robbery**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- The woman initially threatened the store owner with a bomb to get money, which is a classic example of a robbery threat.\n- However, the threat was not backed up by any actual bomb, and the owner was not deceived by the threat.\n- Despite this, the owner agreed to cash the check out of sympathy for the woman.\n- After leaving, the owner noticed that the check had not been endorsed, which means the woman did not intend to cash the check herself.\n\nGiven that the threat was not carried out and the check was not endorsed, the woman's actions can be considered an attempt to commit robbery. She attempted to use a threat to gain money but did not complete the act."
