Since \\( \\mathbb{Z}^n \\) exists for every positive integer \\( n \\), there exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.\n\nStatement 2 is False. A finitely generated abelian group being free abelian does not depend on its Betti number. The Betti number is a concept from algebraic topology, specifically in the study of homology groups, and it does not directly relate to the structure of a finitely generated abelian group. A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if and only if it is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}^n \\) for some \\( n \\), which is determined by its rank and not by its Betti number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
