Yes, because the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence.\n\nIn federal court, a party must object to a proposed instruction at the time the instruction is proposed or before the judge gives the instructions to the jury. If the party fails to object at either of these times, the issue is generally considered to be waived for purposes of appeal. However, if the party submits a proposed instruction and the judge fails to give it, the issue is preserved for appeal. This is because the failure to give the instruction amounts to a ruling on the instruction, which is a matter of law that can be appealed.\n\nTherefore, the defendant's submission of a proposed instruction on contributory negligence preserved the issue for appeal."
