Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\"\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nIn this passage, Marx and Engels seem to be chiefly preoccupied with\n\nA. provoking fear to drive their readers to action\nB. attacking the extreme communists who threatened to sink the entire movement\nC. demonstrating the understanding of the others in point of fact\nD. explaining the reasons for debunking opponents of communism\n"

Provoking fear to drive their readers to action**: This option suggests that the primary goal is to incite fear. However, the passage does not seem to be primarily focused on fear but rather on addressing the specter of Communism head-on.\n   - **B. Attacking the extreme communists who threatened to sink the entire movement**: This option suggests that the passage is attacking extreme communists. While the specter of Communism is mentioned, the passage does not focus on attacking communists but rather on addressing the specter.\n   - **C. Demonstrating the understanding of the others in point of fact**: This option suggests that the passage is demonstrating understanding of others' points of view. While the passage acknowledges the specter of Communism, it is not primarily about demonstrating understanding of others' points of view.\n   - **D. Explaining the reasons for debunk opponents of communism**: This This option suggest that the passage is explaining the reasons for debunking opponents of communism. The passage does explain the reasons for the Communist party to openly declare its views and aims, which aligns with this option.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The passage is primarily focused on explaining the reasons for the Communist party to openly declare its views and aims, as it is high time for them to do so in the face of the specter of Communism.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**D. explaining the reasons for debunk opponents of communism**."
