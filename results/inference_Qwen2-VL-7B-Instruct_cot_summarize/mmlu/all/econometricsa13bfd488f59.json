As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients.\n\nThe Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics are both used to test for the presence of autocorrelation in a time time series. Asymptotically, these two statistics are equivalent, meaning that as the sample size increases, their values will converge. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nThe Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*, which means that the Q test is more reliable when the sample size is small. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nThe Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples, meaning that it may reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients even when it is true. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nAs the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients. This is because both tests are designed to detect autocorrelation, and as the sample size increases, the power of the tests to detect autocorrelation also also increases. Therefore, option D is incorrect."
