Native Americans in North America and South America genetically diverged from each other and their ancestors in the far north by about 30,000 years ago.\n- This option suggests a significant genetic divergence between Native Americans in North and South America, but it does not specify the timing or the origin of this divergence.\n\nB. All Native Americans, both ancient and modern, are derived from a single migration of Austral-Melanesians into the Americas by about 13,000 years ago.\n- This option suggests a single migration event, but it does not specify the timing or the the origin of this migration.\n\nC. All Native Americans, both ancient and modern, are derived from a single migration of the Inuit, who arrived in the Americas by about 13,000 years ago.\n- This option suggests a single migration event from the Inuit, but it does not specify the timing or the the origin of this migration.\n\nD. The separation between native Siberians and the earliest Native Americans occurred sometime between 20,000 and 23,000 years ago.\n- This option suggests a specific time period for the separation between native Siberians and the earliest Native Americans, but it does not specify the origin of this separation.\n\nGiven the options, the most accurate conclusion based on the study would be:\n\nD. The separation between native Siberians and the earliest Native Americans occurred sometime between 20,000 and 23,000 years ago.\n\nThis option provides a specific time period for the separation, which aligns with the study's findings."
