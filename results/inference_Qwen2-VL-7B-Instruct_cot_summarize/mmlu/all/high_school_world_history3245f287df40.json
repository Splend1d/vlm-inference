The author describes the destruction of his property and the pending litigation against the British government due to the actions of a contingent of 1,500 natives (i.e., Zulus.\n\n1. **Highlight the extent of the property losses**: The author mentions that his homestead was insured for \u00a32,000 and that his crops and premises would have been destroyed. He also also states that he is suing the government for damages done by the Zulus. This indicates that the author is trying to emphasize the significant extent of his property losses.\n\n2. **Express his opposition to the ongoing war**: The author does not explicitly state his opposition to the war. Instead, he focuses on the damages caused by the Zulus and the pending litigation.\n\n3. **Belittle British officials**: The author does not belittle British officials. He is more concerned with the damages caused by the Zulus and the government's responsibility for those damages.\n\n4. **Place blame on both his home country as well as the Zulus**: While the author mentions the Zulus' actions, he primarily focuses on the government's responsibility for the damages caused by the Zulus.\n\nGiven this analysis, the author's pending litigation with the British government serves to highlight the extent of his property losses.\n\n**Final Answer: A. Highlight the extent of the author's property losses**"
