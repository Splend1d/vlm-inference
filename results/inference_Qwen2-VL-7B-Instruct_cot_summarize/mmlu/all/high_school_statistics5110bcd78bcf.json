Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries.\n\n**Reasoninging:**\n\n1. **Stratified Sampling:**\n   - Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups (strata\u2014each stratum is homogeneous within itself but heterogeneous across strata.\n   - In this case, the population is divided into five strata based on the five different countries where the company has offices.\n   - This method ensures that each stratum (country) is represented in the sample, which is crucial because the views on smoking bans may vary significantly across different countries due to local social structures.\n\n2. **Cluster Sampling:**\n   - Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and then randomly selecting some of these clusters to be included in the sample.\n   - While this method can be used when it is difficult to list all members of the population, it does not ensure representation from each stratum (country.\n   - This method might not be as effective in capturing the diversity of views across different countries.\n\n3. **Simple Random Sampling:**\n   - Simple random sampling involves selecting members of the population completely at random.\n   - While it is straightforward and unbiased, it does not ensure representation from each stratum (country.\n   - This method might not be as effective in capturing the diversity of views across different countries.\n\nGiven the context, stratified sampling is the most appropriate because it ensures that each stratum (country) is represented in the sample, which is crucial for accurately estimating the proportion of employees in favor of banning smoking in offices across different countries."
