Then, we divide this by the total number of ways to choose any 3 suitcases out of 25.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 damaged suitcases out of 5 is given by the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \\(n!\\) denotes the factorial of \\(n\\).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 damaged suitcases out of 5 is:\n\\[C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\\]\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 undamaged suitcase out of 20 is:\n\\[C(20, 1) = \\frac{20!}{1!(20-1)!} = 20\\]\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 3 suitcases out of 25 is:\n\\[C(25, 3) = \\frac{25!}{3!(25-3)!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2300\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 suitcases selected are damaged is:\n\\[P = \\frac{10 \\times 20}{2300} = \\frac{200}{2300} = \\frac{2}{23}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 2/23."
