A beach then formed where previously there had been lake bottom.\n\nThis sequence of events is consistent with the presence of a layer of sandstone in bedrock just above a layer of shale. When the water level of a large lake lowers, it can expose the lake bottom, which may be composed of a layer of shale. Over time, the sediments on the lake bottom can be exposed to the air and subjected to weatheringing and erosion. As the sediments are transported by wind or water, they can be deposited on the beach, where they can be compacteded and lithified into sandstone. This process can result in a layer of sandstone forming above a layer of shale in the bedrock."
