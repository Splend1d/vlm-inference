Because he believes portions of March's deposition are highly favorable to his case, Cooper's attorney intends to read parts of the deposition at trial instead of calling March to the stand. March objects to Cooper's use of the deposition at trial. What is the court's likely ruling?\n\nA. Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.\nB. Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only to contradict or impeach March's prior inconsistent statements or pleadings.\nC. Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist.\nD. Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as this would make March his witness and immune to impeachment.\n"

Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist.\n\nIn the United States, the use of a deposition at trial is generally governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence ( (F.R.E. 104). A deposition is a pretrial discovery tool where a party can question a witness outside of the courtroom. The witness's answers are then recorded and can be used at trial. However, the use of a deposition at trial is subject to certain limitations.\n\nMarch's objection to Cooper's use of the deposition at trial is based on the principle that March is able to testify at trial and no exceptional circumstances exist that would justify the use of the deposition. This is because, under normal circumstances, a party cannot use a deposition at trial unless the opposing party consents or there are exceptional circumstances that justify the use of the deposition.\n\nTherefore, the court's likely ruling would be that Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist."
