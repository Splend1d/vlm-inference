She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. She does not smoke. There is no history of lung disease. She weighs 54 kg (120 lb) and is 163 cm (64 in) tall. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?\n\nA. Decreased plasma renin activity\nB. Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations\nC. Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations\nD. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\n"

Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\n\nThe patient has hypertension treated with enalapril, which is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors work by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased angiotensin II concentrations. This can cause cough as a side effect. Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator and inflammatory mediator that can also cause cough. The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of cough in this patient."
