If the work is 300 J and the cycle is counterclockwise, the heat transfer during the cycle can be calculated using the First Law of Thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (\u0394U is equal to the heat transfer Q plus the work done W:\n\n\u0394U = Q + W\n\nSince the cycle is closed, the change in internal energy \u0394U is zero. Therefore:\n\nQ = -W\n\nGiven that the work W is 300 J, the heat transfer Q is:\n\nQ = -300 J\n\nThis means that heat is transferred out of the system, making the correct answer:\n\nB. 300 J out of the system"
