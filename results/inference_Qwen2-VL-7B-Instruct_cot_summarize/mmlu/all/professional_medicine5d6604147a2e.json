Fatty acid synthesis.\n\nMalonyl-CoA is an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC, which is a key enzyme in the fatty acid synthesis pathway. When malonyl-CoA levels increase, it binds to ACC, inhibiting its activity and thereby reducing fatty acid synthesis. This is a mechanism to prevent the accumulation of fatty acids in the muscle cells during hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, which can lead to insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders."
