However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing anorexia nervosa. These factors include:\n\n1. **Perfectionism and High Standards**: Individuals who are driven by a need for perfection and have high standards for themselves are at higher risk.\n2. **Family History**: Having a family member with an eating disorder increases the risk.\n3. **Psychological Factors**: Conditions such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem can contribute to the development of anorexia nervosa.\n4. **Sociocultural Pressures**: Societal pressures to be thin can also lead to disordered eating behaviors.\n\nGiven these factors, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **A. Maria, a 16-year-old Caucasian female, who is an A student and talented musician, but who feels that her life is out of control**: Maria might be experiencing stress and a sense of being out of control, which could contribute to the development of anorexia nervosa.\n\n- **B. Leticia, a 15-year-old African American female, who is an A student and exceptional athlete, plus an avid reader**: Leticia's achievements and interests do not necessarily indicate a higher risk for anorexia nervosa. However, she might be under pressure to maintain her high standards and appearance.\n\n- **C. Rosa, a 26-year-old Hispanic female, who has just received her law degree, is struggling with debt from school, and having difficulty finding employment**: While Rosa's financial and career struggles could be stressful, they do not directly indicate a higher risk for anorexia nervosa.\n\n- **D. Virginia, a 14-year-old Caucasian female, who is a C student, is sexually promiscuous, and is experimenting with drugs**: Virginia's behavior might indicate a higher risk for other mental health issues, but it does not specifically point to an increased risk for anorexia nervosa.\n\nBased on the analysis, **A. Maria** is the most likely to develop anorexia nervosa due to her feeling that her life is out of control, which could contribute to the development of disordered eating behaviors."
