The mortgage was promptly recorded. The next year, the father died intestate. The father's heirs were the son and his two sisters. The sisters first learned of the mortgage just after their father died. The sisters now assert that the son, their brother, holds the mortgage for their benefit as well as for himself because as a tenant in common with his sisters, he has a fiduciary duty toward them. There are no applicable statutes. Are the sisters correct?\n\nA. No, because the mortgage was granted before the tenancy in common was created.\nB. No, because the three siblings took the farm as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\nC. Yes, because a fiduciary relationship exists among tenants in common.\nD. Yes, because their three interests are equal.\n"

No, because the three siblings took the farm as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nIn the context of intestate succession, the distribution of property among the surviving siblings depends on the nature of their ownership interest in the farm. If the siblings took the farm as tenants in common, each sibling would have an equal undivided interest in the property. However, if they had taken the farm as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the property would have passed directly to the surviving joint tenant(s) upon the death of the first tenant, bypassing intestate succession.\n\nGiven that the sisters assert that they are tenants in common, the farm would have passed to them according to the intestate succession laws of their state, rather than to the son alone. Therefore, the son does not hold the mortgage for their benefit as well as for himself, as the sisters' interests are not protected by the mortgage in the same way as if they were joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nThus, the sisters are not correct in asserting that the son holds the mortgage for their benefit as well as for himself due to the nature of their ownership interest in the farm."
