Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E.?\n\nA. The invention of the machine gun\nB. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases\nC. The development of the joint-stock company\nD. The invention of steam-powered ships\n"

This invention significantly enhanced the capabilities of European armies to conduct colonial conquests more efficiently and effectively. Therefore, it played a significant role in European penetration of Africa.\n\n2. **The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases**:\n   - Vaccines for tropical diseases, such as yellow fever and malaria, were developed in the late 19th century. These vaccines helped protect European soldiers and settlers from diseases that were previously fatal, thereby reducing the mortality rate and enabling more sustained and successful colonization efforts.\n\n3. **The development of the joint-stock company**:\n   - The joint-stock company was a financial innovation that allowed for the pooling of capital and risk among investors. This innovation facilitated large-scale investments in exploration and colonization, enabling European powers to fund extensive expeditionsary efforts and establish colonies.\n\n4. **The invention of steam-powered ships**:\n   - Steam-powered ships were developed in the early 19th century, with the first successful steam-powered ship sailing in 1807. These ships allowed for faster and more efficient navigation, enabling European powers to establish and maintain colonies across vast distances more easily.\n\nGiven the timeline and the historical context, the invention of the machine gun ( (A) and the invention of vaccines for tropical diseases ( (B) were developed later in the 19th century and had a significant impact on European colonial expansion. The development of the joint-stock company ( (C) was a financial innovation that facilitated large-scale investments in exploration and colonization. The invention of steam-powered ships ( (D) was a technological advancement that enabled faster and more efficient navigation.\n\nTherefore, the invention of vaccines for tropical diseases ( (B) contributed the least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E., as it was developed later and had a more direct impact on the health and survival of European colonizers.\n\nFinal answer: B. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases"
