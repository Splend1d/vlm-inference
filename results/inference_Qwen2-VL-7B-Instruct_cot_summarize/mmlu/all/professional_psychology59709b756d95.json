A value of 0 indicates no linear relationship, while values closer to 1 or -1 indicate a stronger linear relationship.\n\nGiven that about 15% of the variability in GPA is accounted for by the amount of time spent studying, we can use the coefficient of determination, \\( r^2 \\), to find the correlation coefficient. The coefficient of determination is the square of the correlation coefficient, and it represents the proportion of the variance in one variable that is predictable from the other variable.\n\nSo, if 15% of the variability in GPA is accounted for by the amount of time spent studying, then:\n\n\\[ r^2 = 0.15 \\]\n\nTo find \\( r \\), we take the square root of 0.15:\n\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{0.15} \\approx 0.387 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correlation coefficient \\( r \\) is approximately 0.39.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.39"
