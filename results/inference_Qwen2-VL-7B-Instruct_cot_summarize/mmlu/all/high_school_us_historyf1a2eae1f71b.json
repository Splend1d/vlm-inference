Polk. \n\nManifest Destiny was a 19th-century belief held by many Americans that it was their divine right and national destiny to expand the United States across the North American continent. This belief was often justified by the idea that the United States was destined to spread its values and institutions across the continent, which was seen as a \"manifest destiny\" from God.\n\nPresident James K. Polk is often associated with Manifest Destiny because he was a strong proponent of territorial expansion and was instrumental in the acquisition of new territories, including Texas, Oregon, and California, during his presidency. His administration was characterized by a series of territorial acquisitions that significantly expanded the boundaries of the United States.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. James K. Polk"
