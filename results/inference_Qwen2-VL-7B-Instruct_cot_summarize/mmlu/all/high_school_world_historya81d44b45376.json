It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following is a treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. that is similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E.?\n\nA.

This scenario involves the displacement and extermination of one barbarian group by another, which is a form of conflict and displacement.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option to see which one aligns with this treatment:\n\nA. Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies.\n- This option describes a cultural assimilation strategy, where barbarian peoples adopt the religions of the civilized societies. This is not similar to the treatment described in the passage, which focuses on displacement and extermination.\n\nB. Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\n- This option describes the integration of barbarian peoples into the military of civilized societies. This is not similar to the treatment described in the passage, which focuses on displacement and extermination.\n\nC. Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.\n- This option describes the legal subjugation of barbarian peoples to servile status. This is similar to the treatment described in the passage, which involves the displacement and extermination of barbarian peoples by other barbarian peoples.\n\nD. Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\n- This option describes the invitation of barbarian peoples to rule within the civilized societies. This is not similar to the treatment described in the passage, which focuses on displacement and extermination.\n\nBased on the analysis, the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. that is similar to the treatment described in the passage is:\n\nC. Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies."
