By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following attitudes prevalent after the First World War is evident in the passage above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the attitude prevalent after the First World War that is evident in the passage, let's analyze the context and the information provided:\n\n1. The passage discusses the Addison's Act, which was introduced to address working-class aspirations post-World War I.\n2. It mentions that by 1920, the fear of revolution similar to that in Russia was beginning to recede.\n3. The passage also notes that the government's Housing Board deferred a scheme and announced a drastic curtailment of the housing program in 1921.\n\nGiven this information, the passage reflects a shift in attitude from the initial belief that addressing working-class aspirations was crucial to prevent revolution to a more pragmatic and possibly disillusionedment with the effectiveness of such policies.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Women's suffrage should increase - The passage does not mention anything about women's suffrage, so this option is irrelevant.\n\nB. Democratization of society - The passage does not discuss democratization of society, so this option is also irrelevant.\n\nC. Increased disillusionment and cynicism - The passage indicates a shift from the initial belief in the need for rapid social change to a more pragmatic and possibly disillusionedment with the effectiveness of such policies.\n\nD. The rise of communism as a world power - The passage does not discuss the rise of communism as a world power, so this option is irrelevant.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Increased disillusionment and cynicism"
