This fallacy is based on the assumption that loyalty to a group or person should dictate the acceptance of an idea or action, rather than evaluating it based on its merits or logical reasoning.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. arguing that someone should do something because it will make him or her better liked by others\n- This describes the fallacy of appeal to popularity, not appeal to loyalty.\n\nB. responding to an argument with an expression of derision\n- This describes the fallacy of ad hominem, not appeal to loyalty.\n\nC. arguing that an idea should be accepted only because of who originated the idea\n- This describes the fallacy of appeal to authority, not appeal to loyalty.\n\nD. arguing that someone should do something to be loyal to a person or a group\n- This describes the fallacy of appeal to loyalty.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. arguing that someone should do something to be loyal to a person or a group"
