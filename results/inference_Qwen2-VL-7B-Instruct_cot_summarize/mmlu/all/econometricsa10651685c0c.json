The regression $R^2$ may be spuriously high.\n\nWhen using non-stationary data in levels form, the $R^2$ value can be spuriously high because it captures the spurious correlation between the variables due to their non-stationary nature. However, this does not necessarily mean that the regression is invalid or that statistical inferences are invalid. The test statistics may not follow standard distributions, and parameter estimates may be biased, but these are consequences of using non-stationary data in levels form."
