Third States are free to fish within another EEZ, except from certain designated areas.\n\nUnder the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982 (UNCLOS), third States (i.e., non-coastal States) do not have inherent fishing rights within another State's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). However, UNCLOS does provide some exceptions and provisions that may allow third States to access fisheries within another State's EEZ, subject to certain conditions and restrictions. These conditions and restrictions are typically set by the coastal State and may include limitations on the types of fish that can be caught, the methods of fishing, and the duration of the fishing period.\n\nIn summary, while third States do not have inherent fishing rights within another State's EEZ, they may be granted access to fisheries within that EEZ under certain conditions and restrictions set by the coastal State."
