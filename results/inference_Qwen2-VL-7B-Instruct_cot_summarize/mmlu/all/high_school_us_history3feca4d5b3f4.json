                    "text": "To determine which speech is most in harmony with the sentiments expressed in Woodrow Wilson's 1914 statement, we need to analyze the core message of the statement and compare it with the themes and sentiments of each of the given speeches.\n\nWoodrow Wilson's statement emphasizes the importance of maintaining neutrality in a conflict, ensuring that no person within the United States takes part in the war, and upholding strict neutrality with all belligerents. This reflects a commitment to peace and impartiality during a time of international conflict.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Washington's Farewell Address** - This speech by George Washington in 1796 emphasized the importance of avoiding foreign entanglements and maintaining a neutral stance in international affairs. This aligns closely with Wilson's statement.\n\nB. **George H. W. Bush's \"A Thousand Points of Light\"** - This speech in 1989 focused on the importance of community service and volunteerism, which is unrelated to international neutrality or conflict.\n\nC. **Lincoln's Gettysburg Address** - This speech in 1863 focused on the preservation of the Union and the ideals of democracy and freedom, which are more related to domestic issues rather than international neutrality.\n\nD. **Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"Day of Infamy\"** - This speech in 1941 focused on the attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent declaration of war against Japan and Germany. It is about entering the war rather than maintaining neutrality.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement by Woodrow Wilson is most in harmony with the sentiments expressed in Washington's Farewell Address.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nA. Washington's Farewell Address"
