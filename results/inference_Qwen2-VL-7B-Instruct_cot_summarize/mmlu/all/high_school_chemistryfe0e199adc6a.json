The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n"

We can use the principle of calorimetry, which states that the heat lost by the sample is equal to the heat gained by the water.\n\nGiven:\n- Mass of of the solid sample, \\( m = 25 \\) g\n- Initial temperature of the solid sample, \\( T_1 = 100^\\circ C \\)\n- Mass of of the water, \\( m = 100 \\) g\n- Initial temperature of the water, \\( T_2 = 26^\\circ C \\)\n- Final temperature of the mixture, \\( T_f = 37^\\circ C \\)\n\nThe heat lost by the solid sample ( \\( Q_{\\text{solid}} \\) is equal to the heat gained by the water \\( q_{\\text{water}} \\):\n\n\\[ q_{\\text{solid}} = q_{\\text{water}} \\]\n\nUsing the heat capacity formula \\( q = mc\\Delta T \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass, \\( c \\) is the specific heat capacity, and \\( \\Delta T \\) is the temperature change, we can write:\n\n\\[ m_{\\text{solid}} = = m_{\\text{water}} \\]\n\n\\[ (25 \\cdot c_{\\text{solid}} \\cdot (100 - 37) = 100 \\cdot c_{\\text{water}} \\cdot (37 - 26) \\]\n\n\\[ 25 \\cdot c_{\\text{solid}} \\cdot 63 = 100 \\cdot c_{\\text{water}} \\cdot 11 \\]\n\n\\[ c_{\\text{solid}} \\cdot 63 = 100 \\cdot c_{\\text{water}} \\cdot 11 \\]\n\n\\[ c_{\\text{solid}} = \\frac{100 \\cdot c_{\\text{water}} \\cdot 11}{63} \\]\n\n\\[ c_{\\text{solid}} = \\frac{100 \\cdot 11}{63} \\cdot c_{\\text{water}} \\]\n\n\\[ c_{\\text{solid}} = \\frac{1100}{63} \\cdot c_{\\text{water}} \\]\n\n\\[ c_{\\text{solid}} \\approx 17.57 \\cdot c_{\\text{water}} \\]\n\nThis shows that the specific heat capacity of the solid sample is approximately 17.57 times that of the water. Therefore, the sample has a higher heat capacity than the water.\n\nThus, the correct conclusion is:\n\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water."
