                    "text": "To determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in potassium-40 ( when it is part of K2SO4, we need to understand the basic properties of potassium and the structure of K2SO4.\n\n1. **Protons and Neutrons in Potassium-40:**\n   - Potassium (K) is an element with atomic number 19, which means it has 19 protons.\n   - The mass number of potassium-40 is 40, which includes both protons and neutrons. Therefore, the number of neutrons is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of neutrons} = \\text{Mass number} - \\text{Protons} = 40 - 19 = 21\n     \\]\n\n2. **Electrons in Potassium-40:**\n   - Potassium is a neutral atom, meaning it has the same number of protons and electrons. Therefore, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of electrons} = 19\n     \\]\n\n3. **Electrons in K2SO4:**\n   - K2SO4 is a compound of potassium sulfate. Potassium sulfate has the formula K2SO4, which means it consists of two potassium ions (K\u207a and one sulfate ion (SO4\u00b2\u207b).\n   - Each potassium ion (K\u207a) has 19 protons and 18 electrons ( (19 - 1 = 18).\n   - Each sulfate ion (SO4\u00b2\u207b) has 32 protons and 30 electrons ( (32 - 2 = 30).\n\n4. **Total Electrons in K2SO4:**\n   - There are two potassium ions, each with 18 electrons:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 18 = 36\n     \\]\n   - There is one sulfate ion, with 30 electrons:\n     \\[\n     30\n     \\]\n   - Total electrons in K2SO4:\n     \\[\n     36 + 30 = 66\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's match these numbers with the given options:\n\n- Option A: 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons\n- Option B: 20 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons\n- Option C: 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons\n- Option D: 19 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons"
