Carbamazepine\n\nCarbamazepine is a commonly used medication for trigeminal neuralgia (also known as tic douloureux, which is characterized by brief, severe, and shooting pain in the trigeminal nerve distribution. The patient's symptoms, including the brief duration of pain and the triggers mentioned, are consistent with trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine is effective in managing this condition by stabilizing the nerve fibers and reducing the frequency and intensity of pain attacks."
