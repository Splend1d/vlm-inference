Separation of powers\n\nExplanation: The separation of powers is a constitutional principle that divides the government into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. Each branch has distinct powers and responsibilities, and they are supposed to check and balance each other. If the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA issued, enforced, and adjudicated all disputes regarding a new regulation, it would violate the separation of powers principle because it would give the EPA too much power and authority, which is not its intended role."
