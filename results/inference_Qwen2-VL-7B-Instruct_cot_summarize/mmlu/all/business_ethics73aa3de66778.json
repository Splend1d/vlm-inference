This alignss with the idea that ethics are not universal but vary based on the situation and the person involved.\n\n2. **Ethics have an internal guide to ethics**: This suggests that individuals have an internal moral compass or guide that helps them make ethical decisions. This is consistent with the idea that ethics are not solely determined by external rules but are also influenced by personal values and internal moral principles.\n\n3. **Ethics are context and individual specific and as such have an internal guide to ethics**: This combines the previous two points, stating that ethics are influenced by context and individual perspectives and that individuals have an internal guide to make ethical decisions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement is best represented by combining points 1 and 2, as they are both key aspects of post-modern ethics.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. 1,2**"
