This gives us $4! \\cdot 4! = 576$ ways.\nSimilarly, for the second sequence, we have 4 choices for the first black ball, 3 choices for the first white ball, 2 choices for the second black ball, and so on. This gives us $4! \\cdot 4! = 576$ ways.\nTherefore, the total number of ways to draw out the balls such that they alternate colors is $576 + 576 = 1152$.\nSo the probability is $\\frac{1152}{70} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\nThe answer is: B. $\\frac{1}{7}$"
