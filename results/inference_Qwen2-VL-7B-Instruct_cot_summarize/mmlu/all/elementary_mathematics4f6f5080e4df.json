To find out how many times he bounces the ball per second, we divide the number of bounces by the number of seconds:\n\n\\[ \\text{Bounces per second} = \\frac{25 \\text{ bounces}}{30 \\text{ seconds}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Bounces per second} = \\frac{25}{30} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Bounces per second} = \\frac{5}{6} \\]\n\nNow, to find out how many times Pat will bounce the ball in 150 seconds, we multiply the number of bounces per second by 150 seconds:\n\n\\[ \\text{Bounces in 150 seconds} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 150 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Bounces in 150 seconds} = 125 \\]\n\nSo, Pat will bounce the ball approximately 125 times in 150 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 125."
