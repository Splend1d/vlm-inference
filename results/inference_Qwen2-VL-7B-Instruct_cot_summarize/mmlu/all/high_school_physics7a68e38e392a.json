The work done by the friction force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the box. The friction force is given by \u03bcmg, where m is the mass of the box, m is the acceleration due to gravity, and \u03bc is the coefficient of kinetic friction. The initial kinetic energy of the box is (1/2mv0^2, and the final kinetic energy is 0 ( since the box comes to rest. Therefore, the work done by the friction force is equal to the initial kinetic energy of the box:\n\n\u03bcmg * d = 1/2mv0^2\n\nwhere d is the distance the box slides. Solving for d:\n\nd = ( v0^2/(\u03bcg)"
