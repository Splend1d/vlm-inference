By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?\n\nA. They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.\nB. They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\nD. They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.\n"

The passage discusses the development and use of gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China during different periods.\n\n1. **Identify the type of logical reasoning involved**: This problem involves causal reasoning, where we need to determine the cause of a particular outcome (in this case, why the Chinese did not lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry despite inventing it.\n\n2. **Comprehend the context and the core of the question**: The passage explains that Europe found gunpowder weaponry useful in sieges, leading to its development and improvement. In contrast, China, facing highly mobile steppe nomads threats, found early gunpowder weapons ineffective and thus focused on improving horse archer units instead.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **A. They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.**\n     - This option suggests a cultural or ideological reason. However, the passage does not mention Confucian traditionalism or any cultural discouragement.\n   - **B. They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed force.**\n     - This option implies a strategic decision based on the existing forces. The passage does not mention the Chinese's faith in their existing forces.\n   - **C. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.**\n     - This option aligns with the passage's explanation. The Chinese focused on horse archers because early gunpowder weapons were ineffective against their primary threat, steppe nomads.\n   - **D. They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.**\n     - This option suggests an economic reason. The passage does not mention any financial constraints.\n\n4. **Conclude with an answer**:\n   - The passage clearly states that China's focus on horse archers was due to the ineffectiveness of early gunpowder weapons against their primary threat, the steppe nomads. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.**"
