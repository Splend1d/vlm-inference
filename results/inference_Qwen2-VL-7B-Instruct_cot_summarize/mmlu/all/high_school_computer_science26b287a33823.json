This alone is sufficient to make the entire expression true.\n\n### Condition 2: `a < b && !(a == c)`\n- This condition requires two things:\n  1. `a < b`\n  2. `!(a == c)` ( which means `a != c`\n\n- If `a < b`, then the second part of the expression (`a < b`) is true.\n- If `a != c`, then the third part of the expression (`!(a == c)`) is true.\n\n- Therefore, if both `a < b` and `a != c` are true, then the entire second part of the expression is true.\n\n### Combining the two conditions:\n- If `a < c`, then the entire expression is true.\n- If `a < b` and `a != c`, then the entire expression is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe condition that is sufficient to guarantee that the expression `a < c || a < b && !(a == c)` evaluates to true is:\n\nA. `a < c`\n\nThis is because `a < c` directly satisfies the first part of the expression, making the entire expression true."
