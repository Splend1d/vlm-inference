Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?\n\nA. No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.\nB. No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.\nC. Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.\nD. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n"

Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n\nThe prosecutor's proposed cross-examination is proper because it falls under the category of impeachment for prior inconsistency. This type of cross-examination is allowed to challenge the witness's credibility by showing that the witness did not mention the defendant's alibi statement when the police asked her about it. This inconsistency can be used to suggest that the witness may not be truthful or may have a motive to not mention the alibi statement."
