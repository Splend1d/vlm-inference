So, a 28-pound bag of dog food is:\n\n\\[ 28 \\, \\text{pounds} \\times 16 \\, \\text{ounces/pound} = 448 \\, \\text{ounces} \\]\n\nNow, since each serving is 8 ounces, we divide the total ounces by the serving size to find the number of servings:\n\n\\[ \\frac{448 \\, \\text{ounces}}{8 \\, \\text{ounces/serving} = 56 \\, \\text{servingsings} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 56"
