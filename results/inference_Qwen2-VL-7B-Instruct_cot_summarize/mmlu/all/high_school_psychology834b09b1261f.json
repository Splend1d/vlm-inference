Which of the following research method choices (and the rationale for the choice) is the most appropriate?\n\nA. Experiment-the most convenient and ethical way to study online bullying is to randomly assign half of the participants to a group who experiences the independent variable (online bullying).\nB. Correlation-it would be unethical to purposefully expose middle school students to bullying behaviors, so Professor Ek should examine variables that correlate with existing instances of online bullying.\nC. Naturalistic observation-observing instances of online bullying by monitoring middle school students' social networking behavior would provide the most accurate data and not raise important privacy concerns, because social networks are considered \"public\" space.\nD. Survey-self-reports about online bullying behaviors and responses to these behaviors would likely provide the most accurate descriptions of bullying and its impact.\n"

Correlation - it would be unethical to purposefully expose middle school students to bullying behaviors, so Professor Ek should examine variables that correlate with existing instances of online bullying.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Experiment (** While an experiment might seem convenient and ethical, it involves randomly assigning participants to groups, which could potentially expose them to bullying. This method is not ethical because it would involve intentionally exposing students to a harmful behavior.\n- **Naturalistic Observation** While observing instances of online bullying might provide accurate data, it raises significant privacy concerns. Social networks are often considered \"public\" spaces, but they can also be highly sensitive and private. Observing without consent could infringe on students' privacy and ethical standards.\n- **Survey** Self-reports about online bullying behaviors and responses to these behaviors could provide valuable insights. However, self-reports can be biased and may not always accurately reflect the true experiences of the participants, especially in sensitive topics like bullying.\n\n**Correlation Study:**\n- A correlation study would allow Professor Ek to examine variables that are already present in the students' online behavior. By looking at existing instances of online bullying, Professor Ek can identify patterns, risk factors, and correlates without intentionally exposing students to bullying. This method is ethical and provides valuable insights into the factors that might contribute to online bullying behaviors."
