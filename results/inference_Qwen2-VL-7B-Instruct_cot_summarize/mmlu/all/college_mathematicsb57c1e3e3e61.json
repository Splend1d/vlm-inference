The interval of convergence can be a finite interval, an infinite interval, or a single point.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(I) [\u22121, 3) - This is a finite interval from -1 to 3, not including 3. This could be a valid interval of convergence.\n\n(II) (\u2212\u221e, 0] - This is an infinite interval from negative infinity to positive infinity. This could also be a valid interval of convergence.\n\n(III) [2, 2] \u222a [3, 3] - This is a union of two single-point intervals, [2, 2] and [3, 3]. This is not a valid interval of convergence because an interval of convergence must be a connected set.\n\n(IV) (\u2212\u221e,\u221e) - This is an infinite interval from negative infinity to positive infinity.
