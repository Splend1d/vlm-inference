Dissection of the aorta\n\nThe patient's symptoms of severe substernal chest pain, tearing in quality, and radiation to the neck are consistent with a dissection of the aorta. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue, and it can lead to weakening of the aortic wall, making it more susceptible to dissection. Acute bacterial endocarditis typically presents with fever, chills, and other systemic symptoms, acute myocardial infarction with chest pain that is usually described as squeezing or crushing, and esophageal reflux with spasm with chest pain that is usually described as burning or discomfort."
