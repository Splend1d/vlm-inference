If this bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water, what would be the expected result?\n\nA. There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.\nB. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\nC. The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.\nD. The solute will flow out of the dialysis bag into the beaker.\n"

There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\n\nWhen the dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution is placed into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution, water will move from the beaker into the bag due to osmosis. This is because the beaker has a higher concentration of solute ( (0.6 M) compared to the dialysis bag ( (0.5 M). As a result, water will move through the semi-permeable membrane of the dialysis bag from the beaker into the bag, causing the bag to swell in size."
