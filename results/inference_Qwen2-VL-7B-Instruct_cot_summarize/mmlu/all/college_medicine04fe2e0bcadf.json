After first walking into a crowded room, you no longer are distracted by the buzz of conversation around you.\n\nSensory adaptation, or neural adaptation, refers to the process by which sensory receptors in the body become less responsive to a constant stimulus over time. This means that the sensation of the stimulus decreases or disappears.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. After putting on a shirt, you eventually no longer feel the sensation of the fabric on your back.\n- This is an example of sensory adaptation because the sensation of the fabric on your back decreases over time.\n\nC. After first walking outside on a sunny day, you no longer are blinded by the initial brightness of the light.\n- This is also an example of sensory adaptation because your eyes become less sensitive to the bright light over time.\n\nD. After first walking into an anatomy lab, you no longer notice the smell of formaldehyde.\n- This is also an example of sensory adaptation because your sense of smell becomes less sensitive to the formaldehyde smell over time.\n\nOption B describes a change in behavior rather than a change in sensory perception. It refers to the distraction caused by the buzz of conversation decreasing over time, which is more related to habituation or attention rather than sensory adaptation."
