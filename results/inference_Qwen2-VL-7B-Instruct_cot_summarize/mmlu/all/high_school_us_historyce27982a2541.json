The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business.\"\n\u2014The New York Times, October 15, 1905\nWhich of the following groups would have most likely supported the scenario described in this passage?\n\nA. Ku Klux Klan.\nB. American Temperance Union.\nC. National Woman Suffrage Association.\nD. Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which group would have most likely supported the scenario described in the passage, let's analyze the context and the core message of the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses how economic necessity has led to significant changes in social norms, particularly regarding women's roles and eating habits. It mentions that women are now eating in public, unescorted by men, which is a new social phenomenon. This suggests a shift in societal norms and a move towards greater independence for women.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Ku Klux Klan**: The Ku Klux Klan is known for its racist and anti-Semitic views, as well as its opposition to women's rights and social changes. They would likely oppose the described scenario, as it challenges traditional gender roles and social norms.\n\nB. **American Temperance Union**: The American Temperance Union was focused on the prohibition of alcohol consumption. While they might have supported changes in social norms, their primary focus was on alcohol, not necessarily on women's roles or eating habits.\n\nC. **National Woman Suffrage Association**: The National Woman Suffrage Association was dedicated to securing women's right to vote and advocating for women's rights. The passage describes a shift in women's roles and independence, which aligns with the goals of the National Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nD. **Southern Christian Leadership Conference**: The Southern Christian Leadership Conference was primarily concerned with civil rights and equality, particularly for African Americans. While they might have supported broader social changes, their focus was more on racial equality rather than specifically on women's roles and eating habits.\n\nGiven the passage's emphasis on women's independence and social changes, the group that would most likely support the scenario described is the National Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC. National Woman Suffrage Association."
