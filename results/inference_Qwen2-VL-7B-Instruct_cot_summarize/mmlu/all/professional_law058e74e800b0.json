                    "text": "A creditor instituted a garnishment action against a woman who owed the creditor a back due debt. This was the first action taken, and the creditor did not have a judgment. It served the notice of garnishment on the garnishee, the woman's employer. The employer honored the notice by holding all of the woman's earnings in escrow pending the creditor's lawsuit and entrance of final judgment against the woman. The state where defendant lived and worked had a provision for pre-judgment garnishment, as long as the money was held and not distributed until a judgment was entered. The money would be paid to the woman if a judgment was not entered with the next 120 days. The woman sued the employer and the creditor, demanding release of her earnings. Will the court order the garnishee to release the funds to the woman?\n\nA. No, because the state procedure for protecting the woman's money until a judgment is entered is a fair one that comports with procedural due process.\nB. No, because the state has an interest in protecting the rights of creditors to collect debts through the garnishment procedure.\nC. Yes, because the only party that has garnishment rights in the United States is the Internal Revenue Service.\nD. Yes, because the interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violates procedural due process.\n"

Yes, because the interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violates procedural due process.\n\nThe court is likely to order the garnishee to release the funds to the woman because the interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violates her procedural due process rights. The state's provision for pre-judgment garnishment, while it may be fair in terms of protecting creditors' rights, does not provide the woman with an opportunity to contest the garnishment before her earnings are frozen. This lack of a hearing violates her right to due process, which requires that individuals be given an opportunity to be heard before the government deprives them of a significant property interest. Therefore, the court would likely order the garnishee to release the funds to the woman."
