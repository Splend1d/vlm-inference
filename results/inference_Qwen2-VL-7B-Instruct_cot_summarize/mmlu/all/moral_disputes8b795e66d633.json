This is because as the population grows, the demand for resources increases, which can lead to a decrease in the availability of those resources. This can then lead to a series of emergency situations, such as food shortages, water scarcity, and other environmental problems, which can further exacerbate the problem of overpopulation. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
