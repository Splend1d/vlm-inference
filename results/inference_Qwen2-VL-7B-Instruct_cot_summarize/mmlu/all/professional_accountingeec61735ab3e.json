The company estimates that it will sell one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold. This means the sales mix is 1:4 (DVD players:Home Entertainment Systems.\n\nLet's assume the company sells \\( x \\) units of DVD players and \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\) units of Home Entertainment Systems. The total contribution margin per unit sold is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Contribution Margin} = (40x + 140\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Contribution Margin} = 40x + 35x \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Contribution Margin} = 75x \\]\n\nThe break-even point in units is calculated by dividing the total fixed costs by the weighted average contribution margin per unit:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even Point ( Units} = \\frac{\\text{Total Fixed Costs}}{\\text{Total Contribution Margin per Unit}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even Point = Units} = \\frac{90000}{75} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even Point = Units} = 1200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the company needs to sell 1200 units of DVD players to break even.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 1200"
