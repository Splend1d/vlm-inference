At the beginning of the lease term, the tenant installed numerous appliances in the building as well as a large air-conditioning system. The tenant alone paid for these items; they were installed with the landlord's permission and were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise. At the end of the lease term, the tenant failed to vacate the premises in a timely manner and continued to pay rent while remaining in possession for another four months. Before vacating the building at the end of the fourth month, the tenant removed the appliances and the air-conditioning system that he had installed, causing no damage to the building. Was the removal by the tenant proper?\n\nA. No, because he was a holdover tenant.\nB. No, because the lease was oral.\nC. Yes, because they were accessions.\nD. Yes, because they were trade fixtures.\n"

Yes, because they were trade fixtures.\n\nIn commercial lease agreements, trade fixtures are items that are specifically installed for the purpose of conducting business and are typically considered to be the property of the tenant. Trade fixtures are generally not considered to be personal property and are not subject to the same rules as personal property when it comes to removal at the end of a lease term. \n\nIn this case, the tenant installed numerous appliances and a large air-conditioning system with the landlord's permission, and these items were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that these items were trade fixtures. As such, the tenant would be entitled to remove them at the end of the lease term without incurring any liability for damage to the building."
