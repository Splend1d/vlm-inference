It encourages liberalization of global trade\n\nAmerican exceptionalism, which refers to the belief that the United States is uniquely superior and has a special role to play in the world, has historically influenced U.S. foreign policy and economic relations. In terms of global economics, this belief has often led to a push for liberalization of global trade. This means reducing trade barriers and promoting free trade, which can lead to increased economic growth and prosperity for all countries involved."
