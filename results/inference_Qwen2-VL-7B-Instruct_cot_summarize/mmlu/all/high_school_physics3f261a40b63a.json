                    "text": "To determine the acceleration of the toy car and the toy truck during the collision, we need to consider the principles of conservation of momentum and Newton's second law of motion.\n\n1. **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. Let's denote:\n   - \\( m \\) as the mass of the toy car\n   - \\( at \\) as the mass of the toy truck ( (double the mass of the toy car)\n   - \\( v_c \\) as the velocity of the toy car before the collision\n   - \\( v_tr \\) as the velocity of the toy truck before the collision\n\n   The total momentum before the collision is:\n   \\[\n   m \\cdot v_c + at \\cdot v_tr\n   \\]\n\n   After the collision, let's denote:\n   - \\( v'_c \\) as the velocity of the toy car after the collision\n   - \\( v'_t \\) as the velocity of the toy truck after the collision\n\n   The total momentum after the collision is:\n   \\[\n   ic \\cdot v'_c + at \\cdot v'_t\n   \\]\n\n   Since momentum is conserved:\n   \\[\n   ic \\cdot v_c + at \\cdot v_tr = ic \\cdot v'_c + at \\cdot v'_t\n   \\]\n\n2. **Newton's's Second Law**: The acceleration \\( a \\) is given by the change in momentum over time:\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}\n   \\]\n\n   For the toy car:\n   \\[\n   a_c = \\frac{ic \\cdot (v'_c - ic \\cdot v_c}{\\Delta t}\n   \\]\n\n   For the toy truck:\n   \\[\n   a_t = \\frac{at \\cdot v'_t - at \\cdot v_tr}{\\Delta t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Comparing Accelerations**: We need to compare the magnitudes of \\( a_c \\) and \\( a_t \\).\n\n   Since the masses are in the ratio 1:2, the accelerations will be in the inverse ratio:\n   \\[\n   a_c = \\frac{1}{2} a_t\n   \\]\n\n   This means the acceleration of the toy car will be half the magnitude of the acceleration of the toy truck.\n\n4. **Direction of Acceleration**: The direction of the acceleration depends on the direction of the collision. If the collision is in the same direction, both accelerations will be in the same direction. If the collision is in the opposite direction, both accelerations will be in the opposite direction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. half the magnitude and in the same direction"
