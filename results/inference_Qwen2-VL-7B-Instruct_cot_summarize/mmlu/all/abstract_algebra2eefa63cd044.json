For the polynomial \\(4x - 2\\), we can factor it as \\(2(2x - 1)\\). Since this can be factored into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients, the polynomial is reducible over Z. Therefore, Statement 1 is **False**.\n\n2. **Irreducibility over Q**. A polynomial is irreducible over the rationals numbers (Q) if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients. The polynomial \\(4x - 2\\) can be rewritten as \\(2(2x - 1)\\). Since this can be factored into two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients, the polynomial is reducible over Q. Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
