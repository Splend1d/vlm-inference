If `a` is `0`, it executes the block from line 3 to line 4. If `a` is not `0`, it executes the block from line 5 to line 8.\n\n1. **Line 1:** `IF (a = 0)`\n   - This checks if `a` is `0`.\n\n2. **Line 2:** `{`\n   - This is the start of the block if `a` is `0`.\n\n3. **Line 3:** `b \u2190 a + 10`\n   - If `a` is `0`, this line will execute and set `b` to `10`.\n\n4. **Line 4:** `}`\n   - This is the end of the block if `a` is `0`.\n\n5. **Line 5:** `ELSE`\n   - This is the start of the block if `a` is not `0`.\n\n6. **Line 6:** `{`\n   - This is the start of the block if `a` is not `0`.\n\n7. **Line 7:** `b \u2190 a + 20`\n   - If `a` is not `0`, this line will execute and set `b` to `a + 20`.\n\n8. **Line 8:** `}`\n   - This is the end of the block if `a` is not `0`.\n\nNow let's analyze each change:\n\nA. **Changing line 3 to `b \u2190 10`**\n   - This will always set `b` to `10`, regardless of the value of `a`. This will affect the result if `a` is not `0`.\n\nB. **Changing line 3 to `a \u2190 b + 10`**\n   - This will change the value of `a` to `b + 10`, which will affect the result if `a` is not `0`.\n\nC. **Changing line 7 to `b \u2190 20`**\n   - This will always set `b` to `20`, regardless of the value of `a`. This will affect the result if `a` is `0`.\n\nD. **Changing line 7 to `a \u2190 b + 10`**\n   - This will change the value of `a` to `b + 10`, which will affect the result if `a` is `0`.\n\nNone of the changes will affect the result if `a` is `0`. Therefore, the change that will NOT affect the results when the code segment is executed is:\n\n**Final answer: A. Changing line 3 to `b \u2190 10`**"
