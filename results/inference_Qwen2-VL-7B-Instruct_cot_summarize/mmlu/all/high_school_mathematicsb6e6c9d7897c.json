When we replace \\( x \\) with \\( 2x \\), the function \\( 3\\sin 2x \\) will still accept all real numbers as inputs because \\( 2x \\) will still span all real numbers as \\( x \\) spans all real numbers. Therefore, the domain remains the same.\n\n### Range\n\nThe range of \\( \\sin x \\) is \\([-1, 1]\\). When we multiply \\( \\sin 2x \\) by 3, the amplitude of the sine function is tripled. This means the maximum value of \\( 3\\sin 2x \\) is 3 and the minimum value is -3. Therefore, the range of \\( 3\\sin 2x \\) is \\([-3, 3]\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The domain remains the same.\n- The range is tripled.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Domain is the same; range is tripled"
