Only the guilty were guilty.\nChildren of killers are not killers but children. I have neither the desire nor the authority to judge today's generation for the unspeakable crimes committed by the generation of Hitler.\nBut we may\u2014and we must\u2014hold it responsible, not for the past, but for the way it remembers the past. And for what it does with the memory of the past. In remembering, you will help your own people vanquish the ghosts that hover over its history. Remember: a community that does not come to terms with the dead will continue to traumatize the living.\nWe remember Auschwitz and all that it symbolizes because we believe that, in spite of the past and its horrors, the world is worthy of salvation; and salvation, like redemption, can be found only in memory.\nElie Wiesel, \"Reflections of a Survivor,\" 1987\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Wiesel believed that the current generation of Germans\n\nA. shared their ancestors' guilt for the Holocaust\nB. had a responsibility to remember the Holocaust\nC. shared in the responsibility for the Holocaust\nD. had no responsibility where the Holocaust was concerned\n"

Elie Wiesel emphasizes the importance of remembering the past and the role of memory in overcoming the trauma of history.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Shared their ancestors' guilt for the Holocaust\" - The passage does not explicitly state that the current generation of Germans shared their ancestors' guilt. It focuses more on the responsibility to remember and the importance of memory.\n   - **Option B**: \"Had a responsibility to remember the Holocaust\" - This alignss with the passage's emphasis on remembering the Holocaust and its importance in overcoming the trauma of history.\n   - **Option C**: \"Shared in the responsibility for the Holocaust\" - The passage does not suggest that the current generation shares in the responsibility for the Holocaust. It focuses on the responsibility to remember, not on sharing the guilt.\n   - **Option D**: \"Had no responsibility where the Holocaust was concerned\" - This contradicts the passage, which clearly states that the current generation has a responsibility to remember and come to terms with the past.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer**: Based on the analysis, the most accurate inference from the passage is that Elie Wiesel believed the current generation of Germans had a responsibility to remember the Holocaust.\n\n**Final Answer: B. Had a responsibility to remember the Holocaust**"
