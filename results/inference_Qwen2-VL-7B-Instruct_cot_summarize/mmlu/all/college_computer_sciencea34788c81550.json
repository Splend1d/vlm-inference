In an AVL tree, the height of the tree is guaranteed to be logarithmic in the number of nodes. Therefore, the worst-case search time, which is directly related to the height of the tree, is also logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\n II. **Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.**\n   - This statement is also true. The average-case search time in an AVL tree is also logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because the tree is balanced, and the average height of a node in a balanced tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\n III. **Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree.**\n   - This statement is true. The best-case search time in an AVL tree is proportional to the height of the tree. This is because the best-case scenario involves searching for the root node, which is the node with the smallest height.\n\n IV. **The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes.**\n   - This statement is true. In an AVL tree, the height of the tree is guaranteed to be logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is a defining property of AVL trees.\n\nGiven the analysis, all statements I, II, III, and IV are true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I, II, and IV"
