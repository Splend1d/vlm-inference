                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The heat of solution for cerium(III) sulfate is endothermic.\n\nWhen a substance dissolves in water, the process is typically endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat from the surroundings. This is because the dissolution process involves breaking the intermolecular bonds of the solid substance and forming new bonds with water molecules. The heat of solution is the energy required to overcome these intermolecular forces and form the solution.\n\nGiven that cerium(III) sulfate is less soluble in hot water than in cold, it indicates that the process of dissolving cerium(III) sulfate in water is endothermic. This means that the dissolution process requires more heat to occur at higher temperatures, which is why it dissolves less in hot water compared to cold water.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\nC. The heat of solution for cerium(III) sulfate is endothermic."
