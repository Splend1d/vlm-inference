Tracking the number of products reworked.\n\nTracking the number of products reworked is an effective technique for measuring improvements in product quality as a result of internal failure costs. When a product fails during the manufacturing process, it is typically reworked to correct the issue. By tracking the number of products that require rework, organizations can identify trends and areas for improvement in their manufacturing processes. This can help to reduce the number of internal failures and improve overall product quality."
