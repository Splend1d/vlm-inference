Sulfurous acid is a weak acid, which means it does not completely ionize in water. The ionization process can be represented as:\n\n\\[ \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3(aq) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^+(aq) + \\text{HSO}_3^-(aq) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{HSO}_3^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^+(aq) + \\text{SO}_3^{2-}(aq) \\]\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that sulfurous acid ionizes in two steps, with the first step being the predominant one. This means that the concentration of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3\\) will be much lower than the concentration of \\(\\text{HSO}_3^-\\), and the concentration of \\(\\text{HSO}_3^-\\\\) will be much lower than the concentration of \\(\\text{SO}_3^{2-}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct order of concentrations is:\n\n\\[ [\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3] < [\\text{HSO}_3^-] < [\\text{SO}_3^{2-}] \\]\n\nThis corresponds to option B:\n\n\\[ [\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3] > [\\text{HSO}_3^-] > [\\text{SO}_3^{2-}] \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is B."
