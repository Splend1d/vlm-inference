                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and how they interact when applied in an alternating sequence. Let's start by examining the functions:\n\n1. $f(x) = \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$\n2. $g(x(x)) = \\frac{-2}{x+1}$\n\nGiven that $f$ is applied 8 times and $g$ is applied 8 times, we can see that the sequence alternates between $f$ and $g$. Let's denote the number of times $f$ is applied as $n_f$ and the number of times $g$ is applied as $n_g$. In this case, $n_f = 8$ and $n_g = 8$.\n\nTo find the value of $g(f(g(f(\\dotsb g(f(f(12)) \\dotsb )))))$, we need to understand how these functions behave when applied in sequence. Let's start by applying $f$ and $g$ to the initial value of 12.\n\nFirst, apply $f$ to 12:\n\\[f(12) = \\frac{1+12}{1-12} = \\frac{13}{-11} = -\\frac{13}{11}\\]\n\nNext, apply $g$ to the result:\n\\[g(-\\frac{13}{11}) = \\frac{-2}{-\\frac{13}{11}+1} = \\frac{-2}{-\\frac{13}{11}+\\frac{11}{11}} = \\frac{-2}{-\\\\frac{2}{11}} = 11\\]\n\nNow, we have the result of applying $g$ once to the result of applying $f$ once. We can see that applying $g$ to the result of applying $f$ once gives us back the original value of 12. This suggests that the sequence of applying $f$ and then $g$ might have a repeating pattern.\n\nLet's apply $f$ and $g$ again to the result of the previous step:\n\\[f(11) = \\frac{1+11}{1-11} = \\frac{12}{-10} = -\\frac{6}{5}\\]\n\\[g(-\\frac{6}{5}) = \\frac{-2}{-\\frac{6}{5}+1} = \\frac{-2}{-\\\\frac{6}{5}+\\frac{5}{5}} = \\frac{-2}{-\\\\frac{1}{5}} = 10\\]\n\nWe notice that applying $f$ and then $g$ to the result of applying $f$ and $g$ once gives us back the original value of 12. This\n\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that the sequence of applying $f$ and $g$ in this manner will eventually lead us back to the original value of 12 after a certain number of applications. Since we are applying each function 8 times, we can see that the sequence will repeat every 2 applications ( because $f$ and $g$ together form a cycle of 2 steps.\n\nTherefore, applying $f$ and $g$ 8 times will bring us back to the original value of 12. The correct answer is:\n\nA. 12"
