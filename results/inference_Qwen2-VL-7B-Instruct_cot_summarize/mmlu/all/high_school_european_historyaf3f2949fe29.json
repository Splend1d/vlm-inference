One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nVoltaire is best known for supporting which of the following demands of the Enlightenment philosophes?\n\nA. Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion.\nB. Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity.\nC. Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information.\nD. Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which demand of the Enlightenment philosophes Voltaire is best known for supporting, we need to analyze the quote provided and understand its context and implications.\n\nVoltaire's quote reflects a critical view of the Lisbon earthquake and its devastating impact on human life and property. He expresses a sense of cruelty in nature and questions the fairness of human life, suggesting that the game of human life is a wretched gamble. He also also criticizes the Inquisition and implies that religious persecution leads to suffering and destruction.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion.\n- Voltaire was a Deist, but this option focuses on his belief in Deism rather than his broader views on religious toleration.\n\nB. Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity.\n- This option suggests that Voltaire believed religious toleration would lead to social disunity, which is not directly supported by the quote. Voltaire seems to be more concerned with the suffering caused by religious persecution rather than its impact on social unity.\n\nC. Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information.\n- Voltaire was known for his skepticism, but this option focuses on skepticism itself rather than his views on religious toleration.\n\nD. Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.\n- This is the most relevant option. Voltaire's quote reflects his belief in religious toleration, as he criticizes the Inquisition and implies that religious persecution leads to suffering and destruction. This aligns with the broader demand of the Enlightenment philosophes for religious toleration.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best answer is:\n\nD. Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions."
