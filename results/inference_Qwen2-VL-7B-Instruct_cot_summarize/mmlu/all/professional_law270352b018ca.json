The retailer stayed in possession and became the lessee for the next 25 years with monthly payments and various obligations regarding maintaining the property. The retailer had to pay most of the expenses on the property, and had options for further extensions but not to purchase the property back. Within a few years, lessee's business grew and he wanted to tear down one of the buildings and attach a new building to his store. The investor refused to consent. Lessee filed suit asking for an order compelling compliance. Will the court likely order the investor to comply with the lessor's demands?\n\nA. No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.\nB. Yes, the lessee will be able to make the improvements without the investor's consent but the improvements will belong to the investor.\nC. No, because in every sale-leaseback agreement, there is a clause guaranteeing that the lessee cannot make improvements without the written consent of the investor.\nD. Yes, because the lessee's equity interest surpasses the investor's interest, giving the lessee the right to make improvements.\n"

No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.\n\nIn a sale-leaseback arrangement, the lessee typically retains the right to make improvements to the property, but this right is subject to the terms and conditions specified in the lease agreement. If the lease agreement explicitly prohibits the lessee from making certain improvements without the investor's consent, the court is likely to uphold this restriction. The lessee's desire to make improvements does not necessarily override the terms of the lease agreement, especially if the investor has a valid reason to refuse consent, such as the potential impact on the property's value or the investor's financial interests."
