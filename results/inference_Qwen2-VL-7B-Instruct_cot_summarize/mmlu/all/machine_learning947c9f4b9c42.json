This is because with a smaller dataset, the model may learn the noise and random fluctuations in the training data, leading to poor generalization to unseen data.\n\nStatement 2 is False. Overfittingting is more likely when the hypothesis space is large. A larger hypothesis space allows the model to fit the training data more closely, which can lead to overfittingting. This is because a larger hypothesis space can capture more complex patterns in the data, including those that are not generalizable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
