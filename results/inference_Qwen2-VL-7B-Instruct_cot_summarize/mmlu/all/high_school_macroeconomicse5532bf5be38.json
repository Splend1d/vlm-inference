This is because an expansionary gap occurs when the actual output is below the potential output, indicating that there is excess capacity in the economy. By increasing aggregate demand, the economy can utilize this excess capacity and move towards full employment. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the right."
