Although the agreement worked well at 1,000 watches per month, the manufacturer expanded its plant capacity and produced 2500 watches per month. The wholesaler could no longer pay for that volume of watches. The manufacturer sued the wholesaler to compel it to buy its full output each month as required by the contract. will the court likely grant the manufacturer's request?\n\nA. No, because the expansion is a disproportionate increase in product that exceeds contractual estimates and cannot be handled by the buyer.\nB. Yes, because doubling the size of the output contract is not unreasonable and is only 500 more the top estimated limit.\nC. Yes, a doubling of the output contract in these circumstances meets a good faith standard and is reasonable.\nD. No, because a change of more than 10% is considered to be unreasonable and the basis for a breach of contract.\n"

The agreement specifies that the wholesaler agrees to purchase all watches made each month within that range, and a doubling of the output is within that range. Additionally, the court may consider the good faith standard and reasonableness of the increase, which in this case, the doubling of the output is reasonable and within the estimated range."
