This means the number must be a common multiple of 5, 3, and 2.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM of 5, 3, and 2 is the smallest number that is divisible by all three numbers. \n\nTo find the LCM of 5, 3, and 2, we can use the prime factorization method:\n\n- The prime factorization of 5 is 5.\n- The prime factorization of 3 is 3.\n- The prime factorization of 2 is 2.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:\n\nLCM = 5^1 * 3^1 * 2^1 = 5 * 3 * 2 = 30\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of candy that could be in Lily's bag is 30.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 30"
