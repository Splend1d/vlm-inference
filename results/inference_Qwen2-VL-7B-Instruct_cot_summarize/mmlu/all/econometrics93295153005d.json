The Engle-Granger (EG) approach can only detect up to one cointegrant relationship even though there could be more than one.\n\nThe Engle-Yoo (EY) procedure, also known as the Engle-Yoo-Bierstein ( EYB) procedure, addresses the limitation of the Engle-Granger (EG) approach by allowing for the detection of multiple cointegrating relationships. This is a significant improvement because the EG approach was limited to identifying only one cointegrating relationship."
