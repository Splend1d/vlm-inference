                    "text": "To determine which political sentiment is most similar to the one expressed in the given text, we need to analyze the content and context of the statement. The passage describes a situation where the commanding officer has absolute power, reducing the population to slavery. This suggests a strong authoritarian or totalitarian sentiment.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. Justice Frank Murphy's dissent in the Supreme Court case, Korematsu v. United States in 1944.\n   - This case involved the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Justice Murphy dissented, arguing that the internment was unconstitutional and violated the rights of the individuals involved. This aligns with a stance against authoritarianism and the protection of individual rights, which contrasts with the given passage.\n\nB. U.S. Army lawyer Joseph Welsh's opposition to Senator Joseph McCarthy in the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954.\n   - McCarthyism was characterized by the use of fear and intimidation to silence political opponents. Welsh's opposition to McCarthy aligns with a stance against authoritarianism and the protection of individual rights, which contrasts with the given passage.\n\nC. Governor Orval Faubus's response to the steps taken by President Dwight Eisenhower to resolve the Little Rock crisis in 1957.\n   - The Little Rock crisis involved the integration of a school in Little Rock, Arkansas, which was met with resistance from Governor Faubus. His actions were seen as an attempt to maintain segregation and resist federal authority. This align with a stance against integration and federal intervention, which contrasts with the given passage.\n\nD. John Lewis's endorsement of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.\n   - The Voting Rights Act was a significant civil rights law that aimed to overcome racial barriers to voter registration and participation. John Lewis's endorsement align with a stance for civil rights and the protection of individual rights, which contrasts with the given passage.\n\nGiven the analysis, the political sentiment of the given passage is most similar to the stance against authoritarianism and the protection of individual rights. This align with the stance of Justice Frank Murphy and Joseph Welsh, who both opposed authoritarian actions.\n\nTherefore, the most similar political sentiment is:\n\nA. Justice Frank Murphy's dissent in the Supreme Court case, Korematsu v. United States in 1944."
