Congress has enacted the statute solely for the purpose of enabling members of Congress to travel back and forth to the Capital without being tied up in heavy traffic each day. Before Congress enacted this law, the Washington, D. C. , City Council had previously passed an ordinance designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street?\n\nA. It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.\nB. It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.\nC. It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.\nD. It is invalid because it is a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.\n"

It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle of federal preemption, which allows federal laws to take precedence over conflicting state or local laws. Congress has exclusive authority over the District of Columbia, and it has enacted a statute that directly affects the use of Pennsylvania Avenue, which is within the District. Therefore, the federal statute is valid as it is within Congress's exclusive power over the District of Columbia."
