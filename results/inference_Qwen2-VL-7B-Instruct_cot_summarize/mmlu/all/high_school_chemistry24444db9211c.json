                    "text": "To determine which of these molecules has the highest normal boiling point, we need to consider the factors that influence boiling points. The boiling point of a molecule is generally influenced by its molecular weight, polarity, and intermolecular forces.\n\n1. **Molecular Weight**: The higher the molecular weight, the higher the boiling point. However, this is not the only determining factor.\n\n2. **Polarity**: Polar molecules tend to have higher boiling points due to stronger intermolecular forces ( such as hydrogen bonding.\n\n3. **Intermolecular Forces**: These include hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and London dispersion forces. Hydrogen bonding is particularly strong and can significantly increase the boiling point.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **CH3CH2 ch2 ch3 (** ( This is a nonpolar hydrocarbon with no functional groups. It has the lowest boiling point due to the lack of intermolecular forces.\n\nB. ** ch3 ch2 ch2 ch2 oh** This is a polar molecule due to the presence of an alcohol group ( (OH). It has hydrogen bonding, which increases its boiling point.\n\nC. ** ch3 ch2 ch2 ch2 cl** This is a polar molecule due to the presence of a chlorine atom. It has dipole-dipole interactions and some London dispersion forces, but not as strong as hydrogen bonding.\n\nD. ** ch3 ch2 ch2 ch2 br** This is a polar molecule due to the presence of a bromine atom. It has dipole-dipole interactions and some London dispersion forces, but not as strong as hydrogen bonding.\n\nGiven these points, **B. CH3CH2 ch2 ch2 OH** is expected to have the highest normal boiling point because it has hydrogen bonding, which is the strongest intermolecular force among the options provided."
