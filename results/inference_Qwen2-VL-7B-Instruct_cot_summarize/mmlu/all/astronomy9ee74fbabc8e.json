Mars shows evidence of significant volcanism which implies that the climate was once warmer and therefore wetter\nB. early observations showed what appeared to be changing vegetation patterns and canals indicating the presence of water\nC. there are many geologic features on Mars that are difficult to explain unless liquid water was once stable at the surface\nD. all planets tend to begin with warm wet climates and gradually become cold and dry with smaller planets cooling faster than larger planets\n"

Mars has numerous geologic features, such as river valleys, delta deposits, and sedimentary layers, that suggest the presence of liquid water in the past. These features are challenging to explain without the presence of liquid water, which implies that Mars was once warmer and wetter."
