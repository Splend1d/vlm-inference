One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given?\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\nB. Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\nD. Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which Enlightenment philosopher questioned reliance on reason and began the the Romantic Movement for the rationale given, we need to analyze the quote provided by Voltaire and understand the context of the quote.\n\nVoltaire's quote reflects a sense of the cruelty of nature and the unpredictability of human life, suggesting that reason alone cannot fully comprehend the complexities and tragedies of the world. He also questions the reliance on reason and suggests that it might be more appropriate to rely on emotions and empathy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\n- Rousseau did question the corruptingive nature of society and emphasized the importance of natural instincts and emotions over reason. This aligns with Voltaire's sentiment of questioning the reliance on reason.\n\nB. Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.\n- Montesquieu focused on the separation of powers and the role of government in society. While he did question the fairness of governments, his primary focus was on political structures rather than questioning the reliance on reason.\n\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\n- Wollstonecraft was a strong advocate for women's rights and emphasized the importance of emotional intelligence and empathy. However, her primary focus was on gender equality rather than questioning the reliance on reason.\n\nD. Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels.\n- Smith's work focused on the economic principles of of supply and demand and the division of labor. He did not question the reliance on reason in the same way Voltaire did.\n\nGiven the context of Voltaire's quote and the focus on questioning the reliance on reason, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\n\nThis aligns best with Voltaire's sentiment of questioning the reliance on reason and suggesting a more emotional approach to understanding the world."
