However, to simplify it further, we can convert it into an improper fraction.\n\nThe mixed number \"1 and 1/11\" can be converted to an improper fraction by multiplying the whole number by the denominator and then adding the numerator:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 11 + 1 = 11 + 1 = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the fraction is 12/11.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 12 over 11"
