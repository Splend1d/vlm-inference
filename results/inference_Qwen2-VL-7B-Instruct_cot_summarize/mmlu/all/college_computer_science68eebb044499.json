Datagrams at the source must be the size of the smallest maximum transmission unit (MTU) of all the links on a path to the destination.\n   - This statement is false. In IPv4, datagrams are not required to be the size of the smallest MTU on the path. Instead, they can be fragmented to fit the smallest MTU along the path.\n\n ii. Datagrams may be fragmented during routing.\n   - This statement is true. In IPv4, datagrams can be fragmented to fit the smallest MTU along the path to the destination. This fragmentation occurs at routers along the path.\n\n iii. Datagrams are reassembled only at the destination.\n   - This statement is true. In IPv4, datagrams are reassembled only at the destination. This reassembly is performed by the host at the destination.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. II and III"
