High parental investment\n\nGiven that the small rodents have a litter size of two or three, which is relatively small compared to other species, it is likely that they exhibit high parental investment. This means they invest a significant amount of time and energy into caring for their young, which can include tasks such as feeding, protection, and teaching survival skills. This is a common trait in species where young are born in small numbers and require significant care to survive."
