A compact space is one in which every open cover has a finite subcover. In metric spaces, compactness implies completeness. This is a well-known result in topology and analysis.\n\nB. Every complete space is compact.\n- This statement is false. A complete space is one in which every Cauchy sequence converges. However, there are complete spaces that are not compact. For example, the real numbers with the standard metric are complete but not compact.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Every compact space is complete."
