Granite, gabbro, diorite, quartz, feldspar\n- Granite, gabbro, and diorite are igneous rocks composed of minerals like quartz, feldspar, and mlivine.\n- Quartz and feldspar are minerals.\n- Therefore, this list includes both minerals and rocks.\n\nB. Gold, quartz, topaz, diamond, corundum\n- Gold, quartz, topaz, diamond, and corundum are all minerals.\n- Therefore, this list includes only minerals.\n\nC. Gneiss, schist, phyllite, chlorite, mica\n- Gneiss, schist, and phyllite are metamorphic rocks composed of minerals like quartz, feldspar, and mlivine.\n- Chlorite and mica are minerals.\n- Therefore, this list includes both minerals and rocks.\n\nD. Coal, chert, limestone, dolomite, halite\n- Coal is a sedimentary rock composed of organic material.\n- Chert, limestone, dolomite, and halite are all minerals.\n- Therefore, this list includes both minerals and rocks.\n\nThe list that includes minerals only is:\n\nB.
