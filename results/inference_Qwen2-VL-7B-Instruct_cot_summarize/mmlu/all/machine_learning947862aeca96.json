Semantic segmentation models predict the class of each pixel, while multiclass image classifiers predict the class of entire image.\n- This statement is true. Semantic segmentation assigns a class label to each pixel in an image, whereas multiclass image classifiers predict the class of the entire image.\n\nB. A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to $96\\%$ would likely be considered at true positive.\n- This statement is true. An IoU of 96% indicates a high overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box, which is typically considered a true positive.\n\nC. When a predicted bounding box does not correspond to any object in the scene, it is considered a false positive.\n- This statement is false. A false positive occurs when the predicted bounding box overlaps with the ground truth bounding box but does not correspond to any object in the scene. The statement incorrectly suggests that the absence of an object in the scene makes it a false positive.\n\nD. A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to $3\\%$ would likely be considered at false negative.\n- This statement is true. An IoU of 3% indicates a very low overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box, which is typically considered a false negative.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is:\n\nC. When a predicted bounding box does not correspond to any object in the scene, it is considered a false positive."
