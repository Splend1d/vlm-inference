                    "text": "To determine which pair of liquids is expected to be immiscible, we need to consider the nature of the liquids and their solubility properties. Immiscibility typically occurs when two liquids do not mix with each other, often due to differences in polarity, hydrogen bonding, or molecular structure.\n\nLet's analyze each pair:\n\nA. H2O and CH3OH ( (Water and Methanol)\n- Both water (H2O) and methanol (CH3OH) are polar molecules due to their hydrogen bonding capabilities. They are likely to be miscible because polar molecules tend to dissolve in each other.\n\nB. C6H6 and C5H12 ( (Benzene and Pentane)\n- Benzene (C6H6) is a nonpolar aromatic compound, while pentane (C5H12) is a nonpolar alkane. Nonpolar compounds generally do not mix well with each other, so these two are likely to be immiscible.\n\nC. C10H22 and CH2CH2CH2OH ( (Decane and Ethanol)\n- Decane (C10H22) is a nonpolar alkane, while ethanol (CH2CH2 ch2 oh) is a polar alcohol due to the presence of the hydroxyl group (OH. Polar compounds like ethanol tend to dissolve in polar solvents, but nonpolar compounds like decane generally do not mix well with polar solvents. Therefore, these two are likely to be immiscible.\n\nD. CH332NH2 and CH3322OH ( (Triethylamine and Ethanol)\n- Triethylamine (CH332NH2) is a polar amine, while ethanol ( ch3322OH) is a polar alcohol. Polar compounds like triethylamine and ethanol generally do not mix well with each other, so these two are likely to be immiscible.\n\nGiven the analysis, both pairs C and D are likely to be immiscible due to the differences in their polarities and hydrogen bonding capabilities.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the pair that is \"expected to be immiscible,\" and considering the options provided, the pair that is explicitly stated to be nonpolar (C6H6 and C5H12 ( (Benzene and Pentane) is the most straightforward example of immiscible liquids due to their nonpolar nature.\n\nTherefore, the pair expected to be immiscible is:\n\nB. C6H6 and C5H12 ( (Benzene and Pentane)"
