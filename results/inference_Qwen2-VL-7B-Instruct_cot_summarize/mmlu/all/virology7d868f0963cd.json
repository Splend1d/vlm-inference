The first group of pathologists, being aware of the race of the patient, might interpret the specimens differently based on their preconceived notions about race and disease, leading to an overreporting of hypertension nephropathy in black patients specimens. This bias is not due to the pathologists' inability to respond, not related to recall of past events, nor due to referral patterns."
