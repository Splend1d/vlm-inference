This scenario is used to illustrate a distinction between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Central Park qualifies as a state.\n- This option is incorrect because Central Park is a public space within a city, not a state.\n\nB. There is a difference between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory.\n- This option is correct. The example shows that the yoga group can set its own membership rules ( who can join the group - but it cannot control who uses the park as a whole. This highlights the difference between internal group rules and external physical space rules.\n\nC. Territorial rights only belong to individuals.\n- This option is incorrect because the example shows that while individuals can use the park, the group can set its own membership rules.\n\nD. Wellman is committed to an absurd theory of group membership.\n- This option is incorrect because the example is used to clarify a point about group membership, not to criticize Wellman's theory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. There is a difference between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory."
