Use the 88 who did respond, using 88 as the sample size in the analysis.\n\nThis approach is the most straightforward and least likely to introduce bias into the analysis. By using the 88 respondents, you are working with the data that was collected and can analyze it as intended. \n\nOption B would be misleading because it would imply that the sample size is larger than it actually is, which could lead to incorrect conclusions about the population.\n\nOption C is not feasible because it is not practical to attempt to contact the 32 non-respondents and get the information from them.\n\nOption D is not necessary because the 88 respondents already provide a representative sample of the population of interest. Adding more respondents would not improve the representativeness of the sample and could introduce additional complexity and cost without a clear benefit."
