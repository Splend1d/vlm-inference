Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures.\n- This statement is generally true. Horizontal microarchitecture typically requires more time steps because it uses microinstructions that are encoded, which means each microinstruction specifies multiple operations. In contrast, vertical microarchitecture uses macroinstructions that specify a single operation, which can be executed in fewer time steps.\n\nII. Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.\n- This statement is false. Horizontal microinstructions are encoded, meaning they specify multiple operations within a single instruction.\n\nIII. Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.\n- This statement is false. Horizontal microinstructions typically have multiple opcodes and multiple operand specifiers, allowing for the execution of multiple operations in a single instruction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. II only"
