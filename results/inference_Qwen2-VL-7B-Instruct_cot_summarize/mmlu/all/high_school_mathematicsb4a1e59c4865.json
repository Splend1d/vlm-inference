If the amount of paint needed to cover a cube is directly proportional to the surface area, then the amount of paint needed to cover a cube with side length $s$ is proportional to $6s^2$. \n\nGiven that David can completely cover a cube of side length 2 feet with exactly 16 quarts of paint, we can set up the proportion $\\frac{16}{6(2)^2} = \\frac{169}{6s^2}$. \n\nSolving for $s$, we get $s^2 = \\frac{169 \\cdot 6}{16 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{169}{16}$. \n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $s = \\frac{13}{4}$. \n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{4}}$."
