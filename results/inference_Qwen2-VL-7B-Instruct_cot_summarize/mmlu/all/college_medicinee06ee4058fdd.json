Cardiac muscle contraction\n\nMAPs are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and stability of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton. In cardiac muscle cells, microtubules play a critical role in the regulation of the contractile machinery, including the regulation of calcium ions and the movement of myofilaments. Therefore, a reduction in MAP function would likely disrupt the normal function of of cardiac muscle contraction."
