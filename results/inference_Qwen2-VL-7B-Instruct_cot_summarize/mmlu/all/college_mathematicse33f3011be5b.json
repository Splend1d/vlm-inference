We want to find the greatest possible value of \\(f(0)\\), where \\(0\\) is within the interval \\((-1, 4)\\).\n\nGiven \\(f'(x) \\geq -1\\), the slope of the tangent line to the curve \\(f(x)\\) at any point \\(x\\) in the interval \\((-1, 4)\\) is at least \\(-1\\). This means the function \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing at a rate of at least \\(-1\\) per unit of \\(x\\).\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\(f(0)\\), we consider the minimum rate of decrease, which is \\(-1\\). If \\(f'(x) = -1\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\((-1, 4)\\), then the function \\(f(x)\\) decreases linearly at a rate of \\(-1\\) per unit of \\(x\\).\n\nStarting from \\(f(3) = 5\\), if \\(f'(x) = -1\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\((-1, 4)\\), then\n\\[f(x) = f(3) + (-1)(x - 3)\\]\n\\[f(x) = 5 - (x - 3\\]\n\\[f(x) = 8 - x\\]\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\(f(0)\\), we substitute \\(x = 0\\) into the equation:\n\\[f(0) = 8 - 0 = 8\\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of \\(f(0)\\) is \\(8\\), which corresponds to option D."
