The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants.\nB. The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress.\nC. The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.\nD.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n\nWhen the chromosome number of a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously, the hybrid becomes euploid, meaning it has the correct number of chromosomes for its species. In this case, the hybrid would have the same number of chromosomes as the parental species, allowing the chromosomes to pair normally during meiosis. This pairing is essential for the production of viable gametes, which are necessary for sexual reproduction. Therefore, the descendants of such a hybrid plant would be able to reproduce sexually and produce offspring that are genetically similar to the parental species."
