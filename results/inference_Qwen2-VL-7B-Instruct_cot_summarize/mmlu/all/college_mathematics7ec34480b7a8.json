The product of convergent sequences is convergent, and the limit of the product is the product of the limits. This is a direct consequence of the properties of limits and the definition of convergence for sequences.\n\n### Statement 2\nThe statement claims that there exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence.\n\nThis statement is also true. A classic example is the sequence \\(\\{x_n\\}\\) defined as \\(x_n = (-1)^n\\). This sequence is bounded (since all its terms are either 1 or -1. However, it has no convergent subsequence because it oscillates between 1 and -1 and does not approach any single limit.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
