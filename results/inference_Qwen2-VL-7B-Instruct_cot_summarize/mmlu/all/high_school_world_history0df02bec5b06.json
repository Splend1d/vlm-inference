The key points from the source are:\n- Article 5 states that the Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion will continue to be the religion of the Empire.\n- Article 5 also allows followers of all other religions to worship within their households or particular houses for that intent, as long as there is nothing indicating this on the exterior of the Temple.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Religious uniformity was expected of the citizens of most states in the period.**\n   - This option suggests that most states expected religious uniformity. However, Source 2 indicates that followers of other religions are allowed to worship within their households or particular houses, which implies religious toleration rather than uniformity.\n\nB. **Religious toleration gained acceptance with the laws of most states in the period.**\n   - This option suggests that religious toleration was gaining acceptance. Source 2 explicitly states that followers of other religions are allowed to worship within their households or particular houses, which is a clear example of religious toleration.\n\nC. **Religious authority was the basis of the divine right of monarchs to rule their states in the period.**\n   - This option suggests that religious authority was the basis of the divine right of monarchs. However, Source 2 does not provide any information about the divine right of monarchs or religious authority being the basis of their rule.\n\nD. **Religious influence on the populations of states declined due to scientific advancements.**\n   - This option suggests that religious influence declined due to scientific advancements. However, Source 2 does not provide any information about the influence of science on religious influence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the inference supported by Source 2 is:\n\n**B. Religious toleration gained acceptance with the laws of most states in the period.**"
