Let's break down the options:\n\nA. Such a policy would wrongly disrespect existing citizens who belong to that race.\n- This option suggests that Wellman argues that immigration policies excluding members of a given race would be disrespectful to existing citizens of that race. This alignss with the worry that the freedom of association could justify such policies.\n\nB. This is an implication of the freedom of association that we must accept.\n- This option suggests that Wellman claims that the freedom of association necessarily leads to such immigration policies, which we must accept. This does not align with the worry about the freedom of association justifying exclusionary policies.\n\nC. This is an unavoidable implication of all philosophical positions on immigration policy.\n- This option suggests that Wellman claims that the worry about the freedom of association justifying exclusionary policies is an unavoidable implication of all philosophical positions on immigration policy. This does not align with the worry about the freedom of association justifying exclusionary policies.\n\nD. None of the above.\n- This option suggests that Wellman's claim does not fit any of the given options. However, option A alignss with the worry about the freedom of association justifying exclusionary policies.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that option A best captures Wellman's claim in response to the worry about the freedom of association justifying exclusionary immigration policies.\n\nFinal answer: A. Such a policy would wrongly disrespect existing citizens who belong to that race."
