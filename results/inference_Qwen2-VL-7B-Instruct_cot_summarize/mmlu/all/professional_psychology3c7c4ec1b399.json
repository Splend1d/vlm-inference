About 68% of the individuals with a given true score will have observed scores within 15 points of the true score.\n\nThe standard error of measurement ( (SEM) is a statistical measure that indicates the amount of variability or error in a test score. It is typically expressed in the same units as the test scores. In this case, the SEM is 15 points. \n\nThe statement in option B is correct because it reflects the concept of the standard error of measurement. It suggests that about 68% of the observed scores for individuals with a given true score will fall within 15 points of the true score. This is based on the assumption that the test scores are normally distributed, which is a common assumption in many psychological and educational assessments.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they misinterpret the SEM. Option A incorrectly states that about 68% of the observed scores for the test population lie within 15 points of the mean score, which is not necessarily true. Option C incorrectly states that about 15% of the scores are in error, which is not a correct interpretation of the SEM.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because it suggests that differences of up to 30 points represent the same true score, which is not necessarily true. The SEM only indicates the variability or error in the test scores, not the range of true scores."
