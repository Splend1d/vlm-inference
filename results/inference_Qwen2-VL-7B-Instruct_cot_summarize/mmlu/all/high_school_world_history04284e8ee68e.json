It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nWhich of the following led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal?\n\nA. Military campaigns\nB. Meteorological phenomena\nC. Competition with European trade networks\nD. The presence of highly developed port cities\n"

The focus is on the port city and its economic activities, not on military actions.\n\n2. **Meteorological phenomena**: The journal does not discuss any meteorological phenomena or their influence on the economic system. The description is centered around the port city's economic activities and its inhabitants' roles.\n\n3. **Competition with European trade networks**: The journal does not mention any competition with European trade networks. It describes the port city's interactions with Indian merchants and its economic activities, but there is no mention of European involvement or competition.\n\n4. **The presence of highly developed port cities**: The journal describes the port city of Aden, which is a highly developed port city. It mentions that large vessels from various Indian ports come to Aden, and there are Indian merchants, Egyptian merchants, and other economic activities. This suggests that the development of the economic system is directly tied to the presence of a highly developed port city.\n\nGiven the information, the most logical answer is:\n\n**D. The presence of highly developed port cities**"
