However, this does not directly address the core issue of why the notion is incoherent.\n\nB. **Because some things ( e.g., long-term torture, are worse than death.**\n   - This option suggests that the notion is incoherent because there are some experiences worse than death. While this is true, it does not directly address the incoherence of the notion itself.\n\nC. **Because there has yet to be a satisfactory philosophical explanation of why death is bad.**\n   - This option suggests that the notion is incoherent because there is no satisfactory philosophical explanation for why death is bad. This is a valid point, but it does not directly address the incoherence of the notion itself.\n\nD. **Because death is, by definition, undesirable.**\n   - This option suggests that the notion is incoherent because death is inherently undesirable. This directly addresses the core issue: if death is inherently undesirable, then the notion of being \"better off dead\" is inherently contradictory.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most coherent and direct reason why Gill believes Leon Kass thinks the notion of being \"better off dead\" is incoherent is:\n\n**D. Because death is, by definition, undesirable.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the incoherence of the notion by stating that death is inherently undesirable, making the notion of being \"better off dead\" inherently contradictory."
