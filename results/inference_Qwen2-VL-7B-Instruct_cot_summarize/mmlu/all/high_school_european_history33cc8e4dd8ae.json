It marked the end of the First Opium War and the beginning of a period of unequal treaties and the Opium Wars, which allowed the British to establish a foothold in China and open up the country to British trade and influence. The concessions mentioned in the treaty allowed British subjects to reside in certain Chinese cities for the purpose of conducting mercantile pursuits, effectively granting them the right to establish businesses in these locations. This was a significant step in the process of British expansion and the establishment of a sphere of influence in China."
