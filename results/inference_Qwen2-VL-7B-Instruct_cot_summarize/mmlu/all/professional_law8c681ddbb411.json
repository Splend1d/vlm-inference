No, because payment of the $2,000 to the creditor would undermine the statutory public policy against enforcement of stale claims.\nB. No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\nC. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is enforceable by the creditor regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything.\nD. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor revived the uncollectible debt.\n"

No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\n\nExplanation: The creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves. This means that the creditor cannot enforce the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor if the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything. In this case, the debtor's debt to the creditor was barred by the applicable statute of limitations, so the creditor cannot enforce the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor."
