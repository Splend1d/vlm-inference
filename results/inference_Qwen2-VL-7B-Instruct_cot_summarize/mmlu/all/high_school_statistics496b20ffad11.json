In this context, the margin of error is used to express the uncertainty around the reported percentage of high school students who are afraid to go to school.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.\n- This option correctly describes the margin of error. It indicates that the true proportion is likely to be within the range of 38% to 48%, given the 5% margin of error.\n\nB. Five percent of the students refused to participate in the poll.\n- This option is incorrect because the margin of error does not relate to the refusal rate of participants. It is about the uncertainty around the reported percentage.\n\nC. Between 38% and 48% of those surveyed expressed fear about going to school.\n- This option is incorrect because it misinterprets the margin of error. It suggests that 38% to 48% of the surveyed students expressed fear, which is not what the margin of error describes.\n\nD. There is a 0.05 probability that the 43% result is in error.\n- This option is incorrect because it misinterprets the margin of error. It suggests that there is a 5% probability that the result is incorrect, which is not what the margin of error describes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%."
