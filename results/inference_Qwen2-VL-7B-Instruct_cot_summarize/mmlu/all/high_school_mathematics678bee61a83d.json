The prime factors of the number are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. 4\n- 4 can be factored into \\(2 \\times 2\\). Since 2 is a prime factor of the number, 4 must be a factor of the number.\n\nB. 6\n- 6 can be factored into \\(2 \\times 3\\). Since 2 is a prime factor of the number, but 3 is not, 6 is not necessarily a factor of the number.\n\nC. 10\n- 10 can be factored into \\(2 \\times 5\\). Since 2 and 5 are prime factors of the number, 10 must be a factor of the number.\n\nD. 15\n- 15 can be factored into \\(3 \\times 5\\). Since 5 is a prime factor of the number, but 3 is not, 15 is not necessarily a factor of the number.\n\nGiven the analysis, the options that must be factors of the number are:\n\nA. 4\nC. 10\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and C."
