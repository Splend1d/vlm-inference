The goal is to gather additional information about customers who have joined in the past 12 months, and the company wants to ensure that the sample reflects the diversity of musical tastes across different geographical regions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.**\n   - This option would likely result in a sample that is highly skewed towards recent customers. It may not be representative of the broader customer base, especially if customer tastes and behaviors change over time.\n\nB. **Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.**\n   - This option would provide a random sample of customers who joined in the past 12 months. While it would be representative of recent customers, it may not fully capture the diversity of musical tastes across different regions.\n\nC. **From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.**\n   - This option would ensure that the sample includes customers from different geographical regions. However, choosing 10 customers from each state might not be sufficient to capture the diversity within each state, especially if the state has a large population.\n\nD. **From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.**\n   - This option would provide a stratified sample where customers are chosen proportionally from each state. This would ensure that the sample reflects the diversity of musical tastes across different regions, as each state is represented in proportion to its population.\n\nGiven the goal of capturing the diversity of musical tastes across different geographical regions, **Option D** is the most appropriate choice. It ensures that the sample is representative of the customer base across various states, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of customer preferences.\n\n**Final Answer: D. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.**"
