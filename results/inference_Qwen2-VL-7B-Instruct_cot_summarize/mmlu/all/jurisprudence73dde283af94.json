Austin posits that a sanction is the smallest chance of incurring the smallest evil. This implies that a command must include a sanction to be effective.\n\nLet's analyze each option in light of this argument:\n\nA. **All commands include some sanction.**\n   - This statement alignss with Austin's argument. If a command is to be effective, it must include a sanction to ensure compliance.\n\nB. **The concept of a command contains the likelihood that a sanction will follow failure to obey the command.**\n   - This statement also alignss with Austin's argument. The likelihood of a sanction following failure to obey is a fundamental aspect of a command.\n\nC. **Without a sanction the mere expression of a wish is not a command.**\n   - This statement also alignss with Austin's argument. Without a sanction, the mere expression of a wish does not constitute a command because it lacks the necessary element of a potential sanction.\n\nD. **A command confers power to change one's legal status.**\n   - This statement does not necessarily follow logically from Austin's argument. While a command can indeed confer power to change one's legal status, this is not directly related to the inclusion of a sanction. The presence of a sanction is about the likelihood of incurring a small evil, not about legal status changes.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is the least likely to follow logically from Austin's argument is:\n\n**D. A command confers power to change one's legal status.**"
