Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\nB.

The wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) of which standing waves can form is determined by the length of the string and the number of nodes (or antinodes) that fit within that length. The general formula for the wavelength of standing waves on a string is:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{v \\cdot L}{n} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v \\) is the wave speed,\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the string,\n- \\( n \\) is the the number of nodes ( or antinodes.\n\nThe wave speed \\( v \\) on a string is given by:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( T \\) is the tension in the string,\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the linear mass density of the string.\n\nFrom this, we can see that the wave speed \\( v \\) varies directly with the square root of the tension \\( T \\). Therefore, if the tension \\( T \\) is increased, the wave speed \\( v \\) will also increase.\n\nSince the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) is inversely proportional to the wave speed \\( v \\), an increase in tension ( \\( T \\) will lead to an increase in wave speed \\( v \\), and thus a decrease in wavelength \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength."
