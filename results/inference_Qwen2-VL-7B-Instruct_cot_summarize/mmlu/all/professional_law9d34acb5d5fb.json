Because the professor was such a popular and well-respected individual in the bar review industry, there was much speculation and interest concerning his termination. A reporter for the local law journal telephoned the bar review course's administrative director and inquired why the professor had been fired. The director told the reporter that the professor was fired because the president of the bar review course believed that the professor had embezzled money. The next day, the reporter wrote an article that was published by the law journal, which quoted the director and stated that the professor \"was fired because he had embezzled money. \" It was later learned that the professor was not responsible for any unlawful conduct and had not embezzled funds. If the professor asserts a defamation action against the law journal, he will most likely\n\nA. prevail, if the professor proves malice.\nB. prevail, if the newspaper was negligent in notascertaining whether the professor had actually embezzled any funds.\nC. not prevail, because the director was merely providing an opinion about the reason for the professor's termination.\nD. not prevail, because the law journal was merely repeating what it had been told by a source.\n"

The professor would need to prove that the law journal published the statement with malice, which is unlikely given the context.\n\n2. **Negligence**: Negligence in defamation cases means that the defendant failed to take reasonable care in determining the truth of the statement. The professor would need to prove that the law journal was negligent in not verifying the accuracy of the information provided by the administrative director. However, the law journal was merely repeating what it had been told by a source, which makes makes it less likely to be found negligent.\n\n3. **Opinion vs. Fact**: The director's statement that the professor was fired because he had embezzled money was an opinion, not a fact. Opinions are generally not actionable in defamation cases, as they are subjective and not verifiable.\n\n4. **Source Verification**: The law journal was not responsible for verifying the accuracy of the information provided by the administrative director. The law journal was merely repeating what it had been told by a source, which makes make it less likely to be found negligent.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the professor will not prevail in his defamation action against the law journal."
