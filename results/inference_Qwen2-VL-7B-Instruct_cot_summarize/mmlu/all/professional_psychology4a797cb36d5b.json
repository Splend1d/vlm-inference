This is because the theory suggests that individuals experience dissonance when they hold two or more contradictory beliefs or attitudes. When forced compliance occurs, individuals may experience dissonance if they believe that their actions are not aligned with their beliefs. In this case, the large reward can serve as a motivator to align their actions with their beliefs, leading to a greater change in their beliefs. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
