After the meeting, she was injured in the building's elevator as it suddenly fell and crashed to the basement from the third floor. She sued the building's owner, but at trial the only evidence she had regarding the issue of negligence was that she was in the elevator when it malfunctioned. Will the trial judge dismiss the case as a matter of law without letting it go to the jury?\n\nA. Yes, because the injured person always has the affirmative burden of proving negligence.\nB. Yes, because it cannot be presumed that the building owner was negligent.\nC. No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the woman assumed the risk when she decided to use an obviously dangerous instrumentality.\n"

No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\n\nIn a negligence lawsuit, the plaintiff (the injured woman in this case) must prove that the defendant (the building owner) breached a duty of care owed to her, resulting in her injury. The plaintiff does not have the affirmative burden of proving negligence; rather, the defendant has the burden of proving that they did not breach their duty of care. \n\nIn this case, the fact that the elevator malfunctioneded is relevant but not sufficient to establish negligence. The plaintiff must also show that the building owner was negligent in maintaining the elevator. The fact that the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence suggests that the building owner may have been negligent. Therefore, the trial judge should not dismiss the case as a matter of law without allowing it to go to the jury for a determination of the facts."
