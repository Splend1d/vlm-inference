Here, we'll use the concept of optimization.\n\nLet's denote the length of the rectangular yard as \\(L\\) and the width as \\(W\\). Since the fencing forms three sides of the yard, we have:\n\n\\[2W + L = x\\]\n\nWe want to maximize the area \\(A\\) of the rectangle, which is given by:\n\n\\[A = L \\times W\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express \\(L\\) in terms of \\(W\\) and \\(x\\):\n\n\\[L = x - 2W\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the area formula:\n\n\\[A = ( (x - 2W) \\times W\\]\n\\[A = xW - 2W^2\\]\n\nTo find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(W\\) and set it equal to zero:\n\n\\[\\frac{dA}{dW} = x - 4W = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(W\\):\n\n\\[4W = x\\]\n\\[W = \\frac{x}{4}\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(W\\) back into the equation for \\(L\\):\n\n\\[L = x - 2\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right)\\]\n\\[L = x - \\frac{x}{2}\\]\n\nNow, we can find the maximum area \\(A\\) by substituting \\(W\\) and \\(L\\) back into the area formula:\n\n\\[A = L \\times W\\]\n\\[A = \\left(x - \\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\times \\frac{x}{4}\\]\n\\[A = \\frac{x}{2} \\times \\frac{x}{4}\\]\n\\[A = \\frac{x^2}{8}\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area of the yard, in terms of \\(x\\), is \\(\\frac{x^2}{8}\\).\n\nThe correct answer is B. \\(x^2/8\\)."
