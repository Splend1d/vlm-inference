The target contribution margin is the difference between the selling price and the variable cost per unit. We can then use this information to calculate the target selling price.\n\nThe variable cost per unit for Duct is $12 ( (Manufacturing cost) + $3 ( (Selling & admin. Costs) = $15. The target contribution margin per unit is 20% of the selling price, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nTarget contribution margin per unit = 20% * Selling price\n\nWe can then solve for the selling price:\n\nSelling price = Target contribution margin per unit / 20%\n\nSelling price = $15 / 0.20\n\nSelling price = $75\n\nTherefore, the target selling price for Duct is $75. None of the options provided are correct."
