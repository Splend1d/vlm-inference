All of these options.\n\nThe role of the state in achieving human security is multifaceted and can be understood through the lens of each of the provided options:\n\nA. The state is the most prominent threat in terms of committing violent acts against humans, thus directly threatening human security.\n- While it is true that states can be a significant threat to human security through violent acts, it is also important to recognize that states also have the capacity to protect and promote human security through various mechanisms and policies.\n\nB. The state has the greatest material resources and power with which to secure the human referent object.\n- States do possess significant material resources and power, which they can use to secure human security. This includes the ability to provide essential services, enforce laws, and engage in international cooperation to address global threats.\n\nC. In the short term it is unhelpful to adopt a hands-off states and policy approach, as there are many current crises in which people need immediate relief from atrocities.\n- In situations of crisis, a hands-off approach by states can exacerbate the situation and lead to further harm. States have a responsibility to intervene and provide relief to those in need, especially in cases of atrocities and humanitarian crises.\n\nTherefore, the role of the state in achieving human security encompasses both the potential threats and the capacity to protect and promote human security."
