Both can be viewed as different means of achieving the same liberal ends\n\nExceptionalism, in the context of American foreign policy, refers to the belief that the United States has a unique role and responsibility in the world. This belief can manifest in both isolationist and internationalist strategies. \n\nIsolationism is a policy of avoiding involvement in international affairs, often due to a belief in the superiority of one's's own country and culture. Exceptionalism can support isolationism by justifying the United States' unique position and the need to protect its interests without engaging in foreign conflicts.\n\nInternationalism, on the other hand, is a policy of active engagement in international affairs, often to promote peace, stability, and prosperity. Exceptionalism can support internationalism by justifying the United States' role as a leader in global affairs, using its unique capabilities and values to promote liberal ends such as democracy, human rights, and economic prosperity.\n\nTherefore, exceptionalism can link isolationist and internationalist strategies by providing a rationale for both policies, viewing them as different means of achieving the same liberal ends."
