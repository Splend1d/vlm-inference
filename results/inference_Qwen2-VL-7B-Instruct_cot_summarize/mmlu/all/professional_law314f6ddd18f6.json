This is true even though there is considerable mining of silver, turquoise, sulfur, and stone within the state. As a result, the largest platinum mining company in the state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the state's platinum tax statute. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion if the mining company attacks the statute as violating the equal protection of the laws?\n\nA. The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\nB. The state must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the least restrictive means by which to advance a compelling state interest.\nC. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not necessary to advance a compelling state interest.\nD.

In this case, the largest platinum mining company is challenging the constitutionality of the state's platinum tax statute. The company is arguing that the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause by taxing only platinum extraction while not taxing the extraction of other minerals.\n\nThe burden of persuasion in such a case is on the plaintiff ( (the mining company) to demonstrate that the statute is unconstitutional. This means that the mining company must convince the court that the classification in the statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest."
