This does not necessarily mean that the group must be of prime-power order. There are solvable groups that are not of prime-power order, such as the symmetric group \\(S_3\\), which is solvable but not of prime-power order.\n\nStatement 2 is True. Every group of prime-power order is indeed solvable. This is a consequence of the fact that a group of prime-power order is nilpotent, and all nilpotent groups are solvable. The nilpotency class of a group of prime-power order is at most the prime number \\(p\\) dividing the order of the group, which means it is solvable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
