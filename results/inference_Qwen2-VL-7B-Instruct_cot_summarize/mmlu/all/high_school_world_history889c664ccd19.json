Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nThe passage is most closely related with which of the following broad developments?\n\nA. Europe's enslavement of Chinese citizens\nB. Europe's expansion of missionary activity in China\nC. Europe's economic domination of China\nD. Europe's colonization of Chinese territory\n"

                    "text": "To determine which broad development the passage is most closely related to, we need to analyze the context and core message of the passage. The passage is written by Lin Zexu, a Chinese trade commissioner, addressing Queen Victoria, the monarch of the United Kingdom. The passage discusses the issue of opium trade and its harmful effects on China, particularly the Chinese people.\n\n1. **Europe's enslavement of Chinese citizens**: This option is not directly related to the passage. The passage does not discuss the enslavement of Chinese citizens by Europeans.\n\n2. **Europe's expansion of missionary activity in China**: While missionary activity was a significant aspect of European influence in China, the passage does not focus on missionary activities but rather on the opium trade and its consequences.\n\n3. **Europe's economic domination of China**: The passage does touch on economic domination, particularly in the context of the opium trade. Lin Zexu argues that the foreigners are not only harming China economically but also also disregard the harm they are causing to the Chinese people.\n\n4. **Europe's colonization of Chinese territory**: The passage does not mention any colonization of Chinese territory. It focuses on the opium trade and its impact on China.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage is most closely related to the economic domination of China by European powers, particularly through the opium trade.\n\n**Final Answer: C. Europe's economic domination of China**"
