The break-even point is the number of units that must be sold to cover all costs ( (fixed costs + variable costs).\n\n1. Calculate the variable cost per unit:\n   - Variable cost per unit = Selling price - Cost price = $200 - $125 = $75\n\n2. Calculate the total variable cost for the break-even point:\n   - Total variable cost = Variable cost per unit * Number of units = $75 * Number of units\n\n3. Calculate the total cost for the break-even point:\n   - Total cost = Fixed cost + Total variable cost = $3000 + ($75 * Number of units)\n\n4. Calculate the revenue for the break-even point:\n   - Revenue = Selling price * Number of units = $200 * Number of units\n\n5. Calculate the profit at the break-even point:\n   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = ($200 * Number of units) - ($3000 + ($75 * Number of units))\n\n6. Set the profit equal to 10% of the revenue and solve for the number of units:\n   - 0.10 * Revenue = Profit\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - ($3000 + ($75 * Number of units))\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units) = ($200 * Number of units) - $3000 - ($75 * Number of units)\n   - 0.10 * ($200 * Number of units)"
