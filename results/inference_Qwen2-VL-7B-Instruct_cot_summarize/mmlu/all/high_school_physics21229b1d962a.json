It is observed that a speaker frequency of 60 Hz does not produce standing waves in the string. Which explanation for this phenomenon is correct?\n\nA. The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.\nB. The wave speed on the string is fixed.\nC. 60 Hz is in the lowest range of audible sound.\nD. The wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker is equal to the speed of waves on the string divided by 60 Hz.\n"

The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.\n\nStanding waves occur when the length of the string is an exact multiple of half the wavelength of the wave. If the string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength, there will not be a node or antinode at the ends of the string, and thus no standing wave will form."
