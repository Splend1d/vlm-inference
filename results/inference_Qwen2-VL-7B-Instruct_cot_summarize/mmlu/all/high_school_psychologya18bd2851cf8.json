Reliability refers to the consistency of a test, meaning that if the test is administered multiple times under similar conditions, it should yield similar results. Validity, on the other hand, refers to the accuracy of of a test, meaning that the test measures what it is supposed to measure.\n\nIt is possible for a test to be reliable but not valid. For example, a test that consistently measures the same thing but does not measure what it is supposed to measure would be reliable but not valid. Conversely, a test can be valid but not reliable if it does not yield consistent results across different administrations."
