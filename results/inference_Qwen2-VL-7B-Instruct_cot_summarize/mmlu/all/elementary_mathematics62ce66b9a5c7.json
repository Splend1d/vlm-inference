The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\n- Value of 4 in tenths place: 0.4\n- Value of 4 in tens place: 40\n- \\(0.4\\) is not \\(1/10\\) of \\(40\\).\n\nB. The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place.\n- Value of 4 in hundredths place: 0.04\n- Value of 4 in ones place: 4\n- \\(0.04\\) is not \\(1/10\\) of \\(4\\).\n\nC.
