Some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in MI.\n- This statement is true. M2 includes savings deposits, money market mutual funds, and other time deposits, which are generally less liquid than currency and demand deposits in M1.\n\nB. M2 is smaller than MI.\n- This statement is false. M2 includes M1, so it is larger than M1.\n\nC. MI is backed by gold and M2 is backed by silver.\n- This statement is false. Neither M1 nor M2 is backed by precious metals; they are backed by the central bank's reserve assets.\n\nD. The biggest component of MI is currency.\n- This statement is true. Currency is the largest component of M1.\n\nAfter analyzing each statement, the true statement is:\n\nD. The biggest component of M1 is currency."
