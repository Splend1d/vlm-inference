As of 2020, there have been significant advancements in machine learning, particularly in the field of computer vision. Models like ResNet and its variants have been optimized to achieve high accuracy on datasets like CIFAR-10. It is reasonable to assume that some models could have achieved greater than 98% accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 2020.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"The original ResNets were not optimized with the Adam optimizer.\"\n   - This statement is false. The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning, and it was indeed used to train the original ResNet models. The Adam optimizer was introduced in 2014, and it was used in the training of ResNet models, which were introduced in 2015.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
