If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nThis speech led to the creation of laws that did which of the following?\n\nA. Limited work hours in factories\nB. Established public health care and pensions\nC. Displaced citizens in the overpopulated city to the countryside\nD. Forced early retirement for aging workers\n"

Bismarck's speech highlights the worker's concerns about insecurity, health, and aging, as well as the lack of support from society in the event of poverty or illness.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. Limited work hours in factories\n- This option focuses on work hours, which is not directly related to the the worker's concerns about insecurity, health, and aging.\n\nB. Established public health care and pensions\n- This option directly addresses the worker's concerns about health and aging. It suggests that the speech led to the creation of laws that would provide health care and pensions, which would alleviate the worker's fears about health and the future.\n\nC. Displaced citizens in the overpopulated city to the the countryside\n- This option suggests a solution to urban overcrowding, which is not directly related to the worker's concerns about insecurity, health, and aging.\n\nD. Forced early retirement for aging workers\n- This option suggests a policy that would force workers to retire early, which is not directly related to the worker's concerns about health and aging.\n\nGiven the context of Bismarck's speech and the worker's concerns, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. Established public health care and pensions"
