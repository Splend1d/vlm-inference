However, I can tell you that the average American consumes about 3.1 cups of coffee per day. If we multiply that by 7 days in a week, we get approximately 21.7 cups of coffee per week per person. To get the total number of cups consumed in the United States in a week, we would need to multiply that number by the total population of the United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, the estimated population of the United States in 2013 was 316.8 million people. Multiplying 21.7 cups per person per week by 316.8 million people gives us approximately 6.8 billion cups of coffee consumed in the United States in a week in 2013. Therefore, the closest answer to this estimate would be option C, 3 billion cups per week."
