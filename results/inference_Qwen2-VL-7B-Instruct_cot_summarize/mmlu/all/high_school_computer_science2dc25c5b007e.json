If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.\n\nFor a list of 120 integers, the maximum number of elements that must be examined to find the value 100 using binary search is:\n\n1. Divide the list in half: 120 / 2 = 60 elements\n2. Divide the list in half again: 60 / 2 = 30 elements\n3. Divide the list in half again: 30 / 2 = 15 elements\n4. Divide the list in half again: 15 / 2 = 7.5 elements\n\nSince we can't have half an element, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements that must be examined is 8.\n\nThe answer is B. 8."
