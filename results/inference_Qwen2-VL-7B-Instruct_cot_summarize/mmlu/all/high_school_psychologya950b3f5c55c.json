Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **CAT ( (Computed Axial Tomography)**: This is a type of X-ray imaging that provides cross-sectional images of the body. While it can show the structure of the brain, it does not provide information about brain function or activity.\n\nB. **MRI ( (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: This is a powerful imaging technique that provides detailed images of the brain's structure and function. It can show how different parts of the brain are used during various tasks and can help identify areas of the brain that are active during specific activities.\n\nC. **EEG ( (Electroencecephalography)**: This measures the electrical activity of the brain. It can show how different parts of the brain are active during various tasks, but it does not provide structural information about the brain.\n\nD. **PET ( (Positron Emission Tomography)**: This imaging technique measures brain activity by detecting the emission of particles from a radioactive substance that is injected into the body. It can show how different parts of the brain are used during various tasks and can help identify areas of the brain that are active during specific activities.\n\nGiven the statement, we are looking for a scan that can show how different parts of the brain are used during various tasks. MRI and PET scans are particularly useful for this purpose as they can show brain activity and function.\n\nBetween MRI and PET, MRI is more commonly used for structural imaging and can provide a clear view of brain structures, while PET is more specialized for functional imaging. However, both can be used to disprove the statement by showing that different parts of the brain are used during various tasks.\n\nTherefore, the most useful brain scan in disproving the statement would be:\n\n**B. MRI**"
