The only way to be a good or worthwhile person is to know how human beings should behave based on universal norms or values.\n\nSocrates believed that virtue is knowledge, meaning that one must have knowledge of what is good and right in order to act virtuously. This knowledge is not just about personal preferences or opinions, but rather about universal norms or values that are applicable to all human beings. Therefore, for Socrates, the unexamined life is not worth living because it does not involve the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of these universal norms or values."
