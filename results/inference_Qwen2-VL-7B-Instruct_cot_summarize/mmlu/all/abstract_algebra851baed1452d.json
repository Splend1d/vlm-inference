This is because every positive integer \\( n \\) can be expressed as the order of a cyclic group generated by a single element. For example, the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\) ( the integers modulo \\( n \\) under addition, is a cyclic group of order \\( n \\).\n\nStatement 2 is False. While it is true that every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group ( (this is a consequence of the structure theorem for finite abelian groups), it does not necessarily contain an element of every order that divides the order of the group. For example, consider the cyclic group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\). It contains elements of orders 1, 2, and 4, but it does not contain an element of order 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
