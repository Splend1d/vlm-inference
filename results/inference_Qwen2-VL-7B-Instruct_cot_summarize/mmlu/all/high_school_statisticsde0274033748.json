Therefore, the percentage of students not going to 2-year colleges is the remaining percentage, which is:\n\n\\[ 100\\% - 20\\% = 80\\% \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a student who is not going to a 2-year college will be going to a 4-year college. Since 54% of all students go to 4-year colleges, and 80% of the students are not going to 2-year colleges, the probability that a student not going to a 2-year college will be going to a 4-year college is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{54\\%}{80\\%} = \\frac{54}{80} = \\frac{27}{40} \\]\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives us:\n\n\\[ \\frac{27}{40} = 0.675 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 0.675"
