Therefore, the number of moles of mercury(II) oxide is:\n\n   ```\n   moles of HgO = mass of HgO / formula mass of HgO\n   moles of HgO = 4.32 g / 216 g mol^-1\n   moles of HgO = 0.0200 mol\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the number of moles of oxygen gas that will form.**\n\n   From the balanced chemical equation:\n\n   ```\n   HgO(s) \u2192 Hg(l) + O2(g)\n   ```\n\n   We can see that 1 mole of mercury(II) oxide produces 1 mole of oxygen gas. Therefore, the number of moles of oxygen gas that will form is equal to the number of moles of mercury(II) oxide:\n\n   ```\n   moles of O2 = moles of HgO\n   moles of O2 = 0.0200 mol\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.0200 mol."
