Placing celery stalks in water colored with a dye and observing the results\n\nThis activity will be most effective in introducing kindergartners to the concept of how plants transport water because it allows them to observe the movement of water through the celery stalks in real-time. The colored dye makes it easy for them to see how the water moves from the bottom of the stalk to the top, which helps them understand the process of transpiration and the role of xylem in transporting water in plants."
