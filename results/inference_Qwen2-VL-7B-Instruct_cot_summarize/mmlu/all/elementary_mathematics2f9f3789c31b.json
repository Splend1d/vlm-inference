The greatest common factor (GCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers.\n\nGiven that the LCM of the two numbers is 60 and the GCF is 2, we can use the relationship between the LCM, GCF, and the product of the two numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM} \\times \\text{GCF} = \\text{Product of the two numbers} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 2 = \\text{Product of the two numbers} \\]\n\\[ 120 = \\text{Product of the two numbers} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find two numbers whose product is 120 and whose GCF is 2. The prime factorization of 120 is:\n\n\\[ 120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\]\n\nSince the GCF is 2, both numbers must have at least one factor of 2. The remaining factors can be distributed between the two numbers. The pairs of factors of 120 that have a GCF of 2 are:\n\n- 2 and 60\n- 4 and 30\n- 6 and 20\n- 10 and 12\n\nAmong these, the pair that are both less than or equal to 12 is:\n\n- 10 and 12\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 10 and 12"
