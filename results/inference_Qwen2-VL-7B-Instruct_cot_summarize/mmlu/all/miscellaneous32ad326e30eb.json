To find the annual depreciation, we divide the depreciable amount by the useful life:\n\nAnnual depreciation = Depreciable amount / Useful life\nAnnual depreciation = $30,000 / 20 years\nAnnual depreciation = $1,500\n\nTherefore, the straight-line depreciation that can be taken for the first year of ownership is $1,500.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 1500."
