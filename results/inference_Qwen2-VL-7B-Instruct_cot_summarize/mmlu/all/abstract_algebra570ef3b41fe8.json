An equivalence relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, while a partial order is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Not all equivalence relations are partial orders because they are not necessarily antisymmetric.\n\nB. Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\n- This statement is true. The number of relations from set A to set B is \\(2^{n \\times m}\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in set A and \\(m\\) is the number of elements in set B. Here, \\(n = 3\\) and \\(m = 2\\), so the number of relations is \\(2^{3 \\times 2} = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nC. Empty relation _ is reflexive.\n- This statement is false. The empty relation on any set is not reflexive because it does not contain any ordered pairs, and thus it does not satisfy the reflexive property.\n\nD. Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\n- This statement is false. Symmetry and antisymmetry are not negative of each other. A relation is symmetric if for every pair (a, b) in the relation, the pair (b, a) is also. A relation is antisymmetric if for every pair (a, b) in the relation, if (a, b) and (b, a) are both in the relation, then a must equal b. These properties are not opposite but complementary.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is:\n\nB. Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64."
