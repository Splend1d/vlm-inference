The question asks us to identify the problem Baron identifies with treating the ticking bomb case as involving only a single instance of torture.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Justifying one instance of torture requires justifying the practice of torture.\n- This option suggests that if one instance of torture is justified, then the practice of torture should also be justified. However, Baron's argument is more about the nature of the ticking bomb case and the potential for multiple instances of torture, not about the justification of torture in general.\n\nB. It is virtually impossible for torture to be limited to just one instance.\n- This option suggests that torture in the ticking bomb case is likely to extend beyond a single instance. Baron might argue that the ticking bomb case could easily lead to multiple instances of torture, as the situation is highly stressful and potentially justifies repeated use of torture.\n\nC. Both A and B.\n- This option combines both A and B, suggesting that Baron's argument includes both the necessity of justifying torture in general and the likelihood of multiple instances of torture.\n\nD. Neither A nor B.\n- This option suggests that Baron's argument does not include either of the two points mentioned in A and B.\n\nGiven the context, Baron's argument seems to focus more on the potential for multiple instances of torture in the ticking bomb case rather than the general justification of torture. Therefore, the most accurate option is:\n\nB. It is virtually impossible for torture to be limited to just one instance.\n\nFinal answer: B."
