                    "text": "The correlation coefficient \\( r \\) measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this case, the correlation coefficient \\( r = 0.9 \\) indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the number of hours per day students study and their GPAs.\n\nGiven this information, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"90% of students who study receive high grades.\"\n- This statement is not necessarily true. A correlation coefficient of 0.9 does not imply that 90% of students who study receive high grades. It only indicates that there is a strong positive relationship between study hours and GPA, but it does not provide information about the distribution of grades among students who study.\n\nB. \"90% of students who receive high grades study a lot.\"\n- This statement is also not necessarily true. A correlation coefficient of 0.9 does not imply that 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot. It only indicates that there is a strong positive relationship between study hours and GPA, but it does not provide information about the distribution of study hours among students who receive high grades.\n\nC. \"90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\"\n- This statement is true. The correlation coefficient \\( r \\) squared (\\( r^2 \\)) gives the proportion of the variance in one variable that is predictable from the other variable. For \\( r = 0.9 \\), \\( r^2 = 0.81 \\), which means 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\n\nD. \"81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\"\n- This statement is also true. As explained in option C, \\( r^2 = 0.81 \\), which means 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable conclusion is:\n\nD. 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day."
