The buyer paid 10% of the purchase price and financed the rest by executing a promissory note and purchase money mortgage to the builder. A year later, the buyer missed several mortgage payments to the builder and became unable to make payments to the builder and became unable to make payments. During that year, property values in the neighborhood declined substantially. The builder suggested that the buyer deed the house back to the builder to settle all claims and avoid the costs and other disadvantages of foreclosure. The buyer deeded the house back to the builder. Does the builder now own fee simple title to the house?\n\nA. No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.\nB. No, because the owner of a personal residence cannot waive the right to foreclosure.\nC. Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.\nD. Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.\n"

This type of transaction is known as a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In many jurisdictions, a deed in lieu of foreclosure is considered a reasonable and fair resolution of the situation, especially when property values have declined and the buyer is unable to make mortgage payments.
