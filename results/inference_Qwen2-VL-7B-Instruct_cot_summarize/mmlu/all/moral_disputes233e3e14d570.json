This alignss with Wellman's response to the objection that he is denying the right to freedom of movement.\n\nB. **He would present an argument showing that there is actually no right to freedom of movement.**\n   - This option suggests that Wellman would argue that there is no right to freedom of movement. While this could be part of his response, it is more of a direct denial rather than a response to the objection that he is denying the right to freedom of movement.\n\nC. **He would argue that some rights are not absolute, e.g., the right to marriage doesn't allow you to marry an unwilling partner.**\n   - This option suggests that Wellman would argue that some rights are not absolute. While this is a valid point, it does not directly address the objection that he is denying the right to freedom of movement.\n\nD. **He would use deontological premises to deductively conclude that unjust public policies are morally objectionable.**\n   - This option suggest that Wellman would use deontological premises to conclude that unjust public policies are morally objectionable. While this could be part of his response, it does not directly address the objection that he is denying the right to freedom of movement.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the objection, the most fitting response is:\n\n**A. He would say this begs the question because the immigration question is identical to the freedom-of-movement question.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the objection by restatinging the question rather than denying the right to freedom of movement."
