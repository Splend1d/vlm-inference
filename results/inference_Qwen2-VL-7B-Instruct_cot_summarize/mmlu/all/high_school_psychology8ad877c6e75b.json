Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules.\n\nVariable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules because they provide unpredictable reinforcement, which makes it harder for the subject to predict when the next reinforcement will occur. This unpredictability makes it more difficult for the subject to learn a fixed response that will always lead to reinforcement, and therefore, the subject is more likely to continue responding even after the reinforcement has stopped."
