On a hunch, she went to her boyfriend's apartment one afternoon and, using her key, she entered the apartment. Once inside, she found her boyfriend and his new girlfriend in bed together. In a rage, the defendant retrieved the gun from the nightstand and killed her boyfriend and his new girlfriend. After the shooting, the defendant left on a two-day trip to the mountains to get the week's events off her mind. She called her teenage neighbor to take care of her apartment while she was gone and to look after her 4-year-old daughter. That night, after the defendant left, the police came to the apartment. They asked the neighbor if they could search the apartment, and the neighbor gave them permission. The police found in the defendant's bedroom the gun used to kill her boyfriend. At a motion to suppress the gun prior to trial, which of the following facts would the defendant's attorney be LEAST likely to attempt to prove?\n\nA. The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.\nB. The police did not have a search warrant.\nC. The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone.\nD. The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.\n"

The other facts ( A, B, and C are all related to the legality of the search and could be used to argue that the evidence should be suppressed."
