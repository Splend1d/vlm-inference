In a convex polygon, the maximum number of acute angles occurs when the polygon is as \"pointy\" as possible, meaning the angles are as small as possible.\n\n4. **Maximizing Acute Angles**: To maximize the number of acute angles, we need to consider the distribution of angles. The sum of the interior angles of a 10-gon is 1440 degrees. If we assume that the polygon is as \"pointy\" as possible, we can distribute the angles such that they are as close to 90 degrees as possible.\n\n5. **Distribution of Angles**: If we assume that the polygon is as \"pointy\" as possible, we can distribute the angles such that they are as close to 90 degrees as possible. However, since the polygon is convex, the angles cannot be exactly 90 degrees. The maximum number of acute angles occurs when the polygon is as \"pointy\" as possible.\n\n6. **Calculation**: To find the maximum number of acute angles, we can consider the distribution of angles. If we assume that the polygon is as \"pointy\" as possible, we can distribute the angles such that they are as close to 90 degrees as possible. However, since the polygon is convex, the angles cannot be exactly 90 degrees. The maximum number of acute angles occurs when the polygon is as \"pointy\" as possible.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 4"
