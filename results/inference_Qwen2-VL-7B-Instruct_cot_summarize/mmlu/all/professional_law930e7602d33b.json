The defendant admitted that she told the victim she could save him if he brought a large sum of money wrapped in a handkerchief to a ritual. After the ritual, the defendant returned the handkerchief to the victim filled with waste paper rather than the money. After the defendant was convicted of false pretenses, she moved for a new trial and offered the affidavits of several jurors who sat on the case. An affidavit containing which of the following facts will most likely furnish the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial?\n\nA. A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.\nB. A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.\nC.

                    "text": "The defendant's best basis for securing a new trial would be provided by an affidavit from a juror who misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof. This is because a juror's misunderstanding of the burden of proof could potentially affect the outcome of the trial, as it would have led to an incorrect application of the law. If the juror's misunderstanding influenced the verdict, it could be argued that the trial was not conducted fairly and that a new trial is warranted.\n\nHere's a brief analysis of each option:\n\nA. A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.\n- This is the most compelling reason for a new trial because it directly impacts the fairness of the trial. If the juror misunderstood the burden of proof, it could have led to an incorrect verdict.\n\nB. A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.\n- This could also be grounds for a new trial, but it is less compelling than a juror misunderstanding the burden of proof. Reading a newspaper article could potentially influence the juror's decision, but it is less directly related to the legal principles guiding the trial.\n\nC. Ajuror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument.\n- This is less likely to be grounds for a new trial. Falling asleep during a closing argument does not necessarily affect the juror' decision-making process in a way that would warrant a new trial.\n\nD. A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.\n- This could also be grounds for a new trial, but it is less compelling than a juror misunderstanding the burden of proof. Personal animosity could influence the juror's decision, but it is less directly related to the legal principles guiding the trial.\n\nTherefore, the most compelling reason for a new trial is provided by an affidavit from a juror who misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof."
