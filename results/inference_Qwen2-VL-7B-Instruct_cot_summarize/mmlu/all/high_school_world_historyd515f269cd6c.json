The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nWhich of the following historical developments most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph?\n\nA. Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies\nB. The Great Depression that started in 1929\nC. The decolonization process already underway in Africa\nD. World War II\n"

                    "text": "To determine which historical development most assisted the ultimate success of the Indian boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph, we need to carefully analyze the context and the message conveyed by Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nThe message emphasizes the importance of non-violent resistance, unity among Hindus and Muslims, and the boycott of foreign cloth as a means to achieve Swaraj ( (self-rule) and the redress of Khilafat and Punjab wrongs. The message also also encourages the boycott of foreign cloth and the promotion of spinning or weaving as a means to achieve self-sufficiency and economic independence.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies**: This is not directly relevant to the Indian context. The Soviet Union was not involved in the Indian independence struggle, and its actions were not directly linked to the Indian boycott.\n\nB. **The Great Depression that started in 1929**: This could have indirectly affected the Indian economy, but it was not a direct factor in the success of the Indian boycott. The Great Depression was primarily an economic crisis in the United States and Europe, not specifically in India.\n\nC. **The decolonization process already underway in Africa**: This was relevant because the decolonization process in Africa was happening concurrently with the Indian independence struggle. The success of the Indian boycott could have been influenced by the broader anti-colonial sentiments and movements that were gaining momentum globally.\n\nD. **World War II**: This was not directly related to the Indian boycott. The Indian boycott was primarily a domestic movement aimed at achieving self-rule and economic independence, not a global conflict.\n\nGiven the context of the message and the historical period, the most relevant historical development that could have assisted the ultimate success of the Indian boycott is:\n\n**C. The decolonization process already underway in Africa**\n\nThis option aligns with the broader anti-colonial sentiments and movements that were gaining momentum globally, which could have provided a supportive environment for the Indian boycott.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**C. The decolonization process already underway in Africa**"
