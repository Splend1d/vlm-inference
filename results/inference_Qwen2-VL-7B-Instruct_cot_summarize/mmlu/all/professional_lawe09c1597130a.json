As they reached the car, a defendant, who was visibly intoxicated, emerged from behind a trash can and approached them. The defendant knocked the brother to the ground and hit him over the head with a trash can, causing the brother to lose consciousness. The defendant then forced the sister into the car and raped her. The defendant is charged with assault with intent to commit rape, based on his attack on the brother. The defendant's best defense would be which of the following statements?\n\nA. Although the sister was only 15 years old, she appeared to be 16 years old to a reasonable man.\nB. The defendant did not intend to rape the sister.\nC. The defendant's intoxication at the time negated the required general intent.\nD. It is impossible to prove that the defendant was the perpetrator because the parking lot was dimly lit.\n"

The defendant's intoxication at the time negated the required general intent.\n\nThis defense is based on the legal principle that intoxication can negate the required intent for certain crimes. In this case, the defendant's intoxication at the time of the assault and rape could potentially negate the required intent to commit the crimes of assault and rape. This defense would argue that due to the defendant's intoxication, he did not have the necessary intent to commit these crimes at the time they occurred."
