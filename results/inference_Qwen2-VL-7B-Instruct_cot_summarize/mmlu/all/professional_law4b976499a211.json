Although the state provides both sexes with equal pay and benefits, the state has adopted a policy that prohibits the assignment of female officers to its special undercover narcotics division. This is a moderate risk position that sometimes involves violent encounters with drug dealers. Since the special narcotics division was first established, five undercover agents have been killed in the line of duty. It is because of the state's concern with the safety and well-being of its female officers that it has adopted such a policy. The woman, who desired to be a member of the narcotics division, filed an application for assignment as a special drug agent. After she was rejected for the position, the woman sued the state in federal court to enjoin enforcement of its stated policy on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following results in this suit is most appropriate?\n\nA. Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.\nB. Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender.\nC. Judgment for the state, because it is within a state's police power to insulate the terms and conditions of governmental employment.\nD. Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials.\n"

Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender.\n\nThis conclusion is drawn from the principle that state government employment terms and conditions are privileges or immunities of state citizenship, which are protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The state cannot abridge these privileges or immunities on the basis of gender. The fact that the state has a policy that prohibits female officers from serving in the special narcotics division, which is a moderate risk position, does not demonstrate a substantial relationship to an important state interest, nor does it provide a rational basis for the classification. Therefore, the state's policy is likely to be found unconstitutional under this reasoning."
