The firm cannot face a downward sloping demand curve.\n   - This is incorrect. Price discrimination requires a downward sloping demand curve because it allows the firm to charge different prices to different groups of consumers based on their willingness to pay.\n\n II. The firm must have market power.\n   - This is correct. Price discrimination is a strategy used by firms with market power to extract more surplus from consumers.\n\n III. Buyers with differing demand elasticities must be separable.\n   - This is correct. The firm needs to be able to identify and separate different groups of consumers with different elasticities of demand.\n\n IV. The firm must have motives beyond profit maximization.\n   - This is incorrect. Price discrimination is a profit-maximizing strategy. The firm does not need motives beyond profit maximization.\n\n V. The firm must be able to prevent the re-sale of its products.\n   - This is correct. Price discrimination relies on the firm being able to prevent resale of its products to ensure that different groups of consumers are paying different prices.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. II, III, and V only"
