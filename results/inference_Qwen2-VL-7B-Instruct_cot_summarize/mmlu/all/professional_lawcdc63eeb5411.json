A buyer recently purchased an undeveloped beachfront lot in the jurisdiction. He hired a building contractor to construct a new house on the property. Thereafter, the contractor employed a subcontractor to provide on-site maintenance. The contractor contracted with a cement company to supply concrete for the foundation of the structure. After excavation started, an employee of the cement company delivered a load of concrete to the construction site. To facilitate delivery, the contractor and the subcontractor had built an access ramp extending from the street to the lot. As the employee was driving over the ramp, it suddenly collapsed and caused the truck to overturn, seriously injuring the employee. A subsequent investigation determined that the contractor and the subcontractor negligently used substandard materials in constructing the ramp. In addition, the employee was partially at fault for driving while intoxicated. The employee brought suit against the contractor and the subcontractor to recover damages for his injuries. A special trial was held on the issue of negligence, and it was adjudged that each party was contributorily negligent as follows:PARTY DEGREE OF NEGLIGENCEPlaintiff: (the EE) 40%Defendant: (the contractor) 35%Defendant: (the subcontractor) 25%The employee, who suffered damages in the amount of $100,000, brings a personal injury action against the contractor individually.
