And because our Saviour sayeth it is impossible but that offences will come, but woe unto him by whom they cometh, our desire is not to offend one of his little ones, in whatsoever form, name or title hee appears in, whether Presbyterian, Independent, Baptist or Quaker, but shall be glad to see anything of God in any of them, desiring to doe unto all men as we desire all men should doe unto us, which is the true law both of Church and State; for our Saviour sayeth this is the law and the prophets.\n\"Therefore if any of these said persons come in love unto us, we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them, but give them free egresse and regresse unto our Town, and houses, as God shall persuade our consciences, for we are bounde by the law of God and man to doe good unto all men and evil to noe man. And this is according to the patent and charter of our Towne, given unto us in the name of the States General, which we are not willing to infringe, and violate, but shall houlde to our patent and shall remaine, your humble subjects, the inhabitants of Vlishing (Flushing, part of the colony of New Netherlands).\"\n\u2014The Flushing Remonstrance, 1657\nWhich of the following most accurately describes the context in which the above document was written?\n\nA. The Dutch West India Company had sought to establish a model community in the New World, based on Enlightenment principles; the document grew out of this mandate.\nB. The policies of the Dutch West Indian company had discouraged non-Dutch immigrants from settling in New Netherlands; the document was an attempt to diversify the colony.\nC. Religious toleration had become the norm in the neighboring New England colonies in the seventeenth century; the document was an attempt to bring New Amsterdam to the same levels of toleration.\nD. The director-general of the colony of New Netherlands, Peter Stuyvesant, was attempting to enforce conformity in New Netherlands despite the multi-ethnic makeup of the colony; the document was an attempt to accommodate the diverse population.\n"

                    "text": "The context in which the Flushing Remonstrance was written can be best described by option A: \"The Dutch West India Company had sought to establish a model community in the New World, based on Enlightenment principles; the document grew out of this mandate.\"\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Enlightenment Principles**: The Flushing Remonstrance reflects Enlightenment ideals, which emphasize reason, tolerance, and the protection of individual rights. These principles were central to the Dutch West India Company's vision for New Amsterdam.\n\n2. **Model Community**: The Dutch West India Company aimed to create a model community in the New World, one that would be a beacon of civilization and a refuge for religious and political dissenters. The Flushing Remonstrance was a key document in this effort, advocating for religious freedom and tolerance.\n\n3. **Conscience and Law**: The document emphasizes the importance of conscience and the law of God and man, which align with Enlightenment principles of natural law and the protection of individual rights.\n\n4. **Dutch West India Company's Mandate**: The Flushing Remonstrance was written in response to the company's mandate to establish a community based on these principles. It was an attempt to ensure that the colony's policies reflected the company's commitment to tolerance and the protection of individual rights.\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not accurately describe the context of the Flushing Remonstrance. Option B suggests that the document was an attempt to diversify the colony, which is not the primary focus. Option C implies that the neighboring New England colonies had already achieved religious toleration, which is not accurate. Option D suggests that the document was an attempt to accommodate a diverse population under the rule of Peter Stuyvesant, but the document was written before Stuyvesant's rule and before the multi-ethnic makeup of the colony was fully realized.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the context in which the Flushing Remonstrance was written is option A."
