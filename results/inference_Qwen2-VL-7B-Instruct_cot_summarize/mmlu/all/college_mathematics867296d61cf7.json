This means that as n approaches infinity, x_(n+1) approaches L. We can then set up the equation:\n\nL = sqrt(3 + 2L)\n\nNow, we can solve for L:\n\nL^2 = 3 + 2L\nL^2 - 2L - 3 = 0\n(L - 3)(L + 1) = 0\n\nSo, L = 3 or L = -1. However, since the sequence is defined as positive integers, we can discard the negative solution. Therefore, the limit of the sequence {x_n} as n approaches infinity is:\n\nL = 3\n\nSo, the answer is A. 3."
