The predictable rate of mutation results in ongoing variability in a gene pool.\n\nThis statement is the least likely reason the frequency of mutation appears to be low because it directly contradicts the idea that mutations occur at a regular and predictable rate. If mutations were predictable and ongoing, it would suggest that the frequency of mutation is not low but rather consistent and high. The other options ( A, B, and C, all provide valid reasons why the frequency of mutation might appear low due to the nature of recessive alleles, undesirable traits, and drastic phenotypic changes, respectively."
