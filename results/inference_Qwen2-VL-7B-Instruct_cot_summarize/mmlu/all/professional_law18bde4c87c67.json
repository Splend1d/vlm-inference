                    "text": "To address the argument that the statute violates the commerce clause, we need to consider the nature of the commerce clause and how it relates to the state's construction contract statute. The commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution generally prohibits states from passing legislation that discriminates against interstate commerce or unduly burdens it. In this context, the statute in question discriminates against non-state citizens in the context of state construction contracts.\n\nLet's analyze each option to determine which one provides the strongest argument in support of the statute:\n\nA. **The statute will help racial minorities living in the state obtain gainful employment.**\n   - This option focuses on the potential positive impact on racial minorities but does not directly address the commerce clause issue. It does not provide a compelling reason why the state's construction contracts should be limited to citizens of the state.\n\nB. **The state has the highest unemployment rate in the country.**\n   - While this option highlights the state's high unemployment rate, it does not directly address the commerce clause issue. It does not provide a reason why the state's construction contracts should be limited to citizens of the state.\n\nC. **If the state uses its own taxpayer funds to purchase construction materials, it is responsible for creating demand for the required labor.**\n   - This option directly addresses the commerce clause issue. It argues that the state, by using its own funds to purchase construction materials, is responsible for creating demand for labor. This implies that the state has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the labor it creates demand for is available within the state, thereby supporting the state's right to regulate within its own jurisdiction.\n\nD. **The statute was overwhelmingly adopted by the voters of the state.**\n   - This option is about the popularity of the statute among the voters but does not provide a reason why the state's construction contracts should be limited to citizens of the state. It does not address the commerce clause issue.\n\nGiven the analysis, the strongest argument in support of the statute if it is attacked as violating the commerce clause is:\n\n**C. If the state uses its own taxpayer funds to purchase construction materials, it is responsible for creating demand for the required labor.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the commerce clause issue by arguing that the state's construction contracts should be limited to citizens of the state because the state is responsible for creating demand for labor within its own jurisdiction."
