When the friend refused to return the card during a later conversation in a bar, the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held his finger on the trigger, and said, \"Give it back!\" A bystander screamed and threw a beer bottle at the man. The bottle struck the man's hand and caused the gun to discharge, killing the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder in a jurisdiction that follows the common law of homicide. On appeal, he argues that the evidence, which essentially set out the facts above, was insufficient to support a verdict of murder. Should the man's conviction be reversed?\n\nA. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.\nB. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.\nC. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.\nD. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.\n"

Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him at a claim of right.\n\nUnder the common law of homicide, the distinction between murder and manslaughter hinges on the defendant's intent at the time of the act. In this case, the man's intent was to retrieve the debit card, not to kill the friend. The discharge of the gun was an unintended consequence of the man's actions, and the evidence suggests that the man did not intend to cause death. Therefore, the conviction for murder should be reversed, and the man should be convicted of a lesser offense, such as manslaughter or negligent discharge of a firearm, if the evidence supports such a finding."
