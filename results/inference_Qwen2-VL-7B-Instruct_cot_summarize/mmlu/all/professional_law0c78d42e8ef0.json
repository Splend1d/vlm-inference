Two of the guests got into an argument, and one of them got up from the table and lunged at the other with a large hunting knife. The host stepped in with a baseball bat and hit the attacker in the chest with it, preventing the imminent contact by the attacker with his target. The blow knocked the attacker down and caused several broken ribs. The injured guest sued the host for aggravated assault and battery. Is the court likely to grant the host's motion to dismiss the claim for failure to state a sufficient claim for relief?\n\nA. Yes, because the host had the privilege of \"defense of others.\"\nB. No, because the host's use of force was excessive under the circumstances.\nC. Yes, because the host has the privilege of host immunity.\nD. No, because the host escalated the conflict by getting involved.\n"

Yes, because the host had the privilege of \"defense of others.\"\n\nIn the context of the law, the host of the dinner party would likely have a defense of \"defense of others\" privilege. This privilege allows a person to use reasonable force to prevent an imminent threat to another person. In this case, the host intervened to prevent the attacker from inflicting harm on the other guest, which was a reasonable and necessary action to protect the guest. Therefore, the court is likely to grant the host's motion to dismiss the claim for failure to state a sufficient claim for relief."
