This suggests that there were substantial improvements in education and literacy during the Soviet period.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The ideals of the Russian Revolution were betrayed by the Leninist and Stalinist regimes.\n- This option suggests a negative view of the Soviet regime, which contradicts the historian's sympathetic to Soviet communism. The data does not provide evidence to support this view.\n\nB. Lenin and Stalin vastly improved Russian military preparedness.\n- This option is not directly supported by the literacy rate data. The literacy rates do not provide information about military preparedness.\n\nC. Communism has been made to work more efficiently in Russia than in China.\n- This option compares the efficiency of communism in Russia versus China. The data provided does not allow for a comparison with China, so this option cannot be supported.\n\nD. Despite abuses on the part of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet regime managed significant achievements.\n- This option suggests that despite negative aspects, the Soviet regime achieved significant improvements in literacy rates. This alignss with the data showing substantial literacy improvements over time.\n\nGiven the analysis, the historian sympathetic to Soviet communism would most likely use the chart as evidence to support option D.\n\nFinal answer: D. Despite abuses on the part of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet regime managed significant achievements."
