They claimed receiving promises from the broker that if they bought the home immediately a $15,000 rebate would be given to them at closing by the sellers. At closing, the sellers claimed no knowledge and didn't pay. At trial against the broker, the couple subpoenaed one of the broker's agents who testified that he was in a meeting with the buyers and he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objected that the testimony was hearsay. What will the court most likely decide regarding the admissibility of the testimony?\n\nA. The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.\nB. The testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.\nC. The testimony is inadmissible because it is pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter that is in dispute.\nD. The testimony is admissible \u0080\u0094 even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.\n"

In this case, the testimony of the broker's agent is a party admission because it was made by an agent of the broker and relates to the matter of the promise made to the couple regarding the rebate."
