Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system.\nB. Peace research, in contrast to university IR, was under a great deal of pressure to deal with relevant issues with a high expectation of immediate delivery of policy answers.\nC. There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.\nD. The setting was simultaneously informed by political theory as the dominant discipline and isolated from developments in theory in the different disciplines.\n"

There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.\n\nThe 1980s were a period of significant political and social change, particularly in Europe, with the rise of the peace movement and the end of the Cold War. Peace research during this time was often focused on the study of security issues and the development of policies to promote peace and prevent conflict. While there may have been some inter-disciplinary and politically orientated research, it was not necessarily immediately policy-oriented or accountable to major powers. Additionally, while there may have been some pressure to provide policy answers, this was not the primary focus of peace research during this time. Finally, while there may have been some distance from policy responsibility, peace research during this time did gain political relevance due to the politicization of security issues and the rise of the peace movement."
