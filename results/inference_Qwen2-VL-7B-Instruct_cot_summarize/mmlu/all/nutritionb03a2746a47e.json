Which of the following is correct?\n\n\nA. Consumption of a meal leads to suppression of lipase activity within adipose tissue leading to a decrease in plasma NEFA concentrations\nB. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin and therefore is most active following meal consumption\nC. During the postprandial period the VLDL synthesis pathway is suppressed in favour of hydrolysis of chylomicrons\nD. All options given are correct\n"
