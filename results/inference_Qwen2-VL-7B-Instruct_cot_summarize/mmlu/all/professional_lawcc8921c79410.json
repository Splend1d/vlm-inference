As the customer handed the deposit to the woman, she saw that he had a misprinted $5 bill in his possession. The woman knew that the $5 bill, which had President Lincoln's picture upside down, was worth $500 to bill collectors. The woman then asked the customer if he would like to exchange \"that old $5 bill for a new bill. \" The customer accepted the woman's offer and handed her the misprinted bill for a new one. One week later, the customer learned that the $5 bill that he gave the woman was valued at $500. If the customer asserts a claim against the woman for deceit, will he prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the customer was the true owner of the misprinted bill and, therefore, he was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\nB. Yes, because the woman did not disclose the true value of the misprinted bill.\nC. No, because the woman made no false representation of fact.\nD. No, because the customer was not justified in relying on the woman's offer.\n"
