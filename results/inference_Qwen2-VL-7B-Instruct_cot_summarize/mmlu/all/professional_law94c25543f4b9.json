Hearsay.\n\nIn the context of the trial, Bobbie-Sue's testimony about Billy-Joe's confession to her would be considered hearsay. Hearsay is a statement made outside of court that is offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, Bobbie-Sue's testimony about Billy-Joe's statement would be offered to prove that Billy-Joe actually said what he did, which is hearsay.\n\nThe other objections listed are less likely to be sustained:\n\nB. Marital Communication Privilege: This privilege generally protects communications between spouses from being used against one another in court. However, it is not applicable here because the statement was made before the marriage, not during it.\n\nC. Specific instances of conduct cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence: This rule generally applies to proving a person's character or a trait of character, but it is not applicable here because the statement is not about Billy-Joe's character or a trait of character.\n\nD. None, because the statement is admissible: This is not a valid objection because the statement is hearsay and therefore inadmissible."
