The grocery store was situated in the first floor of the building in which the husband and wife occupied a second-floor apartment. Late one evening, the defendant was walking past the grocery store when he decided to steal the money he heard had been stashed in a cigar box inside the store. The defendant furtively walked to the rear of the building. He then proceeded to open the gate to the fenced-in back yard. Once inside the back yard, the defendant attempted to pry open the back window of the grocery store. Awakened by the barking of his watchdog, the husband went out onto his second- floor back porch and saw the defendant below. The husband yelled at the defendant. Startled, the defendant turned to run when he noticed a large package lying outside the rear door to the store. The defendant picked up the package, which contained baked bread that had been delivered earlier in the evening, and the defendant then ran off. Which of the following crimes will the defendant most likely be convicted of?\n\nA. Larceny.\nB. Burglary.\nC. Larceny and attempted burglary.\nD. Larceny and burglary.\n"

Larceny and burglary**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- **Larceny**: The defendant initially intended to steal money from the grocery store. This is a clear case of larceny, which is the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property.\n- **Burglary**: The defendant attempted to pry open the back window of the grocery store, which is an attempt to enter the building with the intent to commit a crime. This constitutes an attempt at burglary.\n\nTherefore, the defendant's actions encompass both larceny and an attempted burglary."
