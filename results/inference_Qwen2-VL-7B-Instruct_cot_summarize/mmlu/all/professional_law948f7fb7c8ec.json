The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the regulations set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:\"Each purchaser, by the acceptance of a deed therefore, promises to pay the community association an annual assessment or charge to be determined on the basis of the valuation of each individual lot and the improvements thereon. Nonpayment of any annual assessment or charge when due shall result in a lien upon the parcel of the property. \"A gardener, the owner of lot 29 in the development, sold his land to a landscaper with a deed containing no restrictions. The community association, pursuant the Declaration of Covenants, sues the landscaper to collect the annual assessment for lot 29. Which of the following is the best argument for the landscaper?\n\nA. There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.\nB. Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.\nC. There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.\nD. There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.\n"

There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.\n\nThis argument is the most compelling because it addresses the key issue of whether there is a direct contractual relationship between the gardener and the landscaper. The landscaper purchased the land from the gardener without any restrictions, and therefore, there is no privity of contract between them. Consequently, the landscaper is not bound by the terms of the Declaration of Covenants, which was created between the housing corporation and the community association, and the gardener.\n\nThe other options are less effective for the landscaper's argument:\n\nA. There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.\n- This argument is not relevant to the landscaper's situation, as the landscaper is not involved in the relationship between the housing corporation and the community association.\n\nB. Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.\n- While this statement is true, it does not address the fundamental issue of privity of contract. The landscaper is not bound by the lien because there is no direct contractual relationship with the community association.\n\nD. There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.\n- This argument is somewhat related but less precise. The focus should be on the lack of privity of contract rather than privity of estate, which is not directly relevant to the landscaper's situation.\n\nTherefore, option C is the best argument for the landscaper."
