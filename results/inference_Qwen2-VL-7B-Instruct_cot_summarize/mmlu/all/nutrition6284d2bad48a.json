                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement to determine which one is correct:\n\nA. The flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids.\n- This statement is incorrect. Flavonoids and isoflavonoids are both types of flavonoids, but they are not separate classes. Flavonoids are a large group of compounds, and isoflavonoids are a specific type of flavonoid found in plants like soybeans.\n\nB. The digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products are not changed by processing.\n- This statement is incorrect. Processing can affect the digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products. For example, heat processing can alter the structure of isoflavones, potentially affecting their absorption and bioavailability.\n\nC. \u00df-Carotene and lycopene can both act as provitamin A.\n- This statement is correct. \u00df-Carotene and lycopene are both precursors of vitamin A. \u00df-Carotene is converted into vitamin A in the body, and lycopene can also be converted to vitamin A under certain conditions.\n\nD. Carotenoids and flavonoids both belong to the polyphenol class.\n- This statement is incorrect. Carotenoids and flavonoids are not part of the same class. Carotenoids are a class of pigments, while flavonoids are a class of organic compounds. They belong to different chemical classes.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nC. \u00df-Carotene and lycopene can both act as provitamin A."
