After prosperity burst upon the community, the property owner subdivided the property into 30 lots and built townhouses on each of the lots. After selling all 30 of the lots, the various homeowners formed a homeowners' association. Thereafter, the homeowners' association adopted a Declaration of Covenants, which provided, inter alia, that each homeowner was required to pay an annual assessment charge to be used \"for the promotion of the health, safety, and welfare of residents within the subdivision and for the enhancement of education, social life, and community welfare. \"The homeowners' association then properly and legally assessed each homeowner an assessment charge of $750. An owner of a townhouse in the subdivision refused to pay the assessment. The townhouse owner was experiencing financial problems and claimed that she couldn't afford to pay the $750. As a result, the president of the homeowners' association sent the townhouse owner the following letter:\"Article 1 of the Declaration of Covenants requires all homeowners to pay their annual assessment charge on the first day of January for the said year. Because of your failure to make this payment, the homeowners' association shall have the right to collect the amount due by action of law. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. \"Three weeks elapsed, and the president of the homeowners' association did not receive any response from the townhouse owner. He then wrote her a second letter that stated:\"Before it institutes legal action, this is the homeowners' association's final demand for your $750 assessment charge. It is unfortunate that deadbeats like you ruin our community. \"A copy of this letter was mailed to the other29 residents of the development. The presidenteven sent a copy of the letter to the editor of thecounty newspaper, which had a circulation of20,000 subscribers. In its next edition, the countynewspaper published the president's letter on itseditorial page. If the townhouse owner sues the president for defamation, she will probably\n\nA. not prevail, because the president was acting to protect a legitimate public interest.\nB. not prevail, because the statement involves only an expression of opinion.\nC. prevail, because the president obviously acted with malice by sending the letter to the newspaper.\nD. prevail, because the language of the president's letter would be highly offensive to reasonable persons.\n"

The use of such language in a letter addressed to the townhouse owner and the other residents of the development, as well as the publication of the letter in the county newspaper, could be seen as an attempt to harm the townhouse owner's reputation and cause her distress. Therefore, the townhouse owner may have a strong case for defamation."
