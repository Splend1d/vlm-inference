There are 4 cups in 1 quart. Therefore, 3 quarts would be equal to \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) cups.\n\nSo, the ratio of 2 cups to 3 quarts (or 12 cups) can be written as:\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{12}\\)\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\n\\(\\frac{2 \\div 2}{12 \\div 2} = \\frac{1}{6}\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1 over 6"
