Acting subjects: who or what is acting to produce security or insecurity.\n- This is a correct definition. Acting subjects are the entities (people, organizations, etc.) that take actions to either secure or create insecurity.\n\nB. Substantive content: what being secure looks like and what conditions must exist for us to be able to say we are secure.\n- This is also a correct definition. Substantive content refers to the specific characteristics or conditions that define security.\n\nC. Referent object: whom or what we act to make secure.\n- This is also a correct definition. The referent object is the target of security actions, whether it's a person, place, or thing.\n\nD. Objective security: when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation.\n- This is not a correct definition. Objective security typically refers to the assessment of security based on measurable, observable facts, rather than interpretations. The term \"objective\" usually implies that something is true regardless of personal opinions or interpretations.\n\nTherefore, the definition that is not correct is:\n\nD. Objective security: when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation."
