In March, the retiree planted his annual tobacco crop, which he usually harvested in early October. In September, the retiree sold his farm to a tobacco grower for $100,000. At the time the retiree conveyed the property to the grower, the tobacco crop was well developed and quite mature. When the retiree and the grower entered into their land-sale agreement, there was no mention of the status or ownership of the tobacco crop. In early October, after the grower took possession of the property, the retiree contacted him and requested permission to harvest and remove the tobacco crop. The grower refused to allow the retiree to re-enter the property. The retiree brings suit against the grower seeking to re-enter the property and remove the tobacco crop that he had planted. Which of the following is correct regarding the respective rights of the parties?\n\nA. The retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop, but he must pay the grower a reasonable value to enter the property, thus gaining access to the crop.\nB. The retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop and is not required to pay the grower for entering the property, thus gaining access to the crop.\nC. The retiree is not entitled to remove the tobacco crop and, thus, is not entitled to re-enter the property.\nD. The retiree and the grower each have a colorable title to the tobacco crop, and consequently, there should be an equitable division of the proceeds from the sale of the crop between both parties.\n"

The retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop and is not required to pay the grower for enter the property, thus gaining access to the crop.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe situation involves a conflict over the ownership of the tobacco crop planted on the 10-acre strip of the 100-acre farm. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Ownership of the Farm**: The retiree owned the entire 100-acre farm, including the 10-acre strip where the tobacco was planted.\n2. **Sale of the Farm**: The retiree sold the entire farm to the tobacco grower for $100,000. At the time of the sale, the tobacco crop was mature and well-developed.\n3. **Agreement at the Time of Sale**: There was no mention of the status or ownership of the tobacco crop in the land sale agreement.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Ownership of the Tobacco Crop**: Since the retiree owned the entire farm, including the 10-acre strip where the tobacco was planted, he had the right to the crop. The sale of the farm did not transfer ownership of the crop to the grower.\n- **Right to Harvest and Remove the Crop**: The retiree had the right to harvest and remove the tobacco crop from the property. This right is inherent in the ownership of the land.\n- **No Mention of the Crop in the Sale Agreement**: The lack of mention of the crop in the sale agreement does not affect the retiree's right to the crop. The sale agreement only transferred the land itself, not the crops growing on it.\n\nGiven these points, the retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop from the property without having to pay the grower for the right to enter the property. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
