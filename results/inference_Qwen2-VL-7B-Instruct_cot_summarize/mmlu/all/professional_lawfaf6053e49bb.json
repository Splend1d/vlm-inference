One afternoon, the lift suddenly broke down because of a power failure in the area. A customer was suspended in his lift chair, one-third of the way up the hill and 50 feet above the ground. The customer remained on the lift for five hours until power was restored. He was then returned uninjured to the bottom of the hill. In a suit against the ski resort, the customer is likely to have action for\n\nA. false imprisonment.\nB. negligence.\nC. assault.\nD. no cause of action.\n"
