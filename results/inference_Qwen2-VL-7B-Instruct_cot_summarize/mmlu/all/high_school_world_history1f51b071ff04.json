One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nWhat is the most likely explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury?\n\nA.

To facilitate trade with the predominantly Muslim merchants during this era.**\n     - This, the passage does not provide any information about trade with Muslim merchants. It is not a likely explanation.\n   - **B. The king of Ghana had recently become a Muslim.**\n     - While this is a possibility, the passage does not explicitly state that the king had recently converted to Islam. It is not the most likely explanation.\n   - **C. Merchants and trade were considered taboo in the traditional pagan religion.**\n     - This is a plausible explanation. If the traditional pagan religion considered merchants and trade as taboo, it would make sense for the king to appoint a Muslim to handle the treasury, as Muslims were not bound by these taboos.\n   - **D. African kings were merely vassals of the Muslim caliphs.**\n     - While this might be true, the passage does not provide any information about the relationship between the king of Ghana and the Muslim caliphs. it is not a likely explanation.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The most likely explanation is that merchants and trade were considered taboo in the traditional pagan religion. Therefore, a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury would make sense to handle the treasury's responsibilities without being bound by these taboos.\n\nThe final answer is: **C. Merchants and trade were considered taboo in the traditional pagan religion.**"
