If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.\nAccording to the passage, what was the Chinese reaction to the British goods?\n\nA. Awe at their technological superiority\nB. Fascination with their strangeness\nC. Offense at a perceived bribe\nD. Interpreting them as an act of submission\n"

The emperor's response indicates his lack of interest in British goods and their manufactures.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **A. Awe at their technological superiority**: The emperor does not express awe or interest in the British goods, so this option is incorrect.\n   - **B. Fascination with their strangeness**: The emperor does not show fascination with the strangeness of the goods; he explicitly states he has no use for them.\n   - **C. Offense at a perceived bribe**: The emperor's response does not indicate offense but rather a lack of interest and a desire for greater devotion and loyalty.\n   - **D. Interpret them as an act of submission**: The emperor's response suggests that he expects greater devotion and loyalty from the British, implying that he sees their goods as an act of submission.\n\n4. **Conclude with a clear answer**: Based on the emperor's response, the correct interpretation is that he views the British goods as an act of submission.\n\nFinal answer: **D. Interpret them as an act of submission**."
