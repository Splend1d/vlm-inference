Yes, because the bullet from the hunter's rifle made direct physical contact with the hiker.\n\nAn actionable battery claim typically requires that there be direct physical contact or an intentional act that results in harmful or offensive contact. In this case, the bullet from the hunter's rifle made direct physical contact with the hiker, which constitutes harmful or offensive contact. Therefore, the injured hiker has an actionable battery claim against the hunter."
