The structure of a disjunctive syllogism can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Either P or Q ( (the disjunction)\n2. Not P ( (the denial of one of the disjuncts)\n3. Therefore, Q. ( (the conclusion)\n\nThe key characteristic of a valid disjunctive syllogism is that it must be logically valid, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This is because the disjunction ensures that at least one of the disjuncts is true, and the denial of one disjunct allows us to conclude the truth of the other disjunct.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The minor premise must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent.\n- This is not correct. The minor premise in a disjunctive syllogism is the denial of one of the disjuncts, not an antecedent or consequent.\n\nB. The minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative.\n- This is correct. The minor premise in a disjunctive syllogism is the denial of one of the disjuncts, which is either accepted or rejected.\n\nC. One of the premises is missing.\n- This is incorrect. A disjunctive syllogism requires both premises: the disjunction and the denial of one of the disjuncts.\n\nD. It reaches a truthful conclusion.\n- This is correct. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct characteristics of a valid disjunctive syllogism are:\n\nB. The minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative.\nD. It reaches a truthful conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nB and D."
