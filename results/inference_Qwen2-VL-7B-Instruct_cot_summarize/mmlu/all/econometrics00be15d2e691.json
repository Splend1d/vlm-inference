Here's a breakdown of the statements:\n\ni) $x_t$ and $y_t$ must both be stationary - This is not necessarily true. Cointegration does not require both variables to be stationary. Instead, it requires that a linear combination of the variables is stationary.\n\nii) Only one linear combination of $x_t$ and $y_t$ will be stationary - This is true. If $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated, there exists at least one linear combination of them that is stationary. This linear combination represents the cointegrating equation.\n\niii) The cointegrant equation for $x_t$ and $y_t$ describes the short-run relationship between the two series - This is false. The cointegrant equation describes the long-run equilibrium relationship between the two series.\n\niv) The residuals of a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$ must be stationary - This is true. If $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated, the residuals of a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$ will be stationary, indicating that the long-run equilibrium relationship has been captured.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
