Total Costs\n\nThe cost of pizza sauce is variable because it changes with the number of pizzas made. It is not a fixed cost because it does not remain constant regardless of the number of pizzas made. It is not a marginal cost because it is not the cost of producing one additional unit of output. It is not a total fixed cost because it is not a fixed cost at all. Therefore, the correct answer is C. II and IV only."
