                    "text": "A uniformed United States Park Policeman pulled over a motorist for going through a red light. The man reacted gruffly, telling the officer that he had no authority to stop him. There was a brief scuffle, and the officer issued two more charges, for disorderly conduct and failure to obey an officer. Eventually, the defendant pled guilty to the red light citation and the other two charges were dismissed. He then filed a federal court action against the park policeman in which he asserted a Bivens civil rights claim for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The first legal theory was that the park officer lacked authority to stop the plaintiff on a New York street and arrest him for a state traffic violation. He claimed that the officer was outside of his federal park land jurisdiction. Will the court likely uphold the authority of the park police under these facts?\n\nA. The U.S. Park Police have the authority to make a warrantless arrest for a state law violation because of statutory grants of authority from the various states.\nB. All federal officers can make arrests for all criminal offenses within a state's geographical jurisdiction under the priority status of federal law and federal law officers.\nC. The federal officer was way outside his scope of authority and he clearly cannot make an arrest outside of the confines of the federal park systems.\nD. The federal officer is allowed to arrest for homicide and serious felonies but cannot make traffic arrests within a state's geographical jurisdiction.\n"

If the traffic violation falls under federal jurisdiction (\u2014 for example, if it involves interstate commerce or if the violation is related to a federal park or national monument\u2014then the officer would have the authority to make the arrest.\n\n**Option B: All federal officers can make arrests for all criminal offenses within a state's geographical jurisdiction under the priority status of federal law and federal law officers.**\n\nThis option is less likely to be upheld because it would imply that federal officers have the authority to enforce state laws within state jurisdictions, which is generally not the case. Federal officers typically have jurisdiction over federal matters and may have limited authority to enforce state laws, especially in situations where there is a clear conflict of jurisdiction.\n\n**Option C: The federal officer was way outside his scope of authority and he clearly cannot make an arrest outside of the confines of the federal park systems.**\n\nThis option is also unlikely to be upheld because it would suggest that the officer had no authority to make the arrest at all, which is inconsistent with the fact that the defendant pled guilty to the red light citation and the other two charges were dismissed. The officer's authority would have to be more nuanced than simply being restricted to federal park systems.\n\n**Option D: The federal officer is allowed to arrest for homicide and serious felonies but cannot make traffic arrests within a state's geographical jurisdiction.**\n\nThis option is also unlikely to be upheld because it would imply that the officer has no authority to make any arrests within state jurisdictions, which is not supported by the facts of the case. The officer's authority would have to be more specific and limited to certain types of offenses, but not so broad as to suggest no authority at all.\n\nGiven the facts of the case, the court is likely to uphold the authority of the U.S. Park Police to make the arrest for the state traffic violation if it falls under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, the most likely answer is:\n\n**A. The U.S. Park Police have the authority to make a warrantless arrest for a state law violation because of statutory grant of of authority from the various states.**"
