If \\( R \\) is a ring and \\( S \\) is a subring of \\( R \\), then the unity of \\( R \\) is also also the unity of \\( s \\). This is because the unity of \\( R \\) must be in \\( R \\) and, by definition, must also also be in any subring \\( s \\) of \\( R \\).\n\nStatement 2 is True. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. A field is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Since every field is a commutative ring with unity and every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, it is also also an integral domain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
