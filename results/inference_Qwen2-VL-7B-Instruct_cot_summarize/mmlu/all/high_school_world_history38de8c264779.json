The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t verse suggests that when the roses are in bloom, it is the time to pour the wine, implying a celebration or enjoyment of life.\n\n3. **Analyze each option:**\n   - **A. Many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era.**\n     This option is not supported by the verses. The Qur'an verse clearly states the prohibition of certain practices, while the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t verse does not indicate atheism but rather a celebration of life.\n   \n   - **B. Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.**\n     This option is plausible. The Qur'an verse explicitly mentions that these practices should be avoided, while the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t verse suggests enjoyment, implying that not all Muslims might have observed the restrictions.\n   \n   - **C. Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations.**\n     This option is not supported by the verses. The verses do not provide any information about Christian missionaries or conversions.\n   \n   - **D. Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice.**\n     This option is not supported by the verses. The Qur'an verse mentions the prohibition of certain practices, but it does not indicate hostility towards traditional practices by Muslim intellectuals.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer:**\n   The best-supported conclusion from the comparison of the verses is that **B. Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims**.\n\nFinal answer: B. Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims."
