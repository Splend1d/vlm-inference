Representatives' constituents more often belong largely to the representative's party: This is true. In many districts, the majority of the population is aligned with one party, making it easier for representatives to win re-election.\n\nB. Senators have more political power than representatives, and Senate races are accordingly contested more aggressively: This is incorrect. While senators do have more political power, Senate races are not necessarily more aggressive. In fact, Senate races can be less competitive than House races due to factors like the need for a majority in the Senate, which can lead to more bipartisan cooperation.\n\nC. Representatives may use federal funds to publicize their achievements via direct mail to constituents: This is true. Representatives have access to federal funds to communicate with their constituents, which can be used to promote their achievements and re-election campaigns.\n\nD. Representatives more often run uncontested: This is true. In many districts, there is only one representative, and they often face no opposition in re-election campaigns.\n\nTherefore, the reason that incumbent senators win re-election less often than incumbent representatives is not because Senate races are more aggressively contested."
