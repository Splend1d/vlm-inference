At trial, the prosecution attempted to present the testimony of the victim's out-of-state sister regarding a telephone conversation she had with the defendant. She had called their landline number to talk with her sister on the same day when he had first reported to the police that his fianc\u00c3\u00a9 had been missing for five days. The sister had not met the man but had spoken with him briefly a few other times. He told her that her sister \"went out all night last night and did not return yet.\" The prosecution attempted at trial to have the sister testify to the conversation to show the significant discrepancy between his stories to the police and to her. The defense objected, arguing that she couldn't authenticate the conversation because she couldn't identify the speaker as the defendant nor had she ever met him. The prosecution told the court that she felt it was \"probably\" his voice, which she recollected from the prior talks at the same number. Will the court likely grant the defendant's objection to the testimony?\n\nA. Yes, because the sister does not have sufficient experience and knowledge to be able to identify the man's voice and to say that the voice and the defendant were the same person.\nB. Yes, because the conversation is hearsay and there are no exceptions that would allow it into evidence.\nC. No, because there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to make a reasonable conclusion that the man she talked to was her sister's fianc\u00c3\u00a9.\nD. No, because telephone conversations do not need to be authenticated, because there is a presumption that the person talking is the same person who owns the phone number.\n"

                    "text": "The court is likely to grant the defendant's objection to the testimony. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- **Option A:** This option is plausible because the sister's's inability to identify the speaker definitively as the defendant, despite her recollection of his voice from previous conversations, raises doubts about the reliability of her testimony. The court may consider the lack of certainty and the potential for misidentification as grounds for excluding the testimony.\n\n- **Option B:** This option is unlikely because the conversation is not inherently hearsay. Hearsay generally refers to statements made for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted, but the conversation in question is not being used to prove the truth of the statement itself. Instead, it's being used to show the defendant's inconsistent statements.\n\n- **Option C:** This option is unlikely because the court would need to consider the circumstances and the strength of the evidence presented. The fact that the sister's felt it was \"probably\" the defendant's voice does not provide sufficient basis for the court to conclude that the testimony should be admitted. The defense's objection is based on the lack of certainty and the potential for misidentification, which the court would likely take into account.\n\n- **Option D:** This option is unlikely because the court would need to consider the specific circumstances of the case, including the reliability of the witness's identification and the potential for misidentification. The presumption that the person talking is the same person who owns the phone number does not necessarily apply to the situation where the witness is not certain of the identity of the speaker.\n\nGiven these considerations, the court is likely to grant the defendant's objection to the testimony, as it does not meet the necessary criteria for admissibility."
