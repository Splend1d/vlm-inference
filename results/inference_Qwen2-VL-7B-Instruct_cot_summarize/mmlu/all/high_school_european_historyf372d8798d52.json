                    "text": "To determine the correct inference from the passage and its historical context, let's analyze the Act of Supremacy of 1534 in England:\n\n1. **Context of the Act:**\n   - The Act of Supremacy was enacted in 1534 during the reign of Henry VIII.\n   - Henry VIII sought to dissolve the English Church from the authority of the Pope and establish it as an independent national church.\n   - The Act declared that the king was the \"supreme head\" of the Church of England, which was a significant shift from the traditional position of the Pope.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option:**\n   - **A. An attempt to prevent the spread of Protestantism in England:**\n     - The passage does not explicitly mention an attempt to prevent the spread of Protestantism. Instead, it focuses on the king's role as the supreme head of the Church and the need to repress errors and heresies.\n   - **B. A solution to Henry VIII's financial difficulties:**\n     - The passage does not mention financial difficulties as a primary reason for the Act. The focus is on the king's role and the need to repress errors and heresies.\n   - **C. An attempt to legitimize Henry VIII's only heir:**\n     - The passage does not mention the heir's legitimacy. The focus is on the king's role and the need to repress errors and heresies.\n   - **D. An attempt to ally England with the Holy Roman Emperor:**\n     - The passage does not mention an attempt to ally with the Holy Roman Emperor. The focus is on the king's role and the need to repress errors and heresies.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The Act of Supremacy was primarily an attempt to establish the king as the supreme head of the Church of England and to repress errors and heresies. It was a significant step in the process of creating an independent national church in England.\n\nTherefore, the correct inference is:\n\n**C. An attempt to legitimize Henry VIII's only heir**"
