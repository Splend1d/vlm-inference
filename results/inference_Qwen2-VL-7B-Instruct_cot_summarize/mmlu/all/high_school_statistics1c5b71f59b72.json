The registrar decides to take a random sample of 150 students from the current directory of students and determine the number of students with the correct addresses on record. He then uses this information to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements must be true?\n\nA. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\nB. Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.\nC.

The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\n\nThis statement is true because a 95 percent confidence interval is constructed to estimate the true proportion of students with the correct address on record in the entire student population. The confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true proportion is expected to fall with 95 percent confidence. Therefore, the true proportion of students with the correct address on record must be within this interval."
