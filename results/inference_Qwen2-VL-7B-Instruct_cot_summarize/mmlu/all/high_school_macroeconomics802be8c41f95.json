The spending multiplier is determined by the marginal propensity to consume ( (MPC), which is the fraction of each additional dollar of income that is spent on consumption.\n\nThe spending multiplier is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{MPC}} \\]\n\nThis formula shows that the spending multiplier is inversely related to the marginal propensity to save ( (MPS), which is the fraction of each additional dollar of income that is saved. The MPS is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{MPS} = 1 - \\text{MPC} \\]\n\nTherefore, an increase in the marginal propensity to consume ( (MPC) will decrease the marginal propensity to save ( (MPS), which in turn will increase the spending multiplier.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. An increase in the marginal propensity to consume"
