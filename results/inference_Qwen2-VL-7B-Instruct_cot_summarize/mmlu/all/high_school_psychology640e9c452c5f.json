After serving 120 dinners, Tamika told her mother how happy she is that they can afford to buy delicious foods she loves. Tamika's increased perception that she is happy is best explained by applying which of the following theories?\n\nA. relative deprivation\nB. adaptation-level\nC.

In Tamika's case, her increased perception of happiness after volunteering can be attributed to the change in her environment and the positive experience of helping others, which is a form of adaptation-level change."
