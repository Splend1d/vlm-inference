                    "text": "The algorithm simulates flipping a coin 4 times and keeps track of the number of heads and the number of flips. The goal is to determine whether the simulation resulted in an equal number of heads and tails.\n\nTo determine if the simulation resulted in an equal number of heads and tails, we need to check if the number of heads is equal to the number of tails. Since the coin is flipped 4 times, the number of heads and tails should be equal if the simulation resulted in an equal number of heads and tails.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. `coin_f1ip = 1`\nThis indicates that the coin flip resulted in heads. However, it does not provide information about the total number of heads or tails.\n\nB. `flip_counter = 1`\nThis indicates that the simulation has completed one flip. It does not provide information about the number of heads or tails.\n\nC. `flip_counter = 2`\nThis indicates that the simulation has completed two flips. It does not provide information about the number of heads or tails.\n\nD. `heads_counter = 2`\nThis indicates that there have been 2 heads in the simulation. Since the coin is flipped 4 times, if there are 2 heads, there must also be 2 tails to make the total number of heads and tails equal. This directly indicates that the simulation resulted in an equal number of heads and tails.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. `heads_counter = 2`"
