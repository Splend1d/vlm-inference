As it turned out, the hospital had hired a 52-year-old man as the nurse\u00d5s replacement, a fact that rendered an age discrimination claim unavailable. The hospital responded tothe complaint by filing a motion for sanctions against thenurse\u00d5s attorney. Is the court likely to grant the hospital\u00d5s motion?\n\nA. No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.\nB. No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.\nC. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s attorney failed to conduct areasonable pre-filing inquiry.\nD. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing lawbased on the facts in this case.\n"

Yes, because the nurse's attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry.\n\nThe court is likely to grant the hospital's motion for sanctions against the nurse's attorney if it is found that the attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry. This is because the attorney filed an age discrimination complaint against the hospital based on the nurse's statement that he was fired because of his age, without verifying the accuracy of this statement. The fact that the nurse's replacement was a 52-year-old man, which made an age discrimination claim unavailable, indicates that the attorney did not conduct a thorough investigation before filing the complaint."
