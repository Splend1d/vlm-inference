The passage states that Peter the Great did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people.\n2. It mentions that he was convinced that he, as the ruler, must provide both the direction and the motive force for the transformation of Russia.\n3. The passage also notes that he would try to lead but could also drive and even flog the backward nation forward if necessary.\n\nThese points indicate that Peter the Great believed in a strong, centralized form of government where he held absolute power and was willing to use force to enforce his will.\n\nGiven these points, the term that best describes Peter the Great's ruling style is:\n\nB. Absolutist"
