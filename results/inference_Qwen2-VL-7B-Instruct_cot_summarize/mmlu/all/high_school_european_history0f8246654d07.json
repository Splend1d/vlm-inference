What shall I say of it now, when the words are put into my mouth, my hope of its destruction\u2014what shall I say of its supplanting by Socialism?\nWhat shall I say concerning its mastery of and its waste of mechanical power, its commonwealth so poor, its enemies of the commonwealth so rich, its stupendous organization\u2014for the misery of life! Its contempt of simple pleasures which everyone could enjoy but for its folly? Its eyeless vulgarity which has destroyed art, the one certain solace of labor? All this I felt then as now, but I did not know why it was so. The hope of the past times was gone, the struggles of mankind for many ages had produced nothing but this sordid, aimless, ugly confusion; the immediate future seemed to me likely to intensify all the present evils by sweeping away the last survivals of the days before the dull squalor of civilization had settled down on the world.\nThis was a bad lookout indeed, and, if I may mention myself as a personality and not as a mere type, especially so to a man of my disposition, careless of metaphysics and religion, as well as of scientific analysis, but with a deep love of the earth and the life on it, and a passion for the history of the past of mankind.\nWilliam Morris, How I Became a Socialist, 1896\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Morris\n\nA. chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society\nB. chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments\nC. rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion\nD. rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it\n"

The passage discusses Morris's disillusionment with modern civilization and his hope for its replacement by socialism. Let's break down the options:\n\nA. **Morris chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society.**\n   - The passage mentions Morris's hatred of modern civilization and his felt that it was sordid, aimless, ugly, and caused misery. However, it does not explicitly state that Morris chose socialism due to the waste of resources and general misery. It focuses more on the hope for a better future rather than the specific reasons for choosing socialism.\n\nB. **Morris chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments.**\n   - The passage does not mention Morris being influenced by Marx's arguments. It does not discuss Morris's exposure to or understanding of Marx's theories.\n\nC. **Morris rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion.**\n   - The passage does not state that Morris rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion. It discusses his hope for socialism to replace modern civilization but does not explicitly reject socialism.\n\nD. **Morris rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it.**\n   - The passage mentions Morris's deep love for the earth and life on it, but it does not state that Morris rejected socialism because of this love. It discusses his hope for socialism but does not explicitly reject it.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage does not provide enough information to conclude that Morris chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments or rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it. However, it does suggest that Morris was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate inference is:\n\n**A. Morris chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society.**"
