                    "text": " The ceiling function $\\lceil x \\rceil$ rounds $x$ up to the nearest integer. So, for example, $\\lceil\\sqrt{5}\\rceil = 3$ because $\\sqrt{5}$ is between 2 and 3, and we round up to the nearest integer. Similarly, $\\\\lceil\\sqrt{6}\\rceil = 3$, $\\\\lceil\\sqrt{7}\\rceil = 3$, and so on, up to $\\\\lceil\\sqrt{29}\\rceil = 6$.\n\nSo, we are asked to evaluate the sum of the ceiling functions of the square roots of the integers from 5 to 29. This is equivalent to summing the integers from 3 to 6, because each term in the sum is equal to the ceiling of the square root of the corresponding integer.\n\nThe sum of the integers from 3 to 6 is $3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18$.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 18.
