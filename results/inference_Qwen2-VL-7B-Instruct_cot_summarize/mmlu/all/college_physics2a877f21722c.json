                    "text": "The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is the probability that a photon will be detected by the detector. In this case, the quantum efficiency is 0.1, which means that there is a 10% chance that a photon will be detected by the detector.\nIf 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other, the detector will detect photons on average 10 times. This is because the probability of a photon being detected is 0.1, and the probability of a photon not being detected is 0.9. The probability of a photon being detected 10 times in a row is therefore (0.1)^10, which is approximately 0.000000001. This is a very small probability, so it is unlikely that the detector will detect photons 10 times in a row.\nThe rms deviation is a measure of the variability of a set of data. In this case, the rms deviation is approximately 3. This means that the number of photons detected by the detector will vary by about 3 from the average of 10.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3."
