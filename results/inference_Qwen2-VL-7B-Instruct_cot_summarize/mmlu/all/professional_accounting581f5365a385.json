As an increase in depreciation expense of $32,000.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Depreciation Expense**: The $40,000 of depreciation expense should have been recorded in the prior year but was not. This means that the company's financial statements for the prior year understated the depreciation expense by $40,000.\n\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**: Accumulated depreciation is the total amount of depreciation expense that has been recorded over the life of an asset. Since the depreciation expense was understated in the prior year, the accumulated depreciation balance should not be adjusted to reflect the correct amount. Therefore, option A ( \"As an increase in accumulated depreciation of $32,000\" is incorrect.\n\n3. **Tax Implications**: The tax rate is 20%, but this does not directly affect the accounting treatment of the error. The tax implications are relevant for income tax reporting, not for the correction of the accounting error.\n\n4. **Correcting the Error**: To correct the error, Holt Co. should recognize the $40,000 of depreciation expense in the current year. This will increase the depreciation expense for the current year by $40,000. However, since the error was discovered in the current year, the $40,000 should be recognized as an adjustment to the current year's's financial statements, not as a retroactive adjustment to the prior year's's financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. As an increase in depreciation expense of $32,000."
