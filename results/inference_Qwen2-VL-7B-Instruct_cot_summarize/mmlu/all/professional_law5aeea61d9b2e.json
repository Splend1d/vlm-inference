The surgeon moved to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion and set discovery cutoff and trial dates. The surgeon has appealed the denial of the motion. Should the appellate court hear the merits of the surgeon's appeal?\n\nA. No, because the appellate court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.\nB. No, because the district court's decision on jurisdiction is final.\nC. Yes, because a contrary appellate decision could terminate the action.\nD.

Yes, because the surgeon's personal-jurisdiction challenge raises a constitutional question.\n\nThe surgeon's appeal challenges the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. This issue involves a constitutional question, specifically the Due Process Clause of of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees due process of of the laws of the United States. If the appellate court were to hear the merits of the appeal, it would be addressing whether the district court properly exercised its discretion in denying the motion to dismiss based on personal jurisdiction. This is a significant matter that could potentially affect the constitutional rights of both the patient and the surgeon, and thus, the appellate court should hear the appeal to ensure that the proper constitutional standards are applied."
