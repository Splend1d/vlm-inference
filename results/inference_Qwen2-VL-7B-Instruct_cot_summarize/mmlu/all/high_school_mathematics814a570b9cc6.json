If 41 grams of sugar is 14% of the normal daily allowance, we can represent the normal daily allowance as \\(x\\) grams. The proportion can be set up as follows:\n\n\\[ \\frac{41}{x} = \\frac{14}{100} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{41 \\times 100}{14} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{4100}{14} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 292.857 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get approximately 293 grams. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 293"
