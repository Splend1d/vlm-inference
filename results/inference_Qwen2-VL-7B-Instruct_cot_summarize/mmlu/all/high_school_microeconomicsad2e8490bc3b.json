                    "text": "Let's analyze each option to understand why price (P) equals marginal revenue (MR) under perfect competition, and why price (P) is greater than marginal revenue under monopoly or imperfect competition.\n\n### Perfect Competition\nIn perfect competition, the market is characterized by a large number of buyers and sellers, each with a negligible impact on the market price. The demand curve for an individual firm is perfectly elastic, meaning that the firm can sell all it it wants at the market price. The marginal revenue (MR) for a firm in perfect competition is equal to the market price (P) because the firm can sell any quantity at the market price without affecting the price.\n\n### Monopoly or Imperfect Competition\nIn monopoly or imperfect competition, there are fewer sellers, and each firm has some control over the price. The demand curve for an individual firm is downward sloping, indicating that as the firm increases its output, it must lower its price to sell more. The marginal revenue (MR) for a firm in this scenario is less than the price (P) because to sell an additional unit, the firm must lower the price on all units sold, reducing the revenue from those units.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n- **Option I**: \"MR = P = demand on horizontal function for perfect competition.\"\n  - This correctly illustrates that in perfect competition, the demand curve is horizontal, and the marginal revenue equals the price.\n  \n- **Option II**: \"P > MR as downward sloping function for imperfect competition.\"\n  - This correctly illustrates that in imperfect competition, the demand curve is downward sloping, and the price is greater than the marginal revenue.\n  \n- **Option III**: \"Demand and Price are represented as a vertical function for imperfect competition.\"\n  - This is incorrect. In imperfect competition, the demand curve is downward sloping, not vertical.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is **B. I and II**."
