This means she is calculating the total number of days she will miss by multiplying the number of weeks by the number of days in a week. \n\nAnother way to find the number of days of work she will miss is to add the number of days in each week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can add 7 three times to get the total number of days she will miss. \nTherefore, the expression that shows another way Katie can find the number of days of work she will miss is: \nB. 3+3+3"
