We are given that the circumference of the circle is $12\\pi$, so we can set up the equation $12\\pi = 2\\pi r$ and solve for $p$:\n\\[12\\pi = 2\\pi p \\implies p = \\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi} = 6.\\\\]\nSo the radius of the circle is 6 units.\n\nThe side length of the square is also 6 units, since the sides of the square are the same length as the radius of the circle.\n\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the square. Substituting $s = 6$ into the formula, we get:\n\\[A = 6^2 = 36.\\\\]\nSo the area of the square is 36 square units. The answer is: D. 36"
