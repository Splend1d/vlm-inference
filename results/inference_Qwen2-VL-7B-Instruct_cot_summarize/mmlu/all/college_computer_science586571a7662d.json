A recursive procedure can terminate without having any local variables. For example, a procedure that simply checks a base case and returns without any local variables can still terminate.\n\nii. **P has an execution path where it does not call itself.**\n   - This statement must be true. For a recursive procedure to terminate, there must be at least one execution path that does not call itself. This is because the recursive calls must eventually reach a base case that does not call the procedure again, ensuring termination.\n\niii. **P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. A recursive procedure can terminate without referring to any global variables or having any parameters. For example, a procedure that checks a base case and returns without any global variables or parameters can still terminate.\n\nGiven the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n\n**B.
