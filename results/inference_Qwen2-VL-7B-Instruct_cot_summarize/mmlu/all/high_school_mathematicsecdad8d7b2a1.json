A full circle is 360 degrees.\n2. Spinning 2250 degrees is equivalent to spinning 2250 / 360 = 6.25 full circles.\n\nSince 6 full circles bring the skater back to the starting position (north, we need to consider the remaining 0.25 of a circle.\n\n3. 0.25 of a circle is equivalent to 0.25 * 360 = 90 degrees.\n4. Spinning 90 degrees to the right from north brings the skater to the east.\n\nTherefore, after spinning 2250 degrees to the right, the figure skater is facing east.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. east"
