It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nFrederick Douglass was most influenced by which of the following social movements?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which social movement Frederick Douglass was most influenced by, let's analyze the context and content of the passage provided.\n\nThe passage discusses the advantages of the slaveholders, particularly their complete organization, and mentions the involvement of state governments, church organizations, and the Federal Government in supporting slavery. Douglass emphasizes the unity of the pen ( (writing), the purse ( (financial resources), and the sword ( (military power) against the simple truth of abolitionism.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. First Great Awakening - This was a religious revival movement in the 18th century that emphasized personal religious experience and emotionalism. It did not directly address the issue of slavery or its abolition.\n\nB. Second Great Awakening - This was a religious revival movement in the 19th century that emphasized personal religious experience and emotionalism. It also focused on social reform, including abolitionism. Douglass was a prominent figure in the abolitionist movement, which alignss with the Second Great Awakening's emphasis on social reform.\n\nC. Manifest Destiny - This was a political and cultural ideology in the 19th century that justified the expansion of the United States to the Pacific Ocean. It did not directly address the issue of slavery or its abolition.\n\nD. Popular Sovereignty - This was a political doctrine that proposed that the people of a territory should decide whether to allow slavery or not. It was a key issue in the 1850 Kansas-Nebraska Act and the subsequent debates leading to the Civil War.\n\nGiven the passage's focus on the organized support for slavery by various institutions and the unity of the pen, purse, and sword against the simple truth of abolitionism, the Second Great Awakening aligns best with Douglass's emphasis on social reform and abolitionism.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\nB. Second Great Awakening"
