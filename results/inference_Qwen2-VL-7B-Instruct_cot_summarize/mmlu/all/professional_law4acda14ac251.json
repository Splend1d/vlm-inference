The car swerved out of control, jumped the curb, and crashed into a home. The defendant was arrested and charged with the separate crimes of larceny and malicious destruction of property. During the trial the judge instructed the jury that the theft of the car was sufficient evidence to satisfS' the malice requirement for the malicious destruction of property charge. The defendant's attorney has filed a motion objecting to the judge's jury instruction. The judge's instruction was\n\nA. correct, because malice can be inferred from the intent to steal.\nB. correct, because malicious destruction of property is a general intent crime.\nC. incorrect, because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property.\nD. incorrect, because malice requires a showing of recklessness.\n"

Incorrect, because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe judge's instruction was incorrect because larceny ( or theft, as it is often referred to in legal contexts - is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property. A lesser included offense is a crime that is less serious than the charged offense and can be convicted of if the defendant is found guilty of the charged offense. In this case, larceny and malicious destruction of property are distinct offenses with different elements and purposes.\n\n- **Larceny ( (theft)**: This crime involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. It is a specific intent crime, meaning the defendant must have the specific intent to steal.\n  \n- **Malicious Destruction of Property**: This crime involves intentionally or recklessly destroying or damaging property with the intent to cause damage. It is a general intent crime, meaning the defendant need not have a specific intent to cause damage, but only a general intent to act recklessly or intentionally.\n\nThe judge's instruction conflates the two offenses by suggesting that the intent to steal ( which is a specific intent for larceny - can be used to satisfy the malice requirement for malicious destruction of property, which is a general intent crime. This is incorrect because the intent to steal does not necessarily equate to the intent to recklessly or intentionally cause damage to property, which is required for malicious destruction of property.\n\nTherefore, the judge's instruction was incorrect because it improperly conflates the intent required for larceny with the intent required for malicious destruction of property."
