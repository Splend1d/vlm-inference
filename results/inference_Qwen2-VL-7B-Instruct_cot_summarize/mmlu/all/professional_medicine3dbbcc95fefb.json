She has had similar episodes over the past 6 months. The symptoms improve following ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks. She says that she has had a great deal of stress. She has been drinking two alcoholic beverages daily for the past month; before this time, she seldom drank alcohol. Examination shows no abnormalities. Her serum glucose concentration is 30 mg/dL. Intravenous glucose is administered, and the patient's symptoms improve. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Measurement of serum proinsulin and insulin antibodies\nB. Measurement of serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations\nC. Measurement of serum growth hormone and plasma somatomedin-C concentrations\nD. Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations\n"

Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations\n\nThe patient's symptoms of nervousness, dizziness, palpitations, and excess perspiration, along with her low serum glucose concentration of 30 mg/dL, suggest that she may be experiencing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including alcohol consumption, which can lead to a rapid drop in blood sugar levels. The fact that her symptoms improve following ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks, which are high in sugar, supports this diagnosis.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis of hypoglycemia, the next step in the diagnosis would be to measure the patient's serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations. Insulin and C-peptide are hormones produced by the pancreas that help regulate blood sugar levels. In hypoglycemia, the levels of insulin and C-peptide are typically elevated, indicating that the body is trying to compensate for the low blood sugar levels by producing more insulin. Therefore, measuring these hormones can help confirm the diagnosis of hypoglycemia."
