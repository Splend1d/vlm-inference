Otherwise, it is rounded down.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 1,399 and 1,599\n- 1,399 rounds down to 1,400 because it is less than halfway to 1,500.\n- 1,599 rounds up to 1,600 because it is more than halfway to 1,600.\n- Neither of these numbers rounds to 1,500.\n\nB. 1,449 and 1,549\n- 1,449 rounds down to 1,400 because it is less than halfway to 1,500.\n- 1,549 rounds up to 1,600 because it is more than halfway to 1,600.\n- Neither of these numbers rounds to 1,500.\n\nC. 1,457 and 1,547\n- 1,457 rounds up to 1,500 because it is more than halfway to 1,500.\n- 1,547 rounds up to 1,600 because it is more than halfway to 1,600.\n- Neither of these numbers rounds to 1,500.\n\nD. 1,489 and 1,589\n- 1,489 rounds up to 1,500 because it is more than halfway to 1,500.\n- 1,589 rounds up to 1,600 because it is more than halfway to 1,600.\n- Neither of these numbers rounds to 1,500.\n\nNone of the given options have two numbers that both round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNone of the options provided have two numbers that both round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred."
