The cube has a density of 200 kg/m^3 ( (since its mass is 100 kg and its volume is (0.5 m)^3 = 0.125 m^3), and the fluid has a density of 1200 kg/m^3. Since the cube's density is less than the fluid's density, the cube will float with some of its volume submerged in the fluid.\n\nThe fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface of the fluid can be determined using the principle of flotation, which states that the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged part of the cube is equal to the weight of the cube.
