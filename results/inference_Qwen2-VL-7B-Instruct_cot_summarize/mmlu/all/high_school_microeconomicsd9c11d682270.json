She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.\nB. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nC.

This principle is known as the law of diminishing marginal utility and the marginal utility per dollar rule.\n\nGiven:\n- The price of apples is $1 each.\n- The price of oranges is $2 each.\n- The marginal utility of apples is 12.\n- The marginal utility of oranges is 18.\n\nTo find the optimal consumption, Melanie should aim for the point where the marginal utility per dollar spent on apples equals the marginal utility per dollar spent on oranges. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Marginal Utility of Apples}}{\\text{Price of Apples}} = \\frac{\\text{Marginal Utility of Oranges}}{\\text{Price of Oranges}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{1} = \\frac{18}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ 12 = 9 \\]\n\nThis equation is not true, indicating that Melanie's current consumption is not optimal. To correct this, she should adjust her consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both apples and oranges.\n\nSince the marginal utility per dollar for apples is lower than for oranges, Melanie should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both."
