If borrowers have fixed interest rates, they are paying back the same amount of money over time, but the value of that money decreases due to inflation. This means they are effectively paying back more in terms of goods and services than they borrowed. So, borrowers at fixed interest rates are hurt by inflation.\n\n2. **Individuals on fixed incomes**: Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money. If individuals have a fixed income, their income does not increase with inflation, but the cost of living does. This means they can buy fewer goods and services with the same amount of money, effectively reducing their standard of of living. So, individuals on fixed incomes are hurt by inflation.\n\n3. **Those with savings earning fixed interest rates**: Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money. If savings earn a fixed interest rate, the interest earned does not increase with inflation. This means the real value of the savings decreases over time, as the purchasing power of the money decreases. So, those with savings earning fixed interest rates are hurt by inflation.\n\n4. **Restaurant owners**: Inflation can have mixed effects on restaurant owners. On one hand, higher prices for ingredients and labor can increase costs, which might lead to higher prices for customers, potentially reducing demand. On the other hand, if inflation leads to higher overall prices, it might also increase the demand for dining out as people might perceive it as a way to enjoy a higher value for money. However, the overall effect on restaurant owners is likely to be negative, as higher costs and reduced demand can lead to lower profits. So, restaurant owners are generally hurt by inflation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the groups hurt by inflation are:\n\n- Borrowers at fixed interest rates\n- Individuals on fixed incomes\n- Those with savings earning fixed interest rates\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. II and III only"
