In this case, n = 5, so the number of labeled trees is 5^(5-2) = 5^3 = 125.\n\nHowever, this formula counts isomorphic trees as distinct. To find the number of nonisomorphic trees, we need to divide the total number of labeled trees by the number of automorphisms of each tree. The number of automorphisms of a tree with n vertices is n^(n-2).\n\nFor a tree with 5 vertices, the number of automorphisms is 5^(5-2) = 5^3 = 125. Therefore, the number of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices is 125 / 125 = 1.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 1."
