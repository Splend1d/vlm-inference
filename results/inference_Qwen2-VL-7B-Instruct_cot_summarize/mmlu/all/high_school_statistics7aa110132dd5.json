This type of bias occurs when individuals with particular characteristics systematically refuse to answer a survey question, leading to skewed results that do not accurately reflect the population's true opinions or behaviors.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Nonresponse bias** - This is the correct answer. Nonresponse bias occurs when certain groups of people are less likely to respond to a survey, leading to a sample that does not accurately represent the entire population. In this case, the respondents who voted against the annexation in the poll might not be the same group of people who voted against it in the actual vote, leading to a difference in the percentages.\n\nB. **Systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons** - This is a similar concept to nonresponse bias but is more specific to the difference between a statistic ( (the result from the sample) and a parameter ( (the true value in the population). While it is related, it does not fully capture the specific issue of nonresponse.\n\nC. **Difference between the same statistics computed from two different samples** - This option suggests that the difference is due to the samples being different, but it does not explain why the difference exists. It does not address the issue of nonresponse.\n\nD. **Difference between the statistic and the truth due to use of a random sample** - This option suggests that the difference is due to the use of a random sample, which is not the case here. The difference is due to nonresponse, not the sampling method.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. It is an example of nonresponse bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to refuse to answer a survey question.**"
