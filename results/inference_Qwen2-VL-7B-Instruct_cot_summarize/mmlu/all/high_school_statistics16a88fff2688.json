Given the options provided, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation or calculation. The correct mean and standard deviation based on the given percentages and the properties of a normal distribution are:\n\n**Mean (\u03bc = 4.5 years**\n**Standard Deviation \u03c3 \u2248 0.158 years**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the provided options."
