It sets up a scenario where the person has the ability to prevent something bad.\n\n2. **\"without sacrificing anything nearly as important\"**:\n   - This part specifies the conditions under which the action should be taken. It states that the action should be taken if it does not involve sacrificing something nearly as important.\n\n3. **\"it is wrong not to do so\"**:\n   - This part concludes the argument by stating the moral obligation. It asserts that if the conditions are met, then it not taking the action is morally wrong.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"something bad\":\n   - This phrase refers to the negative outcome that needs to be prevented. It is not vague because it is clear what is meant by \"something bad.\"\n\nB. \"it is wrong\":\n   - This phrase states the moral judgment. It is not vague because it is clear what is meant by \"it is wrong.\"\n\nC. \"nearly as important\":\n   - This phrase specifies the level of importance that the action should not involve sacrificing. It is not vague because it is clear what is meant by \"nearly as important.\"\n\nD. \"in your power\":\n   - This phrase refers to the ability or capability of the person to take the action. It is deliberately left vague because it does not specify who the person is or what the power entails.\n\nTherefore, the phrase that is deliberately left vague is:\n\n**D. \"in your power\"**."
