The perceived 'medicalization' of societies occurs when social issues are increasingly considered and respond to as medical problems.\n\nMedicalization refers to the process by which social issues are increasingly treated as medical problems, often leading to the application of medical terminology, treatment, and solutions to non-medical issues. This can involve framing social problems, such as mental health issues, addiction, or even social inequalities, as medical conditions that require medical intervention or treatment. This shift can have significant implications for how these issues are understood, treated, and addressed within society."
