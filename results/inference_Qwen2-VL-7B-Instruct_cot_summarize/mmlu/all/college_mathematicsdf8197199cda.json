The absolute value of any real number \\( x \\) is non-negative, i.e., \\( |x| \\geq 0 \\).\n\nB. \\( |x \\cdot y| \\le |x| \\cdot |y| \\)\nThis statement is always true. This is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which holds for any vectors \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^k \\). It states that the absolute value of their dot product is less than or equal to the product of their norms.\n\nC. \\( |x| = 0 \\) if and only if \\( x = 0 \\)\nThis statement is always true. The absolute value of a vector \\( x \\) is zero if and only if the vector itself is the zero vector.\n\nD. \\( |x + y| = |x| + |y| \\)\nThis statement is not always true. It is the triangle inequality, which states that the absolute value of the sum of two vectors is less than or equal to the sum of their absolute values. However, it is not always equal, as there are cases where \\( |x + y| < |x| + |y| \\).\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not always true for \\( x, y, z \\ \\in \\ \\mathbb{R}^k \\) is:\n\nD. \\( |x + y| = |x| + |y| \\)"
