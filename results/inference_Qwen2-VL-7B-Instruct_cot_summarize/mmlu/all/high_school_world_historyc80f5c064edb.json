That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

The introduction of new crops like maize, potatoes, and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe had a profound impact on European diets, population growth, and economic development. It contributed to the growth of Western Europe's global influence.\n\n2. **Refinement of gunpowder technologies**: Gunpowder was a critical technological advancement that enabled the development of firearms, which were instrumental in European military superiority and conquests. This technological advantage played a crucial role in European expansion and global hegemony.\n\n3. **The development and application of steam-powered technologies**: Steam-powered technologies, particularly the steam engine, were developed later in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were pivotal in the Industrial Revolution and contributed significantly to Western Europe's technological and economic dominance. However, the period specified (1450 to 1750 C.E. predates the widespread application of steam-powered technologies.\n\n4. **The implementation of joint-stock companies**: Joint-stock companies were a significant innovation in the 16th and 17th centuries that allowed for the pooling of capital and risk in large-scale ventures. This were crucial for the financing of exploration, colonization, and trade, contributing to the economic and political power of Western Europe.\n\nGiven the timeline and the information provided, the development and application of steam-powered technologies ( contributed the least to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The development and application of steam-powered technologies**"
