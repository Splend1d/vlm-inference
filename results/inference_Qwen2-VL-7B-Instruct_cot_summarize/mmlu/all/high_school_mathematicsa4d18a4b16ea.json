There are 12 inches in a foot.\n\nThe patio dimensions in inches are:\n- Length: 12 feet * 12 inches/foot = 144 inches\n- Width: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches\n\nThe area of the patio in square inches is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 144 \\times 120 = 17,280 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nThe volume of one brick in cubic inches is:\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Height} = 4 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 48 \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\nTo find the number of bricks needed to cover the patio, we divide the area of the patio by the volume of one brick:\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks} = \\frac{\\text{Area of patio}}{\\text{Volume of one brick}} = \\frac{17,280}{48} = 360 \\]\n\nHowever, since Zoey wants to cover the patio with a thickness of one brick, we need to consider the thickness of the bricks. Each brick is 2 inches thick. Therefore, we need to divide the number of bricks by the thickness to get the number of bricks that can fit in the thickness of the patio:\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks in thickness} = \\frac{360}{2} = 180 \\]\n\nSo, the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell to meet his sales criteria is 180 bricks. However, this option is not listed among the choices provided. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be 180 bricks, which is not listed among the options A, B, C, or D."
