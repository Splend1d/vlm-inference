                    "text": "To find the remainder when \\(25^{1059}\\) is divided by 23, we can use modular arithmetic. First, notice that \\(25 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{23\\), because \\(25 - 23 = 2\\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n\\[25^{1059} \\equiv 2^{1059} \\pmod{23\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder of \\(2^{1059}\\) when divided by 23. We can simplify this by finding the pattern of powers of 2 modulo 23.\n\nLet's start by calculating the first few powers of 2 modulo 23:\n\n- \\(2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{23\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{23\\)\n- \\(2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{23\\)\n- \\(2^4 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{23\\)\n- \\(2^5 \\equiv 16 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 32 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{23\\)\n- \\(2^6 \\equiv 9 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 18 \\pmod{23\\)\n- \\(2^7 \\equiv 18 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 36 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{23}\\)\n- \\(2^8 \\equiv 13 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 26 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{23}\\)\n- \\(2^9 \\equiv 3 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{23}\\)\n- \\(2^{10} \\equiv 6 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{23}\\)\n- \\(2^{11} \\equiv 12 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 24 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\)\n\nNotice that \\(2^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\), which means that every power of 2 modulo 23 repeats every 11 powers. Therefore, we can simplify \\(2^{1059}\\) by finding the remainder of 1059 divided by 11, which is 0. This means \\(2^{1059} \\equiv 2^0 \\pmod{23}\\), and since \\(2^0 = 1\\), we have:\n\n\\[2^{1059} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\]\n\nTherefore, the remainder when \\(25^{1059}\\) is divided by 23 is 1.
