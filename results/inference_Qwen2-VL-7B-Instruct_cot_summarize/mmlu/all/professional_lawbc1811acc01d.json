The Secretary has the discretion to implement \"deferred action,\" which temporarily postpones the exportation of certain groups of undocumented immigrants. With 11.3 million people now here illegally, the Secretary implemented a program called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The program deferred removal for two years of individuals who came to the United States as children, met certain eligibility criteria, and cleared a background check. A Sheriff in a county near the Mexican border, sued the Secretary, claiming that the policy would increase crime and drain resources in his county. The U.S. District Court dismissed the Sheriff's claim for lack of standing. On appeal, will the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals likely affirm the dismissal?\n\nA. Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\nB. Yes, because the Sheriff, as a part of the executive branch himself, is not legally qualified to bring a claim against the executive.\nC. No, because anyone has the right to object to the executive branch when it tries to legislate its own opinion into the existing law.\nD. No, because the Sheriff's county is near the border and it will in fact suffer an ingestion of more immigrants from the policy.\n"

Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\n\nThis option is the most likely because the Sheriff's claim hinges on a speculative future event. The Sheriff is arguing that the policy will lead to increased crime and resource drain, but this is a future consequence that is not yet certain. The court would likely find that the Sheriff lacks standing because he cannot demonstrate a direct and concrete injury that is imminent or certain to occur as a result of the policy.\n\nB. Yes, because the Sheriff, as a part of the executive branch himself, is not legally qualified to bring a claim against the executive.\n\nThis option is incorrect because the Sheriff is not part of the executive branch. He is a county official, and as such, he has standing to bring a claim against the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nC. No, because anyone has the right to object to the executive branch when it tries to legislate its own opinion into the existing law.\n\nThis option is incorrect because the Sheriff's claim is not about challenging the legality of the policy but rather about the potential impact of the policy on his county.

The court would likely dismiss the claim for lack of standing rather than affirm it the Sheriff's county will indeed suffer an ingestion of more immigrants from the policy.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will affirm the dismissal of the Sheriff's claim for lack of standing."
