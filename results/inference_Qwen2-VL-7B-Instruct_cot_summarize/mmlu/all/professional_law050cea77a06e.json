He contacted several companies and asked them to submit bids for the installation work. An alarm company decided to submit a bid and, in turn, requested bids from several wholesalers for the burglar alarms it planned to use if it was awarded the job. A supplier submitted a bid to the alarm company that the latter used in computing the bid that it was preparing for the builder. On September 1, the alarm company sent the builder its bid, in which it proposed to install the security systems for $100,000. On September 9, the supplier notified the alarm company that it would be unable to supply any burglar alarms to them. On September 11, the builder sent the following fax to the alarm company: \"I hereby accept your offer to install the security systems for $100,000. \"The alarm company had to pay another wholesaler $10,000 above the price quoted by the supplier for the burglar alarms. As a result, the alarm company advised the builder that the total price for the job would have to be increased to $10,000. The builder replied that he would hold the alarm company to the initially agreed price of $100,000. The alarm company installed the security systems, but the builder has not yet paid them anything. In an action by the alarm company against the builder for services rendered, the alarm company will probably be able to recover\n\nA. $100,000, because that was the contract price.\nB. $110,000 because of an unanticipated changeof circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.\nC. only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.\nD. only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.\n"

This acceptance constitutes a binding contract between the parties.\n\n2. **Unforeseen Event**: On September 9, the supplier notified the alarm company that it would be unable to supply any burglar alarms. This this event was unforeseen and not reasonably foreseeable by the alarm company at the time of the initial bid.\n\n3. **Increase in Cost**: As a result of the supplier's inability to supply the alarms, the alarm company had to pay an additional $10,000 to another wholesaler. This this increase in cost was a direct result of the unforeseen event.\n\n4. **Builder's Position**: The builder was aware of the initial agreement and the subsequent increase in cost. However, the builder refused to accept the increased and demanded the original agreed price of $100,000.\n\n5. **Legal Principle**: In such situations, the principle of **quantum meruit** ( (meaning \"what one has earned\") comes into play. This quantum meruit allows a party to be compensated for the value of the work done, even if there is no formal contract. However, in this case, the increase in cost was a direct result of an unforeseen event, and the builder was aware of this increase.\n\n6. **Recovery of Increased Cost**: The alarm company can recover the additional $10,000 due to the unforeseen event, as this cost was a direct result of the supplier's inability to supply the alarms. This the builder's refusal to accept the increased, the alarm company can recover the total cost of the job, which is $110,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $110,000 because of an unanticipated change of circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract."
