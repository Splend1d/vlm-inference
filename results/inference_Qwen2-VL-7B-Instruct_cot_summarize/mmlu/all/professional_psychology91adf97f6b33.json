Piaget placed too much emphasis on the role of culture and social interactions in children\u2019s cognitive development.\n\nPiaget's theory of cognitive development primarily focuses on the innate processes of the mind and how children actively construct knowledge through their experiences. While he did acknowledge the influence of social interactions, his theory did not place a significant emphasis on the role of culture in cognitive development. Therefore, option B is not a criticism of Piaget's theory."
