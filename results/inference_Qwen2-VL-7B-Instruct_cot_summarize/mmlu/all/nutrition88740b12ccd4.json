                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Methylation of IGF2 is increased.\n\nFolic acid supplementation during pregnancy is known to have several beneficial effects on the developing fetus, including reducing the risk of neural tube defects. Folic acid is also involved in DNA methylation processes, which are crucial for gene expression regulation. Specifically, folic acid is a key component in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionione ( (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for DNA methylation reactions.\n\nIGF2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2) is an imprinted gene, meaning that its expression is regulated by the methylation status of its promoter region. In general, increased methylation of the promoter region of an imprinted gene can lead to decreased expression of that gene. Therefore, folic acid supplementation, which increases DNA methylation, is likely to result in increased methylation of the IGF2 gene, potentially leading to decreased expression of IGF2 in the resulting children.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific effects of folic acid supplementation on methylation of IGF2 and other genes expression patterns can vary and depend on multiple factors, including the individual's genetic background, the timing and duration of supplementation, and other environmental factors. However, based on the general knowledge of folic acid's role in DNA methylation and the known regulation of IGF2 expression, the most likely effect of folic acid supplementation on IGF2 methylation is an increase."
