So, the total number of apples is:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ boxes} \\times 18 \\text{ apples/box} = 270 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nEach pie requires 7 apples. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pie:\n\n\\[ \\frac{270 \\text{ apples}}{7 \\text{ apples/pie} = 38.5714 \\text{ pies} \\]\n\nSince they can't make a fraction of a pie, they can make 38 whole pies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 38"
