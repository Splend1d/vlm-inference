When he confronted her with it she laughed derisively, admitted to the adultery in sordid detail, and taunted him with insults. He got into a rage and killed her on the spot. In the trial for first degree murder, defense counsel asked for a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter. The trial judge refused. On appeal will the husband prevail on an argument that the facts justified a charge of voluntary manslaughter?\n\nA. No, voluntary manslaughter is only available when the adultery is witnessed in real time by the defendant.\nB. No, mere words are never a sufficient provocation to establish voluntary manslaughter.\nC. Yes, an admission of adultery always justifies a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\nD. Yes, there was sufficient provocation to justify a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\n"

The defense counsel's argument that the facts justified a charge of voluntary manslaughter is supported by the husband's reaction to the provocation, which led to the killing of his wife."
