So, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{10}{12} \\cdot \\frac{12}{15} \\cdot \\frac{15}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the options. \n\nLet's try another approach. The area of a triangle is also also given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}$. \n\nIn this case, we can consider the triangle as being divided into three smaller triangles by its altitudes. The base of each smaller triangle is one of the sides of the original triangle, and the height is one of the altitudes. \n\nThe area of each smaller triangle is then $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}$. \n\nAdding up the areas of the three smaller triangles gives the area of the original triangle. \n\nLet's denote the sides of the original triangle as $a$, $b$, and $c$. Then, the area of the original triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot a \\cdot 10 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot b \\cdot 12 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot c \\cdot 15 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (a \\cdot 10 + b \\cdot 12 + c \\cdot 15$.\n\nHowever, we don't know the lengths of the sides of the original triangle. We can't solve this problem without more information. \n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{None of the above}}$."
