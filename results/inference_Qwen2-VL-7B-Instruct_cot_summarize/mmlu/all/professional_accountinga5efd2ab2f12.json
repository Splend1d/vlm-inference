All returns were filed on the original due date. The proposed adjustment relates to the disallowance of corporate jet usage for personal reasons. The agent does not find the error to be fraudulent or substantial in nature. Which of the following statements regarding this adjustment is correct?\n\nA. The adjustment is improper because an agent may only propose adjustments to the year under examination.\nB. The adjustment is proper because there is no statute of limitations for improperly claiming personal expenses as business expenses\nC. The adjustment is proper because it relates to a change in accounting method, which can be made retroactively irrespective of the statute of limitations.\nD. The adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment\n"

The adjustment is proper because there is no statute of limitations for improperly claiming personal expenses as business expenses.\n\nExplanation:\nThe statute of limitations for tax adjustments generally applies to the year under examination and any prior years within the statute of limitations. However, the disallowance of corporate jet usage for personal reasons does not relate to a change in accounting method. Instead, it is a matter of proper classification of expenses. Since the adjustment does not involve a change in accounting method, it is not subject to the same limitations as a change in accounting method. Therefore, the adjustment is proper as it relates to the disallowance of personal expenses claimed as business expenses."
