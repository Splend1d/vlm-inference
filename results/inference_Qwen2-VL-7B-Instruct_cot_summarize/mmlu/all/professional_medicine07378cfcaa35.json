Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. Arterial blood gas analysis\nB. Examination of sputum for eosinophils\nC. Sweat chloride test\nD. Sputum cytology\n"

The presence of purulent sputum, expiratory wheezes and rhonchi, hyperinflation on chest x-ray, and a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio on spirometry are all indicative of COPD. The examination of sputum for eosinophils can help confirm the diagnosis of COPD, as eosinophils are commonly found in the sputum of patients with COPD."
