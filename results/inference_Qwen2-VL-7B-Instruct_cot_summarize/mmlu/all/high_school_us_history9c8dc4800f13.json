The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following conclusions is best supported by the excerpt above?\n\nA.

It focuses on the overall electoral and popular vote percentages and the states won by each candidate. Therefore, this option cannot be conclusively supported by the information given.\n\n2. **Option B: Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War.**\n   - The excerpt mentions that Lincoln was reelected with 78% of the Union electorate casting ballots and that the 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century. It also notes that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. This information supports the idea that Lincoln's victory was linked to the Union's success during the Civil War. Therefore, this option is strongly supported by the excerpt.\n\n3. **Option C: The Emancipation Proclamation mobilized black voters in the South to vote for Lincoln in the Election of 1864.**\n   - The excerpt does not mention the Emancipation Proclamation or the mobilization of black voters. It focuses on the overall electoral and popular vote percentages and the states won by each candidate. Therefore, this option cannot be conclusively supported by the information given.\n\n4. **Option D: Republicans managed to gain control of Congress through the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf.**\n   - The excerpt mentions that Republicans gained seats in Congress, but it does not provide specific details about the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf.

Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War.**"
