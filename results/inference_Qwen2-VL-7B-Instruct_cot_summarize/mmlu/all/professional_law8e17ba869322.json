One afternoon while the judge was mowing his lawn, the father decided to avenge his son's conviction. The father set up his water sprinkler behind some shrubbery separating their adjoining properties. As the judge was mowing his lawn and came within reach of the water sprinkler, the father turned on the sprinkling device. The judge did not see the water coming toward him. The water hit the judge in the back and drenched him. The judge would be able to recover against the father for which of the following tort or torts?\n\nA. Negligence and battery.\nB. Battery and assault.\nC. Negligence and assault.\nD. Battery and trespass to land.\n"

Battery and trespass to land.\n\nThe father's actions of turning on the water sprinkler without the judge's knowledge and without any prior warning constitute a battery, as he intentionally caused the judge harm (by getting wet. Additionally, the fact that the water hit the judge in the back and drenched him indicates that the father's actions were intentional and caused harm, which is the essence of battery.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the water hit the judge in the back and drenched him while he was mowing his lawn suggests that the father's actions was done in a way that invaded the judge's property and caused harm to the judge while he was engaged in his own activity. This would also constitute trespass to land, as the father's actions were unauthorized and caused harm to the judge's property.\n\nTherefore, the judge would be able to recover against the father for battery and trespass to land."
