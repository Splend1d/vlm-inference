Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nWhich of the following presidents would be most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments?\n\nA. Franklin D. Roosevelt\nB. Lyndon B. Johnson\nC. Ronald Reagan\nD. Barack Obama\n"

                    "text": "To determine which president would most likely share Calvin Coolidge's sentiments, we need to analyze Coolidge's views on taxation, property rights, and the role of government in the economy. Coolidge emphasizes the importance of protecting individual property rights and the freedom to enjoy the rewards of one's own industry. He also that a government that imposes taxes without a clear necessity and sound public policy is a tyranny and that the breaking down of free government is often marked by a disregard for the right of the people to their own property.\n\nLet's examine each president:\n\nA. Franklin D. Roosevelt ( - Roosevelt was known for his New Deal policies, which included significant government intervention in the economy, such as the creation of the Social Security Administration and the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. These actions were aimed at providing economic security and relief to citizens, which contrasts with Coolidge's emphasis on individual freedom and limited government intervention.\n\nB. Lyndon B. Johnson - Johnson was known for his Great Society programs, which aimed to address poverty, civil rights, and other social issues. These programs involved substantial government intervention in the economy and society, which also contrasts with Coolidge's views on limited government intervention.\n\nC. Ronald Reagan - Reagan was known for his conservative policies, which included a strong emphasis on limited government intervention, individual freedom, and economic growth. His administration implemented tax cuts and deregulation, which align well with Coolidge's sentiments about protecting individual property rights and the freedom to enjoy the rewards of one's own industry.\n\nD. Barack Obama - Obama's administration was known for its expansive government programs, including the Affordable Care Act and the stimulus package, which involved significant government intervention in the economy. These actions were aimed at addressing economic challenges and social issues, which contrasts with Coolidge's views on limited government intervention.\n\nGiven the analysis, the president who would most likely share Coolidge's sentiments is:\n\nC. Ronald Reagan"
