The prime minister's death triggered a civil war between rival factions within the country. To prevent U. S. involvement in this country's political crisis, Congress passed an appropriations bill prohibiting any funding for U. S. military operations in this foreign country. The appropriations bill was passed over a presidential veto. Thereafter, the President issued an executive order directing U. S. Navy and Army troops to the foreign country to restore order. Is this executive order constitutional?\n\nA. Yes, because the President, as commander- in-chief of the armed forces, has the power to authorize such military expeditions.\nB. Yes, because the President has inherent power to regulate foreign affairs as long as there is no formal declaration of war.\nC. No, because the President cannot usurp Congress's spending power by taking action that supersedes a congressional appropriations bill.\nD. No, because the executive order was neither authorized by federal statute nor ratified by the Senate.\n"

No, because the President cannot usurp Congress's spending power by taking action that supersedes a congressional appropriations bill.\n\nThe Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse, which includes the authority to appropriate funds for the operation of the federal government. The President's executive order directing U.S. military troops to the foreign country would be unconstitutional because it would be an attempt to override a congressional appropriations bill that explicitly prohibits funding for military operations in that country."
