The quadratic formula is given by:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a\\]\n\nFor our equation, $a = 1$, $b = -3$, and $c = -4$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula gives:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-4)}}{2(1)\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{3 \\pm 5}{2}\\]\n\nSo, we have two solutions:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{3 + 5}{2} = 4\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{3 - 5}{2} = -1\\]\n\nThese are the values that make the denominator zero, so they are not included in the domain.\n\nNext, we need to ensure that the expression under the square root is non-negative:\n\n\\[x^2 - 3x - 4 \\geq 0\\]\n\nWe already know the roots of this equation are $x = -1$ and $x = 4$. The expression under the square root is non-negative between these two roots, because the parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive), and it is negative outside these roots.\n\nTherefore, the domain of the function is all real numbers except $x = -1$ and $x = 4$, which can be written as:\n\n\\[(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (-1, 4) \\cup (4, \\in \\in \\in \\in \\in \\ \\in \\in \\ \\ \\infty)\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)"
