The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA. The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\nB. 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\nC. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nD. The compound is contaminated with a precursor\n"

                    "text": "The most likely explanation for these observations is:\n\nA. The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\n\nThis explanation is supported by the following points:\n\n1. **1H NMR Spectrum**: The two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals. This suggests that the compound is not a single enantiomer but a mixture of two enantiomers, which would give rise to two peaks with similar characteristics.\n\n2. **LC-MS Analysis**: The two peaks of equal intensities in the LC-MS analysis indicate that there are two distinct forms of the compound. Since both peaks have the same mass spectrum, it is likely that these two forms are enantiomers, differing only in their chirality.\n\n3. **Spin-Spin Coupling**: The fact that the duplicate peaks do not result from spin-spin coupling rules out this possibility, as spin-spin coupling would typically result in a splitting pattern rather than two identical peaks.\n\n4. **Diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers would typically show different chemical shifts and integrals values, which is not the case here.\n\n5. **Contaminant**: While contamination with a precursor could result in two peaks, the mass spectra being consistent with the expected molecule suggests that the two forms are related to the target compound rather than a contaminant.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is that the crude compound is a mixture of enantiomers."
