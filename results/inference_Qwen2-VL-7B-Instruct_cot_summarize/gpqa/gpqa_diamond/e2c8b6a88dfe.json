                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative motion and the principle of time dilation from special relativity. The key points are:\n\n1. The supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy.\n2. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered as inertial frames of reference.\n3. The center of the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s.\n4. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame.\n\nFirst, let's convert the speed of the Galaxy towards the ejecta from km/s to m/s (:\n\\[ 60,000 \\text{ km/s} = 60,000 \\times 10^3 \\text{ m/s} = 60,000,000 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame. Since the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, the relative velocity between the two frames is the sum of their velocities:\n\\[ v_{\\text{relative}} = v_{\\text{Galaxy}} + v_{\\text{ejecta}} \\]\n\nHowever, since the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy, its velocity \\( v_{\\text{ejecta}} \\) is in the opposite direction of the Galaxy's velocity \\( v_{\\text{Galaxy}} \\). Therefore, the relative velocity is:\n\\[ v_{\\text{relative}} = 60,000,000 \\text{ km/s} - 60,000 \\text{ km/s} = 59,940,000 \\text{ km/s} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame. The distance traveled \\( d \\) is given by:\n\\[ d = v_{\\text{relative}} \\times t \\]\nwhere \\( t \\) is the time in the ejecta's reference frame.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ v_{\\text{relative}} = 59,940,000 \\text{ km/s} \\]\n\\[ t = 5 = 50 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ d = 59,940,000 \\text{ km/s} \\times 50 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\\[ d = 2,997,000,000 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame is approximately:\n\\[ 2,997,000,000 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nThe closest answer is:\nD. 2 940 000 km"
