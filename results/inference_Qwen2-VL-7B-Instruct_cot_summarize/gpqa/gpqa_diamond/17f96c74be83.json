An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate\n\nA. 2, 5, 3, 4 and 3\nB. 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4\nC. 5, 2, 1, 3 and 4\nD. 2, 5, 1, 4 and 3\n"

Hydroxide ( (OH-) is the most reactive nucleophile due to its high electron density and ability to stabilize the negative charge.\n2. Ethanethiolate ( (SCH3-) is the next most reactive nucleophile, as it is a strong nucleophile due to the the presence of the sulfur atom.\n3. Propionate ( (CH3COO-) is a moderately reactive nucleophile, as it is a strong nucleophile due to the the presence of the oxygen atom.\n4. Methanol ( (CH3OH) is a weak nucleophile, as it is a weak nucleophile due to the the presence of the oxygen atom.\n5. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is the poorest reactive nucleophile, as it is a weak nucleophile due to the the presence of the oxygen atom.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 5, 2, 3, 4 and 3"
