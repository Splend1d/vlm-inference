This is because basic solutions can stabilize the oxygen molecule, making it easier for oxygen to accept electrons and thus act as a stronger oxidant.\n\n2. **Kinetics:**\n   - In acidic solutions, oxygen reacts faster. This is because acidic solutions can facilitate the electron transfer process, making the reaction proceed more quickly.\n\nGiven these points, the correct combination is:\n\nC. stronger \u2013 faster\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
