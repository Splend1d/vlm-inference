                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and deduce the number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n1. **Decolorization of Bromine Water**: The mixture X decolorizes bromine water, indicating that it contains at least one alkene ( (CH=CH2) or an aromatic compound (C6H5CH=CH2).\n\n2. **Disproportionation Reaction**: When mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. This mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, suggesting that it contains at least one alkane (CH3ch2ch2ch3) or an alkene (CH2=ch2).\n\n3. **Hydrogenation**: Both mixtures X and Y, when hydrogenated in the presence of platinum under severe conditions, give only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which means Z is a hydrocarbon with a high hydrogen content. Given that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent, it is likely to be hexane ( C6H14.\n\n4. **Conjugated Multiple Bonds**: There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X. This means that the compounds in mixture X are either alkanes or alkenes, but not alkynes.\n\n5. **Hydrocarbon Z**: Since Z is a hydrocarbon with a high hydrogen content and is a constituent of mixture Y, it is likely to be hexane ( C6H14.\n\n6. **Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**: Since mixture X decolorizes bromine water, it contains at least one alkene or an aromatic compound. Given that Z is hexane ( C6H14, it is likely that mixture X contains a compound similar to hexane.\n\n7. **Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Two Liquids of Mixture X**: Since mixture X contains at least one alkene or an aromatic compound, and considering the possibility of a compound similar to hexane, the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X is likely to be around 12-18.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 22\nB. 12\nC. 18\nD. 16\n\nThe most reasonable answer is:\nC. 18"
