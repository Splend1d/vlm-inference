While it is possible that such systems are used industrially, the statement does not provide specific details about the catalysts used or their effectiveness.\n\n2. **Statement B: Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n   - This statement indicates that noble metal catalysts are viable but costly. While noble metals like platinum or palladium are indeed used in polymerization reactions, their high cost is a significant drawback.\n\n3. **Statement C: Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n   - This statement asserts that aluminum-based activators are ineffective for the necessary additional reaction step. This is a crucial point because the effectiveness of activators is essential for the dual catalyst system to function.\n\n4. **Statement D: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n   - This statement suggests that a catalyst from group VIa transition metals ( such as iron or cobalt, can be used in combination with specific activators. This aligns with the given scenario, as group VIa transition metals are known to be used in ethylene polymerization reactions, and specific activators can enhance their performance.\n\nGiven the context and the details provided, the correct statement is:\n\n**D. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n\nThis statement directly addresses the dual catalyst system and the specific requirements for the polymerization process."
