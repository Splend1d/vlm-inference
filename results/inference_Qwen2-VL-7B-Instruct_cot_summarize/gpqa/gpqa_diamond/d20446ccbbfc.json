It is associated with the spin degrees of freedom of the magnetic atoms. The spin of of the magnetic atoms can be thought of as a quantum mechanical property that can be in one of two states (up or down. The exchange of magnons between these states is a manifestation of the spin-orbit interaction, which is a form of symmetry breaking.\n\n2. **Phonon**: Phonon is a quantum of the lattice vibration in a solid. It is associated with the vibrational modes of the lattice. The lattice vibrations are a result of the periodic arrangement of atoms in a solid, and they are not directly associated with a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same way that magnons or pions are.\n\n3. **Pion**: Pion is a meson particle that is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is associated with the strong force and is involved in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electroweonic theory. The pion is a Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry of the theory.\n\n4. **Skyrmion**: Skyrmion is a topological soliton in a lattice model of a magnetic material. It is a particle-like excitation that is topologically stable and is associated with the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry of the model.\n\nGiven this understanding, the particle that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is:\n\n**B. Phonon**"
