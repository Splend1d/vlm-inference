The state of the system is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). We need to apply the operator P to this state vector.\n\nThe operator P is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[ P = \\begin{pm{matrix}\n0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0\n\\end{pm{matrix} \\}\n\nApplying P to the state vector (-1, 2, 1), we get:\n\n\\[ P \\cdot \\begin{pm{matrix}\n-1 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pm{matrix} \\} = \\begin{pm{matrix}\n0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0\n\\end{pm{matrix} \\} \\cdot \\begin{pm{matrix}\n-1 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pm{matrix} \\} = \\begin{pm{matrix}\n-1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n1 \\\\\n-1/\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{pm{matrix} \\}\n\nSo, after measuring P, the state of the system is (-1/\\sqrt{2}, 1, -1/\\sqrt{2}).\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of this state being in the subspace where Q = -1. The operator Q is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[ Q = \\begin{pm{matrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{pm{matrix} \\}\n\nApplying Q to the state vector (-1/\\sqrt{2}, 1, -1/\\sqrt{2}), we get:\n\n\\[ Q \\cdot \\begin{pm{matrix}\n-1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n1 \\\\\n-1/\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{pm{matrix} \\} = \\begin{pm{matrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{pm{matrix} \\} \\cdot \\begin{pm{matrix}\n-1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n1 \\\\\n-1/\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{pm{matrix} \\} = \\begin{pm{matrix}\n-1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{pm{matrix} \\}\n\nSo, after measuring Q, the state of the system is (-1/\\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/\\sqrt{2}).\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of this state being in the subspace where P = 0. The probability of this state being in the subspace where p = 0 is given by the inner product of the state vector and the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of the matrix P.\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of the matrix p is the vector (1, 1, 1). The inner product of the state vector (-1/\\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/\\sqrt{2}) and the eigenvector (1, 1, 1) is:\n\n\\[ \\langle -1/\\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/\\sqrt{2} | 1, 1, 1 \\rangle = -1/\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1 + 1/\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 1 = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is none of the options A, B, C, D."
