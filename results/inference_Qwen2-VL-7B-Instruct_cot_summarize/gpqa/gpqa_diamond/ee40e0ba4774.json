                    "text": "In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell's's equations would indeed look different. The key difference lies in the behavior of the magnetic field, particularly in the presence of isolated poles. \n\nMaxwell's equations are:\n\n1. Gauss's law for electric fields: \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\\)\n2. Gauss's law for magnetic fields: \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0\\)\n3. Faraday's law of induction: \\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\\)\n4. Amp\u00e8re's law with Maxwell's addition: \\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 (\\mathbf{J} + \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t})\\)\n\nIn the presence of isolated poles, the magnetic field would not be divergence-free (\\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0\\)), which is a fundamental assumption in the standard Maxwell's equations. This divergence of the magnetic field is directly related to the presence of isolated poles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field."
