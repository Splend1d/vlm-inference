                    "text": "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4. The dissociation of H3PO4 can be representeded as:\n\nH3PO4(aq) \u21cc H2PO4-(aq) + H+(aq)\n\nThe dissociation constants (Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4 are given as 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8, and 1.8x10^-12, respectively. These values represent the equilibrium constants for the first, second, and third dissociation steps of H3PO4.\n\nSince we are interested in the concentration of orthophosphate ions (H2PO4-, we need to consider the first dissociation step. The dissociation constant Ka1 for the first step is 7.5x10^-3.\n\nThe dissociation of H3PO4 can be represented as:\n\nH3PO4(aq) \u21cc H2PO4-(aq) + H+(aq)\n\nThe dissociation constant Ka1 for the first step is given by:\n\nKa1 = [H2PO4-][H+] / [H3PO4]\n\nWe need to determine the concentrations of H2PO4- and H+ ions in the solution. Let's assume that the initial concentration of H3PO4 is C0. The dissociation of H3PO4 can be represented as:\n\nC0 = [H3PO4]0 = 1.00 g KH2PO4 / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol/L\n\nThe dissociation of H3PO4 can be represented as:\n\n[H3PO4]0 = [H2PO4-]0 + [H+]0\n\nSince the dissociation constant Ka1 is very small, we can assume that the concentration of H2PO4- ions is negligible compared to the concentration of H3PO4 ions. Therefore, we can approximate:\n\n[H3PO4]0 \u2248 [H2PO4-]0\n\nThe dissociation constant Ka1 can be expressed as:\n\nKa1 = [H2PO4-][H+] / [H3PO4]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for [H2PO4-]:\n\n[H2PO4-] = Ka1 * [H3PO4]\n\nSubstituting the values of Ka1 and [H3PO4]:\n\n[H2PO4-] = (7.5x10^-3 * 0.00735 mol/L = 5.48x10^-7 mol/L\n\nTherefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is 5.48x10^-7 M.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 5.48x10^-7 M"
