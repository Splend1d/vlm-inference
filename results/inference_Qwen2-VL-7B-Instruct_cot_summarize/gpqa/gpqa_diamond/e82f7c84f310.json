This will convert the double bond into a ketone.\n2. **Aqueous acid** will then protonate the ketone, converting it into a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Reaction 2: Z)-oct-4-ene treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid\n\n1. **Z)-oct-4-ene** is treated with one equivalent of **mCPBA**. This will also convert the double bond into a ketone.\n2. **Aqueous acid** will then protonate the ketone, converting it into a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Chromatograms\n\n#### Standard (achiral HPLC Column\n\n- **E)-oct-4-ene** and **Z)-oct-4-ene** both yield the same ketone upon oxidation and protonation.\n- Since the achiral HPLC column does not differentiate between enantiomers, it will only resolve the ketone into two peaks ( one for each enantiomer.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC Column\n\n- **E)-oct-4-ene** and **Z)-oct-4-ene** are different enantiomers.\n- The chiral HPLC column will resolve the two enantiomers into two distinct peaks.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Standard HPLC**: 2 peaks ( one for each enantiomer of the ketone.\n- **Chiral HPLC**: 2 peaks ( one for each enantiomer of the ketone.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC"
