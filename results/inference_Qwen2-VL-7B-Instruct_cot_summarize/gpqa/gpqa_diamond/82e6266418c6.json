In this framework, all operators must respect certain symmetries principles to ensure the consistency and predictability of the theory. \n\n1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of the theory, which includes both special relativity ( (the invariance of the laws of physics under a change of coordinates by a Lorentz transformation) and the invariance under rotations and translations in spacetime. Lorentz symmetry is a requirement for any theory that aims to describe the fundamental interactions of particles.\n\n2. **Poincare Symmetry**: This is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz symmetry and also the invariance under time-time translations. Poincare symmetry is also a requirement for any theory that aims to describe the fundamental interactions of particles.\n\n3. **CP Symmetry**: This symmetry requires that the laws of physics remain unchanged under the combined operation of charge conjugation ( (C) and parity ( (P). Charge conjugation flips the sign of all fermion charges, while parity flips the sign of all spatial coordinates. CP symmetry is a requirement for any theory that aims to describe the fundamental interactions of particles.\n\n4. **CPT Symmetry**: This symmetry requires that the laws of physics remain unchanged under the combined operation of charge conjugation ( (C), parity ( (P), and time reversal ( (T)). CPT symmetry is a requirement for any theory that aims to describe the fundamental interactions of particles.\n\nIn the context of the SMEFT, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry and Poincare symmetry because these symmetries principles are fundamental to the theory and are required for the consistency and predictability of the theory. CP and CPT symmetries are also important, but they are not as fundamental as Lorentz and Poincare symmetries in the SMEFT framework.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1,2,4"
