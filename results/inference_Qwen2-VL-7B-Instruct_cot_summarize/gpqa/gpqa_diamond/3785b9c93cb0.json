                    "text": "The electric field at a point P outside the spherical conductor can be found by considering the charge distribution inside the cavity and the spherical conductor. The charge $+q$ inside the cavity will create an electric field that is spherically symmetric around the cavity. The spherical conductor will also create an electric field that is spherically symmetric around its surface.\n\nTo find the electric field at point P, we can use the principle of superposition. The electric field at point P due to the charge $+q$ inside the cavity can be found using the formula for the electric field of a point charge:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere $r$ is the distance from the charge to point P. However, since the charge is inside the cavity, the distance $r$ is not directly given. Instead, we need to consider the distance from the center of the cavity to point P, which is $l$.\n\nThe electric field due to the spherical conductor can be found using the formula for the electric field of a charged sphere:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{conductor}} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{R^2} \\]\n\nwhere $Q$ is the total charge on the conductor and $R$ is the radius of the conductor. However, since the charge is distributed uniformly over the surface of the conductor, the electric field at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor is:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{conductor}} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{L^2} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the net electric field at point P. Since the electric field due to the charge inside the cavity and the spherical conductor are spherically symmetric, we can use the principle of superposition to find the net electric field:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{net}} = E_{\\text{cavity}} + E_{\\text{conductor}} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{l^2} + \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{L^2} \\]\n\nHowever, we don't have the value of $Q$ ( the total charge on the spherical conductor. We can't find the exact value of the electric field without knowing the total charge on the conductor. But we can express the electric field in terms of the distance $l$ and $L$.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$"
