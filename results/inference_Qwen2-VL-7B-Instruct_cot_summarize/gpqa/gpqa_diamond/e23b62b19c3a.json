The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n\nA. CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\nB.

CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\n\nThe broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers in the FTIR spectrum suggests the presence of an alcohol group (-OH, which is consistent with the presence of an ester group in the compound. The strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O, which is also also consistent with the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl-hydrogens, which is consistent with the presence of an ester group. The doublet of triplets of quartet and doublet of triplets of triplets signals in the 1H NMR spectrum are consistent with the presence of an ester group."
