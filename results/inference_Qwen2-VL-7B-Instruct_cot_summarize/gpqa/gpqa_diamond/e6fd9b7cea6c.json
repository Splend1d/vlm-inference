It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?\n\nA. ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nB. ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\nC. ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nD. ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n"

The t-distribution is given by:\n\nt = ( (t_1 - t_2) / ( t1*t2)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n\nln(t) = ln( (t_1 - t_2) / ( t1*t2))\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = [ (t_1 - t_2) / ( t1*t2)]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
