                    "text": "To determine which compound does not show tautomerism and which one will show optical isomerism, we need to understand the definitions and characteristics of each type of isomer.\n\n1. **Tautomerism**: This refers to the interconversion of two or more molecules that differ in the position of a double bond but have the same molecular formula and functional groups. Tautomerism is possible when a compound has a double bond that can be shifted to different positions within the molecule.\n\n2. **Optical Isomerism ( (Stereoisomerism)**: This occurs when molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. Optical isomers are also known as enantiomers and are mirror images of each other that cannot be superimposed.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n### Compound Analysis\n\n**A. Benzoquinone (**\n- Benzoquinone is a compound with the molecular formula C8H4O2. It is a quinone, which means it has a double bond between two aromatic rings. This double bond can be shifted to different positions, allowing for tautomerism.\n\n**B. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n- Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a compound with the molecular formula C8H6O3. It is a trione, which means it has three carbonyl groups. The connectivity of of these groups does not allow for tautomerism because the double bond cannot be shifted to different positions.\n\n**C. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n- Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a compound with the molecular formula C8H14O2. It is a carboxylic acid ester. The connectivity of of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups does not allow for tautomerism because the double bond cannot be shifted to different positions.\n\n**D. Dimethyl fumarate**\n- Dimethyl fumarate is a compound with the molecular formula C10H16O2. It is a fumarate, which means it has two double bonds. The connectivity of of these double bonds does not allow for tautomerism because the double bond cannot be shifted to different positions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Tautomerism**: Benzoquinone and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show tautomerism because they can interconvert between different structures.\n- **Optical Isomerism**: Dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism because it has two double bonds that can be connected in different ways, leading to different spatial arrangements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate**"
