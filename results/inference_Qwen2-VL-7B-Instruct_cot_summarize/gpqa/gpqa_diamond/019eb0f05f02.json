                    "text": "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to understand the concept of optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, also also known as chirality, occurs when molecules have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity but differ in their spatial arrangement. This results in molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, and thus are optically active.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n   - This compound has a complex structure with multiple substituents and a specific arrangement. It is likely to exhibit optical isomerism due to the presence of chiral centers.\n\n2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n   - This compound has a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group. The hydroxyl group can be in two different spatial orientations, leading to two different optical isomers.\n\n3. **benzophenone**\n   - Benzophenone has a benzene ring and a ketone group. It does not have any chiral centers, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4. **dimethyl fumarate**\n   - Fumarate is a dicarboxylic acid with two double bonds. The double bonds can be in two different spatial orientations, leading to two different optical isomers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the compounds that show optical isomerism are:\n\n- dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n- methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n- dimethyl fumarate\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. 1, 2 and 4**"
