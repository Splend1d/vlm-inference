Therefore, it gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. This is correct.\n\nB. **F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n   - **Compound F** is 2,3-dimethylbutane acid chloride, which is a precursor for the synthesis of dyes. This is correct.\n\nC. **C is a flammable gas.**\n   - **Compound C** is 2,3-dimethylbutanol, which is a flammable liquid, not a gas. This statement is incorrect.\n\nD. **H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n   - **Compound H** is 2,3-dimethylbutane acid sodium salt, which does not give a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. This is incorrect.\n\nThe incorrect statement is:\n\n**C. C is a flammable gas.**"
