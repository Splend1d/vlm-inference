You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?\n\nA. cytoplasmic localization of the red signal\nB. there is no green signal\nC. cell line-specific red signals label different organelles\nD. green signal colocalizes with the red signal\n"
