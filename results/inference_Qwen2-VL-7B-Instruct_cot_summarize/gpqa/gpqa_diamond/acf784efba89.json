The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?\n\nA. chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis\nB. attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I\nC. chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote\nD. progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis.\n\nKlinefelter's syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males, typically resulting in 47 chromosomes (46 autosomes and an extra X chromosome (47,XXY). The molecular mechanism responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome ( (which is caused by an extra 21st chromosome) is the resolution of chiasmata by separase during diakinesis. \n\nChiasmata are sites of crossing over between homologous chromosomes, and their resolution is a critical step in meiosis. In Klinefelter's syndrome, the extra X chromosome does not participate in crossing over, which means that the resolution of chiasmata is less prominent. This results in fewer phenotypic consequences compared to Down's syndrome, where the extra chromosome is involved in crossing over and can lead to more severe developmental issues."
