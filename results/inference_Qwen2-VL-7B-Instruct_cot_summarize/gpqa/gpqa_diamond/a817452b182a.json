How would you go about designing this kit?\n\nA. First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.\nB. First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.\nC. First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.\nD. First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis\n"
