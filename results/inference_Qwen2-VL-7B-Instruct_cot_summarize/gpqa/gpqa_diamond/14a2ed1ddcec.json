Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Substance X**: Incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\n2. **Liquid Y**: Reacts violently with Substance X.\n3. **Gas W**: Contains the same number of neutrons and protons as the molecule of Substance X.\n4. **Precipitate G**: Forms when Substance X reacts with Liquid Y.\n5. **B**: Released when G is heated.\n6. **Meltinging point of B**: Very close to 277 K ( (277 K is approximately 0 0 K, which is close to the melting point of water (0 K).\n\nGiven that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen, we can infer that the keto acid is likely a simple compound like acetylacetone (C\u2084H\u2085O\u2082.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Elements in Substance X**:\n   - Since Substance X reacts violently with Liquid Y and forms a precipitate G, it likely contains a metal (M.\n   - The gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons as Substance X, suggesting it is a hydrogen molecule (H\u2082.\n\n2. **Identify Elements in Precipitate G**:\n   - The precipitate G forms when Substance X reacts with Liquid Y.\n   - The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point very close to 277 K ( (277 K is approximately 0 K, which is close to the melting point of water 0 K).\n\n3. **Identify Elements in B**:\n   - B has a melting point very close to 277 K, suggesting it is water (H\u2082O.\n\n4. **Identify Elements in Keto Acid**:\n   - The keto acid reacts with Substance X and contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n   - The keto acid is likely acetylacetone (C\u2084H\u2085O\u2082.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Substance X** must contain a metal (M) and hydrogen (H.\n- **Liquid Y** is likely water (H\u2082O.\n- **Gas W** is likely hydrogen molecule H\u2082.\n- **Precipitate G** is likely a compound containing M and H.\n- **B** is likely water H\u2082O.\n\n### Atomic Mass Calculation:\n- **Metal (M**: Let's assume M is a metal with a common atomic mass.\n- **Hydrogen (H**: The atomic mass of hydrogen is 1.\n\n### Sum of Atomic Masses:\n- **Lightest Element (H**: 1\n- **Heaviest Element M**: Let's assume the atomic mass of M is 31 ( (a common atomic mass for metals).\n\n### Cumulative Atomic Mass:\n- **Cumulative Atomic Mass = Lightest Element + Heaviest Element = 1 + 31 = 32**\n\nThe closest option to 32 is **31**.\n\n**Final Answer: A. 31**"
