                    "text": "To determine which assumptions jointly imply the \"impulse\" approximation in the context of many-body nuclear calculations, we need to analyze each option carefully.\n\n1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n   - This assumption implies that the interaction is localized to individual nucleons, which is a key aspect of the impulse approximation.\n\n2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n   - This assumption implies that the nucleus as a whole is transparent to the interaction, except for the selected nucleon. This is also a crucial aspect of the impulse approximation, as it treats the nucleus as a whole.\n\n3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n   - This assumption implies that the internal quarks of the selected nucleon are treated as non-relativistic. This is important because the impulse approximation often assumes that the internal structure of the nucleon can be neglected.\n\n4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding force.**\n   - This assumption implies that the selected nucleon is treated as if it experiences no binding force, which is another key aspect of the impulse approximation.\n\nGiven these analyses, the assumptions that jointly imply the \"impulse\" approximation are:\n\n- The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleon ( (1)\n- The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon ( (2)\n- The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic ( (3)\n- The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no bind force. ( (4)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 1,3,4**"
