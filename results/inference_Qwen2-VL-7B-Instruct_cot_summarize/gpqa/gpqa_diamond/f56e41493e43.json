                    "text": "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we need to use the relationship between the orbital period, the mass of the planets, and their distances from the star. The orbital period \\( T \\) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by Kepler's's third law:\n\n\\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since the masses of the planets is not directly relevant to the orbital period in this context, we can focus on the orbital distances.\n\nGiven the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures and the masses ratios, we can infer the relative distances of the planets from the star. The equilibrium temperature \\( T_e \\) of a planet is related to its distance \\( a \\) from the star by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\n\\[ T_e \\propto \\frac{1}{a^1.5} \\]\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. We can write these ratios as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} \\approx 1.4 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{T_{e2}}{T_{e3}} \\approx 2.3 \\]\n\nCombining these ratios to find the ratio of \\( T_{e1} \\) to \\( T_{e3} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e3}} = \\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} \\cdot \\frac{T_{e2}}{T_{e3}} \\approx 1.4 \\cdot 2.3 \\approx 3.12 \\]\n\nThis means that the distance of Planet1 from the star is approximately 3.12 times the distance of Planet3 from the star. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{a_{Planet3}}{a_{Planet1}} \\right)^{3/2} \\approx \\left( \\frac{1}{3.12} \\right)^{3/2} \\approx 0.32 \\]\n\nSo, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 3.2.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. ~ 3.2"
