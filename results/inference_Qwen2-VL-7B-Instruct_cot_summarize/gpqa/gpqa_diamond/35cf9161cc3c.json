The transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star, and the occultation occurs when the planet blocks the star from view.\n\nGiven:\n- The radius of the first planet is 1 Earth radius.\n- The radius of the second planet is 2.5 times that of Earth.\n- The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days.\n- The star has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun.\n\nThe transit impact parameter ( \\( b \\) is given as 0.2. For a planet to exhibit both transit and occultation events, the planet's radius must be such that it can block the star from view.\n\nThe transit impact parameter \\( b \\) is defined as:\n\\[ b = \\frac{R_p}{a} \\]\nwhere \\( R_p \\) is the planet's radius and \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nFor the first planet:\n\\[ b = \\frac{1}{a} = 0.2 \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5 \\text{ AU} \\]\n\nFor the second planet:\n\\[ R_p = 2.5 \\text{ Earth radii} \\]\n\\[ b = \\frac{2.5}{a} \\]\n\nTo find the maximum orbital period \\( P \\) for the second planet, we need to ensure that the planet's radius allows it to block the star from view. The maximum orbital period \\( P \\) for a planet to block the star from view is when the planet's radius is equal to the star's radius:\n\\[ R_p = 1.5 \\text{ Sun radii} \\]\n\nFor the second planet:\n\\[ 2.5 \\text{ Earth radii} = 1.5 \\text{ Sun radii} \\]\n\nTo find the orbital period \\( P \\) for the second planet, we use Kepler's Third Law:\n\\[ P^2 = a^3 \\]\n\\[ P = \\sqrt{a^3} \\]\n\nGiven \\( a = 5 \\text{ AU} \\):\n\\[ p = \\sqrt{5^3} = \\sqrt{125} \\approx 11.18 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum orbital period of the second planet is approximately 11.18 days.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\nA. ~ 12.5"
