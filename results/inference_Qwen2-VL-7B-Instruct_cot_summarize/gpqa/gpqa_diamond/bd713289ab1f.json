F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\n   - D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\n2. **Molecular Symmetry Groups:**\n   - **D\u221eh:** This group represents a molecule with infinite symmetry, which is not typical for most molecules.\n   - **C2:** This group represents a molecule with two-fold rotational symmetry.\n   - **C2v:** This group represents a molecule with two-fold rotational symmetry and two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n   - **D4h:** This group represents a molecule with four-fold rotational symmetry and four perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n\n3. **Analysis of E:**\n   - E is formed from C and D in a 1:2 ratio.\n   - C is a bright red product formed from A and B.\n   - D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.\n   - E is extremely hazardous and is formed from C and D.\n\nGiven that E is formed from C and D in a 1:2 ratio, and considering the symmetry properties of C and D, we need to determine the symmetry group of E.\n\n- C is a bright red product, which suggests a certain level of symmetry.\n- D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio, suggesting it has some symmetry.\n\nConsidering the options:\n- **C2:** This group represents a molecule with two-fold rotational symmetry. This is a reasonable symmetry group for E, as it could be a molecule with two-fold rotational symmetry.\n- **C2v:** This group represents a molecule with two-fold rotational symmetry and two perpendicular planes of symmetry. This is also a reasonable symmetry group for E, as it could be a molecule with two-fold rotational symmetry and two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n- **D4h:** This represents a molecule with four-fold rotational symmetry and four perpendicular planes of symmetry. This is not a reasonable symmetry group for E, as it would be too symmetrical for a hazardous product.\n\nGiven the options and the properties of E, the most reasonable symmetry group for E is:\n\n**C2v**"
