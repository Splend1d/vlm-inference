The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA. C6H10O2\nB. C6H12O2\nC. C6H12O\nD. C6H10O\n"

The strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers are characteristic of carbonyyl groups ((-CO-), indicating the presence of esters or carboxylic acids.\n\n2. **1H NMR Spectrum**: The presence of vinyl-hydrogens suggests the presence of a double bond ((-CH=ch-).\n\n3. **Mass Spectrum**: The fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponds to the molecular ion peak of C6H10O2.\n\nGiven these observations, the compound must contain both an alcohol group (-OH) and a carbonyl group (-CO-), which is consistent with the presence of an ester group. The mass spectrum confirms that the compound has a molecular formula of C6H10O2.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is:\n\n**A. C6H10O2**"
