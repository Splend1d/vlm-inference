The electric field inside a grounded conducting sphere is zero, so the potential energy is due to the electric field outside the sphere.\n\nThe electric field outside a grounded conducting sphere is given by:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{kq}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the Coulomb constant, \\( q \\) is the charge, and \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of the sphere.\n\nThe potential energy \\( U \\) of a point charge \\( q \\) in an electric field \\( E \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ U = -qE \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( E \\) into the equation for \\( U \\):\n\n\\[ U = -q \\left( \\frac{kq}{r^2} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{kq^2}{r^2} \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( r \\) with \\( d \\) ( since the charge is placed a distance \\( d \\) away from the center of the sphere:\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{kq^2}{d^2} \\]\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{kq^2}{d^2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{kq^2}{d^2} \\]\n\nThis matches option B:\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{1}{2} kq^2 \\frac{d}{d^2 + R^2} \\]\n\nHowever, this option is not correct because it does not match the correct formula for the potential energy. The correct formula is:\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{kq^2}{d^2} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{kq^2}{d^2} \\]\n\nThis matches option C:\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{kq^2}{d^2} \\]"
