The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA. ~ 0.53\nB. ~ 0.98\nC. ~ 1.05\nD. ~ 1.30\n"

The formula for the Stefan-Boltzmann law is:\n\n\\[ P = \\sigma A T^4 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the power emitted by the black body,\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (\\( 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{W m}^2/\\text{K}^4 \\)),\n- \\( A \\) is the surface area of the black body,\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature of the black body.\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the amount of radiation absorbed by each planet is the same. Therefore, the ratio of their emitted radiation (and hence their temperatures) can be determined by the ratio of their surface areas.\n\nThe surface area \\( A \\) of a sphere is given by:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nFor Planet1:\n- Mass = 7 Earth masses\n- Radius = 1.7 times Earth's radius\n\nFor Planet2:\n- Mass = 5 Earth masses\n- Radius = 1.3 times Earth's radius\n\nSince the mass of a planet is proportional to its radius cubed ( ( \\( M = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\)), we can use this relationship to find the ratio of their radii:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\left( \\frac{m_1}{m_2} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given masses:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\]\n\nCalculating the cube root of the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\left( 1.4 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\approx 1.107 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of their surface areas:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\left( \\frac{r_1}{r_2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\left( 1.107 \\right)^2 \\approx 1.229 \\]\n\nSince the ratio of the emitted radiation (and hence the temperature) is the inverse of the ratio of the surface areas:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{A_1}{A_2}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1.229} \\approx 0.816 \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.816.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\n\nA. ~ 0.53"
