The mass dimension of \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\) is \\(-1\\) ( (since it is a four-component spinor), the mass dimension of \\(\\psi\\) is \\(-1\\) ( (for the same reason), and the mass dimension of \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) is \\(0 \\) ( (since it is a field strength tensor). The mass dimension of \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is \\(0 \\)  ( because it is a product of gamma matrices, which have mass dimension \\(0 \\).\n\nThus, the mass dimension of the entire term \\(\\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-1 + 0 + (-1) + 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) must be \\(1\\) to make the entire term dimensionless:\n\n\\[\n\\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M} = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine if the theory is renormalizable. A theory is renormalizable if the Lagrangian can be written in a form where all divergences can be absorbed into finite counterterms. For a theory to be renormalizable, the Lagrangian must be dimensionally regularizable and the divergences must be finite.\n\nThe given Lagrangian is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{int} = \\kappa \\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\n\\]\n\nThis Lagrangian is already dimensionally regularizable because it is a product of fields with well-defined dimensions. The divergence of this term is finite because it is a product of fields with well-defined dimensions.\n\nTherefore, the theory is renormalizable.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. The mass dimension \\(\\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M}=1\\). The theory is renormalizable."
