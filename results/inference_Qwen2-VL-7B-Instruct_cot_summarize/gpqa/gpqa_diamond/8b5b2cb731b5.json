This lone pair of electrons causes the oxygen atoms to be more electronegative than the carbon atoms in the adamantane ring. This results in the oxygen atoms being more deshielded than the carbon atoms, and therefore the hydrogen atoms attached to the oxygen atoms are more deshielded than the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms.\nIn the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom will be a triplet. This is because the hydrogen atom is attached to a carbon atom that is part of a ring, and therefore it will have three equivalent neighbors."
