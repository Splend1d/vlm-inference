He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n\n\nA. Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples\nB. Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles\nC. The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates\nD. qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates.\n\nIn qPCR, the cycle threshold ( (ct) value is inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample. The closer the ct values are to each other, the more consistent the results are. In this case, the ct values for each concentration are relatively close to each other, indicating that the results are consistent. Therefore, the discrepancies in the results are not due to the ct values not being in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in the samples ( (A), the ten-fold dilution being more than 3.3 cycles ( (B), or qPCR not being able to be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ( (D). Instead, the discrepancies are likely due to the deviation being more than 0.3 between technical replicates, which is a common issue in qPCR experiments."
