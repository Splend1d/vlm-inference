As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\n\nA.

This suggests that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions, as their combined effect is less than the sum of their individual effects.\n\n3. **G1 is epistatic towards G3**: The g1g3 double mutant has a lower resistance level (10% compared to the single mutants, indicating that G1 suppresses the effect of G3. Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene is masked or altered by the presence of another gene.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**B.
