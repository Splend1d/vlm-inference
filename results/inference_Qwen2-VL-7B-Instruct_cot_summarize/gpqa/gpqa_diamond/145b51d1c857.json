In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:\n\nA. Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 \u03bcM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide\nB. Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells\nC. Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant\nD. Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit\n"

Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatatant\n\nThis experiment will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug because it involves the transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant. This experiment is focused on measuring the activity of luciferase, which is an enzyme that produces light when it reacts with luciferin. This does not provide information about the role of the drug in the mitochondria."
