Anisole (C6H5OCH3) is a phenol derivative, and the reaction likely involves the formation of a biphenyl derivative through a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction.\n\nGiven the above reactions, the final product should be a biphenyl derivative with a bromo group and a methoxy group. The structure of the final product should be:\n\n- **3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl"
