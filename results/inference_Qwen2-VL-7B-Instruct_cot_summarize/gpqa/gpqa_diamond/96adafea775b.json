Let's analyze each option to determine which one correctly describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.\n\nA. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.\n- This option correctly identifies a trap-free single-carrier device, which is a key assumption for the Mott-Gurney equation. However, it also mentions \"no carrier injection barrier,\" which is not a requirement for the validity of the equation. The equation is valid even in the presence of a carrier injection barrier. Therefore, this option is not entirely accurate.\n\nB. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.\n- This option mentions a single-carrier device, which is correct. However, it also mentions a \"Schottky contact,\" which is not a requirement for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation is valid for any type of contact, including Ohmic contacts. Therefore, this option is not entirely accurate.\n\nC. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.\n- This option mentions a two-carrier device, which is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived for a single-carrier device. Therefore, this option is not valid.\n\nD. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.\n- This option correctly identifies a trap-free single-carrier device, which is a key assumption for the validity of the equation. It also mentions an \"Ohmic contact,\" which is correct, and it also mentions \"negligible drift current,\" which is also a requirement for the validity of the equation. Therefore, this option is the most accurate.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is:\n\nD. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current."
