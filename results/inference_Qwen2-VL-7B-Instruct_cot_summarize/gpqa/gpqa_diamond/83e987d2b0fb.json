The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.\n\nIn synthetic organic chemistry, when compounds are \"on top of each other,\" it typically means that they are interacting with each other through non-covalent forces, such as van der Waals interactions. This can happen when the compounds have similar shapes and sizes, allowing them to fit together in a way that minimizes energy. This kind of interaction can lead to the compounds being difficult to separate, which is why the second chemist might say their compounds are \"on top of each other.\""
