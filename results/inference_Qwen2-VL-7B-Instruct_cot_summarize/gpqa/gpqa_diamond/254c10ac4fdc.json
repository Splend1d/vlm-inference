The electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges is given by the formula:\n\nU = (1/2 * \u03a3 (q_i * q_j / r_ij\n\nwhere q_i and q_j are the charges, and r_ij is the distance between them.\n\nIn this case, we have 13 charges, with 12 charges at a distance of 2 meters from the point P, and one charge at P. The distance between the charges at P and the charges at a distance of 2 meters is 2 meters. The distance between the charges at P and the charges at a distance of 2 meters is 2 meters. The distance between the charges at P and the charges at a distance of 2 meters is 2 meters.\n\nThe electrostatic potential energy of the system is:\n\nU = (1/2 * \u03a3 (q_i * q_j / r_ij\n\nU = 1/2 * (2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 + 2 * 2 / 2)\n\nU = 122.330 Joules\n\nTherefore, the minimum energy of the system is 122.330 Joules, which corresponds to option A."
