Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?\n\nA. loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype\nB. protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype\nC. protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\nD. change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype\n"

In this case, the mutation Y would cause the protein to misfold or change its conformation, leading to a gain-of-function phenotype. This would interfere with the wild-type protein's ability to dimerize and function to the nucleus, thereby disrupting gene transcription and potentially leading to a loss-of-function phenotype."
