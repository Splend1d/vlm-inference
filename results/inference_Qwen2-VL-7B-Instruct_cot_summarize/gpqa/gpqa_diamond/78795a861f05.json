This is because the shorter-lived state will decay before we can resolve the difference between the two states.\n\nGiven:\n- Lifetime of the first state (E1 = 10^-9 sec\n- Lifetime of the second state E2 = 10^-8 sec\n\nThe shorter lifetime is 10^-8 sec. Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than 10^-8 eV.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. 10^-4 eV\n- This is greater than 10^-8 eV, so it could be resolved.\n\nB. 10^-8 eV\n- This is equal to the lifetime of the second state, so it cannot be resolved.\n\nC. 10^-11 eV\n- This is less than 10^-8 eV, so it cannot be resolved.\n\nD. 10^-9 eV\n- This is less than 10^-8 eV, so it cannot be resolved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 10^-4 eV"
