However, we can make some educated guesses based on the general chemistry involved.\n\nAssuming the final product 4 is a complex molecule with multiple rings and functional groups, it is likely to have a significant number of hydrogen atoms. The exact number would depend on the specific structure of 4, which is not provided.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 10\nB. 7\nC. 4\nD. 8\n\nWithout more specific information, it is not possible to accurately determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on 4. Therefore, the correct answer cannot be determined from the given information."
