                    "text": "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we need to consider the relationship between the orbital periods and the distance from the star. The planets are in orbital resonance with orbital periods in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. This means their orbital periods are proportional to their distances from the star, with the closest planet having the shortest period and the farthest planet having the longest period.\n\nGiven the orbital periods in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we can denote the orbital periods of the planets as \\( T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, \\) and \\( T_5 \\) respectively. The distances from the star to each planet can be represented as \\( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, \\) and \\( d_5 \\).\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is directly proportional to the the square root of the distance from the star. This is because the amount of energy received from the star ( \\( E \\) ) is proportional to the inverse square of the distance from the star ( \\( d \\) ), and the temperature \\( T \\) is proportional to the square root of the energy received per unit area ( \\( \\sqrt{E} \\).\n\nThus, the equilibrium temperature \\( T \\) of a planet is given by:\n\\[ T \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d}} \\]\n\nGiven the distances ratios:\n\\[ d_1 : d_2 : d_3 : d_4 : d_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5 \\]\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d_4}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_2}{d_4}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the distance ratios:\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{t_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3.5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3.5}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5714} \\approx 0.757 \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.757, which is closest to option C.\n\nThe final answer is:\nC. ~0.75"
