It involves modifying the theory in a way that makes it mathematically well-defined, but the modifications are then removed in the limit of high energies or short distances.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Classical Electrodynamics**: This is the theory of the electromagnetic field without quantum effects. It does not involve regularization because it is a classical theory and does not deal with the quantum nature of particles.\n\nB. **Superstring Theory**: This is a theoretical framework in which the fundamental objects are one-dimensional \"strings\" rather than point-like particles. It is a quantum theory and thus requires regularization to deal with infinities at high energies.\n\nC. **Quantum Chromodynamics ( (QCD)**: This is the quantum field theory of the strong interaction, which is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is a quantum theory and thus requires regularization to deal with inf finities at high energies.\n\nD. **Quantum Electrodynamics ( (QED)**: This is the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic interaction. It is a quantum theory and thus requires regularization to deal with inf finities at high energies.\n\nGiven this analysis, the only theory that never requires regularization at high energies is:\n\nA.
