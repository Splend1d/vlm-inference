However, the IR spectrum of Compound E shows a peak at around 1715 cm^-1, which is lower than the peak of Compound A. This suggests that Compound E is a derivative of Compound A, likely through a reduction or elimination reaction.\n\nGiven the information, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**B. 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one**\n\nThis compound fits the structure of 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane and has a peak at around 1750 cm^-1, which matches the IR spectrum of Compound A. It is also a reasonable candidate for Compound E, given the reduction and elimination reactions described in the scheme."
