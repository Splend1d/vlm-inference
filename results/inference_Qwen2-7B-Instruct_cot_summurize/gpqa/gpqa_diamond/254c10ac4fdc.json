                    "text": "To find the minimum energy of the system, we can use Coulomb's Law. Coulomb's Law states that the electrostatic force between two charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by:\n\nF = k * |q1*q2| / r^2\n\nwhere k is Coulomb's constant (\u2248 8.99 x 10^9 N*m^2/C^2.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of all pairs of charges. Since there are 12 charges at a distance of 2 m from the central charge, the total energy is:\n\nE_total = 12 * (sum(F_ij)\n\nwhere F_ij is the force between any pair of charges i and j.\n\nSince all charges are equal (2e, the force between any pair of charges will be:\n\nF_ij = k * (|2e*2e| / (2^2) = k * 4e^2 / 4 = k * e^2\n\nTherefore, the total energy is:\n\nE_total = 12 * (sum(F_ij) = 12 * 12 * k * e^2 = 144 * k * e^2\n\nSubstituting the value for Coulomb's constant:\n\nE_total = 144 * 8.99 x 10^9 * ( (2e)^2 \u2248 2.822 x 10^-22 J\n\nSo, the answer is C. 2.822 x 10^-22."
