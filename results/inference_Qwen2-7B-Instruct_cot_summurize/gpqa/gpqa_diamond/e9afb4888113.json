Classical Electrodynamics\n\nRegularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with infinities that arise when calculations are done naively. Classical electrodynamics, being it a classical theory, does not involve such infinities and thus does not require regularization. \n\nB. Superstring Theory: While technically a quantum theory, superstring theory also doesn't require regularization at high energies due to its inherent finiteness.\n\nC. Quantum Chromodynamics ( and \n\nD. Quantum Electrodynamics: Both these theories are quantum field theories and do require regularization techniques when calculating scattering amplitudes or other processes at high energies.\n\nPlease note that while superstring theory avoids some infinities of quantum field theories due to its mathematical structure, it still has a complex regularization scheme related to its higher-dimensional nature and involves regularization in calculations. The key distinction here is that classical electrodynamics, being it a classical theory, does not suffer from infinities and thus does not need regularization."
