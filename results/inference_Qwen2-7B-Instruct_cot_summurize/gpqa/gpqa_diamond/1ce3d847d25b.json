For a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, one calcium ion reacts with one EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) molecule to form a complex. \n\nGiven:\n- Concentration of Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M \n- Dissociation constant (Kc = 5 x 10^10\n\nThe dissociation equation for the complex is:\n\\[ Ca^{2+} + EDTA \\rightleftharpoons Ca-EDTA \\]\n\nAt equilibrium, let [Ca^2+] = x (M. Since the complex is formed stoichiometrically, the concentration of EDTA will also decrease by x M at equilibrium. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so at equilibrium, it will be (0.02 - x M.\n\nSubstituting these values into the dissociation constant expression:\n\n\\[ K_c = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA]}{[Ca-EDTA]} \\]\n\nSince the reaction goes to completion, the concentration of the complex at equilibrium is negligible compared to the starting concentration. Therefore, we can approximate [Ca-EDTA] \u2248 0.02 M. So,\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{x \\times x}{0.02} \\]\n\n\\[ x^2 = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\times 0.02 \\]\n\n\\[ x^2 = 1 \\times 10^{9} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{1 \\times 10^{9}} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 1 \\times 10^{-4} \\]\n\nSo, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-4}\\) M, which is not among the provided options. It seems there might have been an error in the calculation or the provided options. Based on the correct calculation process, the answer would be something around \\(1 \\times 10^{-4}\\) M, which is not listed among A) 1.0x10^-2 M, B) 6.3x10^-7 M, C) 2.0x10^-2 M, D) 5.0x10^-3 M."
