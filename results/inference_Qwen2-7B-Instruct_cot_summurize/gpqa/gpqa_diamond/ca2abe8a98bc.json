                    "text": "The identification of the chemical formula can be based on the information provided from both the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.\n\nFrom the 1H NMR data:\n- Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H suggest there are two aromatic rings in the molecule.\n- Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H indicate the presence of a vinyl group.\n- One doublet and one doublet of quartets for the vinyl-H signals suggests the presence of a double bond in the molecule, consistent with a di-substituted alkene or alkyne.\n- Two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups suggest there are two methyl groups attached to the ring.\n\nFrom the FTIR data:\n- The presence of an ester group is indicated by an absorption peak, which is characteristic of esters.\n\nConsidering the structure, we know that the compound is an ester with an aromatic ring. The presence of a double bond indicates that it's a di-substituted alkene or alkyne. Since the compound has two methyl groups (-CH3) attached to the ring and an ester group, we need to consider how these groups could be distributed among the given options.\n\nThe number of hydrogen atoms in the given options can be calculated:\n- C11H12O2 would contain 11 * 1 + 2 = 13 H atoms,\n- C11H14O2 would contain 11 * 1 + 4 = 15 H atoms,\n- C12H12O2 would contain 12 * 1 + 2 = 14 H atoms,\n- C12H14O2 would contain 12 * 1 + 4 = 16 H atoms.\n\nGiven that the NMR spectrum indicates the presence of two signals corresponding to vinyl-H, this implies there are two double bonds in the molecule, contributing to at least four additional hydrogen atoms beyond the aromatic and methyl groups. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms must accommodate these additional bonds, leading us to option C12H14O2, which has exactly 14 hydrogen atoms. This matches the total number of hydrogen atoms derived from the presence of two aromatic rings systems, two vinyl groups, and two methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. C12H14O2**."
