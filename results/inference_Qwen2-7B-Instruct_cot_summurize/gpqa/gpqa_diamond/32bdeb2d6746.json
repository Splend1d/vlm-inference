The specific diketone formed depends on the structure of the initial aldehyde. \n\nIn the case of A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, when treated with sodium nitrite, HCl, and water, it forms 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This is because the double bond in the aldehyde can add across the nitroxy group (NOH to give a cycloadduct.\n\nSimilarly, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one would yield 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione upon undergoing the same reaction conditions. \n\nTherefore, option A correctly pairs the initial aldehydes with the resulting diketones."
