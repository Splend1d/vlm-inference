                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the orbital periods of planets and their distances from the star they orbit around, which is governed by Kepler's Third Law. Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (T (of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a of its orbit. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n\\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\]\n\nor more specifically for circular orbits:\n\n\\[ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{GM}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(T\\) is the orbital period,\n- \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis length ( (which is equal to the orbital radius \\(r\\) for circular orbits),\n- \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\(M\\) is the mass of the central star.\n\nFor two planets to exhibit both transit and occultation events, the orbital period of the second planet must be an integer multiple of the first planet's orbital period. This means that the ratio of their orbital periods must be a rational number.\n\nGiven:\n- The first planet has an orbital period of \\(3\\) days.\n- Its radius is \\(1\\) Earth radius.\n- The star's radius is \\(1.5\\) times that of the Sun.\n- The second planet has a radius of \\(2.5\\) times that of Earth.\n\nWe don't need the exact values of \\(G\\), \\(M\\), or the radii for solving this problem since these factors do not affect the orbital period ratios. We only need to consider the relationships between the orbital periods and the given conditions.\n\nSince we're interested in the maximum orbital period of the second planet, we look for the largest integer multiple of the first planet's period that would still allow for both transit and occultation events. The transit event occurs when the planet passes directly in front of the star as seen from the observer on the other side of the star, and the occultation event occurs when the planet blocks the light of the star from reaching the observer.\n\nFor transit and occultation to occur simultaneously, the orbital period of the second planet should ideally be such that it completes an integer number of orbits while the first planet completes at least one orbit but less than two orbits. This means the ratio of the orbital periods should be close to but less than \\(2:1\\). \n\nGiven the first planet's orbital period is \\(3\\) days, let's find the smallest orbital period for the second planet that satisfies these conditions. The second planet's orbital period should be a multiple of \\(3\\) days, but considering the ratio constraints, the next logical value after \\(3\\) days would be \\(6\\) days (\\(2 \\times 3\\) days), which allows for both transit and occultation events under ideal circumstances.\n\nThus, the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events is \\(6 \\) days, which isn't explicitly listed among your options. However, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. ~ 12.5\nB. ~ 33.5\nC. ~ 7.5\nD. ~ 37.5\n\nThe closest match to our calculation, considering the nature of the question and the options provided, would be:\n\n**A. ~ 12.5**\n\nThis assumes a misinterpretation or simplification of the question's intent due to the lack of a direct match to the calculated result. The correct interpretation based on the question's context and the mathematical understanding provided leads us to conclude that the closest answer choice aligning with the principles discussed and the options available is **A. ~ 12.5** days."
