                    "text": "To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \\(X\\) at the lowest order, we need to look at the particle content in the Standard Model (SM). The interaction term provided suggests that \\(X\\) couples to fermions through Yukawa couplings, which can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa} = -\\lambda f \\bar{\\psi} f(y) (\\upsilon + X(y)) \\psi_f(y)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(f\\) represents a fermion field, \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\) its Dirac conjugate, \\(\\psi_f\\) the fermion wave function, \\(\\lambda\\) the coupling constant, \\(f\\) the fermion mass, \\(\\upsilon\\) the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, and \\(X\\) the bosonic field with mass \\(m_X = 6\\) GeV.\n\nThe SM contains the following fermions:\n- Quarks: up (\\(u\\)), down (\\(d\\)), strange (\\(s\\)), charm (\\(c\\)), bottom (\\(b\\)), and top (\\(t\\)).\n- Leptons: electron (\\(e\\)), muon (\\(\\mu\\)), tau (\\(\\tau\\)), and their respective neutrinos.\n\nThe possible decay modes will depend on the quantum numbers and masses of these fermions. For a massive boson like \\(X\\) with a mass of 6 GeV, it's reasonable to consider decays into quark pairs since the quarks have masses in the range from around 0.3 GeV ( (up, down) to around 1.8 GeV ( (top).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. This option includes all quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top) and lepton pairs (tau, muon, electron, along with their antiparticles. This option seems to cover all possible decays based on the fermion content of the SM.\n\nB. This option includes all quarks except the top quark and only lepton pairs (tau, muon, electron, along with their antiparticles. Since the top quark has a much larger mass than the other quarks ( around 173 GeV), it's not kinematically allowed to decay into a pair of top quarks within the energy scale considered here (since \\(m_X < m_X\\). However, the inclusion of lepton pairs is correct.\n\nC. This option includes all quarks and lepton pairs (tau, muon, electron, along with their antiparticles. As mentioned before, the top quark is excluded due to its significantly higher mass.\n\nD. This option includes all quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom) and lepton pairs (tau, muon, electron, along with their antiparticles. It includes all quarks but excludes the top quark, which is a valid consideration.\n\nBased on the analysis above, options A, B, C, and D all seem plausible for the kinematically allowed decays of \\(X\\) at the lowest order, considering the fermion content of the SM and the mass of \\(X\\). However, without additional information or constraints on the coupling constants or the nature of \\(X\\)'s interactions, it's difficult to definitively choose one over another. In practice, the choice might depend on specific theoretical predictions or experimental observations related to \\(X\\)'s properties and interactions."
