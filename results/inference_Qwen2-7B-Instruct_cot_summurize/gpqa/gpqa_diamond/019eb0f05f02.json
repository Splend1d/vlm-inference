                    "text": "Optical isomerism occurs when molecules are have the same connectivity ( i.e., the same atoms are bonded in the same sequence) but differ in their spatial arrangement. This is typically seen in compounds containing chiral centers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate** - This compound has multiple carbon atoms bonded to four different substituents, making it potentially chiral if one of these positions contains a chiral center. However, without a specific description of the connectivity, we cannot conclusively determine if this compound shows optical isomerism based on the information provided.\n\n2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanate** - This compound is a secondary alcohol, which means it has a carbon atom bonded to four other atoms or groups (a hydroxyl group and three methyl groups. The presence of a single chiral center (the carbon atom attached to the hydroxyl group) indicates that this molecule can exist in enantiomeric forms, thus showing optical isomerism.\n\n3. **benzophenone** - Benzophenone has a phenyl ring and a ketone group. Typically, it does not contain a chiral center unless it is part of a larger, more complex structure. Without additional details, it's hard to say definitively, but in its simplest form, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4. **dimethyl fumarate** - Fumarates typically have a structure with two carboxylic acid groups separated by an ethene ( or ethyne bond. This structure usually contains one chiral center at the double bond, suggesting that dimethyl fumarate can exist in enantiomeric forms, showing optical isomerism.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- **Option 2 ( methyl 2-hydroxypropanate** clearly shows optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.\n- **Option 4. dimethyl fumarate**, assuming the typical structure of fumarates, also shows potential for optical isomerism due to its chiral center.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 2 and 4**."
