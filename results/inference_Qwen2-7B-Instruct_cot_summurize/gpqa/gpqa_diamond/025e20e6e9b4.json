The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?\n\nA. cytoplasmic localization of the red signal\nB. there is no green signal\nC. cell line-specific red signals label different organelles\nD. green signal colocalizes with the red signal\n"

When these cells are injected into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and then tracked over 48 hours with TUNEL-FITC staining for apoptosis, you would expect to see the red signal from the iPSCs and the green signal from the TUNEL-FITC staining indicating apoptosis. If the iPSCs are successfully contributing to the embryo development and interacting with the apoptotic events, you would expect to see the colocalization of both signals in certain areas or cells within the embryo, especially if the iPSCs are fateding towards specific lineages that are undergoing apoptosis or are interacting with apoptotic processes."
