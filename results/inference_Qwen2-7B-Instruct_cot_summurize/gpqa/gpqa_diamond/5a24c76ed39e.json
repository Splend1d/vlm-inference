                    "text": "The problem you're describing involves the diffraction pattern produced by a polygonal aperture. When light passes through such an aperture, it creates an interference pattern on a screen placed at some distance away. The positions of the maxima and minima in this pattern can be calculated using the formulae derived from the theory of diffraction.\n\nFor a polygonal aperture with N sides, the angular positions of the minima can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\sin(\\theta_m) = \\frac{m\\lambda}{a} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\theta_m \\) is the angle of the mth minimum,\n- \\( m \\) is an integer representing the order of the minimum ( (for example, first minimum corresponds to \\( m=1 \\), second minimum corresponds to \\( m=2 \\), etc.),\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the light,\n- \\( a \\) is the length of the apothem of the polygon.\n\nWe're asked to find the angular distance between the first and second minima. This corresponds to calculating \\( \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 \\). \n\nGiven that we want to calculate this angular distance for the case where \\( N \\) is infinitely large, we are essentially looking at a circle, since the number of sides approaches infinity. For a circle, the relationship between the angle and the wavelength and apothem length simplifies due to the symmetry of the circle.\n\nThe first minimum (\\( \\theta_1 \\)) occurs at the first order (\\( m=1 \\)), and the second minimum (\\( \\theta_2 \\)) occurs at the second order (\\( t=2 \\)). Using the formula for \\( \\sin(\\theta_m) \\):\n\n\\[ \\sin(\\theta_1) = \\frac{\\lambda}{a}, \\]\n\\[ \\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{2\\lambda}{a}. \\]\n\nTo find \\( \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 \\), we need to find the inverse sine of these expressions, then subtract them:\n\n\\[ \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 = \\arcsin(\\frac{2\\lambda}{a}) - \\arcsin(\\frac{\\lambda}{a}). \\]\n\nHowever, for small angles, we can use the approximation \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\), which leads to:\n\n\\[ \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 \\approx \\frac{2\\lambda}{a} - \\frac{\\lambda}{a} = \\frac{\\lambda}{a}. \\]\n\nThus, the angular distance between the first and second minima is approximately \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.500 \\lambda / a"
