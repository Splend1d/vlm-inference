                    "text": "You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?\n\nA. the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi\nB. the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing\nC. the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame\nD. ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship\n"

                    "text": "The most likely explanation for the absence of the green signal (eGFP) in the offspring of the cross would be:\n\nC. the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame\n\nThis option implies that during the process of gene splicing and translation, there may have been a misalignment or frameshift mutation that occurred, preventing the correct reading frame for the eGFP sequence to be maintained. As a result, the eGFP protein would not be produced correctly or would be non-functional, leading to no detectable fluorescence when visualized under a confocal microscope.\n\nIt's important to note that the other options are less likely based on the information provided:\n\nA. the receptor-eGFP construct being stuck in the Golgi: This could potentially lead to a lack of expression if the proteins are not properly transported out of the Golgi apparatus to reach their intended location for function or detection. However, without evidence of proper localization or accumulation of the protein, this cannot be confirmed as the sole cause.\n\nB. the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression being missing: If an enhancer element is missing from the construct, it might affect the transcriptional efficiency of the genes, but this does not necessarily prevent the proteins from being translated and expressed. It could affect the overall level of expression rather than the translational efficiency.\n\nD. ligand and the receptor being in a paracrine relationship: The presence of a paracrine relationship between the ligand and receptor would not directly impact the expression of the proteins themselves. Paracrine signaling refers to the direct influence one cell exerts on nearby cells, which would not explain why the receptor protein would not be detectable under a microscope.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer based on the provided context is C, as it directly addresses the issue with the genetic construct leading to the absence of the expected fluorescent signal."
