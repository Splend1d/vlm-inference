In your case, the charges are \\(q\\) and the induced charge on the surface of the grounded conducting sphere, which is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to \\(q\\), due to the principle of electrostatic induction. The distance between these charges is \\(d\\).\n\nHowever, because the sphere is grounded, the induced charge will adjust itself so that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This means that the charge will redistribute on the surface of the sphere, forming a spherical shell. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of this induced charge is \\(R\\), not \\(d\\). \n\nThe key here is to realize that the actual interaction happens between the original charge \\(q\\) and the induced charge on the surface of the sphere, which is effectively at a distance \\(R\\), not \\(d\\). So, we use the formula for the electric potential energy with \\(R\\) as the separation distance:\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{k \\cdot q}{R} \\]\n\nBut since \\(q\\) and the induced charge are equal and opposite, their product \\(q^2\\) appears in the formula. Also, since the electric potential energy between two charges is negative ( indicating work done against the electric force, we have the negative sign. Rearranging and substituting \\(R\\) for \\(d\\) in the denominator to account for the fact that \\(R\\) is actually the effective separation distance for the interaction, we get:\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot k \\cdot q^2 \\cdot \\frac{R}{d^2 - R^2} \\]\n\nThis formula correctly represents the net potential energy of the system consisting of the charge \\(q\\) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \\(R\\), where \\(d\\) is the distance between the charge \\(q\\) and the center of the sphere."
