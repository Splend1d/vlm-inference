The stereochemistry of the product depends on the starting material.\n\nIn the first reaction:\n\nA + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThis indicates that the starting material A, when reduced using LiBH4, forms an (R-enantiomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. \n\nIn the second reaction:\n\nB + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThis indicates that the starting material B, when reduced using borane, forms an S-enantiomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\nConsidering this, the starting material must be an optically active compound (R or S configuration, which can be transformed into the other configuration upon reduction. Therefore, if we take the first reaction as an example, A needs to be in the R configuration to produce the R product upon reduction. Hence, it should be the case that A is in one configuration and B in the other.\n\nThus, the correct answer is: \n\nB. A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis way, A can reduce to give the R enantiomer and B can reduce to give the S enantiomer."
