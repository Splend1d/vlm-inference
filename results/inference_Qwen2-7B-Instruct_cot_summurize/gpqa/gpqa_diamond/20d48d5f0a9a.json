However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.\n\nA. ~2.9\nB. ~4.5\nC. ~1.1\nD. ~7.8\n"

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the presence of dark spots on a star affects its photospheric temperature and, consequently, the population of atoms in different energy levels. The key concept here is the relation between temperature and energy level populations in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). \n\nWhen a star has dark spots, these regions are cooler than the surrounding photosphere due to reduced radiation or enhanced convection. This means that the overall temperature of the star, as perceived from Earth, appears lower because some parts of the star are not contributing as much to the overall radiation output.\n\nThe decrease in temperature leads to a change in the ionization state of elements like titanium (Ti. The transition between the energy levels in question corresponds to a specific wavelength (\u03bb \u2248 1448 \u00c5, which helps us determine the excitation energy for this transition. \n\nThe excitation energy (E (in joules) can be calculated using Planck's constant (h, the speed of light (c), and the wavelength (\u03bb:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nGiven \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448 \u00d7 10^-10 m,\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} Js)(3 \\times 10^8 m/s)}{1448 \\times 10^{-10} m} \\]\n\\[ E \u2248 1.41 \\times 10^{-18} J \\]\n\nThis excitation energy must be compared to the thermal energy at different temperatures to determine how the populations of atoms in the two levels will change. The thermal energy at a temperature T (in joules) is given by:\n\n\\[ kT \\]\n\nwhere k is Boltzmann's constant (\u2248 1.38 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K.\n\nFor a temperature difference \u0394T, the change in population of an atom in one level relative to another is determined by the Boltzmann distribution:\n\n\\[ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = e^{-\\frac{E}{k(\\frac{T_1 + T_2}{2})}} \\]\n\nHere, \\(N_1\\) and \\(N_2\\) are are the populations of atoms in the first and second levels, respectively. The ratio \\(N_2/N_1\\) gives the desired change in the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels.\n\nAssuming \\(T_1\\) is the temperature of the region without spots and \\(T_2\\) is the temperature of the region with spots, we need to compare the ratios of \\(e^{-\\frac{E}{kT_1}}\\) and \\(e^{-\\frac{E}{kT_2}}\\) to find the factor by which the ratio changes.\n\nSince \\(T_1 > T_2\\) ( (as the spots are cooler than the rest of the star), \\(e^{-\\frac{E}{kT_2}}\\) will be larger than \\( e^{-\\frac{E}{kT_1}}\\), meaning the population of atoms in the higher energy level will be relatively more populated when there are spots.\n\nHowever, without specific values for \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\), it's challenging to calculate the exact factor. But we know that the population in the higher energy level increases as the temperature decreases, and the ratio changes inversely with the temperature.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. ~2.9\nB. ~4.5\nC. ~1.1\nD. ~7.8\n\nWe look for a value that reflects the inverse relationship between temperature and the ratio of populations. Since the spots make the temperature lower, the ratio of populations in the levels should increase. This means the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nOption C (~1.1 seems reasonable based on the explanation provided, as it suggests a moderate increase in the ratio of populations in the higher energy level relative to the lower energy level due to the decreased temperature caused by the presence of spots.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely **C. ~1.1**."
