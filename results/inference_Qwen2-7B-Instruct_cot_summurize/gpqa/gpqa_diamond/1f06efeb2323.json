This compound has several types of stereocenters: an ethyl group at C9, a methyl group at C2, and a chlorine atom at C6. The presence of double bonds also implies that there could be geometric isomerism (E/Z isomers) due to the restricted rotation around the double bond.\n\nConsidering the stereocenters:\n\n1. C9 ( has 2 possible configurations (R or S.\n2. C2 has 2 configurations (R or S.\n3. C66 has only one configuration as it is an atom replacing by another atom.\n\nTherefore, the total number of stereoisomers is calculated by multiplying the possible configurations for each stereocenter, which is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 4."
