The wave function is given by:\n\n\\[ \\psi(x) = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i \\]\n\nWe know that the wave function must be real for physical interpretation, which means the imaginary part must be zero when we measure the position. This implies that the coefficient of \\(i\\) must be equal to zero for the wave function to be real.\n\nSo, we set the imaginary part equal to zero:\n\n\\[ -0.5i = 0 \\]\n\nThis condition is automatically satisfied since the imaginary part is already isolated to just \\(0.5i\\), so there's no need to solve for anything here. However, to ensure that the wave function is normalized ( (which is necessary for quantum mechanics), we integrate the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space and set it equal to 1. The integral is taken from \\(x = 1\\) to \\(x = 3\\) because that's the range where the particles are found.\n\n\\[ \\int_{1}^{3} |\\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1 \\]\n\nGiven \\(\\psi(x) = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i\\), the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ \\int_{1}^{3} \\left|\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1 + x}}\\right|^2 dx = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\int_{1}^{3} \\frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx = 1 \\]\n\nSolving this integral gives:\n\n\\[ a^2 \\left[ \\ln(1+x]_{1}^{3} \\right] = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ a^2 (\\ln(4) - \\ln(2)) = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ a^2 \\ln(2) = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ a^2 = \\frac{1}{\\ln(2)} \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ a = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\ln(2)}} \\]\n\nCalculating the value:\n\n\\[ a \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.683}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.459} \\approx 1.207 \\]\n\nNone of the options A, B, C, or D exactly match this value.
