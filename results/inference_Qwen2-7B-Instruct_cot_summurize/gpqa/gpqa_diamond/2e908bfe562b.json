                    "text": "The correct answer is A. V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v}}}\n\nTo derive this solution, let's start by considering the general form for the scalar potential \\(V\\) and vector potential \\(\\vec{A}\\) due to a moving charge \\(q\\). For a static charge, we have:\n\n1. Scalar potential: \\(V(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0|\\vec{r}|}\\)\n\n2. Vector potential: \\(\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi|\\vec{r}|}\\hat{r}\\)\n\nFor a moving charge, we must account for the time-dependence and motion of the charge. The scalar potential due to a moving charge is given by:\n\n\\[V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[\\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t)|}\\right] d^3s\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\vec{s}(t)\\) is the position of the charge as a function of time, and \\(d/dt\\) accounts for the velocity of the charge. We can rewrite this using the chain rule:\n\n\\[V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t)|} d^3s\\]\n\nThis integral represents the work done per unit charge to move the charge from its position \\(\\vec{s}(t)\\) to the field point \\(\\vec{r}\\), which is proportional to the velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) of the charge.\n\nNext, we consider the vector potential \\(\\vec{A\\) due to a moving charge. The vector potential is given by:\n\n\\[\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{s}(t) - \\vec{r}}{|\\vec{s}(t) - \\vec{r}|^3} \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} d^3s\\]\n\nAgain, using the chain rule, we get:\n\n\\[\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{s}(t) - \\vec{r}}{|\\vec{s}(t) - \\vec{r}|^3} d^3s\\]\n\nThe key difference between \\(V\\) and \\(\\vec{A\\) lies in their dependence on the relative position \\(\\vec{d} = \\vec{s}(t) - \\vec{r}\\) and the velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) of the charge. In our case, the charge moves from \\(\\vec{s}(t)\\) to \\(\\vec{r}\\) at time \\(t\\), so we need to account for the relative position and velocity.\n\nThe correct expression for the scalar potential includes the term \\(\\vec{d}. \\vec{v}\\) in the denominator to account for the velocity of the charge, which changes the direction of the potential as the charge moves. This term appears because the potential depends on the change in the relative position \\(\\vec{d}\\) due to the motion of the charge.\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential expression also includes the term \\(\\vec{d}. \\vec{v}\\) in the denominator, reflecting the same principle. The velocity term \\(\\vec{v}\\) in the numerator of the vector potential expression reflects how the magnetic field strength scales with the velocity of the moving charge.\n\nTherefore, the correct option that satisfies these conditions is A."
