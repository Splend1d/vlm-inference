Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.\n\nA. ~ 1.2\nB. ~ 0.4\nC. ~ 0.7\nD. ~ 0.6\n"

                    "text": "To determine the relative masses of the stars in each system, we can use the fact that the amplitude of the radial velocity (RV) variations is directly related to the masses of the stars involved through Kepler's third law and the concept of orbital mechanics. Specifically, the amplitude of the RV variation is proportional to the product of the masses of the two stars and inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period squared. This relationship is described by the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amplitude} = k \\cdot \\frac{m_1 \\cdot m_2}{a^{3/2}} \\]\n\nwhere \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the masses of the two stars, \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and \\(k\\) is a constant that depends on the gravitational constant and the units used.\n\nSince we're interested in comparing the masses of the systems and not their exact values, we can simplify our analysis by ignoring the constant \\(k\\), the semi-major axis \\(a\\), and focusing on the masses themselves. The ratio of the amplitudes gives us a clue about the ratio of the masses, because it cancels out the other factors:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Amplitude}_1}{\\text{Amplitude}_2} = \\frac{m_1 \\cdot m_2}{m_1' \\cdot m_2'} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Amplitude}_1}{\\text{Amplitude}_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_1 \\cdot m_2}{m_1' \\cdot m_2'}} \\]\n\nGiven that the masses are unknown, we can't directly calculate this ratio. However, we know that the mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its stars, so if we were to compare the total masses, we would consider the ratio of the sums:\n\n\\[ \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1' + m_2'} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Amplitude}_1}{\\text{Amplitude}_2}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nWe have the amplitude ratios from the given data:\n\n- For system 1: Amplitude = 10 km/s (and 5 km/s.\n- For system 2: Amplitude = 15 km/s and 10 km/s.\n\nCalculating the ratios:\n\n- For system 1: \\( \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\)\n- For system 2: \\( \\frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \\)\n\nHowever, since we want to compare the systems as a whole, we need to square these ratios (to account for the fact that we're comparing the total masses:\n\n- For system 1: \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n- For system 2: \\( 1.5^2 = 2.25 \\)\n\nSo, the factor by which system 1 is more massive than system 2 is \\( \\frac{4}{2.25} = \\frac{16}{9} \\approx 1.2 \\).\n\nThe correct answer is A. ~ 1.2."
