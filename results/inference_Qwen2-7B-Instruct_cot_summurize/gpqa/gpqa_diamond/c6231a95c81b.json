It's possible that there might have been a misunderstanding in either the question or the answer choices provided. However, if we strictly follow the calculations, none of the options A, B, C, or D would be correct. The closest option to our calculation would be D. 11200 kJ/mol, but this is not accurate based on the information provided and the calculations performed."
