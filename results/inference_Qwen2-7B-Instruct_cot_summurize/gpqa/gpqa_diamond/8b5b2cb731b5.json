The presence of ozone typically leads to ozonolysis of double bonds, but since we're dealing with a compound containing a ketone (after ozonolysis), the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be part of this ketone.\n\nUpon treatment with dimethylsulfide, the hydroxyl group from the ketone is replaced with a dimethylsulfide group. This substitution often leads to a change in the chemical shift of the hydrogen atom involved in the substitution, making it more deshielded.\n\nThe coupling pattern of a hydrogen atom in an alcohol or a ketone (which is now a methylsulfide group after the reaction with dimethylsulfide, can be determined based on its environment and the number of equivalent neighboring protons. In the case of a methylsulfide group attached to a carbon that is part of a saturated chain, the coupling pattern would typically be a triplet ( (because there are usually two equivalent protons (from the two hydrogens attached to the same carbon) that would couple with the deshielded hydrogen, giving a triplet pattern.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
