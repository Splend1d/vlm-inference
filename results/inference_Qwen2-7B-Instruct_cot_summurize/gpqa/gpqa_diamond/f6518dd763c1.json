Treating cyclohexanone with bromine gives cyclohexyl bromide (product 1. This reaction involves a nucleophilic substitution, replacing the oxygen atom with a bromine atom, breaking the C=O bond.\n\n2. Heating cyclohexyl bromide with sodium hydroxide leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of cyclohexanol. This is a dehydration process where a molecule of water is removed from the compound, breaking the O-H bond.\n\n3. Treating cyclohexanol with thionyl chloride (SOCl2 and pyridine results in the formation of cyclohexyl chloride. This reaction is a chlorination process that replaces one of the hydroxyl group's hydrogen atoms with a chlorine atom.\n\n4. Finally, treating cyclohexyl chloride with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)3 results in the reduction of the double bond to form cyclohexanol again. This is a Grignard-like reaction followed by a protonation step, converting the chloride into an alcohol.\n\nAfter the final step, we have cyclohexanol, which has 7 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 7."
