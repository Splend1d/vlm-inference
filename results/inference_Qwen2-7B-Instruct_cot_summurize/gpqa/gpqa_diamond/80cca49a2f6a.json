                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the reactions that occurred**:\n   - Tube 1 contains Mg(ClO4)2, which reacts with water (from the gas produced by heating salts A and B) to form oxygen gas. The increase in weight by 3.60 g indicates the formation of O2.\n   - Tube 3 contains red-hot copper, which reacts with oxygen from the gas stream to form CuO. The increase in weight by 0.80 g indicates the formation of CuO.\n   - Tube 2 contains Ca(OH)2, but there is no change in its weight, suggesting that the gas produced does not react with Ca(OH)2 or that it reacts completely with another component of the gas stream.\n\n2. **Calculate the moles of oxygen and copper oxide**:\n   - From the mass increase in tube 1 ( (3.20 g), we can calculate the moles of oxygen (O2).\n   - From the mass increase in tube 3 ( (0.80 g), we can calculate the moles of copper oxide (CuO).\n\n   Using the molar masses of oxygen (16 g/mol and copper oxide 79.5 g/mol:\n\n   Moles of O2 = 3.20g / 16 g/mol = 0.26 mol\n   Moles of CuO = 0.80g / 79.5 g/mol = 0.01 mol\n\n3. **Understand the reactions**:\n   - The reaction of copper with oxygen forms CuO, indicating that there was enough oxygen for the reaction to occur. This oxygen came from the decomposition of salts A and B.\n   - The formation of CuO suggests that there were 0.01 moles of oxygen available from the decomposition of salts A and B.\n\n4. **Determine the volume of gas C**:\n   - Given as 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP.\n\n5. **Deduce the composition of salts A and B**:\n   - Since tube 2 did not alter the weight, and the oxygen was used up in forming CuO, the remaining gas must be a product of the reaction between salts A and B and the oxygen.\n   - Considering the volume of gas C and the stoichiometry of reactions, we understand that the products gas C is likely a result of the reduction of CuO back to Cu, which would require additional hydrogen or carbon.\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of atoms**:\n   - From the information provided, we have a direct count of moles of oxygen and copper oxide, which implies that the total number of atoms involved in the reactions is primarily oxygen and copper.\n   - However, without specific information about the exact chemical reactions of salts A and B and their composition, we cannot directly determine the total number of atoms in A and B based solely on the given information.\n   - The options provided seem to suggest a direct calculation based on the reactions described, but the direct calculation from the given data is not straightforward due to missing specifics about the chemical nature of salts A and B and their exact reactions.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the lack of specific information regarding the chemical compositions of salts A and B, and their reactions, the question might be asking for an understanding of the process rather than a direct calculation of the total number of atoms in A and B. The options given do not directly correlate with the information provided to make a precise selection.\n\nHowever, if we were to interpret the question in a way that aligns with the options provided, it might be suggesting an understanding of the reaction stoichiometry and the implication that the total number of atoms involved in the reactions (considering oxygen and copper atoms as a proxy for the reactions involving salts A and B) could lead us to one of the options. \n\nThe direct calculation based on the provided data is not feasible without further details about the chemical formulas of salts A and B. Thus, without additional information or clarification on how to directly apply the given reactions to calculate the total number of atoms in A and B, the options given do not provide sufficient guidance for a definitive answer based on the steps outlined above.\n\nPlease note that the detailed reasoning above is based on a best-effort interpretation of the question and the provided context, given the constraints of the information available. A more precise answer would require additional specific details about the chemical compositions of salts A and B and their reactions."
