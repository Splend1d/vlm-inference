Let's correct this and properly calculate the luminosity using the absolute magnitude directly without making a mistake:\n\nThe absolute magnitude \\( M_V \\) relates to luminosity \\( L \\) through:\n\n\\[ M_V = -2.5 * log_{10}(L/L_{sun}) \\]\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\n\n\\[ L = 10^{(-M_V - 4.75)} * L_{sun} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given absolute magnitude of 15:\n\n\\[ L = 10^{(-15 - 4.75)} * L_{sun} \\]\n\\[ L = 10^{-19.75} * L_{sun} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total flux \\( F \\):\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{L}{D^2} \\]\n\\[ F = \\frac{10^{-19.75} * L_{sun}}{(D_{pc})^2} \\]\n\nSince \\( D_{pc} \\) is the distance in parsecs, we will substitute the distances given for each star:\n\nFor star c (at 10 pc:\n\\[ F_c = \\frac{1^{-11.75} * L_{sun}}{(1)^2} \\]\n\\[ F_c = \\frac{1^{-11.75} * L_{sun}}{(1)^2} \\]\n\\[ F_c = 1^{-11.75} * L_{sun}/(1^2) \\]\n\nFor star d (at 200 pc):\n\\[ F_d = \\frac{e^{-1.75} * L_{sun}}{(200)^2} \\]\n\\[ F_d = \\frac{1^{-11.75} * L_{sun}}{(40000) \\]\n\nFor star e (at 5 pc):\n\\[ F_e = \\frac{10^{-19.75} * L_{sun}}{(5)^2} \\]\n\\[ F_e = \\frac{10^{-11.75} * L_{sun}}{(25) \\]\n\nFor star f (at 50 pc):\n\\[ F_f = \\frac{1^{-11.75} * L_{sun}}{(50)^2} \\]\n\\[ F_f = \\frac{1^{-11.75} * L_{sun}}{(2500) \\]\n\nNow, let's use the corrected approach to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (s/n"
