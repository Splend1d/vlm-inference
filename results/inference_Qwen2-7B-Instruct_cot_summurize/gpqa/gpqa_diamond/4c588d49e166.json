                    "text": "To find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, we need to understand how these operators act on the state vector. \n\nFirst, let's write out the state vector and the operator matrices:\n\nThe state vector is:\n\\[ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nOperator P is:\n\\[ P = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nOperator Q is:\n\\[ Q = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nWhen you measure an observable, you apply the operator to the state vector. Let's calculate the outcome for P:\n\n\\[ P|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nSo, the outcome of measuring P is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. We're interested in the case where this outcome is 0 for P, which doesn't occur here.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a misunderstanding in interpreting the result of measuring P. When measuring an observable, the outcome corresponds to the eigenvalue of the operator acting on the state vector. In this context, since the outcome does not directly correlate with 0 or -1 for P, it seems the question might have been intended to ask about the probabilities of outcomes rather than matching them exactly.\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of measuring -1 for Q:\n\nGiven the outcome of P, we apply Q to it:\n\n\\[ Q|\\psi'\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nThe probability of measuring -1 for Q is the squared magnitude of the component of the resulting vector corresponding to -1, which is $(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus, the correct answer based on the interpretation is **B. 1/2**. However, the original question might have been misunderstood due to the mismatch between the possible outcomes of measuring P and the specific values being asked for (0 for P and -1 for Q)."
