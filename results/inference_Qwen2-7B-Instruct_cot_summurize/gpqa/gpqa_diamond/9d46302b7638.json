The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA. ~ 0.53\nB. ~ 0.98\nC. ~ 1.05\nD. ~ 1.30\n"

                    "text": "To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the power emitted by a blackbody to its temperature. For two planets with the same albedo, the ratio of their powers emitted (P1/P2 would be equal to the ratio of their surface areas (A1/A2, since the power emitted is proportional to the surface area.\n\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by \\( A = 4\\pi r^2 \\). Therefore, the ratio of the surface areas is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A1}{A2} = \\frac{4\\pi r1^2}{4\\pi r2^2} = \\left(\\frac{r1}{r2}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Radius of Planet1 (\\(r1\\)) = 1.7 times that of Earth = 1.7 * 6371 km\n- Radius of Planet2 (\\(r2\\)) = 1.3 times that of Earth = 1.3 * 6371 km\n\n\\[ \\frac{A1}{A2} = \\left(\\frac{1.7}{1.3}\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{A1}{A2} = \\left(\\frac{1.7}{1.3}\\right)^2 \\approx 1.30 \\]\n\nSince the power emitted is proportional to the surface area, and the power emitted is also proportional to the temperature to the fourth power according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the powers emitted is equal to the ratio of the surface areas. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T1/T2) is also equal to the square root of the ratio of the surface areas, because \\( P \\propto T^4 \\), so \\( T \\propto P^{1/4} \\).\n\n\\[ \\frac{T1}{T2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A1}{A2}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{T1}{T2} = \\sqrt{1.30} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{T1}{T2} \\approx 1.14 \\]\n\nNone of the provided answer choices match this calculation exactly, but the closest option would be:\n\nD. ~ 1.30\n\nThis is a slight misinterpretation in the question's context as it should align more closely with the direct calculation based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which suggests a closer value to approximately 1.14 rather than directly matching any of the provided options precisely. The correct understanding from the calculation perspective would lean towards recognizing the principle but acknowledging the options' limitations in representing the precise outcome of the calculation."
