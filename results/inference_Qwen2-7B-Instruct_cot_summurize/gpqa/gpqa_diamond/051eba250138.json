                    "text": "To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), we first need to calculate the molarities of both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. \n\nThe molarity (M = moles/L = grams/molar mass.\n\nFor KH2PO4:\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\nSo, moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00741 mol\n\nVolume of solution = 200.00 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 L\nSo, m(KH2PO4) = 0.00741 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03705 M\n\nFor Na2HPO4:\nMolar mass of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O = 177.99 g/mol\nSo, moles of Na2HPO4 = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00563 mol\n\nVolume of solution = 200.00 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 L\nSo, m(Na2HPO4) = 0.00563 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02765 M\n\nNow, the reaction between KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 will form KNa2HPO4 and H3PO4. This reaction is:\nKH2PO4 + Na2HPO4 -> KNa2HPO4 + H3PO4\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the reaction ratio is 1:1. So, we can equate the number of moles of each reactant:\n\n0.00741 mol KH2PO4 = 0.00563 mol Na2HPO4\n\nThis means that some KH2PO4 will remain unreacted. Let's find out how much:\n\nmoles of KH2PO4 reacted = moles of Na2HPO4 = 0.00563 mol\nSo, moles of KH2PO4 remaining = 0.00741 mol - 0.00563 mol = 0.00178 mol\n\nThe concentration of H3PO4 formed is equal to the concentration of Na2HPO4 used up in the reaction, because the stoichiometry is 1:1:\n\n[H3PO4] = [Na2HPO4] = 0.00563 M\n\nNow, we have H3PO4 and H2PO4- ( and HPO4^2- ions. H3PO4 will dissociate in two steps according to its Ka values. \n\nThe first step is:\n\nH3PO4 \u21cc H+ + H2PO4-\nKa1 = 7.5*10^-3\n\nThe second step is:\n\nH2PO4- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2-\nKa2 = 6.2*10^-8\n\nThe third step is:\n\nHPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-\nKa3 = 1.8*10^-12\n\nWe are're interested in the last step, as it leads directly to PO4^3-. However, since Ka3 is very small, we can assume that almost all HPO4^2- will convert to PO4^3-, with negligible amounts of HPO4^2- remaining. \n\nTherefore, we can calculate the concentration of PO4^3- by using the concentration of HPO4^2- derived from the second step. The concentration of HPO4^2- at equilibrium is equal to the concentration of H3PO4 at the beginning, minus the amount that dissociated in the first step.\n\nLet x be the amount of H3PO4 that dissociates in the first step. Then,\n\n[H3PO4] = 0.00563 - x\n[H+] = x\n[H2PO4-] = x\n\nThe Ka11 value for the first step is given by:\n\nKa11 = [H+][H2PO4-]/[H3PO4]\n7.5*10^-3 = x*x/(0.00563 - x)\n\nSince x is very small compared to 0.00563, we can approximate:\n\n7.5*10^-3 = x*x/0.00563\nx = sqrt(7.5*10^-3 * 0.00563)\nx \u2248 0.00237 M\n\nTherefore, the concentration of HPO4"
