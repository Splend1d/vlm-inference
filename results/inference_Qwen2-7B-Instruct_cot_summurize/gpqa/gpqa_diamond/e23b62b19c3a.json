The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n\nA. CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\nB.

This indicates that the compound contains hydroxyl groups.\n- There is a strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers, which corresponds to carbonyl (C=O stretching vibration, indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\nThe absence of vinyl-hydrogens (H atoms attached to double-bonded carbons, as mentioned in the question, rules out the presence of any alkenes in the compound.\n\nThe specific splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR spectrum (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets, can be indicative of certain substitution patterns around the carbon atoms, but without detailed chemical shift values, it's challenging to precisely assign these patterns to specific compounds based solely on their structure.\n\nGiven the information provided, the compound must contain two methyl groups (-CH3), one ethyl group (-C2H5), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\nConsidering the options:\n\nA. CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH - This compound does not contain an ethyl group (-C2H5).\nB. CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH - This compound has an ethyl group attached to a chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group.\nC. CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH - This compound does not contain two methyl groups (-CH3) directly bonded to the central carbon atom.\nD. CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH - This compound lacks an ethyl group (-C2H5).\n\nTherefore, based on the criteria provided, the correct answer is **B. CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**. This compound contains two methyl groups (-CH3), one ethyl group (-C2H5), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which matches the information given from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra."
