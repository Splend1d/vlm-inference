For the (111) plane, the Miller indices are (111).\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the interplanar distance without specifying the angle \\(\\theta\\) or the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\). The calculation of the interplanar distance for a specific plane in a crystal involves the use of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices, but typically requires knowledge of the geometry of the unit cell and how it relates to the plane of interest.\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are related to the angles and edge lengths in a way that is different from cubic or hexagonal systems. The relationship between the lattice parameters (a, b, c (which are equal due to the rhombohedral symmetry) and the angles \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\) (all equal to 30 degrees in this case, can be described through the identity:\n\n\\[a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos(\\alpha)\\]\n\nGiven that \\(a = b = c\\) in a rhombohedral system, we simplify to:\n\n\\[a^2 = a^2 + a^2 - 2a^2 \\cos(30^\\circ\\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[a^2 = 2a^2(1-\\sqrt{3}/2)\\]\n\nFrom which we find:\n\n\\[1 = 2(1-\\sqrt{3}/2)\\]\n\nThe key to finding the interplanar spacing for a specific plane in a rhombohedral system involves using the reciprocal lattice vectors, which relate to the diffraction pattern produced by the crystal. The relationship between the lattice parameter \\(a\\) and the interplanar spacing \\(d\\) for a specific Miller index \\((hkl)\\) in a rhombohedral system is given by:\n\n\\[d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + kl + lh)\\cos(30^\\circ)}}\\]\n\nFor the (111) plane, \\(h=k=l=1\\), so substituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[d_{111} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)\\cos(30^\\circ)}\\]\n\n\\[d_{111} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3 - 6\\sqrt{3}/2}}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(a = 10\\) Angstrom, \n\n\\[d_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 6\\sqrt{3}/4}}\\]\n\n\\[d_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3(1 - \\sqrt{3}/2)}}\\]\n\n\\[d_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3/2}}\\]\n\n\\[d_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{1.5}}\\]\n\n\\[d_{111} \u2248 \\frac{10}{1.2247}\\]\n\n\\[d_{111} \u2248 8.168 Angstrom\\]\n\nNone of the options provided exactly match this calculation, suggesting there may have been an error in either the interpretation of the question or in the calculation process based on the options provided.
