He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n\n\nA. Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples\nB. Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles.\n\nThe slope of a standard qPCR calibration curve is related to the efficiency of the PCR reaction and the relationship between cycle threshold (CT) and the starting quantity of the template. A slope of -3.3 suggests that each cycle of the PCR reaction doubles the number of copies (since 2^(-3.3) \u2248 0.13, which means the reaction goes through approximately 3.3 cycles before reaching a single molecule.\n\nIf the ten-fold dilutions are spread over more than 3.3 cycles, this could explain discrepancies in the CT values observed across different concentrations. If the dilutions are too large, they might fall outside the linear range of the PCR reaction, leading to inaccurate CT values. This is because beyond the optimal number of cycles, the PCR efficiency drops, affecting the linearity of the relationship between the initial copy number and the CT value.\n\nThe other options:\n\nA. If the Ct values were not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid, it would suggest issues with the qPCR system or the samples themselves rather than just the dilutionations factor.\n\nC. While deviations between technical replicates can contribute to overall variability, if the slopes and R-squared values indicate a consistent relationship between Ct and starting quantity within the linear range of the PCR, then deviations between replicates alone do not directly explain discrepancies in the dilutionation effect.\n\nD. qPCR is generally considered a reliable method for quantifying nucleic acids, so this option is incorrect unless there are significant issues with the qPCR setup, reagents, or samples."
