( (mole fraction) of each species in the final solution.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of each compound:\n\n- Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol\n- Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol\n- Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid, it will fully dissociate into H+ ions. So, we add its moles to the moles of H+ from the dissociation of Ba(OH)2.\n\n- Moles of H+ from HCl = 0.08 mol\n- Moles of H+ from Ba(OH)2 = 2 * 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n- Total moles of H+ = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 mol\n\nThe total volume of the solution is the sum of the volumes:\n\n- Total volume = 0.5 L + 0.4 L + 0.3 L = 1.2 L\n\nNow we find the concentration of H+ ions:\n\n- [H+] = moles of H+ / total volume = 0.26 mol / 1.2 L = 0.183 M\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH using the formula:\n\n- pH = -log([H+])\n- pH = -log(0.183)\n- pH \u2248 0.72\n\nNone of the options provided match this result, indicating there might be an error in the question or the answer choices. Based on the calculations performed, the pH would be approximately 0.72, which is not listed among the options A through D."
