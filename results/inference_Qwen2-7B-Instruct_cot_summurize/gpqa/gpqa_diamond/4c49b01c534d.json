The total initial energy of the pion (Pi+) must equal the sum of the final energies of the muon (mu+) and the antineutrino (nu).\n\nThe total initial energy of the pion (Pi+) is its rest mass energy:\n\nInitial Energy (Pi+ = 139.6 MeV\n\nLet's denote:\n- KE_mu+ as the kinetic energy of the muon,\n- KE_nu as the kinetic energy of the antineutrino,\n- m as the rest mass energy of the antineutrino.\n\nWe have the following equations based on conservation of energy:\n\nInitial Energy = Final Energy of mu+ + Final Energy of nu\n139.6 MeV = KE_mu+ + KE_nu + mu+ rest mass + nu rest mass\n\nGiven that the rest mass energy of the muon (mu+ is 105.7 MeV, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n139.6 MeV = KE_mu+ + KE_nu + 105.7 MeV + o\n\nSince the pion is assumed to be stationary, the final energy of the pion is equal to its rest mass energy:\n\nFinal Energy of Pi+ = Initial Energy of Pi+ = 139.6 MeV\n\nSubstituting the known values, we get:\n\n139.6 MeV = KE_mu+ + KE_nu + 105.7 MeV + o\n\nNow, solving for KE_mu+ and KE_nu:\n\nKE_mu+ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - KE_nu\nKE_nu = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - KE_mu+\n\nFrom the given options, we need to find the pair that satisfies both equations. \n\nOption A: 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nKE_mu+ = 139.6 - 105.7 - 7.2 = 26.8 MeV\nKE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 - 32.8 = -9.3 MeV ( This is not possible since kinetic energy cannot be negative.\n\nOption B: 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nKE_mu+ = 139.6 - 105.7 - 3.52 = 26.8 MeV\nKE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 - 20.8 = -6.3 MeV  This is also not possible.\n\nOption C: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nKE_mu+ = 139.6 - 105.7 - 4.12 = 25.2 MeV\nKE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 - 29.8 = -5.9 MeV  This is also not possible.\n\nOption D: 2.84 MeV, 22.8 MeV\nKE_mu+ = 139.6 - 105.7 - 2.84 = 27.2 MeV\nKE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 - 22.8 = -4.3 MeV  This is also not possible.\n\nNone of the provided options satisfy the condition that the total initial energy equals the sum of the final energies of the muon and the antineutrino.
