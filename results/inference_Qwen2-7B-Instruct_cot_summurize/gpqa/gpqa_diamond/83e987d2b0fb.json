One asks the other \"So, how did it go?\" The second chemist replies, \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other.\"\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?\n\nA. The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.\nB. The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.\nC. The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.\nD. The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.\n"

The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.\n\nWhen the second chemist says that their compounds are \"on top of each other,\" they are likely referring to a situation where the compounds are interacting or aggregating in a way that causes them to be close together in space. This kind of behavior can occur due to various intermolecular forces, including van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding. In the context of synthetic organic chemistry, this could lead to issues such as solubility problems or difficulties in separating products during purification steps."
