Since each spin \\(S_1, S_2,\\) and \\(S_3\\) can take values \\(\\pm1\\), there are 8 possible configurations for this system (including the degeneracies due to spin orientations.\n\nThe energy \\(E\\) of the system is given by:\n\\[E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3]\\]\n\nThe partition function \\(Z\\) is defined as:\n\\[Z = \\sum_{all\\,states} e^{-\\beta E}\\]\n\nLet's consider the possible configurations:\n\n1. **All spins aligned (+1 or -1)**: This gives the lowest energy state with \\(E = -3J\\). There are 2 configurations where all spins are +1 or -1. So, the contribution is \\(2e^{-3J\\beta}\\).\n\n2. **Two spins aligned, one opposite**: This configuration gives an energy of \\(-J\\). There are 6 configurations where two spins are in the same direction and one in the opposite direction ( (for example, \\(S_1 = s_2 = +1, s_3 = -1 \\)). So, the contribution is \\(6e^{-J\\beta}\\).\n\n3. **All spins opposite**: This configuration gives the highest energy state with \\(E = 3J\\). There are also 2 configurations where all spins are -1 or +1. So, the contribution is \\(2e^{3J\\beta}\\).\n\nAdding these contributions together gives the total partition function \\(Z\\):\n\\[Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} + 2e^{-3J\\beta}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C**."
