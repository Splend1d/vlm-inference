The time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for this system in spherical coordinates can be written as:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2mr^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} (r^2 \\psi(r) \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} m\\omega^2 r^2 \\psi(r) = E\\psi(r) \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\psi(r)\\) is the wavefunction and \\(E\\) is the energy of the system.\n\nThe solution to this differential equation for a quantum harmonic oscillator is well-known and given by:\n\\[ \\psi_n(r) = N_n \\cdot r^n \\cdot e^{-\\frac{r^2}{2a_0}} \\]\nwhere \\(N_n\\) is the normalization constant, \\(a_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{m\\omega}\\) is the Bohr radius, and \\(n\\) is the quantum number which determines the energy level.\n\nThe energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by:\n\\[ E_n = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega \\]\n\nGiven that we're interested in the third excited state, we have \\(n = 3\\):\n\\[ E_3 = \\left(3 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega \\]\n\nNow, regarding the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue, for a quantum harmonic oscillator, each energy level has two linearly independent states (corresponding to the even and odd parity states. This is because the wavefunction \\(\\psi_n(r)\\) has \\(n+1\\) nodes, and for each node, there's a change in sign when integrating from one side of the node to the other. Therefore, there are \\(n+1\\) possible combinations of signs for the wavefunction, leading to \\(2^{n+1}\\) linearly independent states. However, since the ground state (\\(n=0\\)) has no nodes and thus only one state, the formula \\(2^{n+1}\\) applies for \\(n \\geq 1\\).\n\nFor \\(n = 3\\):\n\\[ 2^{3+1} = 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\nSo, there are 16 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state. However, none of the provided answer choices exactly matches this calculation. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or a misinterpretation of the provided answer choices. Based on the standard understanding of quantum harmonic oscillators, the correct answer would suggest a different approach or additional context not directly provided in the original question.\n\nGiven the calculations and typical behavior of quantum harmonic oscillators, the closest answer choice to our derived energy and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions would be:\n\nB. \\((9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\\)\n\nHowever, note that the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions calculated is 16, not 3, based on the formula \\(2^{n+1}\\). The discrepancy between the calculated number of eigenfunctions and the provided answer choices highlights the importance of ensuring all information in a question is clear and correctly interpreted."
