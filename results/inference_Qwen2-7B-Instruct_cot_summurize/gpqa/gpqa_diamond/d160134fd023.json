                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of each compound based on the given information:\n\nA1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine at 293 K. This indicates that A1 has a higher boiling point than its decomposition temperature, suggesting it's likely a gas or a liquid at room temperature. The presence of A2 and fluorine suggests that A1 contains both elements.\n\nA3 interacts with xenon. This interaction could indicate that A3 has a high reactivity towards noble gases like xenon.\n\nA3 is obtained from the fluorination of element Y. This means that A3 is a fluoride of Y.\n\nA4 reacts with Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to form A5. Since A4 reacts with Y, it must contain fluorine.\n\nA5 decomposes in water to form two substances. This suggests A5 is not stable in aqueous solutions.\n\nFrom the above points, we can infer some properties about A4:\n\n1. It reacts with Y in a 1:1 ratio, indicating that for every atom of Y, there is one atom of another element in A4.\n2. A5 is unstable in water, implying that A4 is likely stable in water since it decomposes to form A5.\n3. A4 is a fluoride compound, as it reacts with Y to produce A5, which is also a fluoride compound.\n\nConsidering these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. 160-180 - This range is too broad without more specific information about the elements involved.\nB. 110-130 - This range is also broad but could potentially include elements like sodium (Na (atomic weight 23), magnesium Mg (atomic weight 24), aluminum Al (atomic weight 27), silicon Si (atomic weight 28), phosphorus P (atomic weight 31), sulfur S (atomic weight 32), chlorine Cl (atomic weight 35), and bromine Br (atomic weight 80).\nC. 220-240 - This range is likely too high for a single element, considering most elements in this range are metals like titanium Ti (atomic weight 48), vanadium V (atomic weight 51), chromium Cr (atomic weight 52), manganese Mn atomic weight 55), iron Fe atomic weight 56), cobalt Co atomic weight 59), nickel Ni atomic weight 59), zinc Zn atomic weight 66), and cadmium Cd atomic weight 112). However, this range might include combinations of elements within it.\nD. 140-160 - This range is narrow enough to suggest a specific element or combination of elements. Elements within this range include calcium Ca (atomic weight 40), scandium Sc atomic weight 45), yttrium Y atomic weight 89), lanthanum La atomic weight 139), and cerium Ce atomic weight 140).\n\nGiven the context of the question, the most logical answer would be **D. 140-160**, as it is the only range that fits the criteria for the possible atomic weight(s) of an element that could react with fluorine in a 1:1 molar ratio to form a fluoride compound, considering the properties described for the compounds and their reactions."
