                    "text": "Given that the gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, this means it is a neutral molecule, i.e., it is an atom or a diatomic molecule. Since gases typically consist of single atoms or pairs of atoms, we can infer that W is likely to be a noble gas or hydrogen (since these are are the most common elements that form diatomic molecules under standard conditions.\n\nThe melting point of B under normal conditions is very close to 277 K, which corresponds to approximately -19.15\u00b0C or 253.15K at standard pressure. This temperature range suggests that B is likely to be a metal, given that metals generally have higher melting points than -19.15\u00b0C.\n\nConsidering the information about Substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce W, a gas, and a precipitate G, and knowing that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen, we can deduce some key aspects:\n\n- The reaction involving Substance X produces a gas (W, which could potentially be oxygen (O, given the hint about oxygen atoms in the final product.\n- Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, which implies that it might contain an isotope of sulfur (S (or another heavy element like phosphorus or selenium), since these elements have significant isotopic variation.\n- The reaction also produces a precipitate G, which, when heated, releases B. This suggests that G could be a compound containing a metal, such as magnesium (Mg, aluminum Al, iron Fe, or zinc Zn, among others, given the melting point clue.\n\nConsidering these deductions, let's analyze the options provided:\n\nA. 31: This sum corresponds to the atomic masses of phosphorus (P (and chlorine Cl) but does not align with the context of the problem.\n\nB. 35: This sum corresponds to the atomic masses of bromine Br and iodine I, neither of which fit the description provided.\n\nC. 29: This sum corresponds to the atomic masses of nitrogen N and fluorine F. Nitrogen is a possible candidate for Substance X due to its significant isotopic variation, and Fluorine could potentially be involved in the formation of the precipitate or gas in the reaction.\n\nD. 25: This sum corresponds to the atomic masses of boron B and nitrogen N. While boron could be involved in the reaction, it is not consistent with the description of having a heavier isotope in Substance X and the context provided.\n\nBased on the analysis above, option C (29 ( seems to be the most plausible choice, considering the context of the problem and the elements' properties described. Nitrogen, being it in its natural form or through its isotopes, could potentially react with liquid Y to produce oxygen (O, forming a gas, and could contribute to the formation of a precipitate upon reacting with a certain keto acid. However, without more specific details regarding the exact elements involved in Substance X, the answer remains somewhat speculative based on the provided information and context."
