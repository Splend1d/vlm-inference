The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.\n\nIn nuclear physics, when particles are emitted in a decay process, the conservation of energy and momentum dictates how these particles can be distributed. When two light particles (E and V) are emitted alongside the transformation of nucleons from flavor A to flavor B, the energy spectrum for these particles can become continuous because their masses are much smaller than the mass difference between the initial and final nucleons. This allows them to have a wide range of kinetic energies.\n\nHowever, when you replace the two light particles E and V with a single exotic, massless particle M, the situation changes. Since M has no mass, its rest mass energy is zero. Therefore, all the energy that would have been carried by the two light particles must now be carried by this single particle M. This means that the total energy available for the light particles E is reduced, effectively decreasing the endpoint value Q for the continuous spectrum of the E particles.\n\nMoreover, since M is massless, it carries away all the energy and momentum that was originally split between E and V. This results in the spectrum for the E particles remaining continuous but with a different distribution, as the energy is now concentrated differently due to the redistribution of the total energy among the E particles.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B: the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases."
