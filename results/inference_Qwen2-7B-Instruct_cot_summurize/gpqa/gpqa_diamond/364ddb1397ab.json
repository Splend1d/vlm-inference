The total momentum before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after the annihilation. \n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( p \\) as the proton,\n- \\( \\bar{p} \\) as the antiproton,\n- \\( 2A^+ \\) and \\( 2A^- \\) as the two positive and two negative particles respectively.\n\nGiven that \\( m_{A}c^{2} = 300 MeV \\), we first convert this energy into momentum using the relation \\( E = pc \\). However, for the purpose of this problem, it's more useful to think about the mass-energy equivalence in terms of rest mass equivalent momentum, which is given by \\( p = mc \\). We don't have the rest mass of the particles directly, but we can infer some information from the options given.\n\nFirst, let's express the momentum conservation equation:\n\n\\[ m_p + m_{\\bar{p}} = 4p_A \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( m_p \\) is the momentum of the proton (which we'll consider to be zero since we're dealing with velocities much less than the speed of light, so its momentum contribution is negligible.\n- \\( i \\) represents the \"index\" for the initial state (protons or antiprotons.\n- \\( o \\) represents the \"index\" for the final state (particles A.\n\nAssuming the proton has a much larger mass than the antiproton, we can approximate \\( m_{\\bar{p}} \\) as the total momentum transferred to the system of particles A. Since the proton is nearly at rest, the momentum of the antiproton is roughly the total momentum of the system after annihilation.\n\nNow, let's look at the possible velocities for A. We want to find the velocity that makes the total momentum of A equal to the momentum of the antiproton. Given that the antiproton is moving slowly, we can assume it had nearly all the momentum in the initial collision.\n\nGiven the options, we see that the velocity of A needs to be high enough to account for most of the energy (and thus momentum) from the antiproton. Option A (0.96c suggests a very close to light-speed velocity, which seems plausible considering the energy involved.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact values of the masses of the particles involved, we cannot perform an exact calculation to confirm this. But based on the options provided and the principles of momentum conservation, option A seems the most reasonable choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be:\n\nA. 0.96c"
