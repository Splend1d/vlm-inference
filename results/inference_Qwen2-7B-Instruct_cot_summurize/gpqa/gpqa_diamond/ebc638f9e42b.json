Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?\n\nA. 77 years\nB.

Time dilation occurs when an object moves close to the speed of light, and time appears to move slower for that object relative to stationary observers.\n\nThe formula to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (\\(t'\\)) compared to the time experienced on Earth (\\(t\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity of the spacecraft ( which is \\(0.99999987c\\),\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light,\n- \\(t\\) is the time measured on Earth for the journey.\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{22 \\text{ years}}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987^2}}}\\]\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{22 \\text{ years}}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9999997400369}}\\]\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{22 \\text{ years}}{\\sqrt{0.00000025996}}\\]\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{22 \\text{ years}}{0.0050992}\\]\n\n\\[ t' \u2248 4325.1 \\text{ years}\\]\n\nThis result indicates that from the astronaut's perspective, it would take approximately 4325.1 years to reach Earth, assuming no changes in the spacecraft's speed or course during the journey.\n\nGiven the options provided, none of them exactly match this calculated value. However, the closest option to our calculated answer is:\n\nB. The astronaut will die before reach to the Earth.\n\nThis choice implies that the actual time calculated exceeds the average lifespan of the alien civilization, suggesting that the astronaut would indeed not survive the journey based on their species' life expectancy."
