NaNH2, methyl chloride\n2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate\n3. O3/ (CH3)2S\n4. Ba(OH)2\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\nStep 1: Deuterated sodium amide (NaNH2 reacts with methyl chloride to form a Grignard reagent, which is an intermediate that will help in the subsequent reactions.\n\nStep 2: The Grignard reagent reacts with hydrogen under palladium catalysis and calcium carbonate to form an alcohol.\n\nStep 3: The alcohol is then ozonolysed using ozone in dimethyl sulfide (CH3)2S, forming a ketone.\n\nStep 4: The final step involves treatment with barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2, which will convert the ketone into the desired aldehyde. \n\nPlease note that these reactions should ideally be carried out in an inert atmosphere to prevent reactions with oxygen or moisture, which could interfere with the synthesis. Also, the handling of reactive chemicals like NaNH2, ozone, and other reagents requires appropriate safety measures and knowledge about their properties."
