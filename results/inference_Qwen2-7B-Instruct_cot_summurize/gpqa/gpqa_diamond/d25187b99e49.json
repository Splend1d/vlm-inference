When an electron and a positron (which are antimatter counterparts of electrons) collide, they annihilate each other and produce two photons. These photons emerge at equal energy but opposite momenta due to the conservation laws.\n\nSince the total energy and momentum must be conserved during the annihilation, if one photon moves in the upper-right direction, the other must move in the lower-left direction. This implies that these two directions are perpendicular to each other.\n\nThe angle between two lines that are perpendicular to each other is always 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the directions of the photons is:\n\nB. 96"
