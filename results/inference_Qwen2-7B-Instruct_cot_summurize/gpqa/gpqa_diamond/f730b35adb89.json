                    "text": "Optical activity is exhibited by molecules that are are not mirror images of each other and have an asymmetric carbon atom (or a chiral center. This asymmetry causes the molecule to rotate plane-polarized light when passing through it. \n\nAmong the given compounds, let's identify the chiral centers:\n\n1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene** - It has one chiral center at carbon-2. So, it can exhibit optical activity.\n\n2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** - It has two chiral centers (at carbons 3a and 7a. Therefore, it can exhibit optical activity.\n\n3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** - It has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. Hence, it can exhibit optical activity.\n\n4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** - It also has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. Thus, it can exhibit optical activity.\n\n5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** - It has one chiral center at the hydroxyl group. Therefore, it can exhibit optical activity.\n\n6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol** - It has three chiral centers at carbons 1, 3, and 5. Hence, it can exhibit optical activity.\n\n7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one** - This compound does not have any chiral centers as all its functional groups and atoms are are symmetrically.\n\nTherefore, out of the seven compounds, five of them have chiral centers and thus can exhibit optical activity.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 5"
