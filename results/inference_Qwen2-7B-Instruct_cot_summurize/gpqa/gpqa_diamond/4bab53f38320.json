                    "text": "The NMR spectra provide information about the chemical environment of the hydrogen atoms in the molecules. The singlet signals at around 6.7 ppm suggest that these hydrogens are not adjacent to any other equivalent hydrogens (this is characteristic of methyl groups in benzene derivatives. \n\nThe singlet signals at around 2.2 ppm are characteristic of ethyl groups in NMR spectroscopy due to their shielding effect which leads to low ppm values. \n\nIn a 1:1 ratio for the signals at 6.7 ppm, it indicates there are two different types of methyl groups. This can be achieved if we have two different tetramethylbenzene derivatives.\n\nFor the signals at around 2.2 ppm, a 2:1:1 ratio suggests that there are three types of ethyl groups. This could be achieved by having one type of ethyl group in a 2:1 ratio with two different types of ethyl groups in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nConsidering this, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring, so it cannot account for the 1:1 ratio of signals at 6.7 ppm.\nB. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene both have four methyl groups, but they differ in which positions on the benzene ring the methyl groups are attached. Neither can account for the specific 1:1 ratio of signals at 6.7 ppm.\nC. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene both have four methyl groups, but they differ in which positions on the benzene ring the methyl groups are attached. The 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene will have four methyl groups attached at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. Meanwhile, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene will have four methyl groups attached at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Both of these configurations can account for the 1:1 ratio of signals at 6.7 ppm, as well as the 2:1:1 ratio of signals at 2.2 ppm, since they both have a total of four methyl groups ( two of which are in a 2:1 ratio with two different types of methyl groups.\nD. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene both have four methyl groups, but neither can account for the specific 1:1 ratio of signals at 6.7 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene."
