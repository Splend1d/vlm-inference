                    "text": "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we first need to calculate the number of decays per unit time, which can be done using the decay rate formula:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{N}{\\tau_0} \\]\n\nwhere \\( N \\) is the number of decaying particles and \\( \\tau_0 \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle. Since we're not given the number of decaying particles directly, but rather the decay process and its lifetime, we can infer that for every \\( \\tau_0 \\), one decay occurs.\n\nNext, to find the number of decays per unit time (\\( \\lambda \\), we need to convert the lifetime into seconds:\n\n\\[ \\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nThe decay rate \\( \\lambda \\) will then be:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\tau_0} = \\frac{1}{8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}} \\]\n\nTo find the number of decays observed in a certain amount of time \\( t \\), we use the decay formula:\n\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t} \\]\n\nwhere \\( N(t) \\) is the number of decays after time \\( t \\), \\( N_0 \\) is the initial number of decaying particles, and \\( e \\) is Euler's number.\n\nWe want to find the minimum resolution so that at least 30% of the decays are are observed. This means:\n\n\\[ N(t) \\geq 0.3 N_0 \\]\n\nSubstituting the decay formula, we get:\n\n\\[ 0.3 N_0 \\geq N_0 e^{-\\lambda t} \\]\n\nSince \\( N_0 \\) appears on both sides, it cancels out, leaving:\n\n\\[ 0.3 \\geq e^{-\\lambda t} \\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.3) \\geq -\\lambda t \\]\n\nSolving for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t \\geq -\\frac{\\ln(0.3)}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nNow we can calculate \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}} \\approx 1.25 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{decays/s} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ t \\geq -\\frac{\\ln(0.3)}{1.25 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{decays/s}} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq \\frac{\\ln(1/0.3)}{1.25 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{s}} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq \\frac{\\ln(3.333)}{1.25 \\times 10^{15}} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq \\frac{1.20397}{1.25 \\times 10^{15}} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq 9.63176 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nThis is the time required for at least 30% of the decays to occur. To find the resolution needed, we need to understand how resolution affects the observation of decays. The resolution in physics often relates to the ability to distinguish between events that happen close together in time or space. In this case, since we're dealing with a decay process, the resolution might refer to the ability to distinguish two consecutive decays occurring within a short time interval.\n\nHowever, without additional context or clarification on what exactly \"resolution\" means in this scenario, it's challenging to provide an exact answer from the options given. Typically, the resolution would be related to the precision of measuring the time interval between decays, which could be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\Delta t = \\frac{t}{N_{decays}} \\]\n\nWhere \\( N_{decays} \\) is the number of decays considered. Since we're looking for the minimum resolution needed for observing at least 30% of the decays, let's consider the time interval for just one decay:\n\n\\[ \\Delta t = \\frac{9.63176 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{s}}{1} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta t \\approx 9.63 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nGiven the options, none of them match this calculation directly. However, the question seems to imply a conversion or understanding of the time units. The closest option to our calculated time is:\n\n"
