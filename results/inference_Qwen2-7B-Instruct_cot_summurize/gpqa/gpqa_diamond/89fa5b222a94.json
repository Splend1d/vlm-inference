You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine\u00ae, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.\n\nA.

The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain\n\nThe issue described seems to stem from the fact that the genetic construct includes an influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant sequence at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. This could potentially lead to problems if this sequence is not correctly linked or fused to the GADD45G protein sequence. \n\nProteins often have linker sequences between different domains or when proteins are are fused together. These linkers help stabilize the structure of the resulting protein, prevent unwanted interactions (like proteolysis, and ensure proper folding. Without an appropriate linker, the antigenic determinant might interact with cellular proteases, leading to premature degradation of the nascent chain before it is fully synthesized and folded into its functional form.\n\nThus, the lack of a proper linker sequence is likely causing the proteolysis observed during the overexpression attempts. Ensuring that there is a suitable linker sequence between the antigenic determinant and the GADD45G protein would likely resolve this issue."
