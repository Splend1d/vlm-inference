Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.\nB. SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.\nC. SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\nD. The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.\n"

The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the function attributed to the nsp10/nsp14 complex is not accurately described. In fact, the nsp10/nsp14 complex is known to be involved in the degradation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), not its protection. Specifically, nsp14 contains an exonuclease (ExoN) domain that functions in the process of RNA synthesis and may contribute to the degradation of the viral replication intermediate ssRNA, but not the protection of dsRNA from degradation. The nsp10 protein stabilizes the nsp14 ExoN domain, allowing it to efficiently degrade ssRNA. Therefore, the claim that this complex prevents the breakdown of dsRNA is not supported by the current understanding of the roles of these proteins in the viral life cycle."
