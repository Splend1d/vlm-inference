Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nA. ~ 1.96\nB. ~ 0.85\nC. ~ 1.40\nD. ~ 0.36\n"

                    "text": "To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we need to understand the relationship between the orbital speed (v, the wavelength shift (\u03bb), and the orbital period (T. The wavelength shift \u03bb is related to the Doppler effect and can be used to calculate the radial velocity (v of the star due to the planet's motion. \n\nFor a circular orbit, the orbital velocity \\(v\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ v = \\frac{2\\pi R}{T} \\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the orbital radius of the planet, and \\(T\\) is its orbital period.\n\nThe wavelength shift \\(\\lambda\\) is related to the orbital velocity \\(v\\) by the formula for the Doppler effect:\n\\[ \\lambda = \\lambda_0 \\sqrt{\\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)} \\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda_0\\) is the rest wavelength of the spectral line, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the wavelength shift for planet #1 is 5 miliangstrom and for planet #2 is 7 miliangstrom, we can assume that \\(\\lambda_0\\) is constant for both cases. Since the wavelength shift is directly proportional to the velocity ( (and hence inversely proportional to the period T) when the orbital radius R is held constant, we can compare the periods based on the inverse proportionality:\n\nIf the wavelength shift for planet #1 is 5 miliangstrom and for planet #2 is 7 miliangstrom, then the ratio of their orbital periods \\(T_2/T_1\\) is inversely proportional to the ratio of their wavelength shifts \\(\\lambda_1/\\lambda_2\\).\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_2} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{5}{7} \\]\n\nTo find how many times longer \\(T_2\\) is compared to \\(T_1\\), we take the reciprocal:\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{7}{5} \\]\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) or approximately \\(0.71\\) times the orbital period of planet #1. To find out how many times longer \\(T_2\\) is compared to \\(T_1\\), we take the reciprocal of this fraction:\n\n\\[ \\text{Times longer} = \\frac{1}{0.71} \\approx 1.40 \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. ~ 1.40."
