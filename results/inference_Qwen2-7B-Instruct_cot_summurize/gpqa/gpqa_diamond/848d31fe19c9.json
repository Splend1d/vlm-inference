                    "text": "The probability of decay for the atom does not change based on its past behavior; it remains constant due to the nature of radioactive decay being a random process. The fact that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes does not influence its chances of decaying in the following 150 minutes.\n\nGiven that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes, we can infer that the probability of not decaying within that time frame is 68%. However, to directly address your question, we need to calculate the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes without relying on this indirect method.\n\nSince the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, the probability of not decaying within those 100 minutes is 68%. For the next 150 minutes, we need to consider the total decay probability over 250 minutes ( which is 2 * 100 minutes = 200 minutes.\n\nHowever, we only care about the next 150 minutes. Since the decay rate is assumed to be consistent, the probability of not decaying within the first 100 minutes doesn't impact the calculation for the next 150 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the probability of it decaying within the next 150 minutes is simply the decay probability within 100 minutes, adjusted for the new time frame:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability of decay in 150 minutes} = \\frac{150}{250} \\times 32\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability of decay in 150 minutes} = 0.6 \\times 32\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability of decay in 150 minutes} = 32\\% \\times 0.6 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability of decay in 150 minutes} = 19.2\\% \\]\n\nThis result is not listed among your options, suggesting there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation or presentation of the question or answer choices. Based on standard radioactive decay principles and assuming the question's parameters correctly reflect typical decay behavior, the closest match to our calculation would be option B ( 48%, though it does not precisely align with our derived calculation. It seems there might be an error either in the provided options or in the interpretation of the question. \n\nIf we strictly adhere to the information given and the question's intent, the correct answer based on the decay probability within 100 minutes and applying it to a 150-minute time frame would not be listed among your provided choices. The precise answer calculated is 19.2%, which is not represented by any of A, B, C, or D."
