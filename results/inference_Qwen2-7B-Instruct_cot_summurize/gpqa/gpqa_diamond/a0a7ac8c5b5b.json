The formula for calculating the concentration of a complex formed from a single reactant is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Concentration of complex} = \\frac{\\text{Initial concentration of reactant} \\times \\text{Formation constant}}{1 + \\text{Initial concentration of reactant} \\times \\text{Formation constant}} \\]\n\nGiven that the total cobalt concentration is \\(10^{-2}\\) M and the concentration of \\(SCN^-\\) is \\(0.1\\) M, we can calculate the concentrations of each complex:\n\n1. For \\([Co(SCN)]^+\\):\n\\[ \\text{Concentration} = \\frac{0.1 \\times 9}{1 + 0.1 \\times 9} = \\frac{0.09}{1.09} \\approx 0.0826 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\n2. For \\([Co(SCN)_2]^2+\\):\n\\[ \\text{Concentration} = \\frac{0.1 \\times 40}{1 + 0.1 \\times 40} = \\frac{0.4}{1.4} \\approx 0.2857 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\n3.

For \\([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}\\):\n\\[ \\text{Concentration} = \\frac{0.1 \\times 13}{1 + 0.1 \\times 13} = \\frac{0.13}{1.13} \\approx 0.1151 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt complexes is the sum of these individual concentrations plus the uncomplexed cobalt:\n\\[ \\text{Total cobalt complexes} = 0.0822 + 0.2857 + 0.3884 + 0.1151 = 0.8714 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cobalt} = 10^{-2} \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nThe concentration of cobalt in the form of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}) is approximately \\(0.1151 \\, \\text{M}\\).\n\nTo find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, divide its concentration by the total concentration of cobalt complexes and multiply by 1:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{0.1151}{0.8714} \\right) \\times 1 \\approx 0.131 \\times 1 \\approx 13.1\\% \\]\n\nThis answer doesn't exactly match any of the options provided, so it's possible there might have been a slight miscalculation or misinterpretation of the question or the options. Given the closest option to our calculation is B. 1ercent of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately \\(1\\%\\), which is not listed as an exact choice but could be considered closest based"
