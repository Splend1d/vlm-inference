                    "text": "To determine the number of peaks observed in each type of chromatography, we need to consider what happens in each reaction and how these changes are reflected in the HPLC analysis.\n\n**Reaction I:**\n- **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one** is converted into its alcohol by treatment with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH. The product is **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**. This is a single transformation, so the starting material disappears and the product is formed.\n\n**Reaction II:**\n- **Pentane-2,4-dione** is reduced with sodium borohydride (NaBH4 to form **pentane-2,4-diol**. This is also a single transformation where the starting material is converted into one product.\n\n**TLC Monitoring:**\nTLC monitoring confirms that both reactions are complete, meaning all starting materials have been converted into their respective products without side reactions.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\n- **Chiral Stationary Phase**: In chiral HPLC, compounds can separate based on their stereochemistry. Since Reaction I produces a single enantiomer (**(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**, and Reaction II produces another single enantiomer **pentane-2,4-diol**, both will likely resolve into their individual enantiomers. Additionally, the starting materials might also separate into their enantiomers if they are not racemic. Thus, we could potentially see 4 peaks here: 2 for the starting materials and 2 for the products enantiomers.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n- **Normal-Phase Stationary Phase**: Separation is typically based on polarity, not chirality. Therefore, the products from both reactions, which are both polar due to the hydroxyl groups, would likely co-elute as one peak. The starting materials might also co-elute together. So, we could expect to see 2 peaks here: 1 for the starting materials and 1 for the products mixture.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC"
