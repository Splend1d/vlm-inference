                    "text": "The infrared (IR) spectroscopy data shows that Compound X contains a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1) indicating it's a ketone or an aldehyde. The other peaks suggest the presence of aromatic ring(s) (3400\u20132500 cm-1 represents the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups or aromatic ring stretches), alkene (1450 cm-1) or alkyne (1610 cm-1) groups, and an ester group (1450 cm-1). The 1HNMR data gives us information about the chemical shifts (ppm) and the multiplicity (the way the signals split due to neighboring protons) of different types of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\nFrom the 1HNMR spectrum:\n- A broad singlet (bs, 1H at 10.5 ppm) could indicate a proton from an alcohol or a phenol.\n- Two doublets (d, 2H at 8.0 ppm) could be protons attached to a benzene ring.\n- Two downfield doublets (d, 2H at 7.2 ppm) also could be part of a benzene ring.\n- A multiplet (m, 1H at 2.9 ppm) and a multiplet (m, 2H at 1.7 ppm) could indicate a secondary butyl group.\n- A triplet (d, 3H at 1.4 ppm) could be a methyl group.\n- And a triplet (t, 3H at 0.9 ppm) could be a tertiary methyl group.\n\nBased on this analysis, the structure of Compound X seems to be a compound with a benzene ring, a sec-butyl group, and a methyl group attached to the benzene ring. It also has a carbonyl group, suggesting it's a ketone.\n\nComparing these deductions to the given options, we can eliminate options A and C since they do not have a carbonyl group. Option B is a carboxylic acid, not a ketone, and option D also appears to be a carboxylic acid, not a ketone.\n\nGiven the available information, none of the provided options exactly match the deduced structure of Compound X. However, if we were to choose the closest match based on the given options, it would be option D, \"4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\", as it includes a benzene ring and a sec-butyl group. But note that this option does not accurately represent the IR data for the carbonyl group being present but not as a carboxylic acid. \n\nIn a perfect scenario, you'd need additional information to determine the exact structure of Compound X."
