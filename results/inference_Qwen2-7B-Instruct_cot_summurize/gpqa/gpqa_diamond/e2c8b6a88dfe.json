The key concept here is the Principle of Relativity, which states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.\n\nFrom the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it at a speed of 660,000 km/s. This means that in the time period given (50 seconds, the distance that the Galaxy would appear to move towards the ejecta from its own perspective can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\times 50 \\, \\text{s} = 3,000,000 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3,000,000 km."
