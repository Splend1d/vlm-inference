The state vector $|0\\rangle$ corresponds to the north pole and $|1\\rangle$ corresponds to the south pole.\n\nThe given density matrix is a convex combination of the states $|0\\rangle \\langle 0|$ and $|1\\rangle \\langle 1|$, each contributing equally with a weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$. This means that it represents a state that is equally likely to be either $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$, which geometrically corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. \n\nTherefore, the geometrical position of the state described by this density matrix in the qubit space is at:\n\nr = (0, 0, 1)\n\nThis matches choice A."
