A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nExplanation:\nTautomerism refers to compounds that can exist in two or more different forms, called tautomers, that are interconvertible under certain conditions. Benzoquinone can indeed exhibit tautomerism because it has a keto-enol tautomeric form.\n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule can rotate plane-polarized light, and this property depends on the presence of chiral centers. Chiral centers are typically found in molecules containing an asymmetric carbon atom bonded to four different groups. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate contains a chiral center ( (the carbon atom bonded to a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and two hydrogen atoms), thus it can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and dimethyl fumarate do not contain chiral centers and therefore cannot exhibit optical isomerism. Hence, the correct answer is A = benzoquinone (for tautomerism, and B = dimethyl fumarate for not exhibiting optical isomerism. However, since the question asks for the compound that does not show tautomerism and the one showing optical isomerism, the correct pair should be A = benzoquinone ( for tautomerism, and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate for optical isomerism. \n\nThe provided answer choices seem to mix up the properties being asked for, leading to confusion. The correct interpretation based on the given options would be:\n\nA. A = benzoquinone ( for tautomerism,\nB. B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate for optical isomerism.\n\nHowever, given the options, none directly matches the correct interpretation. If we were to select based on the closest fit, option C might be misinterpreted as suggesting cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows no tautomerism, while dimethyl fumarate exhibits optical isomerism, which is not accurate based on the information provided."
