                    "text": "In astronomy, the relationship between the number of stars observed and the parallax distance is described by the inverse square law, which is analogous to how the intensity of light decreases with distance. However, when considering the distribution of stars in terms of parallax, the situation is slightly different because we're looking at the volume of space being probed as a function of parallax.\n\nParallax is defined as the apparent shift in position of an object when viewed from two different points in time or from two different positions. The formula for parallax is:\n\n\\[ \\text{parallax} = \\frac{1}{\\text{distance}} \\]\n\nGiven that stars are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the sky, the number density \\( n \\) of stars within a certain volume can be described as:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{\\text{number of stars}}{\\text{volume}} \\]\n\nThe volume \\( V \\) in terms of parallax can be approximated as:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi D^2 \\cdot \\Delta \\text{parallax} \\]\n\nwhere \\( D \\) is the distance to the star, and \\( \\Delta \\text{parallax} \\) is the range of parallax we're considering. Substituting the relation between parallax and distance into the volume equation gives:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{parallax}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\Delta \\text{parallax} \\]\n\nTo find the number density \\( n \\), divide the number of stars by the volume:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{\\text{number of stars}}{V} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{\\text{number of stars}}{\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{parallax}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\Delta \\text{parallax}} \\]\n\nAs we see, the number of stars per unit range of parallax increases as \\( \\text{parallax}^{-2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. ~ 1/plx^2"
