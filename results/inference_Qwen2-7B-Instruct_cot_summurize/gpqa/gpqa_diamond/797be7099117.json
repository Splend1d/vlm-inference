                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the process that occurs during the titration of an acid with a base. In this case, acetic acid (CH3COOH) is being being titrated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n\nFirstly, let's understand the reaction:\n\\[ CH_3COOH + OH^- \\rightarrow CH_3COO^- + H_2O \\]\n\nThe initial concentration of acetic acid can be calculated as:\n\\[ [CH_3COOH]_{initial} = \\frac{0.05 \\, M \\times 20.00 \\, cm^3}{(20.00 + 20.00) \\, cm^3} \\]\n\\[ [CH_3COOH]_{initial} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.05 \\, M = 0.0125 \\, M \\]\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the base, so we have:\n\\[ [CH_3COOH]_{remaining} = 0.0125 \\, M - 0.0125 \\times 0.25 = 0.0125 \\, M - 0.003125 = 0.009375 \\, M \\]\n\\[ [CH_3COO^-]_{formeded} = 0.0125 \\, M \\times 0.25 = 0.003125 \\, M \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the pH at 25% titration using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\\[ pH = pK_a + \\log{\\left(\\frac{[CH_3COO^-]}{[CH_3COOH]}\\right)} \\]\n\\[ pH = -\\log{(1.85 \\times 10^{-5})} + \\log{\\left(\\frac{0.003125}{0.009375}\\right)} \\]\n\\[ pH \u2248 4.73 \\]\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.73.\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ion (CH3COO^-), so:\n\\[ [CH_3COOH] = 0 \\, M \\]\n\\[ [CH_3COO^-] = 0.05 \\, M \\]\n\nUsing the pKa to find the pH at the equivalence point:\n\\[ pH = pK_a + \\log{\\left(\\frac{[CH_3COO^-]}{[CH_3COOH]}\\right)} \\]\n\\[ pH = -\\log{(1.85 \\times 10^{-5})} + \\log{\\left(\\frac{0.05}{0}\\right)} \\]\nSince the denominator is zero, the log term becomes undefined, which means the pH at the equivalence point is simply the pKa of the acid.\n\\[ pH = -\\log{(1.85 \\times 10^{-5})} \\]\n\\[ pH \u2248 4.73 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 4.73; 7.00. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the explanation for the pH at the equivalence point. The pH should actually be equal to the pKa at the equivalence point because all the acid has been neutralized. Thus, the correct pH should be around 4.73, not 7.00. The explanation provided was incorrectly suggested the equivalence point pH would be 7.00 based on the pKa alone without considering the actual chemistry at the equivalence point. \n\nGiven the options, the closest correct answer would still be D, assuming the explanation for the equivalence point pH was intended to be corrected to reflect the understanding that the pH at the equivalence point is essentially the pKa for weak acids like acetic acid, which would indeed be around 4.73, making option D the most accurate choice based on the provided data and understanding. However, it's important to clarify that the pH at the equivalence point for a weak acid/strong base titration is theoretically the pKa of the acid, not 7.00."
