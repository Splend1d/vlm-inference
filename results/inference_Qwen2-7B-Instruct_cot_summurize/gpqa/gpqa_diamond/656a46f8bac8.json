However, since we're integrating over the volume of a sphere, we're not concerned with the divergence at the origin (which would be undefined due to the singularity), but rather with the behavior of the divergence within the volume.\n\nGiven that \\( \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = 0 \\) everywhere in the volume, the integral of the divergence over any volume is also zero. This is because the divergence theorem ( or Gauss's law) states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary of the volume, which in this case would be the surface area of the sphere times the flux through it. Since the divergence is zero everywhere in the volume, there is no net flux out of the surface, leading to an integral value of zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0"
