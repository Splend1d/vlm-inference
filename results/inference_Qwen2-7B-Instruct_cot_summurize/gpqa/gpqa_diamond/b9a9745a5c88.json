                    "text": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\n\nA. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB. G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC.

                    "text": "Based on the given information, we can infer the following:\n\n- The knockout of G2 leads to a complete loss of resistance, suggesting that G2 plays a crucial role in resistance to anthracnose.\n- The knockout of G3 shows reduced but not completely lost resistance, indicating that G3 also contributes to resistance but its effect is less severe compared to G2.\n- The double knockout of G1 and G3 ( (g1g3) results in resistance similar to the single knockout of G2 ( (g2), which suggests that the combined effect of G1 and G3 is equivalent to the effect of G2 alone. This indicates that G1 and G3 might work together to provide resistance or have overlapping functions.\n\nGiven these observations, the most accurate conclusion would be:\n\nA. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nThis option aligns with the data presented. It suggests that G2 acts as a transcription factor influencing the expression of other genes involved in resistance. The redundancy between G1 and G3 implies that they can compensate for each other's functions to some extent. Additionally, since the double knockout of G1 and G3 provides resistance similar to the single knockout of G2, it indicates that G1 is epistatic towards G3, meaning that the effect of G1 overrides the effect of G3 when both are present."
