                    "text": "The correct answer is C. 14.\n\nTo determine the number of carbon atoms in Product 3, we need to follow the transformation step by step:\n\nTrans-cinnamaldehyde has the molecular formula \\(C_9H_8O\\), which means it contains 9 carbon atoms.\n\n1) When trans-cinnamaldehyde reacts with methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr), it undergoes a nucleophilic substitution reaction forming an alcohol. The general structure of this alcohol would be \\(CH_3CH=CHCH(OH)CH_3\\), which contains 10 carbon atoms.\n\n2) Treating the alcohol formed with Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) typically leads to oxidation and removal of hydroxyl group (-OH) resulting in aldehyde formation. So, the structure changes from \\(CH_3CH=CHCH(OH)CH_3\\) to \\(CH_3CH=CHCH=CHCH_3\\). This step doesn't change the number of carbon atoms, so we still have 10 carbon atoms.\n\n3) Finally, treating with dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature forms a compound containing an oxo group (-O-). The structure of this compound can be represented as \\(CH_3CH=CHCH=CHCH_3-O-CH_3\\). This structure contains 14 carbon atoms.\n\nSo, after all transformations, Product 3 contains 14 carbon atoms."
