                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of superposition for electric fields. Since the sphere is a conductor, it will acquire a uniform charge distribution on its surface when it's in electrostatic equilibrium. This means that the electric field outside the sphere is due to the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface that passes through the point P.\n\nThe point P is outside the sphere, so the electric field at P is not affected by the cavity or its contents directly. Instead, the electric field at P is due to the entire sphere as if the charge inside the cavity was distributed uniformly over the surface of the sphere. \n\nGiven that the sphere has a radius R and the charge q is inside the cavity with radius r, the effective charge seen by point P is the total charge of the sphere, which is the surface area of the sphere times the surface charge density. However, since the charge is not uniformly distributed over the entire sphere but concentrated in a smaller volume, we need to adjust our approach.\n\nThe electric field at a distance L from the center of a uniformly charged sphere is given by:\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{L^2} \\]\nwhere Q is the total charge on the sphere.\n\nHowever, since there's a cavity inside, the effective charge Q on the sphere is reduced by the amount of charge q that was added inside the cavity. But remember, the cavity does not remove any charge from the outer shell; it merely occupies space where no charge would otherwise be present. So, the effective charge Q is still the original charge of the sphere minus the charge q that was moved into the cavity. \n\nIf we assume the original sphere had some charge Q_0 ( (which is not specified), then the effective charge Q on the sphere is Q_0 - q. However, this assumption isn't necessary because the question asks for the electric field due to the charge q alone, considering the sphere behaves as a conductor and distributes its charge on its surface to maintain electrostatic equilibrium.\n\nThe key insight is recognizing that the electric field due to the charge inside the cavity is equivalent to the electric field produced by a point charge equal to the charge q at the location of the cavity. This is because the cavity allows the charge to redistribute itself on the surface of the sphere without changing the net electric field outside the sphere.\n\nThus, the electric field at point P due to the charge q is simply:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{L^2} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **A**. $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$."
