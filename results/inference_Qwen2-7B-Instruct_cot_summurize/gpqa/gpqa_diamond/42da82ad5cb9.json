This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>\n\nA.

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Mutant 3.\n\nIn order to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to prevent the synthesis of that compound. This can be achieved by mutating the start codon or by introducing a premature stop codon, which would lead to a truncated protein that doesn't function properly or not at all.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n- **Mutant 1**: The mutation here changes the third nucleotide of the start codon (ATG to ATC. While this is still a valid start codon, it might lead to a different translation start point and potentially a different protein sequence. It does not necessarily result in the elimination of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n- **Mutant 2**: The mutation changes the sixth nucleotide of the start codon from TTT to TAG, which is a premature stop codon. This could potentially lead to a truncated protein if the mutation occurs before the essential part of the coding sequence. However, it depends on the exact position of the mutation relative to the start of the functional protein region.\n\n- **Mutant 3**: The mutation here changes the third nucleotide of the start codon from TTT to TTA. This is another valid start codon, but it could also potentially lead to a different protein sequence than the original intact gene. \n\n- **Mutant 4**: The mutation changes the second nucleotide of the start codon from TTT to TAC, which is still a valid start codon. However, it introduces a different amino acid at the very beginning of the protein sequence compared to the original intact gene.\n\nAmong these options, only Mutant 3 introduces a change in the start codon without altering its functionality as a start codon. The other mutations either alter the start codon to a different one or introduce a premature stop codon, which could potentially lead to a non-functional protein. Therefore, Mutant 3 seems like the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound because it maintains the ability to start translation correctly while changing the resulting protein sequence."
