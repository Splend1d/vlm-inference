The answer should focus on the critical steps that yield the desired product. Thus, option D's first three steps are the most relevant to the question, but the full synthesis would stop at step iii) since steps iv), v), vi), and vii) are not required for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene."
