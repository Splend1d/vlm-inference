Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?\n\nA. loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype\nB. protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype\nC. protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\nD. change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would be B. protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nMutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. This means that even though only one copy (the mutant allele) is present, it has a negative impact on the function of the protein, and this effect dominates over the function of the normal (wild-type allele which also exists in the cell. \n\nSince mutation Y affects the dimerization domain, it likely prevents the protein from forming functional dimers. Dimers are are essential for the transcription factor to shuttle into the nucleus and serve in gene transcription. Therefore, with the mutation, the protein can't properly perform its function leading to a loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nMoreover, proteins that can't form dimers might aggregate together, forming protein aggregates. These aggregates can be detrimental to the cell and can contribute to various diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases, by disrupting cellular functions. Thus, option B best describes the molecular phenotype that would likely be observed in the presence of mutation Y."
