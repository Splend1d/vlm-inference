The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA. C6H10O2\nB. C6H12O2\nC. C6H12O\nD. C6H10O\n"

Here's how we can deduce this:\n\n- The FTIR spectrum shows:\n    - A broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers, which is characteristic of hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n    - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers, which are indicative of carbonyl (C=O groups. This suggests the presence of an aldehyde or ketone group.\n    - The peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens indicate that there are double bonds present in the structure.\n    - The mass spectrum showing a fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponds to an ethyl group (C2H5.\n\nGiven these pieces of evidence, the compound likely has a structure that includes both an alcohol and an ester group, along with an ethyl group. This fits best with the chemical formula C6H10O2 ( (option A), as it accounts for all the observed features. \n\nIn this structure, one of the oxygen atoms is part of the alcohol group (-OH), and the other oxygen atom is part of the ester group ((-COO-). The ethyl group (C2H5-O- represents the fragment that would give the mass spectrum peak at 45. The remaining carbon atoms form the rest of the backbone of the molecule."
