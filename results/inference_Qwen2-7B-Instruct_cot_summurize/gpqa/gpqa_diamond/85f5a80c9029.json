The formula for density (\u03c1 is:\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{m}{V} \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass and \\( V \\) is the volume. For a sphere, the volume \\( V \\) can be calculated using the formula \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\nGiven that all planets have the same composition as Earth, their densities will be similar to Earth's density, which is about 5.5 g/cm\u00b3. However, the question seems to suggest that the density of option b ( \"A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm\u00b3\" might not make sense since the density would remain the same regardless of the mass, given they have the same composition.\n\nLet's calculate the densities for each option:\n\n**a)** An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:\n- Mass: 1 Earth mass ( (approx. 5.97 x 10^24 kg)\n- Radius: 1 Earth radius ( (approx. 6,371 km or 6.371 x 10^6 m)\n- Volume: \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi ( (6.371 \\times 10^6)^3 \\approx 1.083 \\times 10^{12} \\) cm\u00b3\n- Density: \\( \\frac{5.97 \\times 10^{24}}{1.083 \\times 10^{12}} \\approx 5.5 g/cm^3 \\)\n\n**b)** A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm\u00b3:\n- Mass: 2 Earth masses ( (approx. 1.194 x 10^25 kg)\n- Density remains the same: 5.5 g/cm\u00b3\n\n**c)** A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:\n- Mass: 5 Earth masses ( (approx. 2.985 x 10^25 kg)\n- Radius increases proportionallyally to the cube root of the mass increase to maintain the same density ( (approx. \\( (5^{1/3}) \\times 6,371 \\) km or \\( 1.78 \\times 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\) cm\n- Volume: \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi ( (1.78 \\times 6.371 \\times 10^6)^3 \\approx 5.416 \\times 10^{12} \\) cm\u00b3\n- Density: \\( \\frac{2.985 \\times 10^{25}}{5.416 \\times 10^{12}} \\approx 5.5 g/cm^3 \\)\n\n**d)** A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:\n- Mass: 0.5 Earth masses ( (approx. 2.985 x 10^24 kg)\n- Radius decreases proportionallyally to the cube root of the mass decrease to maintain the same density ( (approx. \\( (0.5)^{1/3} \\times 6,371 \\) km or \\( 0.79 \\times 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\) cm\n- Volume: \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi( (0.79 \\times 6.371 \\times 10^6)^3 \\approx 2.165 \\times 10^{12} \\) cm\u00b3\n- Density: \\( \\frac{2.985 \\times 10^{24}}{2.165 \\times 10^{12}} \\approx 5.5 g/cm^3 \\)\n\nBased on these calculations, the density of each planet is approximately 5.5 g/cm\u00b3, suggesting that all options could potentially have the highest density under the conditions provided. However, if we strictly follow the question's format and intent, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the question's setup regarding the density calculation and the direct comparison among the options based on the information provided.\n\nIn reality, without considering the specific volume changes for each scenario, all options would theoretically result in the same density due to the same composition and thus, the density calculation formula being consistent across them. \n\nGiven this clarification, none of the options can be definitively chosen as having the highest density based solely on the information provided, as the densities would be identical assuming the composition is the same for all.\n\nHowever, if we were to"
