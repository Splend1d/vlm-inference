While Magnons, Phonons, and Pions are all related to specific symmetries in physics ( Magnons relate to spin dynamics, Phonons to lattice vibrations, and Pions to chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics - Skyrmions are topological solitons which can emerge in certain field theories but do not inherently represent a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same sense as these other particles. They can be related to symmetries through their stability or existence conditions, but they are not directly tied to a single symmetry breaking mechanism like the others."
