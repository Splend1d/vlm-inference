This is common for propenyl or butenyl groups.\n- A signal at 5.5 ppm with a multiplicity of 1H, dq (doublet of quartet) suggests a methine proton coupled to the vinyl proton, which is characteristic of acetate esters where the hydroxyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n- A signal at 2.1 ppm with a multiplicity of 3H, s (singlet) indicates a methyl group attached to a saturated carbon.\n- A signal at 1.1 ppm with a multiplicity of 3H, d (doublet) suggests another methyl group that is also part of the acetate group.\n\nGiven these signals, it appears that the molecule has a double bond and two methyl groups attached, consistent with an acetate ester. The presence of a vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm) and the specific coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) indicate the presence of a propenyl group. The doublet of quartet (dq) indicates the protons on the methine of the double bond, which is characteristic of a trans configuration in this case because the coupling constant between the vinyl proton and the adjacent methine proton suggests that they are not adjacent in space (as would be the case in a cis configuration).\n\nTherefore, the structure matches that of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nAnswer: A. Trans-propenyl acetate"
