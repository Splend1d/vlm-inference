This energy is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the star ( following Kepler's third law. In other words, if two planets receive the same amount of solar radiation, the one farther from the star will receive less energy per unit area, resulting in lower temperature.\n\nGiven the information about the orbital periods and assuming the same albedo for all planets, we can calculate the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures using the inverse square law. \n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(T_{1}\\) as the temperature of Planet_1,\n- \\(T_{2}\\) as the temperature of Planet_2,\n- \\(T_{4}\\) as the temperature of Planet_4.\n\nWe are given the orbital periods as follows:\n- \\(P_{1} = T_{1}\\),\n- \\(P_{2} = 2T_{1}\\),\n- \\(P_{4} = 2.5T_{1}\\).\n\nSince the planets are in orbital resonance and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures can be calculated based on the inverse square of their distances from the star. \n\nFor any two planets, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is equal to the square of the inverse ratio of their orbital periods ( due to the inverse square law of energy distribution:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{planet\\_1}}{T_{planet\\_2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_{planet\\_2}}{P_{planet\\_1}}\\right)^{-2}\n\\]\n\nFor example, comparing Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{4}}{T_{2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_{4}}{P_{2}}\\right)^{-2} = \\left(\\frac{2.5T_{1}}{2T_{1}}\\right)^{-2} = \\left(\\frac{2.5}{2}\\right)^{-2} = \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^{-2} = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{16}{25}\n\\]\n\nConverting this into decimal form gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{25} = 0.664\n\\]\n\nNone of the provided answer choices exactly match this result, but the closest option is:\n\nA. ~0.69\n\nThis is likely the best choice among the options given, though it should be noted there might be some rounding or approximation involved in presenting the exact answer in the choices provided."
