Since energy and mass are interchangeable via Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2, we can convert this rest energy into rest mass:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rest Mass} = \\frac{\\text{Rest Energy}}{c^2} = \\frac{300 \\, \\text{GeV}}{c^2} \\]\n\nGiven \\( c^2 \\approx 9 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rest Mass} = \\frac{300}{9 \\times 10^{16}} \\, \\text{kg} \\approx 3.33 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nLet the masses of the two fragments be \\( m_1 \\) and \\( 2m_1 \\), with \\( m_1 + 2m_1 = 0.99M \\). Thus,\n\n\\[ m_1 + 2m_1 = 0.99(3.33 \\times 10^{-14}) \\]\n\\[ 3m_1 = 0.99(3.33 \\times 10^{-14}) \\]\n\\[ m_1 = 0.33 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the system is the difference between the initial rest mass and the final rest masses:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = Mc^2 - (3m_1c^2 - 2m_1c^2 = Mc^2 - 3m_1c^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = (3.33 \\times 10^{-14} - 3(0.33 \\times 10^{-14})c^2 = 3.33 \\times 10^{-14} - 0.99 \\times 3.33 \\times 10^{-14} \\]\n\\[ \\Delta E = 3.33 \\times 10^{-14} - 3.3 \\times 10^{-14} = 0.03 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nConverting to GeV:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{0.03 \\times 10^{-14}}{9 \\times 10^{16}} \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 3.33 \\times 10^{-35} \\, \\text{GeV} \\]\n\nSince 1 GeV \u2248 10^9 eV \u2248 10^6 MeV, we convert the answer:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E \\approx 3.33 \\times 10^{-35} \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{MeV} \\approx 3.33 \\times 10^{-29} \\, \\text{MeV} \\]\n\nThis is not directly comparable to the options provided, so let's approach the question differently by considering the classical non-relativistic approximation.\n\nIn the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is simply \\( K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass and \\( v \\) is the velocity. However, the problem doesn't provide velocities directly, but rather the masses and the fact that one mass is twice another. \n\nGiven the mass distribution, if we assume the more massive fragment (with mass \\( 2m_1 \\) has all the kinetic energy in this simplified model, its kinetic energy would be:\n\n\\[ T_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2m_1 \\cdot v^2 = m_1 \\cdot v^2 \\]\n\nHowever, without specific velocity information, we cannot directly calculate \\( v^2 \\). Instead, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation \\( E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4 \\), where \\( E \\) is energy, \\( p \\) is momentum, and \\( m \\) is mass. In the case of kinetic energy, \\( E = K + m_1c^2 \\).\n\nFor the more massive fragment:\n\n\\[ K = \\Delta E = Mc^2 - 3m_1c^2 \\]\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies comes from the relativistic correction factor, which accounts for the increase in kinetic energy due to relativistic effects.
