The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\n\nA. ~2.35\nB. ~2.23\nC. ~2.32\nD. ~2.25\n"

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the luminosity \\(L\\) of a star to its temperature \\(T\\), radius \\(R\\), and surface area. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is given by:\n\n\\[ L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(L\\) is the luminosity,\n- \\(R\\) is the radius of the star,\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (\\(5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{W m}^{-2} \\text{K}^{-4}\\)),\n- \\(T\\) is the temperature of the star.\n\nGiven that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, it implies that both stars have the same temperature, because their spectral radiance is proportional to \\(T^4\\). This means the ratio of their luminosities will depend on the ratio of their radii and masses, since the mass affects the gravitational compression and thus the temperature of a star if we assume it's a non-rotating star with a fixed composition.\n\nThe mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, and its radius is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Therefore, the volume of Star_1 is \\((1.5)^3 = 3.375\\) times that of Star_2 ( because volume scales with the cube of linear dimensions.\n\nHowever, when calculating the luminosity, we need to consider the surface area (which scales with the square of linear dimensions) and the mass (which affects the temperature (and thus the \\(T^4\\) part of the equation). Since the temperature is the same for both stars ( and does not change based on the mass, the luminosity will be proportional to the mass (because mass affects the gravitational compression and thus the temperature, but in this case, it's balanced out by the fact that the stars are assumed to be at the same temperature).\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is:\n\n\\[ L_{\\text{Star}_1} = 4 \\pi ( (1.5R_{\\text{Star}_2})^2 \\sigma T^4 \\]\n\n\\[ L_{\\text{Star}_1} = 4 \\pi \\cdot 2.25 \\cdot R_{\\text{Star}_2}^2 \\sigma T^4 \\]\n\nThis shows that the luminosity of Star_1 is \\(2.25\\) times the luminosity of Star_2, given that their temperatures are the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. ~2.25."
