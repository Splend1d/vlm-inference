                    "text": "The total angular momentum quantum number $l$ for the combined system of two electrons in a $p$-orbital state is 2. This implies that the total angular momentum can have values from 0 to 2, with a corresponding spin-orbit coupling. However, since we're ignoring spin states here, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number $l$ are just 0, 1, or 2.\n\nGiven that the system is in the state $|l_1,l_2,l,m\\rangle=|1,1,2,-1>$, this corresponds to a specific value of $l=2$ and $m=-1$. This means that the system has a total angular momentum quantum number $l=2$, and its projection along the z-axis, $m$, is -1.\n\nWhen considering the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, each electron can have an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$. For each electron, the possible values for $L_{z}$ ( given $l=1$ are $-\\hbar$, $0$, and $\\hbar$.\n\nGiven that the total angular momentum quantum number $l=2$, it's possible for both electrons to have their $L_z$ equal to $-\\hbar$ if they are aligned in the same direction. This is because:\n\n- Electron 1 could be in a state where $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$.\n- Electron 2 could also be in a state where $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$.\n\nHowever, for both electrons to simultaneously have $L_{1z} = L_{2z} = -\\hbar$, they would need to be in a specific orientation relative to each other. In the given state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the electrons are already aligned in the same direction along the z-axis, so this scenario is possible.\n\nTo calculate the probability, consider all possible states that could result in the same total angular momentum quantum number $l=2$ and $m=-1$. These include states where the two electrons have opposite orientations along the z-axis, and states where they have the same orientation along the z-axis.\n\nThere are 5 possible states for the two electrons with total angular momentum $l=2$: \n1. Both electrons with $L_{z} = \\hbar$: This state does not satisfy the condition $L_{1z} = L_{2z} = -\\hbar$.\n2. Electron 1 with $L_{z} = \\hbar$ and Electron 2 with $L_{z} = -\\hbar$: This state satisfies the condition $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ but not $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$.\n3. Electron 1 with $L_{z} = -\\hbar$ and Electron 2 with $L_{z} = \\hbar$: This state satisfies the condition $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ but not $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$.\n4. Both electrons with $L_{z} = 0$: This state does not satisfy the condition $L_{1z} = L_{2z} = -\\hbar$.\n5. Both electrons with $L_{z} = -\\hbar$: This state satisfies the condition $L_{1z} = L_{2z} = -\\hbar$.\n\nOut of these 5 states, only one of them meets the requirement of both electrons having $L_{z} = -\\hbar$. Therefore, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nThe closest option to $\\frac{1}{5}$ is **D. 1/2**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 1/2**."
