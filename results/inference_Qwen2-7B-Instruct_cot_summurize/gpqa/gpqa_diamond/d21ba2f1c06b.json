When it's applied to racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, the reaction can proceed in two distinct ways: \n\n1. The hydrogen atom can be transferred from the methyl group of the alkene to the double bond. This results in the formation of a secondary alcohol.\n2. Alternatively, if the hydrogen atom is instead transferred to one of the carbon atoms in the side chain, it leads to the formation of a ketone.\n\nHowever, given the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene, transferring hydrogen to a carbon atom in the side chain doesn't yield a product that is significantly different from the original molecule due to its symmetry. Therefore, effectively, we're left with one significant transformation: the formation of a secondary alcohol.\n\nConsidering this, there are two possible stereoisomers for the secondary alcohol product ( depending on whether the hydrogen transfer occurs at the Z- or E-configuration of the double bond. \n\nTherefore, excluding ethene, the answer is:\n\nC. 2"
