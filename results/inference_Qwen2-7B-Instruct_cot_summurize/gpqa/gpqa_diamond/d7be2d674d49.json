                    "text": "The given information suggests that the molecule has a benzene ring with a chlorine atom attached and possibly another functional group. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom on the 4th position of the benzene ring. The presence of a carboxylic acid group is indicated by the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1 in IR spectroscopy. However, this option doesn't have the specific proton signals in the 1H NMR spectrum that match the given data.\n\nB. 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Similar to A, this compound also contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom on the 2nd position of the benzene ring. Again, the carboxylic acid group is confirmed by the IR peak at 1720 cm-1. However, this option also lacks the matching proton signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nC. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This compound contains a ketone group ( (-CHO) instead of a carboxylic acid group, as suggested by the broad peak in the IR spectrum from 3500-2700 cm^-1 which is characteristic of aldehydes. The 1H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm (s indicates the presence of a carbonyl oxygen as a hydrogen atom. The 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm signals correspond to the aromatic protons, indicating that there are two aromatic protons each at different chemical environments (which could be due to the hydroxyl group (-OH). The hydroxyl group is confirmed by the broad peak in the IR spectrum. Therefore, this compound matches all the given spectral data.\n\nD. Phenyl chloroformate: This compound contains a chloroformate group (-OCCl) and a phenyl group. The chloroformate group is not indicated by the given spectral data. \n\nBased on the given spectral data, the most likely structure for the unidentified compound is **C. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**."
