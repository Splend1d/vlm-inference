                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Mixture X decolorizes bromine water**: This suggests that mixture X contains at least one alkene or alkyne, because alkenes and alkynes react with bromine in a substitution reaction, decolorizing the bromine solution.\n\n2. **Mixture Y forms from the disproportionation of mixture X**: Disproportionation implies that one molecule of the starting material can undergo a reaction to form more than one product, often involving oxidation states. In this context, it likely means that a compound in mixture X undergoeses an oxidation-reduction reaction to form two different products, one of which is mixture Y. Since mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, it doesn't contain an alkene or alkyne.\n\n3. **Hydrogenation of both mixtures gives only one substance (hydrocarbon Z)**: This indicates that upon hydrogenation (adding hydrogen to unsaturated compounds), the resulting compound (Z) is the same for both mixtures X and Y. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which helps us determine the molecular formula of Z.\n\n   - If hydrogen makes up 14.28% of Z, and assuming carbon (C and hydrogen (H) are the only elements in Z, we can calculate the number of H atoms per molecule. Let's denote the number of C atoms as \\(n_C\\). Then, the total mass fraction equation would be:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{n_C + 1} = 0.1428\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\(n_C\\) gives:\n     \\[\n     n_c + 1 = \\frac{1}{0.1428} \\approx 7\n     \\]\n     Therefore, \\(n_c = 6\\), meaning each molecule of Z contains 6 carbon atoms.\n\n   - Knowing the mass fraction of hydrogen and the number of carbon atoms, we can find the number of hydrogen atoms. Let \\(n_H\\) be the number of hydrogen atoms. The total number of atoms in Z is \\(n_H + 6\\), and the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{n_H}{n_H + 6} = 0.1428\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\(n_H\\) gives:\n     \\[\n     n_H = 0.1428 \\times (n_H + 6\n     \\]\n     Rearranging terms and solving the quadratic equation yields:\n     \\ \\[\n     n_H = 12\n     \\]\n   \n4. **No conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X**: This means that all compounds in mixture X are either straight-chain alkanes or cycloalkanes.\n\nGiven that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y results in only one substance (hydrocarbon Z, and knowing that Z contains 6 carbon atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms, we deduce that each molecule of Z has 12 hydrogen atoms. \n\nSince the question asks about \"two liquids of mixture X,\" and based on the information provided, the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X is not directly determined by the information given but rather inferred through the process of deducing the composition of Z. The key insight is understanding that the structure of Z informs us about the hydrogen content, which is consistent across the transformation of both mixtures X and Y into Z.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choice is **B. 12**, acknowledging that while the question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in \"two liquids of mixture X,\" the specific composition of the two liquids within X isn't detailed enough to directly answer that with the information provided. However, based on the hydrogen content deduced from the properties of Z, each molecule of Z contains 12 hydrogen atoms, aligning with the understanding derived from the given conditions."
