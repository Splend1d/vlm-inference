The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA. The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\nB. 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\nC. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nD.

The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers.\n\nThe fact that there are two peaks corresponding to the same proton suggests a symmetry in the molecule. This could indicate that the molecule is chiral, and thus exists as a pair of enantiomers, each contributing one peak to the NMR spectrum. The peaks having similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, combined with the presence of two distinct peaks in the MS analysis, strongly suggest that the compound is not racemic but rather exists as a mixture of enantiomers.\n\nOption B ('double coupling') is not the correct answer because it was ruled out as a possibility based on the description of the peaks. \n\nOption C ('the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers') does not fit the given scenario well because the peaks in the NMR spectrum should be different if the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, due to differences in their chemical environments.\n\nOption D ('the compound is contaminated with a precursor') also seems less likely given that the MS analysis shows two clearly defined peaks with the same mass spectrum, suggesting purity in terms of the molecular species present. However, contamination cannot be completely ruled out without additional information about the synthesis process and the purity of the starting materials.\n\nTherefore, the best choice based on the information provided is **A. The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**."
