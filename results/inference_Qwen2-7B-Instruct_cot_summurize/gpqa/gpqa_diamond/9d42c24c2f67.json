The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?\n\nA. ~0.07\nB. ~0.32\nC. ~0.39\nD. ~0.11\n"

This formula comes from the fact that the amount of light blocked or scattered by the planet is proportional to the solid angle subtended by the planet at the observer, which is proportional to the square of its radius when viewed from the side.\n\nThe depth of the dip \u0394F is also related to the filling factor FF ( (the fraction of the star's surface area that is covered by the dark spots), the difference in luminosity between the hot and cool regions (\\( \\Delta L \\)), and the luminosity of the star \\( L_{\\text{star}} \\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta F = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_{\\text{star}}} \\cdot FF \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Star's radius \\( R_{\\text{star}} \\)\n- Star's Teff = 6000 K\n- Star's dark spot filling factor FF = 20%\n- Star's temperature difference \u0394T = 1000 K\n\nWe need to find \\( R_{\\text{planet}}/R_{\\text{star}} \\).\n\nFirst, calculate the luminosity ratio due to the temperature difference:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_{\\text{star}}} = \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T_{\\text{spot}}^4 - 4 \\pi \\sigma T_{\\text{star}}^4}{4 \\pi \\sigma T_{\\text{star}}^4} = \\frac{T_{\\text{spot}}^4 - T_{\\text{star}}^4}{T_{\\text{star}}^4} \\]\n\nWhere \\( T_{\\text{spot}} = T_{\\text{star}} - \\Delta T = 5000 K \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_{\\text{star}}} = \\frac{(5000)^4 - (6000)^4}{(6000)^4} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_{\\text{star}}} \\approx -0.84 \\]\n\nThis value indicates the fraction of the star's luminosity that would be blocked or scattered if the entire star were a perfect blackbody at the spot temperature. However, since only 20% of the star's surface is affected by the spots, we multiply this by the filling factor:\n\n\\[ \\Delta F = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_{\\text{star}}} \\cdot FF \\approx -0.84 \\times 0.20 \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta F \\approx -0.168 \\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates a decrease in flux, but for the purpose of calculating the radius ratio, we only care about the magnitude:\n\n\\[ \\Delta F \\approx 0.168 \\]\n\nNow, equating this to the expression for the depth of the dip due to the planet:\n\n\\[ 0.168 = \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{planet}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( R_{\\text{planet}}/R_{\\text{star}} \\):\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{planet}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\right)^2 = 0.168 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{R_{\\text{planet}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} = \\sqrt{0.168} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{R_{\\text{planet}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\approx 0.41 \\]\n\nThus, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet would be approximately 41% of the radius of the host star to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve.\n\nThe closest answer choice to \\( 0.41 \\) is C. ~0.39."
