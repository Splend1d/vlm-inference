                    "text": "The production of solar neutrinos is dominated by several nuclear reactions taking place in the Sun's core, primarily the proton-proton (pp-chain reaction. The pp-chain reactions can be broadly divided into three main branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III.\n\n- **pp-I** produces neutrinos with an energy range around 14 MeV. This branch is not relevant for the given energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV since these energies fall far below the energy range of neutrinos produced via pp-I.\n\n- **pp-II** produces neutrinos in the energy range of 3-10 MeV, which also does not match the specified energy bands.\n\n- **pp-III** produces neutrinos in the higher energy range, including the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands you mentioned. Specifically, the neutrinos in these bands come from the reactions such as:\n    - \\( ^{3}He + ^{3}He \\rightarrow ^{6}Be + n \\)\n    - \\( ^{3}He + ^{4}He \\rightarrow ^{7}Be + p \\)\n\nWhen the pp-III branch stops, it means that the production of neutrinos in this energy range ceases immediately. However, the question asks about the hypothetical scenario where only the pp-III branch stops, while all other reactions remain unchanged.\n\nSince the production of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band comes solely from the pp-III branch, halting this branch would result in no neutrinos being produced in this energy range. Meanwhile, the 800-900 keV band neutrinos continue to be produced through the same process, albeit at a reduced rate due to the overall decrease in the rate of the pp-III reactions.\n\nTherefore, the flux of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band would be zero, whereas the flux in the 800-900 keV band would still exist, albeit at a lower rate compared to its original value before the hypothetical cessation of the pp-III branch.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer to the question regarding the ratio of the flux between the two bands would be **A. 0.01 ( 10^-2)**. This reflects the fact that the flux in the 700-800 keV band would be essentially zero relative to the flux in the 800-900 keV band, which continues to produce neutrinos albeit at a lower rate."
