When the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and then turned on in the +Y direction, the particle experiences a change in its energy levels due to the interaction with the magnetic field.\n\nThe transition from the initial state aligned with the Z-axis to a final state aligned with the Y-axis corresponds to an energy difference that can be quantized. The energy difference for such a transition is given by:\n\\[ \\Delta E = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\frac{g \\mu_B B}{\\hbar} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta E\\) is the energy difference,\n- \\(g\\) is the Land\u00e9 g-factor (which for a free electron is approximately 2,\n- \\(\\mu_B\\) is the Bohr magneton,\n- \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength.\n\nHowever, we're interested in the frequency of oscillation of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is related to the energy difference by:\n\\[ \\Delta E = h f \\]\nwhere \\(h\\) is Planck's constant and \\(f\\) is the frequency of oscillation.\n\nRearranging this to solve for \\(f\\), we get:\n\\[ f = \\frac{\\Delta E}{h} = \\frac{(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}) (\\frac{g \\mu_B B}{\\hbar})^2}{h} \\]\n\nNotice that \\((\\frac{g \\mu_B B}{\\hbar})^2\\) is proportional to \\(\\gamma^2 B^2\\), since \\(\\mu = \\gamma S_z\\) and \\(S_z = \\frac{1}{2}\\) for a spin-1/2 particle. Simplifyingng our equation using this proportionality, we find:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cdot \\frac{(\\gamma B)^2}{h} \\]\n\nBut the frequency of oscillation is also proportional to the magnetic field strength \\(B\\) because the transition energy depends linearly on \\(B\\) through the term \\((\\frac{g \\mu_B B}{\\hbar})\\).\n\nGiven that the energy difference and thus the frequency of oscillation is directly proportional to \\(B\\), but considering the specific scenario described ( where the system oscillates between two states each experiencing a magnetic field in different directions, the oscillation frequency would be related to the effective magnetic field experienced during the transition.\n\nThe effective magnetic field experienced during the transition from Z to Y and back, when averaged over the oscillation period, would be equivalent to the original field strength \\(B\\) because the system spends equal time in each orientation. Therefore, the correct answer to the question about the oscillation frequency being proportional to \\(B\\) is:\n\nC. \\(\\gamma B\\)\n\nThis represents the simplified understanding based on the principles involved, acknowledging that the precise mathematical derivation involves quantum mechanical details not fully captured in the question's context."
