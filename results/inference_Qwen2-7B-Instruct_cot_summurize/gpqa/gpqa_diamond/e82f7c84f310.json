So, you start with four different products from the two reactions.\n\nWhen running the mixture on an achiral (reverse-phase HPLC column, the separation is primarily based on hydrophobicity. Both enantiomers ( of each diastereomer will have similar hydrophobic properties, thus they will elute together as two peaks. However, the two diastereomers themselves have different geometries, so they will also separate into two peaks, resulting in a total of three peaks.\n\nFor the chiral HPLC column, separation is based on the interaction of the compound's chiral centers with the stationary phase. The two enantiomers of each diastereomer will now be separated because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. This means that within each pair of diastereomers, the enantiomers will separate into two additional peaks, giving a total of four peaks.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C: 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC."
