The spin operator along the y-axis is given by \\(\\sigma_y\\) as you've mentioned:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value can be calculated using the following steps:\n\n1. **Express the state vector**: The state vector for the electron with \\(j=3\\) and \\(m_j=4\\) is:\n   \\[|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2j+1}} \\sum_{m_j=-j}^{j} (-1)^{j-m_j}|m_j\\rangle\\]\n   Since \\(j=3\\), the possible values of \\(m_j\\) are \\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}. But since we're interested in \\(m_j=4\\), there's a mistake in the question setup because the range doesn't include this value. However, proceeding under the assumption that the question intends to describe a state where \\(m_j\\) is one of the allowed values for \\(j=3\\), we would calculate accordingly. For simplicity, let's assume \\(|3i, 4\\rangle\\) was meant to be \\(|3, 2i\\rangle\\) for calculation purposes, considering \\(i\\) could be a typo or misinterpretation related to quantum numbers.\n\n2. **Compute the expectation value**: We need to use the bra-ket notation and the properties of the spin operators. The expectation value of the y-component of spin is:\n   \\[\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | \\sigma_y | \\psi \\rangle\\]\n\nGiven the complexity and potential for misunderstanding in the question's setup due to the unusual spin quantum number representation (\\(3i, 4\\)), I will proceed under the assumption that \\(|3, 2i\\rangle\\) was intended, which seems unlikely but is necessary for proceeding with a calculation.\n\nThe expectation value is computed by taking the dot product of the bra of the state vector with the matrix representation of \\(\\sigma_y\\) and then multiplying by the ket of the same state vector. \n\nGiven the matrix representation of \\(\\sigma_y\\), and assuming the state vector \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) represents an eigenstate of \\(S_z\\) with \\(m_j = 2i\\), the calculation involves:\n\n\\[\n\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\left(-i\\langle 2i|-i|2i\\rangle + i\\langle 2i|i|2i\\rangle\\right)\n\\]\n\nHowever, this is overly complex due to the unconventional quantum number representation and likely misunderstanding in the question. In standard quantum mechanics, spin states are represented by \\(|jm_j\\rangle\\) with \\(j\\) being a non-negative integer or half-integer and \\(m_j\\) ranging from \\(-j\\) to \\(j\\) in steps of 1. \n\nGiven the complexity and potential for misunderstanding, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding in the question's setup regarding the quantum numbers. If \\(|3i, 4\\rangle\\) was intended to represent a state with \\(j=3\\) and \\(m_j=2i\\) ( (which is not standard due to the use of 'i' in the quantum number), the direct calculation would involve the specific properties of this state vector interacting with the \\(\\sigma_y\\) matrix, which would depend on the normalization factor \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\) and the specific values of the matrix elements.\n\nHowever, without a clear and standard interpretation of the quantum numbers provided, and given the nature of the options provided, it seems the question might have aimed for a calculation involving a more conventional quantum state, such as \\(|3, 2\\rangle\\) or similar, which would yield a straightforward result based on the properties of the \\(\\sigma_y\\) matrix and the state vector.\n\nThe correct answer cannot be definitively chosen based on the information provided, as it hinges on the accurate interpretation of the quantum numbers \\(3i, 4\\), which does not align with standard quantum mechanical conventions. Given the options provided, none directly correspond to the correct calculation under the standard quantum mechanical framework, indicating a potential error in question formulation.\n\nFor a precise solution, the quantum numbers should follow standard conventions, and the question should provide a state vector that aligns with these conventions, allowing for a clear and accurate calculation of the expectation"
