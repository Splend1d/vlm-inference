The formula for the relativistic energy of an object with mass \\(m\\) and velocity \\(v\\) is given by:\n\n\\[E = \\gamma mc^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor and \\(v\\) is the velocity of the object.\n\nFor each astronaut, their energy can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For the first astronaut (\\(2m\\) and \\(0.6c\\)):\n\n\\[E_1 = \\frac{(2m)c^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{0.6c}{c}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{2mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{2mc^2}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{2mc^2}{0.8} = 2.5mc^2\\]\n\n- For the second astronaut (\\(3m\\) and \\(0.5c\\)):\n\n\\[E_2 = \\frac{(3m)c^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{0.5c}{c}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{3mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{3mc^2}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{3mc^2}{0.866} \\approx 3.46mc^2\\]\n\nAdding these energies gives the total energy of the system:\n\n\\[E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.46mc^2 = 5.96mc^2\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. v_rel = 0.14c, E= 5.96 mc^2. However, note that there was a mistake in calculating \\(v_{rel}\\). It should be 0.7c instead of 0.14c based on the given velocities."
