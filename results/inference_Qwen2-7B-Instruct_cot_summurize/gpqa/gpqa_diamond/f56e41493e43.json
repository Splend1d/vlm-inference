                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use Kepler's third law which relates the orbital period \\(T\\) and the semi-major axis \\(a\\) of an orbiting body to its mass \\(M\\), the mass of the central body \\(m\\), and the gravitational constant \\(G\\). The law states:\n\n\\[T^2 \\propto a^3\\]\n\nFor our case, we're comparing the orbital periods of two planets around the same star, so we can ignore the mass of the star \\(m\\) in our comparison, since it will be the same for both planets. We want to find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 (\\(T_3\\)) compared to Planet1 (\\(T_1\\)):\n\n\\[\\frac{T_3}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_1}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\]\n\nWe're given that the orbital period is proportional to the semi-major axis raised to the power of 3/2. However, to directly relate the periods to the masses and the albedo, we would typically use the relationship between the temperature of a planet and its orbital period, which depends on the amount of solar energy received, the planet's albedo, and its distance from the sun. \n\nGiven that the albedo is equal for all planets, and assuming that the planets receive solar energy uniformly over their orbital periods, the amount of energy they receive per unit time (and thus the equilibrium temperature) is related to their surface area, not their orbital period directly. However, since the question asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 based on the given information, we'll focus on the orbital dynamics.\n\nThe key pieces of information provided are:\n- Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: \\(T_{1}/T_{2} \\approx 1.4\\) and \\(T_{2}/T_{3} \\approx 2.3\\)\n- Ratio of masses: \\(M_{1}/M_{2} \\approx 1.15\\) and \\(M_{2}/M_{3} \\approx 1.35\\)\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods, we need to consider how the mass affects the orbital period according to Kepler's third law. Since the mass of the central star is constant for both planets orbiting it, we can consider the mass ratios when comparing the planets themselves. The mass ratios suggest a direct relationship with the semi-major axes because the mass appears as a negative exponent in Kepler's third law.\n\nGiven the mass ratios:\n- \\(M_{1}/M_{2} \\approx 1.15\\)\n- \\(M_{2}/M_{3} \\approx 1.35\\)\n\nWe need to find a way to relate these to the orbital periods. However, without specific details on how the masses affect the orbital periods in relation to the given temperature ratios, we must infer a connection through the assumption that the mass affects the semi-major axis in such a way that it indirectly affects the orbital period.\n\nSince we're asked to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, let's use the information given to reason about the relationship:\n\n- The temperature ratios give us a sense of the relative distances or sizes of the orbits, but directly relating them to the orbital periods requires considering the mass effect on the semi-major axis. \n- The mass ratios suggest a proportional change in the mass of the planets relative to each other, which could imply a proportional change in their orbital periods based on Kepler's third law, considering the mass affects the semi-major axis.\n- However, without a direct relationship between the mass ratios and the temperature ratios, and specifically how those relate to the orbital periods, we must make an educated guess based on the typical implications of Kepler's laws and the given information.\n\nGiven the lack of a clear path to directly calculate the orbital period ratio using only the information provided, let's consider the options and reason by process of elimination or approximation based on the principles involved:\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we don't have a direct mathematical derivation linking the provided data points (temperature ratios, mass ratios, and the question about orbital periods) to a clear solution, the correct approach here might involve a simplification or an educated guess based on the understanding of Kepler's laws and the nature of the problem.\n\nSince the question directly asks about the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, and we know that the orbital period scales with the cube root of the semi-major axis, the key elements to consider are the mass ratios and the the temperature ratios which provide indirect information about the size of the orbits.\n\nWithout a precise calculation, and given the choices:\n- A. ~ 4.4  \n- B. ~ 10.4  \n- C. ~ 33.4  \n- D. ~ 3.2\n\nGiven the nature"
