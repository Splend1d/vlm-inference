                    "text": "The electrophilic substitution reaction of the given aromatic compounds with bromine usually follows the mechanism of a \"dipole-dipole\" interaction, leading to formation of the para-substituted product. However, the yield of the para-isomer depends on several factors including the nature of the substituent and the steric hindrance around the benzene ring. \n\nHere's a brief overview:\n\n1) **Ph-CH3** ( (Toluene) : The methyl group is small and does not hinder the reaction much, so it should give a good yield of the para-isomer.\n\n2) **Ph-OOCCH2CH3** ( (Ethyl acetate): The acetate group is slightly larger than the methyl group but still allows for reasonable access to the para-position.\n\n3) **Ph-Cl** : Chloro benzene has no alkyl group attached, which might make it react more uniformly with bromine, giving a decent yield of the para-isomer.\n\n4) **Ph-NO2** : Nitrobenzene has a large group (the nitro group), which can hinder the reaction from proceeding smoothly, making the yield of the para-isomer lower compared to those without or with smaller substituents.\n\n5) **Ph-C2H5** : Ethylbenzene has a medium-sized alkyl group, which could limit the access to the para-position, thus potentially reducing the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n6) **Ph-COOH** : Phenol has a hydroxyl group which is bulky due to its lone pairs and hydrogen bonding capability, making it harder for bromine to access the para-position.\n\nSo, based on these considerations, the correct order would be: \n\n**4<2<6<3<1<5**\n\nThis matches option **C. 4<2<6<3<1<5**."
