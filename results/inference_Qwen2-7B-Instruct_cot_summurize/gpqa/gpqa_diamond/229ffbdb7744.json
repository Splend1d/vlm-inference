In quantum mechanics, the probability of a transition is determined by the square of the matrix element between the initial and final states.\n\nIn the context of the hydrogen atom, the transition probabilities can be calculated using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which involves the overlap of the initial and final states and the selection rules that govern transitions between energy levels.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe quantum numbers \\(n\\), \\(l\\), and \\(m\\) represent:\n- \\(n\\): Principal quantum number ( (energy level)\n- \\(l\\): Orbital angular momentum quantum number ( (shape of the orbital)\n- \\(m\\): Magnetic quantum number ( (orientation of the orbital)\n\n### Transitions:\n\n**Transition A**: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) with probability \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n- **First Transition**: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\)\n    - This transition involves an increase in the principal quantum number (\\(n\\)) from 3 to 2, and a decrease in the magnetic quantum number (\\(m\\)) from 0 to 0. It's not directly a dipole transition but could involve higher-order multipole transitions.\n- **Second Transition**: \\(|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n    - This is a dipole-allowed transition as it involves \\(n=2\\) to \\(n=1\\) and \\(l=1\\) to \\(l=0\\), satisfying the selection rules for dipole transitions (\\(\\Delta n = 1\\) or 0, \\(\\Delta l = 0\\) or \\(\\pm1\\)).\n- **Probability**: The factor \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) does not directly relate to the probabilities of individual transitions based on the quantum numbers alone, suggesting this might be a simplification or specific condition not typically encountered in hydrogen atom transitions.\n\n**Transition B**: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) with probability \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\n- **First Transition**: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\)\n    - This transition also involves an \\(n\\) decrease but with a different change in \\(m\\) (-1 instead of 0). This transition is less straightforward than the typical dipole transitions considered.\n- **Second Transition**: \\(|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n    - This transition is again a dipole-allowed transition, but the first step complicates the overall probability calculation.\n- **Probability**: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) likely reflects the combined probability of both steps considering the quantum numbers involved and possibly additional factors like phase differences or other quantum mechanical considerations.\n\n**Transition C**: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) with probability \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\n- **First Transition**: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\)\n    - This is similar to the first part of Transition A, involving a decrease in \\(n\\) and no change in \\(m\\).\n- **Second Transition**: \\(|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n    - This is a dipole-allowed transition.\n- **Probability**: \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) suggests a simplified or hypothetical scenario, distinct from the more common probabilities associated with hydrogen-like atoms.\n\n**Transition D**: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) with probability \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\n- **First Transition**: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\)\n    - This involves a decrease in \\(n\\) and an increase in \\(l\\), which is less typical for dipole transitions and might involve higher-order multipole interactions.\n- **Second Transition**: \\(|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n    - This transition is a dipole-allowed transition if \\(m\\) decreases appropriately.\n- **Probability**: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) suggests a simplified model or a specific condition affecting the overall probability.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nEach option describes a unique path of two-photon"
