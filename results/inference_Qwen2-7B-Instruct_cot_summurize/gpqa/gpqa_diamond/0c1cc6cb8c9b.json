This approach simplifies the many-body problem into a series of two-body interactions, akin to how one might consider the behavior of charges in an electric field without accounting for the collective effects of the charges themselves. \n\nGiven the options:\n\n1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This directly supports the impulse approximation as it suggests that the interaction can be considered at the level of individual particles rather than their collective behavior.\n\n2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This implies that the nucleus can be thought of as a collection of individual components, each interacting independently, which aligns with the impulse approximation's assumption of treating each nucleon separately.\n\n3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This condition is important because it allows for treating the nucleon as a non-relativistic particle. In the impulse approximation, we often assume non-relativistic behavior to simplify calculations, focusing on the classical behavior of the particles.\n\n4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This assumption is key because it allows us to treat the nucleon as a free particle for the purposes of the interaction, ignoring the internal structure and binding energy of the nucleus.\n\nGiven these explanations, the assumptions that jointly imply the \"impulse\" approximation are:\n\n**B. 1,2,4**\n\nThis selection reflects the core principles of the impulse approximation: considering interactions at the level of individual particles (nucleons), treating the nucleus as transparent except for the interacting particle, and ignoring the binding forces within the nucleus, focusing instead on the interaction currents generated by the individual nucleons."
