Also, there are intense bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which can be indicative of hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n\n1H NMR: The signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) indicates a methyl group attached to a secondary carbon, which is consistent with an alkyl group in an amide or ester. At 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) there's a broad singlet suggesting an alcohol or a nitrogen with lone pair electrons. At 4.5 ppm q, 2H) there's a quartet which suggests two protons attached to a carbon that is bonded to another carbon via single bond ( typically found in alcohols or ethers. At 7.0 ppm d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm d, 2H) there are doublets indicating aromatic protons.\n\nConsidering all these data, the structure that fits this description is **C. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**. This compound has a carbonyl group (C=O, an ethoxy group, and an amino group attached to a phenyl ring, which corresponds to the observed peaks."
