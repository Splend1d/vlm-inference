However, to find \\(\\Delta P_z\\), we only need to focus on the properties of \\(P_z\\) and its action on the given state.\n\nThe state of the system is given by:\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\left( \\begin{array}{c}\n-1/2 \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n-1/2 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate \\(\\langle P_z |\\psi\\rangle\\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c}\n-1/2 \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n-1/2 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right) = \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 = -\\hbar/2\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate \\(\\langle P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle\\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c}\n-1/2 \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n-1/2 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) = -\\hbar^2\n\\]\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the uncertainty formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{-\\hbar^2 - \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{-\\hbar^2 - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{-\\frac{5\\hbar^2}{4}}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the calculation above contains an error since the square of a real number cannot result in a negative value.
