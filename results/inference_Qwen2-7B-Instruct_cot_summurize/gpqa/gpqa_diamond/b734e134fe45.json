                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the Lorentz factor (\u03b3 and the probability of a particle reaching the detector's inner walls. In relativistic physics, the probability of a particle reaching an object decreases as the Lorentz factor increases because the time interval between events becomes longer in the observer's frame compared to the particle's frame.\n\nGiven that one third of the particles reach the detector when the Lorentz factor is ~20, we can infer that the probability of a particle reaching the detector is proportional to \u03b3. We want to find the Lorentz factor that allows two thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n\nLet's denote the desired Lorentz factor as \u03b3'. The probability of reaching the detector is given by:\n\nP = 1/\u03b3\n\nWe know that P = 1/3 when \u03b3 = 20. Therefore, the probability when \u03b3' is the desired Lorentz factor is:\n\nP' = 2/3\n\nNow we set up the equation for P':\n\n1/\u03b3' = 2/3\n\nSolved for \u03b3', we get:\n\n\u03b3' = 3/2\n\nHowever, this doesn't make sense in the context of Lorentz factors, which are always greater than or equal to 1. This indicates that our initial assumption needs to be corrected. The correct interpretation should be that the probability decreases as \u03b3 increases. Thus, if 1/3 of the particles reach the detector with \u03b3 = 20, we need a smaller \u03b3 to increase the probability to 2/3.\n\nSince we're dealing with probabilities and their inversely proportional relationship to \u03b3, we need to consider the square root relationship between \u03b3 and the probability, due to the nature of the Lorentz factor in relativistic physics. \n\nTherefore, to find \u03b3', we can use the relation:\n\n(\u03b3')^2 = ( \u03b3 * ( (desired probability / current probability)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(\u03b3')^2 = 20 * ( (2/3) / (1/3)\n(\u03b3')^2 = 20 * 2\n\u03b3' = \u221a40\n\u03b3' \u2248 6.83\n\nSo, the closest option is D. 68."
