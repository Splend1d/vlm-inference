These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the \u03b2 position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the \u03b2-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA.

                    "text": "The Michael addition reactions involve an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compound reacting with a nucleophile to form a new carbon-carbon bond. Let's analyze each case:\n\n**Case A:**\n- Reactants: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n- The major product should be formed by an attack at the \u03b2-carbon, which in this case would be the p-tolyl group.\n- The final product should be a carboxylic acid ester.\n\nBased on these considerations, the correct answer is **A. A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**, because it reflects the formation of an ester through the Michael addition reaction involving the p-tolyl group as the \u03b2-carbon.\n\n**Case B:**\n- Reactants: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n- Here, the reaction involves a cyclic amine (piperidine) reacting with an alkyne nitrile. \n- The product should be a cyclic amide or imine, given that the nucleophile is a cyclic amine.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer is **B. A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate**, assuming the reaction results in a similar structure to the first option but with different numbering due to the structural differences between the two cases. However, without further specifics, the exact numbering cannot be confirmed based solely on the information provided. \n\n**Case C:**\n- Reactant: but-3-en-2-one and KOH, H2O.\n- This appears to be a different type of reaction, specifically a ketone reduction, not a Michael addition. The product mentioned, cyclohexane-1,3-dione, suggests a rearrangement of the original compound rather than a typical Michael addition product.\n\nGiven the description and the nature of the reaction, **C. A = cyclohexane-1,3-dione** is the correct final product as stated, but the question seems to be misaligned with the typical Michael addition mechanism described for cases A and B. \n\nIn conclusion:\n- **Case A:** Answer A is correct.\n- **Case B:** Without additional clarification on the exact structure of the final product, B might be the closest answer choice based on the provided information, though it could also be A depending on specific structural details not provided.\n- **Case C:** The final product C is correctly identified as cyclohexane-1,3-dione, but the reactants and process described do not align with a typical Michael addition reaction."
