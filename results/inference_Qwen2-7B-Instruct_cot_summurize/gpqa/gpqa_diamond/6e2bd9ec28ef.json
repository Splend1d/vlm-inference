This is known as the Clemmensen reduction.\n\nGiven the compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, it contains two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring (and another in the vinyl group. After undergoing the Clemmensen reduction, both double bonds will be reduced to single bonds, converting the compound into an alcohol.\n\nThe original compound had 5 double bonds ( (two from the cyclohexene ring and three from the vinyl group). After the reduction, all these double bonds become single bonds, resulting in a compound that lacks any double or triple bonds. Hence, it has no \"index of hydrogen deficiency\" related to double or triple bonds, which would be represented as 0 in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0"
