The general pathway involves reduction of the nitrile group to an amine, followed by further oxidation of the amine to an aldehyde or ketone, and finally oxidation of the aldehyde or ketone to a carboxylic acid.\n\nFor the first reaction:\nButan-2-one + NaCN + A --> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\nWe need a reducing agent to convert the butan-2-one to a hydroxyl group. Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3 is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis that can convert ketones to alcohols. So, A would be NaHSO3. \n\nThe second reaction:\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) --> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\nThis is a simple hydration reaction where water adds across the double bond formed after the reduction step. Therefore, B should be H2O.\n\nSo, the suitable reagents are:\n\nA = NaHSO3, B = H2O\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A**."
