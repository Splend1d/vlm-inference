The 2-ethyl-2,2-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one acts as a good leaving group due to its bulky structure, allowing for a nucleophilic attack from the ethyl acrylate. After the initial nucleophilic addition, a rearrangement occurs due to the steric hindrance of the bulky groups, leading to the formation of a new carbonyl group.\n\nThe major product would be: \nA. A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate \n\nThis is because the new carbonyl group will form on the carbon that was originally part of the cyclohexane ring, with the methyl and ethyl groups attached to it, maintaining the stability of the compound.\n\nFor reaction B:\n\nThe given reaction is: 1-nitropropane + KOH, ( (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\nThis reaction involves the reduction of the nitropropane to an aldehyde or ketone followed by the addition of an enolate ion from (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\nConsidering the stability and the steric hindrance:\n1. Nitropropane will reduce to an alcohol, and the addition of the enolate ion will lead to a new double bond formation, resulting in the formation of an alkene.\n2. The major product will be one where the new double bond is formed on the side with less steric hindrance. Since the nitropropane has a bulky tert-butyl group, the addition of the enolate ion should occur at the more accessible site.\n3. The formation of the alkene will lead to a nitrile group being attached to the newly formed carbon atom.\n\nThe major product will be:\nB. 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile"
