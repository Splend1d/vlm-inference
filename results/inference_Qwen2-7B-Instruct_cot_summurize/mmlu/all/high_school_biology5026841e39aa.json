They form part of the mitotic spindle, which aligns chromosomes at the cell's equatorial plate before their separation into two daughter cells. Colchicine's ability to bind to tubulin protein subunits and prevent microtubule assembly disrupts this process, leading to misaligned chromosomes and aneuploidy ( (an abnormal number of chromosomes) in the resulting cells. This is why option A is the correct answer.\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not directly involve microtubules:\n\nB. Coordination of ribosomes and mRNA during protein synthesis is primarily managed by the cytoplasmic environment and the ribosome itself, not microtubules.\n  \nC. Movement of substances across the plasma membrane is facilitated by transport proteins such as channels and carriers, not microtubules.\n\nD. Accumulation of protons inside the thylakoids of chloroplasts during chemiosmosis occurs within the chloroplast's internal structure and is driven by the proton gradient, which is not directly related to microtubule function."
