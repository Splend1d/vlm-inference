The grocery store was situated in the first floor of the building in which the husband and wife occupied a second-floor apartment. Late one evening, the defendant was walking past the grocery store when he decided to steal the money he heard had been stashed in a cigar box inside the store. The defendant furtively walked to the rear of the building. He then proceeded to open the gate to the fenced-in back yard. Once inside the back yard, the defendant attempted to pry open the back window of the grocery store. Awakened by the barking of his watchdog, the husband went out onto his second- floor back porch and saw the defendant below. The husband yelled at the defendant. Startled, the defendant turned to run when he noticed a large package lying outside the rear door to the store. The defendant picked up the package, which contained baked bread that had been delivered earlier in the evening, and the defendant then ran off. Which of the following crimes will the defendant most likely be convicted of?\n\nA. Larceny.\nB. Burglary.\nC. Larceny and attempted burglary.\nD. Larceny and burglary.\n"

However, since he was caught before he could complete the theft, and instead ended up taking an item that was left outside (which is not the intended target of his crime attempt, his act also constitutes an attempted crime.\n\nBurglary typically involves entering a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime inside. In this case, the defendant did enter the building's premises (the back yard and attempted to enter the store through the window, which aligns with the elements of burglary. However, since he did not actually commit the crime of theft inside the store, the charge would not fully meet the criteria for a completed burglary.\n\nGiven these details, the defendant will most likely be convicted of **C. Larceny and attempted burglary**. This conviction acknowledges both the attempted entry with criminal intent (the attempted burglary component) and the actual commission of the crime of larceny by taking the package of baked bread."
