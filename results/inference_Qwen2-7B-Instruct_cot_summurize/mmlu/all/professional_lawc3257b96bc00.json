                    "text": "A woman hired a builder to build a house according to certain plans and specifications prepared by the woman's architect. The agreed upon price was $250,000, with construction to be completed within four months. Two weeks after the building contract was formed, the builder contacted a lumber yard to purchase wood necessary for the construction of the house. The builder and the owner of the lumber yard entered into a valid written agreement whereby the lumber yard was to supply the necessary lumber in exchange for $10,000, payable by the builder within 30 days. One week later, a fire destroyed a good portion of the lumber yard's supply of lumber. As a result, the lumber yard refused to supply lumber to the builder. The builder was unable to find another supplier of lumber and therefore notified the woman that he would be unable to complete her building on time. If the woman sues the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because by operation of law the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract.\nB. Yes, but only if the builder's contract with the owner of the lumber yard was not discharged by the fire.\nC. No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\nD. No, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard.\n"

No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn contract law, \"privity of contract\" refers to the direct relationship between the parties involved in a contract. Generally, a person who is not a party to a contract (like the woman in this scenario) cannot sue for its breach unless they have a special status or interest protected under the law. Here, the woman has a contractual relationship with the builder, but there is no direct contractual relationship between her and the owner of the lumber yard. \n\nThe woman could potentially argue that she is an \"equitable assignee\" of the builder's claim against the lumber yard, meaning she may be able to enforce the builder's rights if the builder cannot do so due to some incapacity. However, without such a specific legal status or interest recognized under the circumstances provided, it is unlikely that the woman would be able to directly sue the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract. Therefore, option A is incorrect as it suggests the woman is automatically an equitable assignee based on the scenario described. Options B and D also incorrectly assume additional legal statuses or relationships not indicated in the given facts."
