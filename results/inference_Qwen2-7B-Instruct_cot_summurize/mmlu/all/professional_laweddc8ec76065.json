After receiving the letter, the woman sent the man a fax that stated, \"The price is a little high, I'll give you $800. \" The man responded by fax, \"I will not accept $800. \" The next day, the woman telephoned the man and said, \"I changed my mind, I will pay $1,000 for the motorcycle. \" The man refused to sell the woman his motorcycle. If the woman sues the man for breach of contract, which of the following defenses would be the man's best defense?\n\nA. Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.\nB. The contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds, because the woman's purported acceptance was oral.\nC. The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.\nD. The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.\n"

The woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance.\n\nIn contract law, when one party makes a counteroffer, it is generally considered as a rejection of the original offer and leads to the termination of the original offer. This means the original offeror ( in this case, the man - is no longer bound by the original terms of the offer. The woman's counteroffer of $800 effectively renegotiatedged the terms of the original offer, thus ending her ability to accept the original offer at the specified price ($1,000). \n\nTherefore, if the woman sues the man for breach of contract based on his refusal to sell the motorcycle at $1,000, the man could argue that the contract was was terminated when the woman made her counteroffer, and he had no obligation to sell the motorcycle at the original price."
