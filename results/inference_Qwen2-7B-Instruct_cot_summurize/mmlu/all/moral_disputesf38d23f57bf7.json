Instead, he advocates for a more nuanced approach that involves ethical education, international cooperation, and the development of societal norms that value diversity and equity. The goal is to create a culture where genetic enhancements are considered for personal enhancement rather than societal advantages, thus reducing the pressure to engage in such practices."
