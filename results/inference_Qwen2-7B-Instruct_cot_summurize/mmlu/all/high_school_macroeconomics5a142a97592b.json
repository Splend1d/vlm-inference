This means that the value of goods and services purchased from other countries exceeds the value of goods and services sold to those countries. In this case, the United States had a trade deficit of $603 billion in 2004, which indicates that Americans consumed more than what was produced domestically. This could be due to various factors, including high levels of consumer spending, lower savings rates, or an over-reliance on foreign goods and services.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are not directly accurate based solely on the information provided about the trade deficit. \n\nA. Net exports being positive would indicate a trade surplus, not a deficit.\nC. The statement about America's government spending more than it took in does not necessarily follow from having a trade deficit. Government budgets can be balanced or have deficits unrelated to the trade balance.\nD. While capital flows out of a country could contribute to a trade deficit, the specific amount ($603 billion) equated to the total trade deficit and does not directly equate to the capital flow out. Capital flows involve investments and financial transactions, not just goods and services trade."
