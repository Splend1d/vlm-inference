In his view, an action or object has utility if it leads to increased happiness or pleasure for individuals, and decreased suffering or pain. This is encapsulated in option C: \"pleasure and the absence of pain.\"\n\nHowever, Mill's concept of utility goes beyond mere personal pleasure. He also considers the principle of utility from a societal perspective, which aligns with option D: \"it promotes the interests of all and does not harm anyone.\" Mill believed that actions should be judged by their overall contribution to the greatest happiness of the greatest number, considering both direct and indirect effects on all individuals affected.\n\nTherefore, while option C captures part of Mill's definition of utility, the full concept also includes the societal dimension represented by option D."
