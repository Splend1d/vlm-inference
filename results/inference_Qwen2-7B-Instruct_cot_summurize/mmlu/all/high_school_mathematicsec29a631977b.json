This is simply the combination of 52 items taken 3 at a time, denoted as \\(C(52, 3)\\). The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!} = \\frac{52!}{3!49!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 22100\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ways to get a pair. To do this, we need to consider selecting a rank for the pair and then selecting a different rank for the single card.\n\n1. **Selecting the rank for the pair**: There are 13 ranks in a deck, so there are 13 ways to select the rank for the pair.\n\n2. **Selecting 2 of the 4 cards of that rank**: Once the rank is selected, there are 4 cards of that rank, and we need to choose 2 of them to form the pair. This can be done in \\(C(4, 2)\\) ways. \n\n\\[C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\\]\n\n3. **Selecting the rank for the single card**: After selecting the pair, we have 12 remaining ranks to choose from for the single card.\n\n4. **Selecting 1 of the 4 cards of that rank**: For the single card, there are 4 cards of its chosen rank, so there are 4 ways to select it.\n\nMultiplying these together gives the total number of ways to get a pair:\n\n\\[13 \\times 6 \\times 12 \\times 4 = 3744\\]\n\nFinally, the probability of drawing a pair is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[P(\\text{a pair}) = \\frac{3744}{22100}\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\n\\[P(\\text{a pair}) = \\frac{3744}{22100} = \\frac{3744 \\div 4}{22100 \\div 4} = \\frac{936}{5525} = \\frac{72}{425}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. \\(\\frac{72}{425}\\)**."
