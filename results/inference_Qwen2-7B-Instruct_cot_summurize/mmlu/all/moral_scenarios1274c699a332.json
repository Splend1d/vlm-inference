Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the action of feeding one's child by forcing them to eat food they might not want or might not be able to consume ( against their will is generally considered morally wrong. It violates the child's autonomy and basic rights, particularly regarding bodily harm and consent.\n\nIn Scenario 2, informing the hospital that a family member needs immediate medical attention is not morally wrong. It is an appropriate action that could save someone's life and is within the bounds of societal expectations for responsible behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: \"Wrong, Not wrong\"."
