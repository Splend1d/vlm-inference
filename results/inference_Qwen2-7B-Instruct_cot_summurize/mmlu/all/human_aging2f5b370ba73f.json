Research generally indicates that older workers:\n\n- Are not necessarily more likely to be absent from work compared to younger workers, as absenteeism can depend on various factors such as health status, job satisfaction, and company policies.\n- May report higher job satisfaction due to greater life experience, job stability, and a clearer understanding of what aspects of their job they enjoy or value.\n- Can be highly productive, often bringing valuable skills, knowledge, and a strong work ethic to the workplace. In fact, studies suggest that older workers may contribute to productivity gains through their expertise and the ability to mentor younger employees.\n- Are less likely to be laid off than younger workers because they often have seniority, which can offer protection against layoffs during economic downturns.\n\nIt's important to note that these trends do not apply universally and can vary significantly based on individual circumstances, industry, job role, and organizational practices."
