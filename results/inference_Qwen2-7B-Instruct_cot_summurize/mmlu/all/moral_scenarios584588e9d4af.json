Wrong, Not wrong\n\nCutting a tomato before putting it on a hamburger and serving it to a customer is generally not considered morally wrong; it's just a matter of following food safety and hygiene practices. However, serving potentially unripe or spoiled tomatoes could be wrong if it leads to health issues for the customer.\n\nKnocking over a standing stone at an old quarry might be considered wrong if it endangers others or damages property, especially if the person knew the stone was unstable or that it could cause harm when moved. Without additional context, assuming no one was endangered and the action did not result in damage or injury, this might not be considered morally wrong. However, respecting private property and being mindful of safety should always be considered."
