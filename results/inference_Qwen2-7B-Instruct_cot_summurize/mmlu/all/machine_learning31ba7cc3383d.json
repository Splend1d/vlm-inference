                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. **For two dimensional data points, the separating hyperplane learnt by a linear SVM will be a straight line.** This statement is **true**. By definition, a linear SVM learns a decision boundary (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that separates classes using a linear function. In two-dimensional space, this means the hyperplane would indeed be a straight line.\n\nB. **In theory, a Gaussian kernel SVM cannot model any complex separating hyperplane.** This statement is **false**. The Gaussian (or radial basis function (RBF) kernel allows the SVM to create non-linear decision boundaries by transforming the original input space into a higher-dimensional feature space where a linear separator might exist. Thus, theoretically, a Gaussian kernel SVM can model complex separating hyperplanes.\n\nC. **For every kernel function used in a SVM, one can obtain an equivalent closed form basis expansion.** This statement is **true**. Every kernel function can be represented as a dot product in a high-dimensional space, which corresponds to a basis expansion. This property is crucial for understanding how kernels enable SVMs to solve non-linear problems without explicitly computing the coordinates in the high-dimensional space.\n\nD. **Overfitting in an SVM is not a function of the number of support vectors.** This statement is **false**. While overfitting isn't directly proportional to the number of support vectors, it can still occur. The complexity of the model, including the margin size and the choice of kernel parameters, can lead to overfitting. More support vectors often imply a more complex model, which might fit the training data too closely and thus overfit, especially if the regularization parameter is not properly tuned. \n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and C."
