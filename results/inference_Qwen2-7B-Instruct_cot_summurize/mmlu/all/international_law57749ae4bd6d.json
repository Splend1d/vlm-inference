This concept is primarily used in the field of international law, particularly in the context of sovereign immunity.\n\nThe correct answer would be B. An act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official State capacity. This means that the action was performed by the state itself or by one of its representatives as part of their official duties and responsibilities. The act is considered an integral part of the state's sovereign functions and powers, which is why it may be exempt from legal liability or subject to a different standard of jurisdiction than other private acts.\n\nIt's important to note that the concept of \"jure imperii\" is somewhat complex and can vary in application across different jurisdictions and legal systems. Additionally, not all acts performed by state officials are necessarily jure imperii; for example, actions taken by a state official in a personal capacity or in a commercial role might not fall under this category."
