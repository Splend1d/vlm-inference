Does the author use personal connections and stories to appeal to the audience's emotions? \n\nThis question targets the use of pathos, which is one of the three rhetorical appeals (appeal to logic (logos), appeal to ethics (ethos), and appeal to emotion (pathos). Pathos involves using emotional language or personal anecdotes to evoke feelings in the audience and persuade them on an emotional level. Therefore, asking about the presence of personal connections and stories would help identify if the author is using pathos."
