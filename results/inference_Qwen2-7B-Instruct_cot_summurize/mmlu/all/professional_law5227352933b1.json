Give the self-defense instruction, because the evidence was sufficient to raise the defense.\n\nIn this scenario, the father claims that he acted in self-defense after his son, under the influence of crack cocaine, threatened and potentially harmed him. The jury must consider whether the father's belief that he was in imminent danger was reasonable based on the available evidence. Since the father presented facts suggesting that his son was violent and had made loud, obscene remarks, which could indicate a potential threat, the evidence supports the possibility of the father acting in self-defense. Therefore, the judge should provide the self-defense instruction to allow the jury to properly evaluate the claim within the context of the presented evidence."
