The passenger, who was extremely exhausted after a long and hectic day, tried to sleep during the flight but was constantly being annoyed by the salesman. Once the flight departed, the salesman started ordering drinks of Scotch and water from the flight attendant, and became inebriated. When the passenger refused to talk to him, the salesman became very abusive to the passenger. Although there were many empty seats available on the plane in the first-class section, the passenger decided to remain seated next to the salesman. Finally, after the flight attendant had served the saleman his tenth drink of Scotch, he became belligerent and punched the passenger in the mouth. The passenger's two front teeth were knocked loose and she suffered a cut lip. If the passenger asserts a claim against the airline based on negligence, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because, as a first-class passenger, she was owed a special duty of care by the airline.\nB. prevail, because the flight attendant should have been aware that her conduct caused an unjustifiable risk of harm.\nC. not prevail, because the airline is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its passengers.\nD. not prevail, because the passenger assumed the risk by not moving to another seat away from the salesman.\n"

By seating the passenger next to the inebriated man, the airline may have breached its duty of care towards the passenger, especially considering the severity of the incident and the fact that there were empty seats available. The airline could potentially be held responsible for the passenger's injuries if it can be shown that the airline failed to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of its passengers, such as removing the intoxicated passenger or providing adequate supervision.\n\nHowever, the specific outcome would depend on the jurisdiction's laws and the details of the case, including whether the airline had policies or procedures in place for handling intoxicated passengers and whether these were followed appropriately."
