This period saw significant economic growth in many developing nations, often referred to as the \"East Asian\u5947\u8ff9\", where countries like China, South Korea, and others experienced rapid economic development and income growth at rates much higher than those of many high-income countries.\n\n\u9009\u9879 A is incorrect because the growth rate was not approximately zero; it was positive and substantial in many cases.\n\u9009\u9879 C is incorrect because while developing countries did experience rapid income growth, it is unlikely to have surpassed the income growth rates seen in Britain during the industrial revolution (which was characterized by a dramatic increase in productivity and income levels over several decades.\n\u9009\u9879 D is also incorrect because while some developing countries did achieve growth rates around 3.0% per year or higher, this was not a universal experience across all less developed countries during that time frame, and the average could be quite different depending on specific country conditions and policies environments."
