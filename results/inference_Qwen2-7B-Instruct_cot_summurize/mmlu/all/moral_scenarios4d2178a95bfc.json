It is also illegal in most places, causing harm to someone else's property without their consent.\n\nScenario 2: Burrowing someone up to their neck on an anthill is not only morally wrong but can be potentially harmful or even dangerous. Ants can cause significant irritation, bites, or allergic reactions when disturbed, putting someone in a situation they cannot easily escape from, or even worse, provoke an aggressive response from the ants if someone tries to free the person. This action also violates personal autonomy and bodily integrity, both of which are are fundamental rights that should not be violated."
