Populations tend to increase at a faster rate than their food supply normally allows.\n\nDarwin was influenced by Malthus's theory of population growth, which he encountered in Malthus's book \"An Essay on the Principle of Population.\" This theory emphasized that populations tend to grow exponentially while resources grow linearly, leading to competition and natural selection. This concept was crucial in Darwin's development of his theory of evolution by natural selection."
