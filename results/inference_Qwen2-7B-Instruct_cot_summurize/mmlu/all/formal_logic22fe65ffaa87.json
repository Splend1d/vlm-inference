N \u00b7 ~Q\n\nWe need to find a valuation that makes all these statements true.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equivalence using logical equivalences:\n\n1. ~N \u2261 ( O \u00b7 P can be rewritten as:\n   - (~N \u2261 O \u00b7 P) \u2261 ( (T \u2261 T) (since ~N is equivalent to its negation, and O\u00b7P is equivalent to itself)\n   - (T \u2261 T (which is always true, so this doesn't add any new information)\n\nNow, let's look at the implications:\n2. ~O \u2283 Q can be rewritten as:\n   - (\u00acO \u2192 Q which means \"if O is false, then Q must be true\"\n\nFinally, we have:\n3. N \u00b7 ~Q\n\nThis statement means \"N is true, and Q is false\".\n\nNow, let's construct a truth table for N, O, P, and Q considering the implications and equivalences:\n\n| N | O | P | Q | ~N | O\u00b7P | ~O | ~O\u2283Q |\n|---|---|---|---|----|-----|----|------|\n| T | T | T | F | F  | TF  | F  | T    |\n| T | T | F | F | F  | TF  | F  | T    |\n| T | F | T | F | T  | FT  | T  | T    |\n| T | F | F | F | T  | FF  | T  | T    |\n| F | T | T | F | T  | TF  | F  | F    |\n| F | T | F | F | T  | TF  | F  | F    |\n| F | F | T | F | T  | FT  | T  | T    |\n| F | F | F | F | T  | FF  | T  | T    |\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the valuation where N, O, and P are true, and Q is false satisfies all the given propositions:\n\n- ~N \u2261 O\u00b7P is true since both sides evaluate to false.\n- ~O \u2283 Q is true since ~O is false and Q is also false, making the implication true.\n- N \u00b7 ~Q is true since both N and ~Q are true.\n\nTherefore, the set of propositions is consistent, and one possible consistent valuation is when N, O, and P are true, and Q is false.\n\nCorrect answer: B.
