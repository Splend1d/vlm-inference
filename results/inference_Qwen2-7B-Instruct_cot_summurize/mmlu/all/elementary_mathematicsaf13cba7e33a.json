Dividing the total pages by the pages per minute gives you the total time required in minutes.\n\nSo, if Susan reads 1 page every 3 minutes, then to read 18 pages, you calculate \\( \\frac{18 \\text{ pages}}{1 \\text{ page/3 minutes}} = 18 \\times \\frac{3 \\text{ minutes}}{1} = 54 \\text{ minutes} \\).\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct choice."
