The shop owner sought $100,000 in damages for allegedly defective goods that the distributor had provided under the contract. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. The distributor brought in as a third-party defendant the wholesaler that had provided the goods to the distributor, alleging that the wholesaler had a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?\n\nA. No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.\nB. No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\nC. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.\nD.

No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim**.\n\nIn this scenario, the shop owner (domiciled in State A) and the distributor (incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C) have a dispute over a contract for allegedly defective goods, where the shop owner seeks $100,000 in damages. The wholesaler (incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A) is brought in as a third-party defendant, alleging a duty to indemnify the distributor. The wholesaler asserts a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor moves to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nFor a federal court to have jurisdiction over a case, there must be diversity of citizenship between the parties, meaning that each party must reside in a different state or that one is a citizen of a state and the other is an alien. In this case, there is diversity between the shop owner and the distributor, as they are domiciled in different states. However, there is no diversity between the distributor and the wholesaler, as both are incorporated in the same state (State B.\n\nThe key here is whether the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim. Supplemental jurisdiction allows federal courts to hear cases that are related to the main action when the main action itself is within the court's original jurisdiction. Since the shop owner's lawsuit against the distributor is within the court's original jurisdiction due to diversity, and the wholesaler's counterclaim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the main action, the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim against the distributor.\n\nTherefore, the motion to dismiss the counterclaim should not be granted based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction."
