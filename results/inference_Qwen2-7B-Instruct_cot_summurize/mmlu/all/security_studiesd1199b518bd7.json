The responsibility of the state to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.\n2. The responsibility of the international community to assist states in fulfilling their responsibilities under certain circumstances.\n3. The responsibility of the international community to take collective action to protect populations when their government fails to do so.\n\nAmong these, the second pillar, \"The responsibility to prevent,\" is widely acclaimed as being particularly important. It emphasizes preventive measures to avoid the occurrence of mass atrocities and supports national and international efforts to prevent them before they happen. This includes diplomatic, humanitarian, and other forms of assistance to states to help them meet their responsibilities."
