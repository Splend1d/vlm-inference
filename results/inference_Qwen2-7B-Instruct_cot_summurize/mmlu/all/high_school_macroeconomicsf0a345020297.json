                    "text": "To calculate the productivity of labor in each country, we need to divide the total output by the number of workers.\n\nFor Country X:\nProductivity = Output / Number of Workers = 30,000 units / 3,000 workers = 10 units per worker\n\nFor Country Z:\nProductivity = Output / Number of Workers = 40,000 units / 8,000 workers = 5 units per worker\n\nNow, let's compare these productivity rates:\n\n- Option A suggests that Country Z's productivity is 33% higher than Country X's. This would mean Country Z's productivity (is 1.33 times Country X's productivity. We can check this by calculating 1.33 * 10 units/worker for Country X's productivity: 13.3 units/worker, which is not equal to Country Z's productivity rate of 5 units/worker.\n  \n- Option B states that Country Z's productivity is 25% higher than Country X's. This would mean Country Z's productivity is 1.25 times Country X's productivity. Calculating 1.25 * 10 units/worker for Country X gives us 12.5 units/worker, which again does not match Country Z's productivity rate of 5 units/worker.\n\n- Option C claims that Country X's productivity is 33% higher than Country Z's. This would mean Country X's productivity is 1.33 times Country Z's productivity. Calculating 1.33 * 5 units/worker for Country Z's productivity gives us 6.65 units/worker, which also does not match Country X's productivity rate of 10 units/worker.\n\n- Option D suggests that Country X's productivity is twice as much as Country Z's. This would mean Country X's productivity is 2 times Country Z's productivity. Calculating 2 * 5 units/worker for Country Z's productivity gives us 10 units/worker, which matches Country X's productivity rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. The productivity of labor in country X is twice as much as country Z.**"
