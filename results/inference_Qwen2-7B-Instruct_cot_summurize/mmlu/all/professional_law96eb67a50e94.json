However, when a tire on the woman's car suddenly blew out, she lost control of her car and crashed, injuring a pedestrian. The pedestrian later sued the man, because the woman had no insurance or assets. Will the pedestrian be likely to prevail in that action?\n\nA. No, because the man did not cause the injury.\nB. No, because the man was driving very carefully.\nC. Yes, because the man and the woman were acting in concert in a dangerous activity.\nD. Yes, because the man was exceeding the speed limit. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because the man and the woman were acting in concert in a dangerous activity.\n\nIn this scenario, the man and woman were participating in an illegal drag race, which is inherently dangerous. Although they were driving carefully at the time of the accident, their joint participation in a prohibited and risky activity makes them potentially liable for any harm caused during the event. The pedestrian's lawsuit against the man would likely argue that by engaging in this dangerous activity together, they created a duty to each other and to others on the road to act responsibly. The fact that the man was also exceeding the speed limit could further support the pedestrian's claim, as it may indicate a disregard for safety rules that contributed to the accident."
