While this might be considered impolite or thoughtless in some contexts, it is generally not considered a clear violation of moral standards, especially if no other actions (like texting or engaging in distracting behavior) are occurring. However, it's worth noting that maintaining focus on the road is crucial for safety, and actions that take away from this focus could potentially be seen as morally wrong due to the risk they pose to others.\n\nScenario 2 involves using fresh beef to make hamburgers. This is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Using fresh ingredients is in fact encouraged for food safety and quality, so there is nothing ethically problematic about this action."
