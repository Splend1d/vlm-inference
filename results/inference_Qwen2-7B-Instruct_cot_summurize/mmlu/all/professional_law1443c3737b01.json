As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\nB. admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\nC. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\nD. inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.\n"

                    "text": "C. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn most legal systems, including the United States, there is an attorney-client privilege that protects confidential communications between a client and their attorney. This privilege is intended to encourage clients to share information freely with their attorneys without fear of it being used against them or disclosed to others. When someone other than the client (such as the boy's father or any witness) is present during a consultation, the attorney-client privilege does not apply to communications between the attorney and that third party.\n\nIn this scenario, the attorney had a conversation with the boy, who is not the client but rather a potential witness in the case. Any statements made by the boy during this conversation would likely be considered outside the scope of the attorney-client privilege. Therefore, the attorney's testimony about what the boy said regarding his physical condition during the consultation would typically be inadmissible in court.\n\nOption A suggests that the privilege is waived simply by filing a lawsuit, but this is not generally true. The attorney-client privilege can still apply even after a lawsuit is filed, depending on the specifics of the communication in question.\n\nOption B incorrectly states that there is no privilege of confidentiality when a third party is present at an attorney-client consultation. While the presence of a third party may affect the applicability of the privilege, it does not automatically negate it.\n\nOption D refers to a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment, which might relate to the application of the hearsay rule or the best evidence rule in court, but it does not directly address the issue of privilege. The key issue here is whether the attorney-client privilege applies to the communications in question, not whether the statement was for medical purposes."
