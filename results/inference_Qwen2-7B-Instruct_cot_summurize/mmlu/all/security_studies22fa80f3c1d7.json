The contention that liberal ideals like democracy, free enterprise, and civil rights are inherently Western was challenged. This perception suggested that these values might not universally resonate or be applicable across different cultures and societies, particularly those with distinct historical, cultural, and political backgrounds.\n\nB. The inconsistency and contradictions within liberalism became more apparent. Western nations often promoted liberal values abroad while sometimes applying them selectively or inconsistently, leading to criticism that their actions did not fully align with their rhetoric. This included concerns over double standards in applying human rights norms, for example, or supporting certain regimes for strategic reasons despite their lack of democratic credentials.\n\nC. The liberalist perspective struggled to articulate a clear strategy for spreading its values. The Arab Spring raised questions about how and when liberal principles should be introduced into non-liberal societies, and whether such an introduction would lead to stability or further unrest. There was also a debate about the role of external actors in promoting change versus allowing internal processes to unfold organically.\n\nThese challenges revealed that while liberalism remains a guiding principle for many Western policymakers, it faces significant practical and theoretical hurdles when applied in diverse global contexts."
