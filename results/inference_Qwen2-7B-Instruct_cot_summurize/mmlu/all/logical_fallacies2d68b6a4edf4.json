Fallacy of Division.\n\nThe Dean's statement suggests that the number of students on campus is one in a hundred, which would imply there is only one student on the campus. This conclusion does not logically follow from the premise given by the visitor's question. The fallacy of division occurs when someone assumes that what is true of a whole must be true of its parts. In this case, the Dean incorrectly applied this logic to infer the total number of students based on an unspecified fraction or percentage."
