Covert observation\n\nCovert observation, also known as hidden or secret observation, typically lacks informed consent because the participants are not aware that they are being observed. This method is often used in ethnography and sociology when studying behaviors and interactions in natural settings without influencing them. The lack of explicit consent can be justified under certain ethical guidelines for research on public behavior, but it still raises significant ethical concerns about privacy and autonomy."
