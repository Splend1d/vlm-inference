In periods of rising prices, the LIFO method results in a lower cost of sales and higher taxable income, when compared to the FIFO method.\n\nExplanation: \nWhen prices are rising, the Last-In, First-Out ( (LIFO) method leads to a lower cost of goods sold ( (COGS) and higher taxable income, as it assumes that the most recently purchased or manufactured items are sold first. This results in a higher profit margin, which increases taxable income. \n\nB. The taxpayer is required to receive permission each year from the Internal Revenue Service to continue the use of the LIFO method.\n\nExplanation:\nThis statement is incorrect. A corporation has the option to use the LIFO accounting method without needing annual permission from the IRS. However, there may be reporting requirements and considerations when switching methods.\n\nC. The LIFO method can be used for tax purposes even if the FIFO method is used for financial statement purposes.\n\nExplanation:\nThis statement is true. A company can use different inventory valuation methods for tax purposes and for financial reporting purposes. The choice depends on the company's strategic goals, tax implications, and accounting policies.\n\nD. Under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods.\n\nExplanation:\nThis statement is incorrect. Under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is considered to be made up of the most recently acquired goods, not the earliest ones. This means that during times of inflation, the ending inventory value will reflect the most recent, higher costs."
