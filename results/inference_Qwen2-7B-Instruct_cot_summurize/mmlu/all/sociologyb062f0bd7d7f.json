This implies that what was once considered abnormal or wrong is now seen as acceptable or even desirable.\n\nThe correct answer here would be:\n\nB. seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character\n\nThis choice suggests that initially, the act might have been viewed as unusual or out of place, but over time, it has become more accepted and integrated into the norms of the group or society. However, it's important to note that this does not make the act morally right or universally acceptable\u2014it merely indicates a shift in societal perception or acceptance.\n\nThe other options are not accurate in describing the normalization of a deviant act:\n- A: It does not necessarily mean that the act is recognized as breaking an important norm; rather, it is recognized as fitting within a new set of norms.\n- C: The normalization of a deviant act does not inherently mark the start of a \"deviant career\"; it's a shift in societal attitudes towards a specific behavior.\n- D: While genetics or anatomy might influence a person's behavior, attributing the normalization of a deviant act to these factors alone doesn't explain the broader social change in accepting such behavior."
