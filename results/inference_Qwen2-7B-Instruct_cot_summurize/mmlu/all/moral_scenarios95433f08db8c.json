Wrong, Wrong.\n\nScenario 1 involves the main character actively seeking out someone to harm or kidnap, which is clearly morally wrong and violates the principles of non-harm and respect for autonomy. This action goes against societal norms that emphasize personal safety, well-being, and the protection of individuals from harm.\n\nScenario 2 involves a situation where the main character intentionally puts another person in immediate danger by pushing them out of the way of an oncoming train. This action can be seen as morally wrong because it results in harm to the other individual and disregards the duty to prevent foreseeable harm to others. Moreover, it also potentially endangers the train passengers and crew, which adds to the severity of the moral wrongdoing.\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character involve intentional harm to others, which is generally considered morally unacceptable under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
