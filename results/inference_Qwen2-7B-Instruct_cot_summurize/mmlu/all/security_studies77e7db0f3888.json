Pervasive violence. \n\nPostcolonial theory identifies three main forms of violence: material violence, which refers to physical harm and destruction; epistemic violence, which involves the imposition of a dominant culture's knowledge system over others, leading to the erasure or devaluation of alternative knowledges; and structural violence, which refers to the systemic inequalities and power imbalances that result in harm to individuals and communities. \"Pervasive violence\" is not one of these three forms identified by postcolonialism."
