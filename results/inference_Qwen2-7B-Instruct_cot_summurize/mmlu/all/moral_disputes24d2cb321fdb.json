This alignss with the principle that each person has the right to self-ownership and the freedom to pursue their own well-being, subject to the condition that they do not harm others in doing so.\n\nGiven this context:\n\nA. This would still not justify drug prohibition. - This alignss with Huemer's view, suggesting that harm to others does not justify prohibition unless it directly violates the rights of those being harmed.\n\nB. This would justify drug prohibition. - Contrary to Huemer's stance, this option suggests that causing harm to others justifies prohibition, which Huemer would argue is not the case.\n\nC. This would only justify drug prohibition if drug use was extremely likely to cause these harms. - This option is somewhat nuanced but still leans towards justification, which goes against Huemer's core argument that prohibition should not be based solely on potential harm to others.\n\nD. This would only justify drug prohibition if drug use was more likely to cause these kinds of harms than other prohibited activity. - This option also leans towards a form of justification but conditions it on the comparative likelihood of harm. While it doesn't fully align with Huemer's views, it comes closest to reflectinging an interpretation where the prohibition might be considered under specific circumstances, which is still at odds with Huemer's primary argument that individuals should be responsible for their actions without external prohibition unless they directly infringe on others' rights.\n\nGiven the options provided, none of them perfectly align with Huemer's exact stance, which tends to reject prohibition based on the harm caused to others. However, among these choices, A. \"this would still not justify drug prohibition\" most closely aligns with Huemer's ethical framework."
