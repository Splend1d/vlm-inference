This includes those who designed the study, collected or analyzed data, contributed to writing the manuscript, or provided critical revisions. The order of authorship typically reflects the degree of contribution, with the primary investigator often listed first.\n\nIn this scenario, since the junior psychologist was involved in conducting the experiment, helping with data analysis, and contributing to the writing of the results, they should be listed as an author on the published paper. They should not be listed as the first author unless they had the primary responsibility for the study design, data collection, analysis, and writing. Instead, their name should appear in the list of authors in the order that reflects their level of contribution to the project."
