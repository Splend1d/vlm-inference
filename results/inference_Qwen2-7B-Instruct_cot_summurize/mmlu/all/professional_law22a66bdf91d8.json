Three weeks after the robbery, a defendant was arrested and charged with the crime. At trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant had previously committed a robbery wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the proffered evidence should be\n\nA. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed the crime as charged.\nB. admissible, to show the identity of the defendant.\nC. inadmissible, because the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nD. inadmissible, because it constitutes improper character evidence.\n"

The probative value of this evidence\u2014that is, its relevance to proving the defendant's guilt in the current case\u2014is limited, as the similarity in appearance does not necessarily correlate with the defendant committing the crime. Therefore, the court would likely rule that the potential for unfair prejudice to the defendant outweighs any probative value the evidence might have."
