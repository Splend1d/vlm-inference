Brent works nights, so he chooses to buy bread at 7 a.m. rather than at 7 p.m.\n\nThis situation is not an example of price discrimination because Brent is choosing to buy bread during a time when it might be offered at a lower price due to the store's pricing strategy ( (e.g., reduced prices on bread at the beginning of the day). The decision is based on personal preference and timing, not on different prices charged to different customers for the same product or service. \n\nPrice discrimination typically involves charging different prices to different groups of customers for the same good or service based on factors such as their willingness to pay, market segment, or other characteristics. Options B, C, and D all involve instances where different customers are being charged different prices for the same product or service."
