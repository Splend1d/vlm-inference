Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\nB. Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\nC. Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\nD. Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.\n"

Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\n\nThe period from 1450 to 1750 C.E. was marked by significant global interactions between Europe and Africa, particularly in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa. During this time, Europeans initiated a series of trading activities with African societies, which had profound impacts on the socio-political structures of these regions. One of the most notable outcomes of these interactions was the role of Europeans as suppliers of firearms to African states and kingdoms.\n\nFirearms, which were not widely available in Sub-Saharan Africa prior to European contact, became instrumental in the consolidation and expansion of African states. They enabled African rulers to maintain and expand their territories, defend against rival groups, and assert dominance over neighboring communities. The acquisition of firearms through trade with Europeans allowed African societies to engage in warfare on a larger scale and with greater effectiveness than before, contributing to the development of centralized political power and the establishment of new states and kingdoms.\n\nThus, option B accurately reflects the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans during this period. It highlights how the exchange of firearms played a crucial role in shaping the political landscape and territorial dynamics of the region."
