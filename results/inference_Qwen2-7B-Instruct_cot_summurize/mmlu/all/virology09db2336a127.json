Placebo effect.\n\nRandomization of study subjects in a clinical trial helps to control for the placebo effect by equally distributing any expectations or beliefs about the treatment among both the treatment and control groups. This ensures that the observed effects can be more confidently attributed to the treatment itself rather than to participants' expectations.\n\nOptions B, C, and D refer to issues that can occur within a study but are not directly controlled for by randomization:\n\n- B. Recall bias: This refers to errors in the recall of past events by participants. While randomization can help ensure that such biases are equally distributed across groups, it does not prevent them.\n- C. Non-compliance: This refers to participants not following the treatment protocol as prescribed. Randomization does not address non-compliance directly; it merely helps to distribute this issue evenly across treatment groups.\n- D. Effect modification (interaction: This occurs when the effect of one variable depends on the level of another variable. Randomization does not inherently control for effect modification, although it can help ensure that any observed interactions are not due to differences in baseline characteristics between groups."
