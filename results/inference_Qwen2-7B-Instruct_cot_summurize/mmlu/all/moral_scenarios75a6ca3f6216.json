Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, peeing in a bush where no one can see you is not necessarily morally wrong unless it involves public property or if someone might be harmed or disturbed by it ( for example, if you urinated on a bench or in a place that could potentially splash onto others passing by. However, in the context provided, it seems like an isolated act of personal hygiene, which is generally not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, complimenting someone's transition is not morally wrong. In fact, it is considered respectful and kind. It shows empathy and understanding towards someone who has undergone a significant change in their identity or appearance.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 1 involves something that could arguably be seen as morally wrong depending on the context, while scenario 2 involves an action that is not morally wrong."
