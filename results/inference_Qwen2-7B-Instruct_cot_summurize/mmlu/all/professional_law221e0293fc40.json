That evening, the buyer was preparing dinner and poured himself a glass of milk from the container purchased at the market. He then sat down to eat his meal and proceeded to take a mouthful of milk. As he did so, the buyer felt something furry lodge in his mouth. He immediately spat out the furry object and saw that it was a dead mouse. The buyer suffered severe emotional distress but did not suffer any physical illness or injury. If the buyer asserts a claim against the dairy based on negligent manufacturing, he will most likely\n\nA. recover, because he suffered severe emotional distress.\nB. recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nC. not recover, because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.\nD. not recover, because the buyer's proper cause of action is for intentional infliction of mental distress.\n"

It essentially shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to show that they were not negligent. This doctrine applies when the accident is of a type that does not usually occur without negligence, and there is no explanation for the accident other than negligence.\n\nIn this scenario, finding a dead mouse in a sealed milk container is an unusual occurrence that suggests negligence in the manufacturing process. The presence of the mouse implies a significant deviation from the expected quality control standards, which would be hard for the dairy to explain away without admitting negligence. Therefore, the buyer might be able to recover under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, assuming other legal requirements like jurisdictional laws are met.\n\nPlease note that actual legal outcomes can vary significantly based on specific circumstances and applicable laws, and this response provides a general understanding based on the given information."
