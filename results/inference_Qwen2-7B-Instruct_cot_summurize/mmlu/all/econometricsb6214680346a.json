In fact, the linear probability model (LPM) is relatively simple to estimate using ordinary least squares (OLS) as it does not require any special estimation techniques compared to other regression models with continuous dependent variables. The estimation process is straightforward and relies on the same methods used for estimating standard linear regression models.\n\nA, B, and C are true statements about the LPM:\n\nA. There is nothing in the model to ensure that the estimated probabilities lie between zero and one: This is correct because OLS can produce predicted probabilities outside the [0,1] range, which doesn't make sense in the context of probability interpretation.\n\nB. Even if the probabilities are truncated at zero and one, there will probably be many observations for which the probability is either exactly zero or exactly one: This is also correct because when the predicted values are adjusted to fall within the [0,1] range, the LPM may still produce very low or very high probabilities that are close to but not exactly equal to zero or one, respectively.\n\nC. The error terms will be heteroscedastic and not normally distributed: This is accurate because the LPM assumes that errors are homoscedastic and normally distributed, which is often violated in practice due to the bounded nature of the dependent variable (probability. Heteroscedasticity occurs because the variance of the error term is not constant across different levels of the independent variables, and the non-normal distribution arises from the bounded nature of the dependent variable."
