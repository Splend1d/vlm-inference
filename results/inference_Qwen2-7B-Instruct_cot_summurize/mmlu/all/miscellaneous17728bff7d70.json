However, probes and orbiters have been sent to study Jupiter, such as the Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and the Juno mission. Landing on Jupiter is not feasible due to its dense atmosphere and lack of a solid surface. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nA. Venus - NASA's Venera 7 and 9 missions successfully landed on Venus in the 1970s.\n\nB. Mars - Numerous spacecraft have landed on Mars, including the Soviet Mars 3, NASA's Viking 1 and 2, Mars Pathfinder, and more recent missions like the InSight lander and the Perseverance rover.\n\nC. The Moon - A total of 12 manned Apollo missions successfully landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972. Additionally, several robotic spacecraft have also landed on the Moon, including Luna 9, Surveyor 3, and more recently by China's Chang'e missions."
