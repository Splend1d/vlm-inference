Early specialization and consistent training can lead to better skill development, physical conditioning, and peak performance at critical stages of athletic development. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that improvements also come from advancements in sports science, technology ( (such as equipment and clothing), nutrition, coaching techniques, and access to training facilities. Additionally, increased visibility, support, and opportunities for female athletes through sponsorships, media coverage, and policy changes have also played significant roles in enhancing their performances."
