Less than the block\u2019s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gravitational potential energy was converted both to thermal energy and to kinetic energy.\n\nWhen an object slides down a rough incline, some of its initial gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it moves. However, not all of the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Some of it is lost to the environment as heat due to friction between the object and the surface of the incline. This means that the total mechanical energy ( which includes both kinetic and potential energy - decreases over time. \n\nTherefore, by the time the object reaches the bottom of the incline, its kinetic energy will be less than the initial gravitational potential energy it had at the top, accounting for the energy lost to friction."
