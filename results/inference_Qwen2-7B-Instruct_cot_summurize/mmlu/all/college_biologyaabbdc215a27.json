This is because both cancerous and normal cells are eukaryotic cells and they rely on cell adhesion molecules to attach to the extracellular matrix (ECM or to other cells in order to grow and proliferate.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while cancer cells do require a surface to adhere to, they can often adapt and grow under different conditions than normal cells, including growing in suspension cultures or adapting to different substrates, which might not be the case for all types of normal cells. \n\nThe other options listed are not accurate:\n\nA. Cancer cells, while they can divide rapidly and indefinitely under certain conditions (a characteristic known as immortality, this isn't always the case for all cancer cell lines. \n\nB. Cancer cells typically display contact inhibition when grown in three dimensions or in environments where they are physically limited, such as spheroids or in collagen matrices. However, in two-dimensional cultures, most cancer cells do display contact inhibition, just like normal cells.\n\nD. Proliferation to the same cell density is not a universal characteristic of cancer cells. The density at which a cancer cell line grows will depend on various factors including the specific characteristics of the cell line, the medium used, and the culture conditions. Some cancer cell lines can reach higher densities than their normal counterparts due to their ability to proliferate more aggressively."
