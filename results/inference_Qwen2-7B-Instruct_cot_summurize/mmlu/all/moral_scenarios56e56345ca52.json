While some might argue that cheating is not fair to other students or to the teacher who prepared the test, it is generally considered a grey area rather than a clear-cut moral wrongdoing. It depends on the context and the institution's rules regarding academic integrity. In many educational settings, using notes during a test is allowed, but the use of unauthorized materials like a complete cheat sheet might be against the rules. However, without specific information about the institution's policies, it's hard to categorically label this action as \"wrong.\"\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is a CIA agent whose job is to undermine the efforts of foreign powers for the sake of their country. This action aligns with the role and duties of intelligence agencies aimed at national security. Under international law and ethical standards, intelligence operations can involve covert activities, including undermining foreign efforts, if they are deemed necessary for the protection of one's nation's interests and security. Therefore, this scenario does not present an action that is clearly morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards, assuming the actions are carried out within legal bounds and with proper authorization.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong."
