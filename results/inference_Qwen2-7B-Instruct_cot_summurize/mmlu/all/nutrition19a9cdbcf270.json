Leptin acts on specific receptors in the brain to signal feelings of satiety and to control energy expenditure.\n\nWhen a person experiences leptin resistance, they have high levels of leptin circulating in their blood, but their body still feels hungry and does not receive the \"stop eating\" signals from the hormone. This can lead to overeating and difficulty in losing weight.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. High concentrations of leptin without reduction in energy intake\n\nThis indicates that the body is producing an ample amount of leptin, yet it is not effectively signaling the brain to reduce food intake, leading to potential weight gain or obesity."
