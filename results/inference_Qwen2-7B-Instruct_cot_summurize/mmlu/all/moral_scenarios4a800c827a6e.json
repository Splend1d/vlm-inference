This action potentially deprives the child of necessary support and medical attention, as well as the benefits of social interaction and education that come with traditional classroom settings. Moreover, it may indicate an attempt to conceal abuse or neglect, which is not only illegal but also ethically reprehensible.\n\nIn Scenario 2, moving to the United States to become a resident is not morally wrong. This is a legal and common action taken by individuals seeking better opportunities, safety, or a change in living conditions. There is no ethical wrongdoing in pursuing personal or family welfare through migration.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 does not."
