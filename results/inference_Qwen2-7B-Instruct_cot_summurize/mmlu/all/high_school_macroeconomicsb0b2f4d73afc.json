Increases aggregate demand which increases real GDP and increases employment. \n\nExpansionary monetary policy typically involves actions such as lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply. These actions aim to lower borrowing costs, encourage spending, and stimulate economic activity. By increasing aggregate demand, it can lead to higher levels of production (real GDP) and more job creation, as businesses respond to increased demand by hiring more workers."
