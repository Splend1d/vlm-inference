However, since our relation only contains pairs of the form \\((x, x)\\), it trivially satisfies this condition because there's no way to have a pair where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are are not equal.\n\n- **Anti-symmetric**: This property holds if for all \\(a, b\\) in the set, if \\((a, b)\\) and \\((b, a)\\) are in the relation, then \\(a = b\\). Our relation only contains self-pairs \\((x, x)\\), which trivially satisfy this condition as they are inherently equal.\n\n- **Equivalence Relation**: An equivalence relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Reflexivity is satisfied because for every element \\(x\\) in \\(A\\), the pair \\((x, x)\\) is in \\(S\\). Symmetry and transitivity are already shown to hold.\n\nGiven these points, the relation \\(S\\) is **both symmetric and anti-symmetric**, so the correct answer is:\n\n**C. both symmetric and anti-symmetric**"
