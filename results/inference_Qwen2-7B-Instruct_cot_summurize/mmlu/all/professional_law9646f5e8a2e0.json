The cab driver recognized the passenger as a former girlfriend, and the passenger invited him into her house when they arrived. Unknown to the cab driver, the passenger was an undercover police officer who worked in the sex crimes unit. When they were inside the passenger's house, the cab driver made sexual advances toward the passenger, who responded by kissing him and holding his hand. The cab driver was about to kiss the passenger again, when she got up to answer the phone in the kitchen.

However, based on the information provided, none of the options A through D seem to fit perfectly without additional context.\n\nOption B ( \"not guilty, solely because he was entrapped\" might suggest that the passenger's actions were designed to entrap the cab driver, which could potentially be a defense if proven, but it doesn't seem to be supported by the given scenario where the passenger is an undercover police officer.\n\nOption C \"not guilty, if he raises the proper alibi defense\" implies that the cab driver has an alibi for the time in question, which is not mentioned in the scenario.\n\nOption D \"not guilty, if he was predisposed to commit the crime\" suggests that the cab driver had a pre-existing inclination or predisposition to commit such a crime, which also isn't clearly indicated.\n\nGiven the scenario:\n\n- The cab driver recognized the passenger as a former girlfriend, suggesting a level of familiarity and possibly a basis for trust.\n- The passenger, being an undercover police officer, responds to the cab driver's sexual advances, which complicates the situation.\n- The passenger then gets up to answer the phone, providing a momentary opportunity for the cab driver to act.\n\nWithout further details, it's difficult to conclusively determine the best course of action. However, the fact that the passenger is an undercover officer working in the sex crimes unit does raise questions about the nature of the encounter and whether the cab driver's actions were influenced by the officer's role or if he had a genuine intention to commit a crime. \n\nIn general, the defense of \"entrapment\" would likely be considered if the police officer induced the cab driver to commit a crime he otherwise would not have committed. The defense of \"predisposition\" might apply if the cab driver had a prior inclination to commit the crime. An alibi would be relevant if the cab driver can prove he was elsewhere at the time of the alleged crime.\n\nGiven these considerations, none of the options A-D directly address the legal issues without additional information. In a real-world scenario, the cab driver would need legal representation to present any defenses that might be available based on the specifics of his actions, the officer's conduct, and applicable laws regarding consent, entrapment, and predisposition."
