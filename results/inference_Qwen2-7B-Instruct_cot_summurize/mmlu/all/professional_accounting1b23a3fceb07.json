Since the entire amount ($250,000) was has been drawn, this will be listed as a current liability.\n\n**Secured Note:**\n- This note is due in five annual installments. As of December 31, year 2, none of these installments have matured, so the entire amount ($750,000) remains a long-term liability.\n\n**Balloon Note:**\n- This note matures in three years. Since it does not mature within the next fiscal year, it is considered a long-term liability.\n\nGiven this categorization:\n\n- **Current Liabilities:** The line of credit of $250,000.\n- **Long-Term Liabilities:** The secured note of $750,000 plus the balloon note of $300,000, totaling $1,050,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
