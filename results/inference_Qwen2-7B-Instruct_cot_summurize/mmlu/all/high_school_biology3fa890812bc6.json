The trait for gray is epistatic over the traits for black and white.\n\nEpistasis refers to a situation where one gene masks the expression of another gene. In this case, since both parents have a gray phenotype (which is likely due to the dominant allele for gray, and their offspring exhibit a range of other colors, it suggests that the gray trait is masking the expression of the black and white traits. This means that the presence of the gray allele suppresses the expression of the black or white alleles, resulting in the observed phenotypic variation when these genes interact."
