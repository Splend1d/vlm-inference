Gross error. \n\nGross errors, also known as blunders, are typically the result of human mistakes and can be considered as significant errors that should not occur under normal circumstances. These could include misreading instruments, incorrect data entry, or making a simple mistake in calculations. They are often unpredictable and do not follow any specific pattern.\n\nWhile all the options you provided can involve human error to some extent:\n\nB. Instrumental error involves inaccuracies due to flaws in equipment or tools used for measurements. This is not strictly a human mistake, but rather an issue with the instrument itself.\n\nC. Observational error can be influenced by human judgment, such as misinterpreting visual data or subjective assessment, but it's also related to the process of observation rather than just human error.\n\nD. Systematic error refers to consistent biases in measurements that can be due to flawed procedures, equipment, or environmental factors. While these can sometimes be traced back to human actions, they are not solely a product of human mistakes but can also stem from systematic issues within a system or process.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, \"gross error\" ( option A, best fits as the category of errors mainly caused by human mistakes."
