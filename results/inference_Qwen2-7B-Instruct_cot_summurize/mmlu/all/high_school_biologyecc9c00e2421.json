Well-adapted individuals leave more offspring, and thus contribute more to the next generation's gene pool, than do poorly adapted individuals.\n\nNatural selection is the process by which certain heritable traits become more or less common in a population because they affect an individual's ability to survive and reproduce. This happens when individuals with advantageous traits are tend to have more offspring, passing those traits on to the next generation. Over time, this can lead to significant changes in a population, potentially resulting in new species. \n\nOption A is incorrect because adaptations may not be beneficial in all habitats; for example, adaptations that are advantageous in a desert environment might not be beneficial in a rainforest.\n\nOption B is incorrect because different species adapting to the same habitat will not undergo the same genetic changes; rather, each species will evolve its own unique adaptations suited to their specific characteristics and evolutionary history.\n\nOption C is incorrect because what was once beneficial might no longer be so in changing environments. For example, in an environment where food sources change over time, an adaptation that was once beneficial might become detrimental if it limits the individual's ability to exploit new food sources."
