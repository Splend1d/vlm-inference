Convenience products are typically non-durable goods or services that consumers often purchase with little pre-purchase thought or consideration. \n\nImpulse products are items that are bought spontaneously, often in the spur of the moment, usually at checkout areas in stores or online platforms. These can include things like candy, magazines, or small personal care items.\n\nConvenience products are those that are frequently purchased by consumers as part of their regular shopping routines, often without much thought or comparison shopping. They are generally low-cost items such as groceries, toiletries, or household supplies that consumers buy frequently because they are easily accessible and meet their immediate needs. \n\nOn the other hand, B. Manufacturer products typically refer to branded items produced by a specific manufacturer and may not necessarily be considered non-durable goods or services unless they fall into categories such as electronics, clothing, or similar items which can be replaced frequently. \n\nD. Luxury products, while often purchased with more consideration due to their high cost and premium status, can also sometimes be bought impulsively if there is a strong emotional connection or desire for the item. However, the term \"luxury\" often implies higher value and longer-lasting nature of the product compared to convenience or impulse items, so it's not strictly categorized as non-durable goods or services."
