Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?\n\nA. Infraspinatus\nB. Pectoralis\nC. Subscapularis\nD. Supraspinatus\n"

Supraspinatus.\n\nThe supraspinatus tendon is particularly prone to injury during activities that involve overhead reaching, such as chopping wood. The patient's symptoms, including pain reproducing with external rotation of the shoulder and lack of weakness, suggest an impingement syndrome or a rotator cuff injury, potentially involving the supraspinatus tendon. \n\nInfraspinatus (A), pectoralis major (B), subscapularis (C), and teres minor are less likely to be involved based on the symptoms provided. Infraspinatus and teres minor are located in the posterior aspect of the shoulder and are not directly affected by external rotation movements. The pectoralis major is a chest muscle that does not have a direct connection to the shoulder joint, and subscapularis is a part of the rotator cuff but its primary function is adduction, not external rotation."
