Although the state provides both sexes with equal pay and benefits, the state has adopted a policy that prohibits the assignment of female officers to its special undercover narcotics division. This is a moderate risk position that sometimes involves violent encounters with drug dealers. Since the special narcotics division was first established, five undercover agents have been killed in the line of duty. It is because of the state's concern with the safety and well-being of its female officers that it has adopted such a policy. The woman, who desired to be a member of the narcotics division, filed an application for assignment as a special drug agent. After she was rejected for the position, the woman sued the state in federal court to enjoin enforcement of its stated policy on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following results in this suit is most appropriate?\n\nA. Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.\nB. Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender.\nC. Judgment for the state, because it is within a state's police power to insulate the terms and conditions of governmental employment.\nD. Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials.\n"

Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.\n\nThis case would likely fall under the scrutiny of gender discrimination laws and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the United States Constitution. The state's policy of prohibiting female officers from serving in the special undercover narcotics division would need to be justified by a compelling state interest and must be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. \n\nIn this scenario, the state argues that the policy is necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of female officers. However, the policy must still meet legal standards. The Supreme Court has held that policies that classify based on gender can be upheld if they are substantially related to an important governmental objective. In other words, the state must show that there is a direct relationship between the gender classification and the goal it aims to achieve.\n\nIn this case, the state's argument that the policy is necessary to protect the safety and well-being of female officers might not be enough to justify the gender-based classification if there is no empirical evidence showing that women are more vulnerable than men in these circumstances. Moreover, the state should also consider alternative measures that could achieve the same goal without resorting to gender-based classification.\n\nTherefore, if the state fails to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating that the policy is substantially related to an important state interest, a court would likely rule in favor of the woman, finding that the policy violates her right to equal protection under the law."
