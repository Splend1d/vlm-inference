A permutation can be composed of multiple disjoint cycles, not just a single cycle. For example, the permutation ( (1 2)(3 4) consists of two disjoint cycles but is still considered a permutation.\n  \n- **Statement 2**: \"Every cycle is a permutation.\" This statement is true. By definition, a cycle is a specific type of permutation. In group theory, particularly in the study of symmetric groups, a cycle refers to a permutation that maps each element to the next one in a sequence, wrapping around to the beginning of the sequence, and fixing all other elements. Since every cycle rearranges the elements of a set in a bijective manner ( preserving the property that each element is mapped to exactly one other element, it fits the definition of a permutation."
