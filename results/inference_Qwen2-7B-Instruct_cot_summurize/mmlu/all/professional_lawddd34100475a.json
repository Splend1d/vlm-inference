In 1980, the businessman conveyed the land to the state \"on the condition that\" it be used as recreational property only. Two years later, the state decided that they wanted a small industrial park attached to the corner of the land. The state went ahead and developed a small portion of the land as industrial space, making it part of a larger industrial park that was adjacent to the land. The businessman notified the state that he was the owner of the property because the state violated the conditions of the conveyance, and that he was taking possession of the property back. What was the interest that was created by the conveyance and can the businessman get the property back?\n\nA. The interest created is a reverter, and the property instantly reverts back to the grantor upon the occurrence of the specified violation.\nB. The interest created is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the original owner can get the property back only by taking affirmative steps to exercise his right of entry.\nC. The interest is a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, and if the condition occurs the property reverts in fee simple to a pre-designated third party.\nD. The interest created is an indefeasible estate, and the owner cannot do anything to enforce a condition that is against public policy and never enforceable in the first place.\n"

                    "text": "The interest that was created by the conveyance in this scenario is most likely a **fee simple subject to a condition subsequent** ( (Option B). This type of interest means that the property was initially granted to the state with a condition that must be met for the property to remain theirs. If the state fails to adhere to the condition (in this case, using the land exclusively for recreational purposes), the original owner (the businessman) has the right to reclaim the property. \n\nTo reclaim the property, the businessman would need to take affirmative steps to exercise his right of entry. This might involve legal action to formally rescind the conveyance or seek a court order to have the property returned to him. \n\nOptions A, C, and D are not entirely accurate based on the information provided:\n\n- Option A suggests a reverter, which typically happens when a specific event occurs and the property automatically returns to the original owner. However, the condition mentioned here ( \"it be used as recreational property only\" - does not specify what would trigger a reversion, unlike a typical reverter clause.\n  \n- Option C mentions a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, which implies that there's a condition that must occur before the property reverts to another party, not the original owner. It doesn't fit the scenario where the original owner is seeking to reclaim their property.\n  \n- Option D states that the interest created is an indefeasible estate, which means the property ownership is secure and not subject to loss through any legal action initiated by others. However, since the condition was explicitly stated in the conveyance, the businessman has the right to reclaim the property if the condition is violated.\n\nTherefore, the businessman would need to take legal action to reclaim the property under the terms of a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent."
