Rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 2(pH) - pK_a \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 2(4.26) - pK_a \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 8.52 - pK_a \\]\n\nWe know that at equilibrium, the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are related to the initial concentration of the acid and the degree of dissociation. For a weak acid, let's denote the degree of dissociation as \\( x \\), such that:\n\n\\[ [HA] = [HA]_0 - x = 0.0025 - x \\]\n\\[ [A^-] = x \\]\n\nThe total volume is 0.250 L, so:\n\n\\[ [HA] = \\frac{0.0025 - x}{0.250} \\]\n\\[ [A^-] = \\frac{x}{0.250} \\]\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into our log equation:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}\\frac{\\frac{x}{0.250}}{\\frac{0.0025 - x}{0.250}} = 8.52 - pK_a \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}\\frac{x}{0.0025 - x} = 8.52 - pK_a \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) is very small compared to 0.0025, we can approximate \\( 0.0025 - x \\approx 0.0025 \\):\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}\\frac{x}{0.0025} = 8.52 - pK_a \\]\n\nUsing properties of logarithms:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}x - \\log_{10}0.0025 = 8.52 - pK_a \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}x = 8.52 - pK_a + \\log_{10}0.0025 \\]\n\nSince \\( \\log_{10}0.0025 = \\log_{10}(2.5*10^{-3}) = \\log_{10}(2.5) + \\log_{10}(10^{-3}) = \\log_{10}(2.5) - 3 \\), \n\nand knowing that \\( \\log_{10}(2.5) \\approx 0.398 \\),\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}x = 8.52 - pK_a + (\\log_{10}(2.5) - 3) \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}x = 8.52 - pK_a + 0.398 - 3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}x = 5.918 - pK_a \\]\n\nSince \\( \\log_{10}x = -pK_a + \\log_{10}[HA]_0 \\), where \\( [HA]_0 = 0.0025 M \\),\n\n\\[ -pK_a + \\log_{10}(0.0025) = 5.918 - pK_a \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(0.0025) = 5.918 \\]\n\n\\[ -3 = 5.918 \\]\n\nThis doesn't make sense since we're trying to find \\( pK_a \\), not confirming the values. Let's correct the approach:\n\nFrom the equation derived earlier, we should have directly solved for \\( pK_a \\) without assuming \\( 0.0025 - x \\approx 0.0025 \\) for finding \\( x \\) first.\n\nLet's correct the process:\n\n\\[ \\log_{1}\\frac{x}{0.00"
