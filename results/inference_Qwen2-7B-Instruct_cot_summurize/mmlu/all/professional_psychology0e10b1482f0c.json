These guidelines outline what activities fall under the umbrella of \"psychological services\". The activities include:\n\nB. Program development: This involves designing and implementing interventions, programs, or services aimed at addressing specific psychological needs or issues.\n\nC. Consultation related to assessment and intervention: This includes providing expert advice to other professionals or organizations on how to assess and intervene with individuals based on psychological principles.\n\nD. Supervision of psychological services: This refers to overseeing the work of trainees or less experienced practitioners, ensuring they are applying psychological theories and techniques appropriately.\n\nHowever, the conduct of scientific research, while being an integral part of psychology, is not typically considered as \"psychological services\" provided directly to clients. It usually falls under academic or research contexts rather than service delivery to individual clients. Therefore, it is the exception in this context."
