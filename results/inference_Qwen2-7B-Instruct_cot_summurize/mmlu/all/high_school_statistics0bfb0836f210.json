                    "text": "To calculate the probability that a jury of 12 selected at random from the pool contains at least three women when 30% of the potential jurors are women, we can use the binomial distribution formula. The binomial distribution is used when there are two possible outcomes (success or failure) and a fixed number of trials.\n\nThe formula for the binomial distribution is:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (q^{n-k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials ( (in this case, 12),\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successes ( (we want at least 3 women, so we'll calculate for 3, 4, ..., 12 women),\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial ( (30% or 0.3),\n- \\( q \\) is the probability of failure on a single trial = \\( 1 - p \\) ( (70% or 0.7),\n- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient, which calculates the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) successes out of \\( n \\) trials.\n\nSince we're looking for the probability of having at least three women, we need to calculate the probabilities for exactly 3, 4, ..., 12 women and sum them up.\n\nHowever, it's often easier to calculate the complementary probability\u2014that is, the probability of having less than three women ( and subtracting that from 1.\n\nSo, let's calculate the probability of having 0, 1, or 2 women and subtract that from 1 to find the probability of having at least three women.\n\n\\[ P(X \\geq 3) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)] \\]\n\nLet's calculate each of these probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(X = 0) = \\binom{12}{0} (0.3^0 (0.7^{12} \\]\n\\[ P(X = 1) = \\binom{12}{1} (0.3^1 (0.7^{11} \\]\n\\[ P(X = 2) = \\binom{12}{2} (0.3^2 (0.7^{10}) \\]\n\nCalculating these:\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{0} = 1 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 0) = 1 \\times 0.3^0 \\times 0.7^{12} = 0.00138412872 \\]\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{1} = 12 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 1) = 12 \\times 0.3^1 \\times 0.7^{11} = 12 \\times 0.3 \\times 0.00351564322 = 0.01265524232 \\]\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{2} = 66 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 2) = 66 \\times 0.3^2 \\times 0.7^{10} = 66 \\times 0.09 \\times 0.0282475249 = 0.18522183756 \\]\n\nNow, summing these probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 0.00138412872 + 0.01265524232 + 0.18522183756 \\]\n\n\\[ P(X < 3) = 0.2090612086 \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ P(X \\geq 3) = 1 - P(X < 3) = 1 - 0.2090212086 = 0.7909787914 \\]\n\nIt seems there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the provided options. Based on the calculation, the probability that the jury of 12 selected at random contains at least three women is approximately 0.791, which isn't listed among your options (A, B, C, or D. \n\nGiven the calculations, the closest option to our result might have been misunderstood in transcription or interpretation. However, none of the provided choices match the calculated probability accurately based on the calculation process detailed here."
