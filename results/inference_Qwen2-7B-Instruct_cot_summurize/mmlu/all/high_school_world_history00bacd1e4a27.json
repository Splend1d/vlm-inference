Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states.\nB. Victories against outsiders provided slaves whose labor sustained agricultural systems.\nC. Victories against outsiders demonstrated the power of divinities over other gods.\nD.

Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states.\n\nThis answer choice aligns best with the context of the passage, which describes the ruler's military achievements and how they were appreciated by the leader of Syria. The victories likely bolstered the military's and the ruler's own status and legitimacy, suggesting that such feats were crucial for establishing or maintaining power. The other options do not directly reflect the political significance of these conflicts as described in the passage."
