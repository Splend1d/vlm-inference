The couple operated a shoe store on the first floor of the building for many years. When the couple purchased the building, the area was predominantly rural and was zoned for nonresidential use. The municipality's zoning is cumulative. cumulative. Five years ago, the municipality rezoned the area to single-family residential use. The daughter was not aware of this change, since she was away at college. Recently, the daughter inherited the building from her parents. The daughter immediately moved into the apartment and took over the operation of the shoe store on the first floor. The daughter has learned that a developer is planning to build a large residential community in the area surrounding her building. The daughter has asked her lawyer for advice regarding her ability to continue operating the shoe store. Should the lawyer advise the daughter that she can continue to operate her shoe store?\n\nA. No, because the nonconforming use of the building terminated when the daughter's parents died.\nB. No, but the municipality must pay her reasonable compensation for her loss resulting from the change in zoning.\nC. Yes, because the shoe store is a nonconforming use.\nD. Yes, because the zoning is cumulative and the building is also used for single-family residential purposes.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Yes, because the shoe store is a nonconforming use.\n\nIn zoning law, a nonconforming use refers to a use of property that is lawful at the time it is established but does not comply with the current zoning regulations. When a property changes hands, if it contains a nonconforming use, that use may be allowed to continue under certain conditions. The specifics of these conditions vary by jurisdiction, but generally, a nonconforming use can continue as long as it is maintained and not expanded upon. \n\nGiven that the daughter inherited the building and is continuing the operation of the shoe store on the first floor, which was already a nonconforming use when the area was zoned for nonresidential use, she should be able to continue operating the store unless local law specifically states otherwise or there are other specific restrictions that apply. The fact that the area has been rezoned to residential use five years ago does not automatically terminate the nonconforming use, provided that the store continues to operate in compliance with its original nonconforming status.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest that the nonconforming use would be terminated upon inheriting the property or that the municipality would have to pay compensation for any loss resulting from the rezoning, neither of which are typically required under standard zoning laws concerning nonconforming uses.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it incorrectly combines two unrelated concepts: the nature of the zoning (which is cumulative in this case, meaning that both residential and commercial uses can coexist in the same zone, and the fact that the building is also used for single-family residential purposes. The key issue here is the nonconforming use, not whether the zoning is cumulative or how residential uses might interact with non-residential ones."
