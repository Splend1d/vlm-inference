Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery.\n\nExplanation: In the scenario described, Donny's action of throwing a knife at Sally, with the intent to injure her, constitutes an act that would likely be considered assault under the law. Assault typically involves the unlawful attempt or threat to cause immediate harmful or offensive contact to another person. Even if the knife did not actually hit Sally, the near miss created a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm, which is sufficient for an assault claim.\n\nBattery, on the other hand, requires actual physical contact between the actor and the victim. Since the knife did not touch Sally, the element of battery is not met in this situation.\n\nTherefore, Donny would likely be held liable for assault but not for battery."
