Moore, the most fundamental question in ethics is how we define the concept of \"good.\" He argued that \"good\" cannot be reduced to any set of descriptive or causal properties, and that it must be understood as a non-empirical, non-naturalistic quality that stands as the ultimate standard of value. This idea is known as \"moral realism\" or \"non-naturalism,\" and it has had a significant influence on ethical theory."
