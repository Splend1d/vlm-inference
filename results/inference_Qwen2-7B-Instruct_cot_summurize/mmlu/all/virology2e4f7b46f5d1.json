This vaccine is used to prevent yellow fever, a disease caused by the yellow fever virus which is transmitted by infected mosquitoes.\n\nThe process for creating this vaccine involves passing the yellow fever virus through a series of mammalian cell cultures in a laboratory. Each passage reduces the virulence ( or harmfulness of the virus, making it less able to cause disease but still capable of stimulating an immune response in the vaccinated individual. After several passages, the virus becomes sufficiently weakened that it cannot cause illness in humans, yet it can still elicit a strong immune response, providing protection against the actual, more dangerous strain of the virus.\n\nThe YF vaccine is typically administered via injection and is highly effective at preventing severe disease if exposure to the virus occurs. It is recommended for travelers to areas where yellow fever is endemic and is sometimes required for entry into certain countries."
