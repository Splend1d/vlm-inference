If a blood unit has been out of refrigeration for too long, it cannot simply be refrigerated again and used; it must be returned to the blood bank for assessment. The reason for this is that there may be changes in the blood components or potential contamination that cannot be detected by simple visual inspection. The blood bank will have protocols in place for assessing whether the unit can still be used safely. \n\nTransfusing the blood without proper assessment could lead to serious health risks for the patient, such as infection or allergic reactions. Therefore, it's important to document the issue and communicate it to the appropriate authority, which in this case is the blood bank."
