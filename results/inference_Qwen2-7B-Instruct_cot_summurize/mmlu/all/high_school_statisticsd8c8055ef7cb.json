Let's correct this:\n\nGiven:\n\\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB)\\]\n\nWe rearrange to solve for \\(P(B)\\):\n\\[P(B) = P(A \\cup B) + P(AB) - P(A)\\]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\\[P(B) = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.6\\]\n\n\\[P(B) = 0.9 - 0.6 = 0.3\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is **0.3**, which corresponds to option **B**."
