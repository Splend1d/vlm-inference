Transpiration is the process by which water is transferred in the form of vapor from the leaves of plants to the atmosphere. It is primarily driven by the difference in vapor pressure between the leaf interior and the external environment. \n\n- A. High temperature generally increases the rate of transpiration because higher temperatures can lead to greater internal vapor pressure, encouraging more water to evaporate from the leaves.\n  \n- C. Low relative humidity also increases transpiration because the air has less water vapor content, leading to a larger vapor pressure difference between the leaf and the air, which drives the evaporation of water from the leaf surface.\n\n- D. Wind increases transpiration by enhancing the removal of water vapor from the leaf surface, which reduces the vapor pressure gradient and thus helps in maintaining the transpiration rate.\n\nTherefore, high relative humidity actually decreases the rate of transpiration because it reduces the vapor pressure difference necessary for water vapor to escape from the plant's leaves."
