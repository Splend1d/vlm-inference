Therefore, bolometric luminosity is the total amount of energy emitted by a celestial object per unit time across the entire spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, from radio waves to gamma rays. This gives astronomers a comprehensive measure of the intrinsic brightness of an object as it would appear if there were no intervening media affecting its light, such as the Earth's atmosphere or interstellar dust."
