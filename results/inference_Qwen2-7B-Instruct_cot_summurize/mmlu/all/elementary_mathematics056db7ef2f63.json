Negative numbers are have less value than positive numbers, so among them, the larger the absolute value, the smaller the number. \n\nLet's look at option A:\n\n-9, -6 ( (which is -6 or -6), -3, 7, 11\n\n-9 is the most negative number, so it comes first. Then, -6 ( which is the second most negative number, comes next. After that, -3, then 7, and finally 11, which is the largest number. \n\nThis arrangement follows the rule of least to greatest correctly."
