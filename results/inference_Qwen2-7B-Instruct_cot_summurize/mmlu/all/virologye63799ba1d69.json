However, if we consider the scale and impact globally, SARS ( Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, was more widespread and deadly when it emerged in 2002-2003. Both MERS ( Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which emerged in 2012, and SARS have been categorized as 'emergent' viruses due to their novel nature and significant health impact.\n\nOn the other hand, C. OC43 and D. HKU1 are are considered common cold coronaviruses that are not typically associated with severe emergent disease patterns. They are part of the group of coronaviruses that commonly cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses. \n\nPlease note that the global health situation is dynamic, and the classification of viruses might change based on the current data and understanding.
