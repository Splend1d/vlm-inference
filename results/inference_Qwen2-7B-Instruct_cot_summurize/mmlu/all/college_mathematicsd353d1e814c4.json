                    "text": "To determine which of these options is not a group, we need to recall the definition of a group in mathematics. A group consists of a set equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions are met:\n\n1. **Closure**: For all elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the group, the result of the operation \\(a \\cdot b\\) is also in the group.\n2. **Associativity**: For all elements \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in the group, \\((a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot ( (b \\cdot c)\\).\n3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element \\(e\\) in the group such that for every element \\(a\\) in the group, \\(e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a\\).\n4. **Inverse Element**: For each element \\(a\\) in the group, there exists an element \\(b\\) in the group such that \\(a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A. The integers under addition**\n- Closure: Adding any two integers results in another integer.\n- Associativity: Addition of integers is associative.\n- Identity Element: 0 is the identity element because adding 0 to any integer does not change its value.\n- Inverse Element: For any integer \\(n\\), there exists \\(-n\\) such that \\(n + (-n) = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the integers under addition satisfy all group properties.\n\n**B. The nonzero integers under multiplication**\n- Closure: Multiplying any two nonzero integers results in another nonzero integer.\n- Associativity: Multiplication of integers is associative.\n- Identity Element: 1 is the identity element because multiplying any nonzero integer by 1 does not change its value.\n- Inverse Element: For any nonzero integer \\(n\\), there exists \\(1/n\\) such that \\(n \\times ( (1/n) = 1\\).\n\nHence, the nonzero integers under multiplication also form a group.\n\n**C. The nonzero real numbers under multiplication**\n- Closure: Multiplying any two nonzero real numbers results in another nonzero real number.\n- Associativity: Multiplication of real numbers is associative.\n- Identity Element: 1 is the identity element because multiplying any nonzero real number by 1 does not change its value.\n- Inverse Element: For any nonzero real number \\(n\\), there exists \\(1/n\\) such that \\(n \\times ( (1/n) = 1\\).\n\nThis confirms that the nonzero real numbers under multiplication form a group.\n\n**D. The complex numbers under addition**\n- Closure: Adding any two complex numbers results in another complex number.\n- Associativity: Addition of complex numbers is associative.\n- Identity Element: 0 is the identity element because adding 0 to any complex number does not change its value.\n- Inverse Element: For any complex number \\(a + bi\\), there exists \\(-(a + bi) = -a - bi\\) such that \\((a + bi) + (-a - bi) = 0\\).\n\nGiven these properties, the complex numbers under addition also form a group.\n\nUpon reviewing all the options, it becomes clear that **none** of the provided options do not meet the criteria for being NOT a group based on the definitions and properties outlined above. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in constructing the question as none of the given groups listed here fail to meet the criteria for being a group."
