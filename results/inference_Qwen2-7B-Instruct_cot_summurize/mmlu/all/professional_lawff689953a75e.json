The owner was subsequently arrested and charged with violating the state obscenity law. At his trial, the owner's defense was that the sale of the materials complained of was constitutionally protected speech. Which of the following, if established, would be most helpful to the owner's defense?\n\nA. The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.\nB. The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.\nC. The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.\nD. 85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.\n"

The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.\n\nEstablishing that the police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore and purchased the materials would be most helpful to the owner's defense. This is because it would likely challenge the legality of the search and seizure, potentially leading to the suppression of the evidence obtained during the illegal search under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Without the evidence obtained from the unlawful search, the prosecution's case against the owner would be significantly weakened.\n\nThe other options ( A, B, and D \u2013 do not directly address the legal issues surrounding the search and seizure of the materials, nor do they necessarily protect the constitutional rights of the defendant in the context of an obscenity prosecution. While they may be relevant in other aspects of the case, such as the content of the materials and public opinion, they do not directly support the defense's argument regarding the legality of the police action."
