This action violates trust and respect for personal boundaries.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character worked hard to earn a good grade and paid their teacher. Assuming they followed all school rules and regulations, this scenario does not involve any morally wrong actions. The act of working hard to achieve academic success is generally encouraged and seen as a positive behavior."
