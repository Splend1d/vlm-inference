They originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, particularly from a lineage of cells known as monocytes, not from periosteal mesenchymal cells. These cells fuse to form multinucleated giant cells with a high capacity to break down bone matrix, releasing it into the bloodstream where it can be recycled or used elsewhere in the body."
