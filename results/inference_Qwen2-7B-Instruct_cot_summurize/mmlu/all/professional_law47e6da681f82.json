Toward the end of the seventh year of the term, a violent storm blew off several of the roof shingles. The tenant noticed a leak through the roof where the shingles had blown off, but didn't make any repairs. A month later, a severe rain storm occurred, and water leaked through the roof, causing damage to the valuable parquet floors in the two rooms below. Before the term of his lease ended, the tenant discovered that the landlord had not paid his taxes on the property, so he purchased the property through a sheriff's sale. The tenant refuses to make any further rental payments on the property. If the landlord brings suit against the tenant for payment of rent in arrears, he would most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the tenant is estopped to deny the landlord's title.\nB. succeed, because of his security interest in the property.\nC. fail, because the purchase by the tenant vitiated any further contractual obligations.\nD. fail, because the landlord was under a duty to keep the demised premises in reasonably good repair.\n"

The storm-damaged roof leading to the tenant's property damage suggests that the landlord neglected their maintenance responsibilities. Therefore, the landlord cannot hold the tenant responsible for non-payment of rent due to their own failure to properly maintain the property."
