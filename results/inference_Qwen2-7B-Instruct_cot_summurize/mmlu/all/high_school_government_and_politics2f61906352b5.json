Approximately 30% of the senators and representatives are members of the presidential political party.\n\nFor a presidential veto to be overturned, Congress needs to override it with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This means that more than just a third of the members need to be from the same political party as the president. Therefore, if around 30% of the senators and representatives are members of the presidential political party, they would likely not have the necessary supermajority to override the veto. \n\nIn reality, achieving a two-thirds majority is extremely difficult and rarely occurs. Therefore, this option might be the closest to a situation where an override could happen due to the high concentration of a single party in both chambers. However, in practice, the other factors listed ( public opinion, the political affiliation of the Chief Justice, or the president's campaign rhetoric \u2013 would not directly impact the ability to override a veto."
