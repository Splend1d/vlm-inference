Given that 1 kcal equals approximately 4.184 kilojoules (kJ), we can convert the oxygen consumption into energy expenditure.\n\nThe athlete's oxygen uptake is 3.0 liters (L) per minute. Since there are 1000 mL in 1 L, this means the athlete consumes 3000 mL of oxygen per minute.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many kcal of energy are consumed in 5 minutes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy (kcal} = \\frac{\\text{Oxygen uptake (mL}}{\\text{20.9 mL/kcal}} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy (kcal)} = \\frac{3000}{20.9} \\times 5 \\approx 72.53 \\text{ kcal} \\]\n\nNext, convert kcal to kJ:\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy (kJ} = \\text{Energy (kcal} \\times 4.184 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy (kJ} = 72.53 \\times 4.184 \\approx 304.3 \\text{ kJ} \\]\n\nGiven the options, the closest answer is **C. 300 kJ**."
