She parked in the store's parking lot, and while walking toward the building two masked males assaulted and raped her. The lot was poorly lit, had no security personnel, and was frequented by gang members. The police had several incident reports in the past 12 months documenting prior criminal activities, including some personal robberies and assaults, in the lot. The store itself had even more reports than the police. The woman sued the store for her injuries, claiming that it breached its duty to make the premises reasonably safe for its customers. Will she likely prevail?\n\nA. Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers.\nB. No, the store owes no special duty of care to eliminate crime on the parking lot; it was up to the police to perform that task.\nC. No, the occurrence of a rape of a customer was not a foreseeable event and the store had no duty to try and discover that such a potential danger could exist.\nD. Yes, a store owner is the guarantor to every customer that he or she will be protected and safe when walking in the parking lot.\n"

Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers.\n\nThis is because, generally, businesses have a legal duty to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition for the use of their customers. This includes ensuring the safety of the parking lot, which is an extension of the store property. If the store had knowledge of past criminal activities in the area, such as the incident reports mentioned, they would be expected to take reasonable steps to mitigate risks, such as increasing lighting, hiring security personnel, or cooperating with local law enforcement to address the issue. \n\nBusinesses cannot guarantee complete safety, but they can be held liable if they fail to act upon known risks, thereby contributing to harm that could have been prevented with reasonable precautions. Therefore, the court might find that the store breached its duty of care in this case, especially considering the history of criminal activities documented in both police and store incident reports."
