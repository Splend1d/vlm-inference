She testified at trial that while sitting on the floor trying to gather the strength to get up, she heard a grocery employee asst. manager say to an employee, \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" The grocer's counsel objected on the basis of hearsay to the admissibility of the purported statements of the asst. manager and the other employee. What will the court decide?\n\nA. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement was not hearsay \u0080\u0094 it was offered to show that they were aware of a problem on the floor.\nB. The objection will be sustained because the asst. manager's statement was pure hearsay and she had to be available for cross-examination for the statement to be admissible.\nC. The objection will be sustained because the statement was irrelevant to whether or not the store was negligent and liable for the shopper's injuries.\nD. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n"

The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n\nIn this scenario, the asst. manager's statement was not hearsay in the traditional sense because it was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted but rather to show the state of mind or actions of the grocery store, which is relevant to proving negligence. The statement suggests that the grocery store knew about the puddle of liquid on the floor and failed to address it promptly, which could indicate negligence on their part. Therefore, the court would likely rule that the statement is admissible under the admission by a party-opponent exception to the hearsay rule."
