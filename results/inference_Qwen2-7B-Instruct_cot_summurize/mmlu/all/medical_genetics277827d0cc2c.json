They allow genetic as opposed to environmental influences on variation in a trait to be estimated.\n\nTwin studies, particularly identical ( or monozygotic twins, who share 100% of their DNA, and fraternal or dizygotic twins, who share approximately 50% of their DNA like any other siblings, are very valuable in the field of genetics. These studies help researchers understand how much of the variation in a particular trait or disease is due to genetic factors versus environmental factors. \n\nThe presence of extra copies of genes (option B) can facilitate cloning of genes in a laboratory setting but it does not specifically relate to twin studies in humans for estimating genetic influence on traits. \n\nOption C, \"they allow improved expression of genes\", is not accurate. While twins may share similar environments which can affect gene expression, twin studies do not directly manipulate or improve gene expression.\n\nOption D, \"twins have a greater likelihood of being heterozygous\", is incorrect. The likelihood of being heterozygous is not increased for twins compared to non-twins. In fact, if one twin has a mutation, the other twin has a 50% chance of also having that mutation, assuming it occurred randomly during meiosis."
