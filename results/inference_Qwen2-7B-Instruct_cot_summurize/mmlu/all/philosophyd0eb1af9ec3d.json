This deeper understanding allows one to apply the principles consistently in various situations, even when the exact examples may not directly fit the circumstances at hand. For instance, understanding the concept of justice goes beyond knowing a list of actions considered just; it involves grasping the core idea that justice entails fairness, equality, and respect for the rights of others, which can guide decision-making in diverse scenarios."
