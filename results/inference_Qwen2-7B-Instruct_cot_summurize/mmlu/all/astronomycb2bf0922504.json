This concept is based on the scientific method and the nature of empirical evidence in science. \n\nIn science, theories are not proven to be absolutely true but rather they are supported by evidence until such time that new evidence emerges that contradicts or casts doubt on the theory. This is because our understanding of the world is always evolving, and as we gain more knowledge, our theories may need to be refined or even replaced.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that theories cannot be considered well-supported or highly reliable. For example, the theory of gravity has been extensively tested and has held up under rigorous scrutiny for centuries. It accurately predicts the motion of planets, stars, and everyday objects alike. While it could potentially be disproven by future discoveries, it remains a cornerstone of physics today.\n\nSo, while a theory might be supported by numerous experiments and observations (option D, testing the hypothesis by many others), it's the continuous process of testing, retesting, and refining our understanding based on new data that allows us to build a robust body of scientific knowledge. It's the potential for further testing and the possibility of being proven wrong that distinguishes scientific theories from absolute truths."
