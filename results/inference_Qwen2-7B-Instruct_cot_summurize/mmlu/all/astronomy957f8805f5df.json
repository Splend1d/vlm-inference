While most aerobic organisms require oxygen, there are many forms of life, such as anaerobic bacteria and certain types of protists, which can live without oxygen. Therefore, the ability to breathe oxygen is not an essential requirement for life as we know it.\n\nB. The ability to make energy from sunlight or to eat things that do.\nC. A source of organic molecules.\nBoth of these requirements are crucial for life as they pertain to energy acquisition and the presence of essential building blocks for living organisms. Sunlight is used by photosynthetic organisms to produce energy and organic molecules, while heterotrophic organisms obtain energy and organic molecules by consuming other organisms or their products.\n\nD. A and B is incorrect because while both B and C are essential requirements for life, option A (the ability to breathe oxygen, is not universally required among all known forms of life."
