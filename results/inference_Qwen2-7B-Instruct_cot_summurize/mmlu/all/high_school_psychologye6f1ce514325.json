Experiments isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables.\n\nExperiments are uniquely capable of establishing causality because they control for extraneous variables and isolate the effect of the independent variable (on the dependent variable. This is done through random assignment to treatment and control groups, manipulation of the independent variable, and controlling or holding constant potential confounding variables. By doing so, researchers can infer that any differences observed between groups are due to the manipulation of the independent variable rather than other factors. Other methods like observational studies, for example, cannot control for all possible confounding variables, making it harder to establish causality."
