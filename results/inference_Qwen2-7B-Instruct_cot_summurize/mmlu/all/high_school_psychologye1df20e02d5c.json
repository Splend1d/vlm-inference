This mechanical energy can then be used to perform work, such as movement. When muscles are involved in activities like exercise, the process of muscle contraction involves the transduction of chemical energy (from ATP breakdown) into mechanical energy (for movement).\n\nGlandular effectors (A), pressure receptors C), and rods and cones D) do not directly convert mechanical or chemical energy into electrochemical energy in the context of muscle action. Glandular effectors are involved in producing and secreting chemical substances, pressure receptors detect changes in pressure and send signals to the brain, and rods and cones are photoreceptors in the eye that convert light into neural signals."
