These symptoms may include increased heart rate, nervousness, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping, among others.\n\nLet me explain why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. A deficiency of ACTH ( would typically lead to a condition called adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease, not anxiety-like symptoms. ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and aldosterone, so a lack of ACTH would reduce the production of these hormones, potentially causing fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms but not specifically anxiety symptoms.\n\nB. An excess of testosterone might affect mood and behavior in some individuals, but it's not typically associated with anxiety-like symptoms as prominently as hyperthyroidism is.\n\nC. Addison's disease, which results from a deficiency in cortisol and aldosterone due to damaged adrenal glands, does cause symptoms such as fatigue, low blood pressure, and low blood sugar levels, but it's not primarily known for producing anxiety symptoms as hyperthyroidism does."
