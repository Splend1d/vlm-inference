College professor\n\nWhile all these professions can involve disruptions to normal sleep patterns, college professors typically have more control over their schedules and are less likely to experience the extreme shifts in work hours that are common in professions like nursing, policing, or flight attending. This can lead to less disruption of their circadian rhythms compared to those professions. However, it's important to note that each individual's response to disrupted circadian rhythms can vary significantly based on various factors including genetics, lifestyle, and personal health status."
