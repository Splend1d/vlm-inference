Professional, Individual, Personal, Organizational.\n\nIn a business-to-business context:\n\n1. **Conflict of Professional vs. Organizational Interests**: This occurs when the professional duties or roles of one party (such as a consultant or service provider, come into conflict with the organizational interests of the client. For example, if a consulting firm is hired to provide strategic advice to another company, there could be a conflict if the consulting firm also stands to gain financially from implementing certain strategies that benefit only its own interests.\n\n2. **Conflict of Individual vs. Organizational Interests**: This type of conflict arises when the personal interests of an individual within a company are clash with the interests of the organization. For instance, an employee who is also a significant shareholder in a competing firm might have incentives to make decisions that favor their own investment over what is best for the company they work for.\n\nUnderstanding and managing these conflicts is crucial to maintaining trust, ethical standards, and effective business relationships."
