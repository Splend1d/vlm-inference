In this model:\n\n- Red is produced by activating red phosphors when an electric current passes through them.\n- Green is produced by activating green phosphors.\n- Blue is produced by activating blue phosphors.\n\nTo create the color yellow, both red and blue phosphors are activated simultaneously. This is because yellow is a combination of red and green light (not blue and red). So, while the question seems to be asking about the specific phosphors that produce yellow, it's actually more accurate to say that yellow is produced by the combination of red and blue phosphors activation, rather than being primarily yellow itself."
