Therefore, the probability of getting all three dominant alleles from one parent is (1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\nSince there are two parents contributing to the offspring, and each contributes independently, we multiply the probabilities together:\n\n(1/8) * (1/8) = 1/64\n\nTherefore, the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals is 1/64.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 1.0/64."
