This can be demonstrated by considering the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\) (which consists of integers modulo \\(n\\) under addition. This group has exactly \\(n\\) elements and is cyclic because it can be generated by a single element, for example, the equivalence class of 1, which when repeatedly added to itself generates all elements of the group.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is also true. In a finite cyclic group \\(G\\), generated by an element \\(g\\), every divisor of the order of \\(G\\) corresponds to the order of some power of \\(g\\). Specifically, if \\(|G| = n\\), then for any divisor \\(d\\) of \\(n\\), there exists an element \\(h\\) in \\(G\\) such that \\(h^d = g^k\\) where \\(k\\) is chosen so that \\(dk\\) is a multiple of \\(n\\), effectively making \\(h\\) have order \\(d\\). This property is a direct consequence of the fundamental theorem on cyclic groups and the properties of powers in cyclic groups."
