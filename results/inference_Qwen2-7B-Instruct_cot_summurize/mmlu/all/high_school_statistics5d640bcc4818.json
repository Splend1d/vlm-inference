To see if there is a difference between boys and girls in their opposition to the new dress code, they conduct a poll of 60 randomly selected male and 70 randomly selected female high school students in the district. They find that 66 females oppose the dress code and 50 males oppose the dress code. Which of the following explains why a two-proportion z-test is not appropriate?\n\nA. The sample sizes are different.\nB. The sample sizes are too large.\nC. The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.\nD. The shapes of the population distributions are not known.\n"

The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.\n\nFor a two-proportion z-test to be appropriate, it is generally recommended that each group (proportion combination has at least 10 successes and 10 failures. In this case, while the numbers are close, the female group has 66 successes (opposing the dress code and 70 - 66 = 4 failures (do not oppose), which does not quite meet the criteria since the number of failures is less than 10. The male group has 50 successes and 60 - 50 = 10 failures, which meets the criteria but only just barely. Therefore, given the context provided, option C is the most accurate explanation as to why a two-proportion z-test might not be appropriate."
