The prime factorization of 45 is \\(3^2 \\times 5\\). According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group. Thus, possible orders for subgroups of such a group include 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. However, there's no guarantee that a subgroup of order 10 will exist in an abelian group of order 45 based solely on this information. \n\nFor instance, the group could be cyclic and generated by an element of order 45, in which case it wouldn't have a subgroup of order 10. Alternatively, if it were a direct product of smaller cyclic groups ( like \\(Z_9 \\times Z_5\\), it would indeed have subgroups of various orders dividing 45, including one of order 10. But without specifying the exact structure of the group, we cannot definitively conclude that such a subgroup always exists. Therefore, Statement 1 is not universally true but could be true under certain circumstances.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.\"\n\nThis statement is actually referring to a key property of normal subgroups, known as the fact that a subgroup \\(H\\) of \\(G\\) is normal if and only if for every \\(g \\in G\\), the left coset \\(gH\\) equals the right coset \\(Hg\\). This does not directly state that the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets; rather, it implies that for a subgroup to be normal, its left and right cosets must coincide. The equality of the number of left and right cosets is a consequence of the subgroup being normal, but the statement itself is not entirely accurate in its formulation. The correct statement would be that a subgroup \\(H\\) of \\(G\\) is normal if and only if \\(gH = Hg\\) for all \\(g \\in G\\).\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer choice is **C. True, False**. However, it's important to note that the second statement, while not precisely stated correctly, points towards a concept related to normal subgroups. The precise statement about the equality of left and right cosets is that for a subgroup \\(H\\) of \\(G\\), \\(H\\) is normal in \\(G\\) if and only if for all \\(g \\in G\\), \\(gH = Hg\\), which implies that all left cosets are also right cosets, leading to the same number of distinct cosets."
