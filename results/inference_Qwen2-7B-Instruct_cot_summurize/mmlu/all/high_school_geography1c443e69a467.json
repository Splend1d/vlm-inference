A charismatic national leader\n\nCentrifugal forces in a country often refer to factors that cause people or regions within the country to feel disconnected or separated from the rest of the nation, potentially leading to secessionist movements or other forms of division. A charismatic national leader might create a strong sense of unity and pride among the populace, which could be seen as a centrifugal force that binds the country together through a shared identity and loyalty to the leader.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the concept of centrifugal force in this context is not a standard term used in political science or sociology. It's more commonly used in physics to describe a force that acts away from a central point. In the context of a country, the term is metaphorical and used to describe social cohesion or disintegration."
