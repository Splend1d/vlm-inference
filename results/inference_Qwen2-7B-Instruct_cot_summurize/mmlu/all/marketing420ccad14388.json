These characteristics help businesses understand different groups of consumers and tailor their marketing strategies to meet the specific needs and preferences of each segment. \n\nWhile other options like organizational size, product type, and price can also be used for segmentation in certain contexts, demographics are generally considered the most fundamental and widely applied criterion for dividing consumer markets."
