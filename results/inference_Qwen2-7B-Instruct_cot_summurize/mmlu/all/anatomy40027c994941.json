The buccal surfaces of the upper molars and lingual surfaces of the lower incisors.\n\nDental plaque tends to accumulate on areas that are difficult to reach when brushing and flossing. The buccal ( or labial surfaces, which are the outer sides of the teeth near the cheeks and lips, can be easily reached during oral hygiene routines. However, the palatal surfaces of the upper molars and the lingual surfaces of the lower incisors are harder to access. These areas are located at the back of the mouth and between the teeth, respectively, making them prime locations for plaque accumulation when oral hygiene practices are not thorough. Therefore, patients with poor oral hygiene are more likely to have plaque buildup in these areas."
