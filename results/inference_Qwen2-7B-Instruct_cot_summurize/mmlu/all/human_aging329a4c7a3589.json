Research has shown that individuals with at least one copy of the APOE 2 allele have a lower risk of developing age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, and tend to live longer compared to those with other genotypes like APOE 3 or 4. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the presence of the APOE 2 allele may be associated with a longer lifespan, it does not guarantee longevity and does not negate the importance of overall lifestyle factors for health and longevity."
