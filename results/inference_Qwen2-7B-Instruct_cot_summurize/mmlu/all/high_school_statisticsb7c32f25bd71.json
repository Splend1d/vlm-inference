The problem states that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. This means that 70% live shorter or equal to 75 years. \n\nIn terms of standard deviations from the mean ( (\\(\\mu\\)) in a normal distribution:\n- 50% of the data lies below the mean (\\(\\mu\\)),\n- 68% lies within one standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of the mean,\n- 95% lies within two standard deviations of the mean,\n- And so on.\n\nGiven that 70% of the data lies below 75 years, this corresponds to the point where 30% of the data lies above it. In a standard normal distribution, this corresponds to a z-score that separates the bottom 70% from the top 30%. From standard normal distribution tables or using a z-score calculator, the z-score that corresponds to the bottom 70% ( or equivalently, the top 30% is approximately 0.5244 ( (this value comes from looking up the z-score for 0.70 cumulative probability in a standard normal distribution table).\n\nThe formula relating the z-score to the mean and standard deviation is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWe know \\(X = 75\\) years, \\(z \\approx 0.5244\\), and \\(\\sigma = 14\\) years. We need to solve for \\(\\mu\\):\n\n\\[ 0.5244 = \\frac{75 - \\mu}{14} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\mu\\):\n\n\\[ 75 - \\mu = 0.5244 \\times 14 \\]\n\n\\[ 75 - \\mu = 7.3416 \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu = 75 - 7.3416 \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu \\approx 67.6584 \\]\n\nNone of the options provided exactly matches this calculation, which suggests there might have been an error in interpreting the question or in the given choices. However, based on the principle of finding the mean when given a percentage of values above a certain threshold, option D seems to be attempting to represent a similar calculation, albeit not directly matching our derived result. It's important to note that the correct answer was not listed among the options provided."
