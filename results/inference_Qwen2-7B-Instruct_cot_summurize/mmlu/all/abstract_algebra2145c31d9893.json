For a set to be a group under multiplication modulo \\(n\\), it must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. The issue with this statement arises when considering the multiplicative group of integers modulo \\(n\\), denoted as \\((\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^*\\). This group consists of elements \\(a\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}\\) that are relatively prime to \\(n\\). That means for every element \\(a\\) in the set \\(\\{1,2,...,n-1\\}\\), there exists another element \\(b\\) in the same set such that \\(ab \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\), which is the condition for invertibility. However, not all elements in \\(\\{1,2,...,n-1\\}\\) are relatively prime to \\(n\\), especially when \\(n\\) is composite and has common factors with some elements in the set. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Statement 2**: There is an integer \\(x\\) such that \\(63x \\mod 100 = 1\\).\n\nThis statement can be verified through the concept of modular inverses or by direct calculation. Essentially, we're looking for an integer \\(x\\) such that when multiplied by 63 and then divided by 100, the remainder is 1. This implies that \\(63x - 1\\) must be divisible by 100. One way to approach this problem is to use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(ax + by = gcd(a, b)\\). In our case, \\(gcd(63, 100) = 1\\), so there exist integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(63x + 100y = 1\\). Solving for \\(x\\) gives us a value that satisfies the given condition. Without going into the full algorithm here, we can note that since \\(gcd(63, 100) = 1\\), there indeed exists at least one solution for \\(x\\), making this statement true.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is **D. False, True**."
