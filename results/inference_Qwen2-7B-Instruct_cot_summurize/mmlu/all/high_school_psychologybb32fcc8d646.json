The Rosenhan study, conducted in 1973 by psychologist David Rosenhan, demonstrated that confirmation bias can indeed influence clinicians' views and treatments of mental patients. In the study, Rosenhan and his team posed as psychiatric patients, entering mental hospitals and convincing staff members of their psychiatric conditions despite none of them actually having any history of mental illness. This experiment revealed that clinicians might be overly influenced by their initial hypotheses or expectations about a patient's condition, leading to misdiagnoses and inappropriate treatments. It highlighted the importance of considering multiple sources of information and the potential for bias in clinical assessments."
