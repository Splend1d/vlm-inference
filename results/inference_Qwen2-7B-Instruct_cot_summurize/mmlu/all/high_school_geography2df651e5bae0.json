They argue that altering the genetic makeup of organisms can lead to unforeseen consequences, including allergic reactions or other health issues that might not be apparent until much later. This fear stems from the lack of comprehensive long-term safety studies on the consumption of genetically modified foods. \n\nIt's important to note that the other options listed have their own scientific debates and are are not universally agreed upon as concerns by all anti-GMO advocates:\n\nA. Global trade: While some critics argue that GMOs could potentially disrupt traditional farming methods and local markets, most experts agree that GMOs have not hindered global trade and, in fact, have facilitated it through increased crop yields and improved shelf life.\n\nB. Making plants more resistant to disease: This is one of the main benefits of GMOs, as genetic modification allows plants to develop resistance to certain pests, diseases, and environmental stresses, which can reduce the need for pesticides and improve agricultural sustainability.\n\nD. Making plants more resistant to drought: Similarly, GMOs can be engineered to be more drought-resistant, which helps in improving crop yields in areas with less water availability, thus contributing to food security.\n\nHowever, these benefits come with their own set of controversies and ethical considerations."
