That the wiretap will extend indefinitely until all relevant conversations are recorded.\n\nExplanation: According to legal procedures and requirements for obtaining a wiretap order, the duration of the wiretap cannot be indefinite. The order must specify the period during which the interception is authorized, which cannot exceed 30 days without renewal. Therefore, stating that the wiretap will extend indefinitely until all relevant conversations are recorded is not required and would not meet the legal criteria for obtaining such an order."
