In fact, Nathanson argues against the death penalty and advocates for rehabilitation and restorative justice, which are in some ways can be seen as a rejection of the idea of treating criminals with complete humanity or kindness, especially when considering the severity of the crimes committed. \n\nRetributivism generally holds that punishment should be proportionate to the crime, but Nathanson's approach is more nuanced, emphasizing the moral wrongness of the act itself and the offender's moral responsibility, rather than solely focusing on deterrence or retribution. He argues against the death penalty, advocating instead for life imprisonment as a more humane and just alternative for the most serious crimes."
