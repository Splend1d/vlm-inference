The purchaser noticed that the car made a squeaking noise when the brakes were applied, so the purchaser took the car back to the dealership to have the mechanic there take a look at it. The mechanic worked on the car and then told the purchaser that the problem had been fixed. A few days later, the brakes failed, causing the purchaser to crash into a tree. The purchaser suffered a serious head injury in the crash. If the purchaser asserts a claim against the car dealership for damages for his injuries, will the purchaser prevail?\n\nA. Yes, if the brakes were defective when the dealership sold the car to the purchaser.\nB. Yes, because the dealership is strictly liable for defective repairs on cars it has sold.\nC. No, because the car had been driven more than 1,000 miles.\nD. No, unless the dealership's employee was negligent in repairing the brakes.\n"

Yes, if the brakes were defective when the dealership sold the car to the purchaser.\n\nIn this scenario, the purchaser might have a valid claim against the car dealership if the brakes were defective when the dealership sold the car to the purchaser. The fact that the brakes failed after a repair and caused an accident leading to injury would likely be a factor in determining liability. The specific laws regarding product liability or warranty claims may vary by jurisdiction, but generally, if a product (in this case, a car) is sold with defects, the seller (the dealership in this case - can be held responsible for any damages resulting from those defects.\n\nThe other options present misunderstandings or oversimplifications of legal principles:\n\nB. The concept of \"strict liability\" typically applies to certain types of products, such as those inherently dangerous, like machinery or chemicals, where the manufacturer or seller can be held liable without regard to fault. In the context of car sales and repairs, a dealership's liability is usually based on negligence or breach of warranty, not strict liability.\n\nC. The mileage on the car is not relevant to whether the brakes were defective when the dealership sold the car. The issue is whether the car was in proper working condition at the time of sale, regardless of how many miles the car had been driven subsequently.\n\nD. While negligence in the repair process could potentially be a factor in establishing the dealership's liability, the primary concern here is whether the car had a defect at the time of sale. If the car was defective when sold, the focus would be on that initial sale rather than the subsequent repair."
