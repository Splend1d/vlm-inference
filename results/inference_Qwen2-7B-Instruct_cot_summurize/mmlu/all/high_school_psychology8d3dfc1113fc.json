Gail has a bag.\n\nIn a code-based phonics approach, the focus is on teaching students how to decode words based on the sounds that individual letters or letter combinations make. Sentences C, \"Gail has a bag,\" contains all the letters that have been introduced (b, a, s, and g, in a way that allows students to apply their knowledge of letter sounds directly. \n\nSentence A includes an additional letter \"o\" which might confuse students if they haven't learned that sound yet. Sentence B introduces a new consonant \"d\" and a vowel \"i\", making it more complex. Sentence D adds another vowel \"h\" and introduces a new letter combination \"l\" that may not follow a simple pattern that students have already learned.\n\nTherefore, sentence C is the most straightforward option that allows students to practice their newly learned letter sounds without introducing any new ones."
