This decrease in overall demand causes firms to produce less, leading to a reduction in output (GDP.\n2. **Price Level**: With flexible prices, the economy adjusts to the new lower level of demand. Prices may fall as firms try to clear their inventories and attract buyers. Thus, the price level decreases.\n\n### Long Run:\n\n1. **GDP**: In the long run, if the economy is at full employment, firms cannot reduce production further without hiring more workers, which implies that wages must adjust to meet the higher demand for labor. However, since wages are flexible, they can adjust downward, allowing firms to maintain current levels of output. Therefore, the economy's potential output remains unchanged, and GDP does not fall.\n2. **Price Level**: In the long run, with flexible prices, the economy tends to move back towards its natural rate of unemployment and potential GDP. If aggregate demand falls, the economy will adjust by lowering prices until it reaches a new equilibrium where output is at its potential level. The price level will stabilize at a lower level but not necessarily at the initial pre-shock level due to changes in expectations.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven these dynamics:\n\n- **Short-run GDP** falls.\n- **Short-run Price Level** falls.\n- **Long-run GDP** remains unchanged.\n- **Long-run Price Level** stabilizes at a lower level.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Falls** for GDP in the short run, **F Falls** for the price level in the short run, **No change** for GDP in the long run, and **No change** for the price level in the long run."
