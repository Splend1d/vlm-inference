They are acts creating unilateral legal obligations to the acting State\n\nUnilateral acts refer to actions taken by a single party without the need for reciprocal action from another party. In the context of international law, a unilateral act can create binding legal obligations for the state performing the act. For example, a declaration by a state of its consent to be bound by certain principles or rules of international law would be considered a unilateral act."
