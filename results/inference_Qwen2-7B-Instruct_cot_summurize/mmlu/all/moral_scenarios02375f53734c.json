Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, waiting outside while someone else takes a shower might be considered a breach of privacy and respect for personal boundaries, which is generally viewed as morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\nIn Scenario 2, breaking up with someone, while it can be emotionally painful, is not inherently morally wrong. It is a common part of romantic relationships and interpersonal dynamics. The morality often depends on how the breakup is handled, such as whether it was done respectfully and with consideration for the other person's feelings."
