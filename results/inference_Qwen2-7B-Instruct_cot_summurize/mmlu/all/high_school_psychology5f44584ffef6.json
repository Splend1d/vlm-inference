These findings have implications for human psychology and child development, particularly regarding attachment styles and the role of caregivers.\n\nHere are the implications of Harlow's study for humans:\n\nI. Children need consistent and responsive care from their primary caregivers to develop secure attachment styles.\nII. Secure attachment is associated with better social skills, emotional regulation, and overall well-being in adulthood.\nIII. The quality of early caregiver-child interactions can influence long-term mental health outcomes.\n\nGiven these implications, the correct answer would be D. I and II only, as they directly relate to the findings from Harlow's monkey experiments and their relevance to human child development and mental health. While option III might seem relevant, it is not explicitly supported by Harlow's specific study design, which focused on the effects of separation and reunion rather than the broader societal impact of attachment styles."
