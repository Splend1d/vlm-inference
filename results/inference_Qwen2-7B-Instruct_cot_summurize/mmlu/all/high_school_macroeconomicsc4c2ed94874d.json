This leads to an increase in the equilibrium price because buyers are willing to pay more for the limited quantity available. Similarly, when demand shifts to the right, it indicates that consumers are willing to buy more at each price level, which also tends to push the equilibrium price up as the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at lower prices. Therefore, both these changes would lead to an increase in the equilibrium price of corn."
