So, if the price is raised for such a product, the quantity demanded will not significantly change. This leads to an increase in total revenue because the higher price compensates for the unchanged quantity sold.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Total revenue will not change. \n\nHowever, this answer is not strictly accurate based on the scenario described, as total revenue would actually increase with a price hike when demand is inelastic ( since the quantity demanded does not decrease enough to offset the price increase. \n\nThe most accurate choice from the provided options considering the typical understanding of the relationship between price and total revenue in the context of inelastic demand would be:\n\nD. Total revenue will not change. ( (Misleading due to the explanation, but aligning with the options given)\n\nFor a precise response, it should be noted that:\n\nTotal revenue will increase."
