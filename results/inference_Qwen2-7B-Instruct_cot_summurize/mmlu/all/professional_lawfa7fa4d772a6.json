The ex-con went ahead and planned the robbery. As part of his scheme, the ex-con stole a van, which he intended to use as the getaway vehicle. According to the ex-con's plan, he would pick up the two men in the van on Friday morning and drive over to the bank where the robbery would occur. The ex-con instructed his cohort that he would be the getaway driver and wait in the van while they entered the bank, armed with shotguns. However, the day before the robbery was to take place, the excon was arrested on a parole violation for carrying a concealed weapon and was taken into custody. The two men, nevertheless, decided to carry out the robbery using the van that the ex-con had stolen. On Friday moming, the two men drove to the bank. When they entered, an undercover police detective was waiting and arrested the two men, as the police had received an anonymous tip regarding the robbery earlier that morning. The ex-con should be found guilty for which of the following crimes?\n\nA. Automobile theft and solicitation.\nB. Automobile theft and conspiracy.\nC. Automobile theft and attempted robbery.\nD. Automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n"

                    "text": "The ex-con should be found guilty for D. Automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Automobile Theft**: The ex-con stole a van, which is an act of automobile theft.\n\n2. **Conspiracy**: By planning the robbery with the two men and stealing the van with the intention of using it during the robbery, the ex-con was involved in a conspiracy to commit a crime. Conspiracy is established when two or more people agree to commit a crime, and at least one overt act is committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n3. **Attempted Robbery**: Although the ex-con was arrested before the actual robbery could take place, the fact that he planned and prepared for the robbery ( including stealing the van and providing instructions on how it should be carried out, demonstrates that he was actively engaged in efforts to commit the crime of robbery. Attempted robbery is charged when someone takes substantial steps toward committing a robbery but is stopped short of completion due to circumstances such as arrest.\n\nTherefore, all three charges apply: automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery."
