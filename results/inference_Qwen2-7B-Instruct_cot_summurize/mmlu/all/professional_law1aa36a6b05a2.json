It advertised that anyone who purchased the car in 2013 and did not get at least 50 miles per gallon average gas mileage during the first 60 days, would receive a payment of $10,000 cash from the company. Record-keeping and inspection procedures were required to assure accurate reporting by the vehicle owner. The promotion was widely publicized. A female customer purchased a hybrid model during the promotion period, followed all the rules, and recorded only 42 mpg in the first 60 days. She demanded the rebate but the company stalled for months and then stopped responding to her inquiries. Does she have a contractual right to collect the $10,000?\n\nA. Yes, because this is a classic bilateral contract, making it necessary that the company live up to its set of promises made to her.\nB. No, this was merely puffing, was not an offer to contract with any particular person and was without consideration.\nC. Yes, this was a unilateral contract in which the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms of the offer, thus creating a binding contract.\nD. No, because she did not formally notify the company that she was accepting the offer before she started performing.\n"

Yes, this was a unilateral contract in which the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms of the offer, thus creating a binding contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the auto retailer's promotion can be considered as a unilateral contract. A unilateral contract occurs when one party (the promisor - makes a promise to another party (the offeree) that if certain conditions are met, the promisor will do something or pay something to the offeree. In this case, the promise was made in the form of the promotional offer: \"if you purchase the car and do not achieve at least 50 mpg within the first 60 days, you will receive $10,000.\" \n\nThe female customer fulfilled the condition set forth in the offer by purchasing the car and recording 42 mpg in the first 60 days, as required. By doing so, she accepted the offer and created a binding contract between herself and the auto retailer. As a result, she has a contractual right to collect the $10,000."
