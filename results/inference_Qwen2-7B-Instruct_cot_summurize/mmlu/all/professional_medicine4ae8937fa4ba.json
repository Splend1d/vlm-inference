She has a 2-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin. She had a normal Pap smear 3 months ago and saw her ophthalmologist 6 months ago. Her 67-year-old grandmother has breast cancer. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2 . Her hemoglobin A1c is 6.2%, and fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 118 mg/dL. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this time?\n\nA. Dietary modification for weight loss\nB. Human papillomavirus testing\nC. Mammography\nD. Influenza virus vaccine\n"

Influenza virus vaccine\n\nGiven that she is young and does not have any other medical conditions requiring immediate attention, the focus should be on preventive care, which includes vaccinations such as the influenza vaccine. The influenza vaccine is recommended for all individuals, especially those with chronic medical conditions like diabetes, as they are at higher risk for complications from influenza.\n\nWhile it's important for her to maintain good control of her diabetes through regular monitoring, adjustments to diet or exercise may not necessarily be indicated based on the information provided. Her recent Pap smear result is also normal, so there is no immediate need for HPV testing. Mammograms are are typically recommended starting around age 40, and given her young age, mammography screening is not typically indicated unless there are specific risk factors, such as a family history of breast cancer. However, discussing the importance of breast self-awareness and the benefits of mammography beginning at age 40 could be beneficial."
