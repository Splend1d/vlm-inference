Recognition of governments is very prevalent in contemporary practice\n\nIn contemporary international relations, the recognition of governments remains a significant practice among states. This involves acknowledging the legal personality of a state and its government as legitimate representatives of a territory or people. Recognition is typically based on factors such as sovereignty, territorial integrity, and adherence to international law.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the process of recognition can be complex and nuanced, with various considerations influencing whether a state or government will be recognized by others. For example, functional recognition refers to the acceptance of a state's authority in specific areas (like trade or security, without necessarily endorsing the entire political system. This approach allows for cooperation and engagement even when broader political questions are unresolved.\n\nAdditionally, there have been instances where rebel entities or transitional governments have received recognition under specific circumstances, especially if they emerge from conflicts or revolutions and manage to consolidate power.\n\nFinally, while democratic principles are often valued, not all democracies receive universal recognition due to geopolitical considerations, historical ties, or other diplomatic reasons. Similarly, non-democratic governments can also be recognized if they meet other criteria for legitimacy and stability.\n\nTherefore, option A accurately reflects the prevalence of government recognition in contemporary international practice, though it's important to understand the complexities and nuances involved in this process."
