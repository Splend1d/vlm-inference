                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Avoid the effect of saturation.\n\nIn an AC motor operating on a variable frequency supply, the magnetic field strength within the motor's coils changes with the applied voltage and frequency. Saturation occurs when the magnetic flux density becomes so high that it limits further increases in magnetic field strength even if more current is supplied. This can lead to reduced efficiency, overheating, and potential damage to the motor.\n\nBy maintaining a variable voltage while adjusting the frequency, the overall magnitude of the magnetic field can be kept within the linear region of operation, thus avoiding saturation and ensuring optimal performance and longevity of the motor."
