In a hypothetical environment, the coat pattern that is associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive, with the result that both the coat pattern and the cross-eyed condition increase in a feline population over time. Which statement is supported by these observations?\n\nA. Evolution is progressive and tends toward a more perfect population.\nB. Phenotype is often the result of compromise.\nC. Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes in populations over the course of time.\nD. Polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive, and should become less common in future generations.\n"

Phenotype is often the result of compromise.\n\nThese observations suggest that the traits (coat pattern and cross-eyed condition) in question are not independent but interact to produce a phenotype that can be advantageous under certain environmental conditions. The fact that the cross-eyed condition is maladaptive in most environments but becomes advantageous when associated with a particular coat pattern implies that the phenotype is a compromise between different genetic factors. \n\nOption A suggests that evolution always leads to perfection, which isn't necessarily true as evolutionary processes can lead to adaptations that are advantageous in specific contexts but may not represent an overall 'perfect' state.\n\nOption C refers to natural selection reducing the frequency of maladaptive genes, which doesn't directly address the scenario described where maladaptive traits can become advantageous under certain conditions.\n\nOption D posits that polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive and should become less common, which isn't supported by the given information. The scenario describes could potentially involve complex interactions between multiple genes ( indicative of polygenic inheritance - but it does not imply this type of inheritance is inherently maladaptive or destined to decrease in prevalence."
