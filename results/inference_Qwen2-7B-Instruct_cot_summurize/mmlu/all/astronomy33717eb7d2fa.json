None of the provided options exactly match this, which indicates there might have been a misunderstanding in the question format since the Boltzmann constant does not include units related to length ( (m, cm, mm, \u03bcm, nm, pm, fm, am, zm, ym, or light-year) as shown in the options A through D. The correct representation in terms of its standard unit should be option C with the understanding that \"i\" represents an incorrect inclusion of a length unit in the given choices."
