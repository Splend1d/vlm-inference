All of these options.\n\nThe period of academic institutionalization can be assessed through various lenses that highlight different aspects of how academic disciplines evolve and mature within specific institutional settings. Here's how each option contributes to this assessment:\n\nA. **Strategic Studies as an Imported American Specialty**: This perspective highlights the influence of American academic institutions and their contributions to the development of strategic studies, which then spread to European institutions. It suggests that certain ideas, methodologies, or frameworks originate from one region (in this case, the United States\u2014and are later adopted or adapted by other regions's academic communities. This can be indicative of the process of academic institutionalization where ideas and practices are standardized and disseminated across different geographical areas.\n\nB. **Think Tanks and Empiricism**: This option focuses on the role of think tanks in academic institutionalization. Think tanks often emerge as key players in the dissemination of knowledge and policy-relevant research. As they become routine producers of narrow technical problem-solving, they might adhere to a particular mode of empiricism that suits their purpose. This can show how academic work becomes more specialized and geared towards practical applications, sometimes at the expense of broader theoretical considerations. The breakdown of the internal logic of deterrence could reflect a shift in focus from complex theoretical frameworks to more concrete, operational solutions, which is another aspect of institutionalization.\n\nC. **Peace Research as a Parallel Track**: This option points out the existence of a parallel track within the field of security studies, specifically the critical branch of peace research. It suggests that different strands of inquiry within a discipline may develop independently or in isolation, leading to a fragmented landscape of academic thought. This can indicate a lack of integration between different areas of study within the same discipline, which is a common feature during periods of institutionalization where new sub-disciplines emerge and establish their own identities and methodologies.\n\nBy considering all these options, we can see that the period of academic institutionalization involves the standardization, specialization, diffusion of ideas, and sometimes fragmentation of academic fields within and across institutional settings. Each of these aspects provides a different angle to understand the complex dynamics of academic development over time."
