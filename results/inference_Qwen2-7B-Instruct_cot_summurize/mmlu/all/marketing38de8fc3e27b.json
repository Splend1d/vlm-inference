It essentially determines how sensitive consumers are to price changes. If the quantity demanded changes significantly when the price changes, then the product has high price elasticity. If the quantity demanded does not change much when the price changes, then the product has low price elasticity. This concept helps businesses understand how altering prices could impact their sales volume and overall revenue."
