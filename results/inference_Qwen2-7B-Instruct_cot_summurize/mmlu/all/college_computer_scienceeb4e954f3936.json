For instance, the string `()()` could be derived as:\n  - `S -> ( S ) S -> () S -> ( S ) -> ()()`\n  - `S -> x S -> () x -> ()()`\n  \n  Both derivations result in the same string, indicating ambiguity.\n\n**Statement II: The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.**\n\n- **Top-down Parsing Suitability:** Top-down parsers, such as LL(k) parsers, attempt to construct a parse tree from the input string by starting with the start symbol and trying to match it against the input. Since our grammar has rules that can be applied in multiple ways (especially the ambiguity in the first rule, a top-down parser might struggle to decide which rule to apply at each step, especially without additional lookahead information. However, given the simplicity and context of this grammar, a top-down parser could theoretically handle it with enough lookahead to distinguish between the ambiguous cases, but it would not be straightforward or efficient.\n\n**Statement III: The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.**\n\n- **Bottom-up Parsing Suitability:** Bottom-up parsers, like LR(k) parsers, start from the input and try to construct the parse tree by applying production rules from the bottom up. The grammar, being quite simple, does not inherently pose a problem for bottom-up parsing. It is capable of being parsed efficiently by a bottom-up parser, as it follows the structure that bottom up parsers are designed to handle, especially without the ambiguity issue being relatively minor and manageable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- Statement I is true due to the inherent ambiguity.\n- Statement II is not necessarily true; while it is not inherently unsuitable, it requires more sophisticated handling than necessary for its simplicity.\n- Statement III is true, as the grammar is compatible with bottom-up parsing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. III only**."
