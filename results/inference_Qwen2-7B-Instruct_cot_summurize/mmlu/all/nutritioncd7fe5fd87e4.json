The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides\nB. Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum\nC. Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion\nD. The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters\n"

When proteins are digested in the stomach and small intestine, they break down into smaller peptides ( such as dipeptides (two amino acids linked together) and tripeptides (three amino acids linked together). Eventually, these peptides and free amino acids can be absorbed through the intestinal walls into the bloodstream. While some amino acids can be absorbed directly, many are first need to be transported into enterocytes (intestinal cells) as di- or tripeptides before being broken down further and absorbed."
