The Mediterranean diet\n\nResearch suggests that the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil, while limiting red meat and added sugars, may show promise in preventing age-related cognitive decline. This diet has been associated with a lower risk of developing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. However, more research is needed to fully understand the specific mechanisms by which this diet impacts cognitive health. It's important to note that no single diet guarantees prevention of cognitive decline, but a healthy, balanced diet can certainly contribute positively to overall health and well-being."
