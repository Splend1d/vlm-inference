                    "text": "The intellectual foundations of the eighteenth-century political revolutions were based on C. the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was a philosophical movement that emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism towards traditional institutions and social norms. It influenced many aspects of society, including politics, law, and ethics. Key figures from this period include John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, and Immanuel Kant, among others. Their ideas contributed significantly to the development of modern democratic principles and the critique of absolute monarchies, which was a prevalent form of government at the time. This led directly to the American Revolution and the French Revolution, where Enlightenment ideals such as liberty, equality, and fraternity played a central role."
