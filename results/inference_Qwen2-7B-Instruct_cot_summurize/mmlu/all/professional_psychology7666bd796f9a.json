This concept suggests that the presence of others can increase an individual's motivation, arousal, and anxiety, which can lead to better performance on simple or well-learned tasks. However, it can also lead to poorer performance on complex or novel tasks due to the added stress and pressure.\n\nIt's important to note that this effect isn't universally true for all individuals or all types of tasks. Some people might experience a decrease in performance (a phenomenon known as \"social inhibition,\" especially when the task is new or challenging and they fear judgment from others. The context, the nature of the task, and the individual's personality traits all play a role in how social presence affects performance."
