They are more efficient when run at high temperatures because the efficiency of a heat engine is largely determined by the temperature difference between its hot and cold reservoirs (this is described by the Carnot efficiency formula. In practical terms, higher operating temperatures allow for greater energy conversion efficiency. However, it's important to note that running at high temperatures also poses challenges related to material strength and durability, which must be managed in the design of the engine."
