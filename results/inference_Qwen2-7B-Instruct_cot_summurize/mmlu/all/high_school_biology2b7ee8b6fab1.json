Differences in the timing and expression levels of different genes leads to structural and functional differences.\n\nCell differentiation in vertebrates (and indeed all multicellular organisms - involves the activation or repression of specific genes within a cell, leading to the production of proteins that are characteristic of that cell type. This is controlled by complex regulatory mechanisms including transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, and signaling pathways. The timing and expression levels of these genes are crucial for proper development and function of different cell types and tissues. \n\nOption A is partially correct; while it's true that cells in different tissues can contain different sets of genes due to genomic imprinting and gene regulation, the key aspect is how those genes are expressed rather than just being present or absent.\n\nOption C refers to issues related to translation, which is not the primary driver of cell differentiation in terms of creating distinct cell types with specialized functions. \n\nOption D suggests that differences between tissues result from spontaneous morphogenesis, which does not accurately describe the regulated process of differentiation where gene expression patterns determine cell fate.\n\nTherefore, option B best captures the core mechanism behind cell differentiation in vertebrates: the differential expression of genes leading to structural and functional differences among cells."
