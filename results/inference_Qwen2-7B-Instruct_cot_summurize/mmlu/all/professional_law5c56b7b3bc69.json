The summons and complaint were served at the stockbroker's office in State B, where the process server handed the documents to the stockbroker's administrative assistant. The stockbroker has answered the complaint, asserting the defense of improper service of process. Assume that both states' requirements for service of process are identical to the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Is the court likely to dismiss the action for improper service of process?\n\nA. No, because service was made on a person of suitable age found at the stockbroker's place of employment.\nB. No, because the stockbroker waived her claim for improper service of process by asserting it in her answer.\nC. Yes, because an individual defendant may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at the defendant's place of employment.\nD. Yes, because the process of State A courts is not effective in State B.\n"

Yes, because an individual defendant may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at the defendant's place of employment.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ( Rule 4, service of process must be made upon a defendant \"personally\" or in certain specified ways when personal delivery is not feasible. Serving a document on a third party, such as an administrative assistant, does not meet this requirement, especially if the document is not accepted personally by the defendant. The stockbroker has asserted the defense of improper service of process, which is generally preserved even if raised in an answer rather than a motion to dismiss. Therefore, the court is likely to find that the service was improper and may dismiss the action based on this ground."
