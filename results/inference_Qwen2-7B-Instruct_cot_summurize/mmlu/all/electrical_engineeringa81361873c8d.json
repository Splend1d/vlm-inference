These devices have a low impedance at their rated clamping voltage, allowing them to effectively conduct and dissipate excess voltage. However, when the voltage exceeds their clamping voltage, they still maintain a relatively high impedance beyond that point to prevent excessive current flow and protect the circuit. This allows them to perform their protective function without significantly affecting the normal operation of the circuit under normal voltage conditions."
