The object will float when the weight of the water it displaces is equal to its own weight.\n\nThe volume of water displaced by the object is equal to the submerged volume of the object. Since the object floats, the weight of the water it displaces (which is equal to the volume of water displaced times the density of water (times gravity (Wd = V * \u03c1_water * g) must be equal to the object's weight.\n\nGiven:\n- Weight of the object (W = 6 N\n- Volume of the object V_obj = 2 x 10^-3 m^3\n- Density of water \u03c1_water = 1000 kg/m^3\n- Acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m/s^2\n\nFirst, calculate the volume of water displaced (V_displaced:\n\\[ W_d = V_{displaced} \\cdot \\rho_{water} \\cdot g \\]\n\\[ 6 N = V_{displaced} \\cdot 1000 \\frac{kg}{m^3} \\cdot 9.8 \\frac{m}{s^2} \\]\n\\[ V_{displaced} = \\frac{6}{1000 \\cdot 9.8} m^3 \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\(V_{displaced}\\):\n\\[ V_{displaced} = \\frac{6}{9800} m^3 = 6.1224 \\times 10^{-4} m^3 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the percentage of the object's volume that is submerged:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage submerged} = \\left( \\frac{V_{displaced}}{V_{obj}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage submerged} = \\left( \\frac{6.1224 \\times 10^{-4} m^3}{2 \\times 10^{-3} m^3} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage submerged} = 30.612\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, approximately 30.612% of the object's volume is submerged in the water. This means that the remaining percentage of the object's volume is above the water surface.\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage above water} = 100\\% - \\text{Percentage submerged} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage above water} = 100\\% - 30.612\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage above water} = 69.388\\% \\]\n\nSo, the closest answer choice to 69.388% is D. 70%."
