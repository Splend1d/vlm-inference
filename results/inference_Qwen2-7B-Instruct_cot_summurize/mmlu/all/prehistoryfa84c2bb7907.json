While it's challenging to definitively state their exact purpose without extensive study and translation, options A, C, and D are presented can all be considered plausible depending on the findings.\n\nHowever, given the context of ancient civilizations, option B is less likely because the Moche civilization is known for its sophisticated culture that included various forms of artistic expression, including pottery, textiles, and metalwork. The markings on the mud-bricks are more likely to have served functional, symbolic, or even religious purposes rather than being purely random.\n\nOption A ( instructions for the builders, could be correct if the markings contain specific details about construction techniques, materials, or assembly instructions.\n\nOption C, identifying the local group that produced them, is also plausible as ancient societies often marked their artifacts with symbols or signs to indicate ownership, origin, or group identity.\n\nOption D, simple arithmetic performed by carpenters on the building site, could be true, especially if the markings include numerical values related to measurements, quantities, or weights.\n\nGiven the lack of definitive information, the most accurate answer would be that they are likely to serve multiple purposes, combining elements of all these possibilities. For instance, they might include both functional instructions and symbolic identifiers, along with possibly some form of record-keeping or simple arithmetic. Therefore, without further archaeological research and analysis, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact nature of these markings. However, options A, C, and D all align with what we might reasonably expect from such ancient inscriptions."
