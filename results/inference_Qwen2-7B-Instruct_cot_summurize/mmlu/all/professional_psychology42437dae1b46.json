This ensures that the client's rights to privacy and autonomy are respected. The Canadian Code of Ethics also emphasizes the importance of client confidentiality and informed consent in professional relationships, which alignss with this principle.\n\nIt is crucial to maintain the client's trust and respect their autonomy throughout the therapeutic process, including when seeking consultation. While it might seem that consulting with a colleague could be beneficial for the client, the primary consideration should always be the client's rights and comfort with the information being shared."
