The Dartos muscle is actually found in the male breast, serving to cover and protect the underlying fat and glandular tissue. In females, the internal structures of the breast include:\n\nA. Breast lobules - These are clusters of milk-producing glands.\nB. Lactiferous ducts - These are tubes that carry milk from the lobules to the nipple.\nC. Lactiferous sinuses - These are dilated portions of the lactiferous ducts where milk is stored before it is expressed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Dartos Muscle."
