The contractor decided to submit a bid to do the construction. The contractor contacted all of the subcontractors she had worked with in the past, informed them of the specifics of the school construction project, and asked each to submit a bid for the work they would be requested to perform. An insulation company submitted a bid of $25,000 to do the required insulation work in the new school. Based on that and other subcontract bids, the contractor prepared a general bid and submitted it to the city. Three days after the contractor submitted the bid to the city, the insulation company notified the contractor that it had overbooked its workforce and would be unable to perform the insulation work. The next day, the city notified the contractor that she had won the bid to build the school. The contractor was forced to find another company to do the insulation work. The other company charged the contractor $30,000 to do the insulation. Which of the following arguments best supports the claim for $5,000 by the contractor against the insulation company?\n\nA. The contractor had made an offer to the insulation company that the latter accepted when it submitted its bid.\nB. The insulation company had made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city.\nC. The insulation company's bid was an offer that it was obligated to hold open, because the insulation company and the contractor were merchants.\nD. An option contract was created, because the contractor used the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city and notified the insulation company of that fact.\n"

The contractor then used this bid as part of their calculation when preparing and submitting their overall bid to the city. By doing so, the contractor effectively \"accepted\" the insulation company's offer by incorporating its price into their own bid, thus creating a binding agreement between the two parties. When the insulation company reneged on its commitment due to overbooking, it breached this agreement, leaving the contractor to seek out alternative options at a higher cost ($30,000) to complete the work.\n\nUnder commercial law, merchants ( which typically includes companies involved in construction and contracting like the insulation company and the contractor in this case - are expected to honor their commitments unless there is a valid reason for non-performance, such as unforeseen circumstances that could not have been anticipated at the time of the offer. The fact that the insulation company was a merchant further strengthens the argument that it should be held to the terms of its original offer, especially since the contractor relied on this offer to secure the larger contract with the city.\n\nTherefore, argument C (states that the insulation company's bid was an offer that it was obligated to hold open because the insulation company and the contractor were merchants, provides the strongest legal basis for the contractor's claim."
