It explores the meaning of concepts such as truth, justice, beauty, and morality, and it examines the validity and justification of beliefs and actions across different cultural, philosophical, and ethical perspectives. Philosophers also consider the limits and potential of reason and logic in understanding the world. Therefore, option B best captures the essence of philosophy's focus on beliefs and their justifications."
