They actually contain a significant fraction of non-gaseous matter.\n\nWhile Jupiter and the other jovian planets (Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are often referred to as \"gas giants,\" this term can be somewhat misleading because it suggests that these planets are composed entirely of gases like hydrogen and helium. However, they also have substantial amounts of solid and liquid materials within their structures.\n\nThese planets have an atmosphere made mostly of hydrogen and helium, but beneath the atmospheres, there is a layer of ices ( such as water, ammonia, and methane, which under the high pressures and temperatures found at the cores of these planets, behave more like solids than liquids. The innermost part of these planets, known as the core, is thought to consist of heavy elements like iron and rock. Therefore, the term \"gas giant\" might give the impression that these planets are entirely gaseous, when in fact, they contain a significant fraction of non-gaseous matter."
