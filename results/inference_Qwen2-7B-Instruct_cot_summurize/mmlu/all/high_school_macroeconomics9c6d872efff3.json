Gold bars in secure locations like Fort Knox\n\nThe U.S. dollar's value was historically tied to gold through the Bretton Woods system until 1971 when President Nixon suspended the convertibility of the US dollar into gold. However, in the context of the question, option B refers to the historical backing of the US dollar with gold, which provided insurance for the value of the dollar. Currently, the value of the US dollar is primarily backed by the economic strength and creditworthiness of the United States, rather than any physical commodity like gold."
