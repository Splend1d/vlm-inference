Pursuant to that law, a woman sued a local newspaper in state court after the newspaper identified her as a rape victim. The state trial and appellate courts rejected the claim, holding that the state law was invalid under both the state constitution and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The state supreme court affirmed, holding specifically: \"We think that this well-intentioned law very likely violates the First Amendment of the federal Constitution. We need not, however, decide that issue, because the law assuredly violates our state constitution, which provides even greater protection to the right of the press to report the news.\" The woman petitioned for review in the U.S. Supreme Court. Is the U.S. Supreme Court likely to review the state supreme court judgment?\n\nA. No, because the First Amendment prohibits the imposition of liability for the publication of truthful information.\nB. No, because the judgment of the state supreme court rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground.\nC. Yes, because the supremacy clause does not permit a state to create rights greater than those conferred by the federal Constitution.\nD. Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction extends to cases arising under federal law.\n"

No, because the judgment of the state supreme court rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground.\n\nIn this case, the U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to review the state supreme court judgment based on the principle of federalism and the doctrine of comity. The state supreme court's decision was grounded in the state constitution, which provided greater protection to the right of the press than the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Since the state court's decision was based on an independent state law ground, it would be inappropriate for the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in the matter. This principle ensures that state courts have the authority to interpret their own constitutions independently unless there is a clear federal question or constitutional issue at stake that requires federal review."
