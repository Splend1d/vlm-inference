Internal\n\nInternal control refers to the belief that one has control over their life and the events that happen to them, rather than feeling that these events are determined by external factors or luck. Research suggests that individuals with an internal locus of control tend to have better mental health, higher self-esteem, and greater resilience in the face of adversity. This can contribute to overall well-being and health, including physical and mental health outcomes."
