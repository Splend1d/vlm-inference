The situation is not clear-cut, but an act of parliament would most probably be required for the incorporation of customary crimes into English law.\n\nEnglish law does incorporate international law, including customary international law, where it conflicts with or complements existing domestic law. However, this incorporation is not automatic and depends on several factors. The process of incorporating international law into domestic law typically involves parliamentary legislation. Acts of Parliament are used to clarify, amend, or apply international law within the domestic legal system, especially when dealing with areas such as human rights, environmental law, and criminal law.\n\nTherefore, while English courts can interpret and apply international law (including customary international law) in certain cases, there is no direct mechanism for automatic incorporation of customary crimes through treaties alone, as suggested in option B. The courts do not have the power to incorporate international law without legislative authorization, which often comes in the form of an Act of Parliament. This ensures that such incorporations are subject to democratic oversight and debate."
