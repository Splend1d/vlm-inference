However, given her general stance in discussions of similar cases ( often referred to as the \"trolley problem\" or variations thereof, which involve complex scenarios involving potential harm to individuals for the greater good, it's possible to infer her position on this particular scenario:\n\nIf we consider the scenario where the violinist only needs your kidneys for one hour, Thomson might argue that:\n\nD. even though you ought to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, we should not conclude that he or she has a right to use your kidneys for that hour.\n\nThis choice reflects Thomson's view that while there might be a moral duty to help the violinist survive in this specific, temporary need, the act itself does not automatically confer a right. Rights typically require a broader context of entitlement, including a claim that is recognized by society or institutionalized through law, which is not necessarily present in such a narrow, specific, and potentially coercive situation. Thomson would likely emphasize the importance of voluntariness and the context of consent, suggesting that while the violinist might morally require your assistance, the act of using your body without your explicit consent does not align with the concept of having a right to do so."
