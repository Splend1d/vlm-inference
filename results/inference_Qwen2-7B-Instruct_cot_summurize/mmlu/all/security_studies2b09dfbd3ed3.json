'A nation is secure to the extent to which it is not in danger of having to sacrifice core values if it wishes to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by victory in such a war.' Lippman, W.\nB. 'Security itself is a relative freedom from war, coupled with a relatively high expectation that defeat will not be a consequence of any war that should occur.' Bellamy, M.\nC. 'Emancipation is the freeing of people (as individuals and groups) from the physical and human constraints which stop them carrying out what they would freely choose to do . . . Security and emancipation are two sides of the same coin. Emancipation, not power or order, produces true security. Emancipation, theoretically, is security.' Booth, K.\nD. None of the above\n"

Security and emancipation are two sides of the same coin. Emancipation, not power or order, produces true security. Emancipation, theoretically, is security.' Booth, K.\n\nThis quote best captures the contemporary understanding of security in the field of Security Studies. It suggests that security is not merely about military strength or freedom from war, but rather about the ability of individuals and groups to act freely without constraints imposed by external forces. This aligns with the broader shift towards a human security perspective, which emphasizes protection from violence and threats to personal safety, health, and well-being."
