Let's break down each point:\n\nA. The division of the world into several rival overseas empires: The 19th century saw the height of colonialism, with European powers competing for colonies and territories around the globe. This led to complex geopolitical rivalries that could escalate into conflict over territorial disputes or control of resources.\n\nB. Industrialization providing better transport, technology, and administration: The Industrial Revolution transformed societies by introducing new technologies such as steam engines, railroads, and improved weaponry. These advancements made it easier to mobilize large armies and conduct warfare on a massive scale, as well as facilitated rapid communication and transportation of troops and supplies. Better administrative systems also allowed for more efficient management of resources during wartime.\n\nC. Intense economic, political, and military competition: As nations developed economically and militarily, they often engaged in competition for resources, markets, and influence. This rivalry could lead to tensions and conflicts if one nation felt its interests were threatened by another's actions. Economic disparities and political ideologies (such as nationalism and imperialism) also contributed to the potential for conflict.\n\nThese factors combined to create an environment where war between nation-states became more feasible and potentially destructive on a larger scale than in previous centuries."
