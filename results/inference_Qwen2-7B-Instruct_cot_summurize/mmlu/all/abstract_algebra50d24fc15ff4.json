According to the definition of group theory, for any two groups \\(G\\) and \\(G'\\), there always exists at least one homomorphism from \\(G\\) into \\(G'\\). A homomorphism between two groups \\(G\\) and \\(G'\\) with binary operations \\(*\\) and \\(\\circ\\), respectively, is a function \\(f: G \\to G'\\) such that for all \\(a, b \\in G\\), \\(f(a * b) = f(a) \\circ f(b)\\). The trivial homomorphism, which maps every element of \\(G\\) to the identity element of \\(G'\\), is always a valid homomorphism.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is false. Not every homomorphism is a one-to-one (injective) map. While it's true that some homomorphisms are injective, others can be surjective, or even neither, depending on the specific structure of the groups involved. For example, consider the homomorphism \\(f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}\\) defined by \\(f(k) = [k]_n\\), where \\([k]_n\\) denotes the equivalence class of \\(k\\) modulo \\(n\\). This is an epimorphism (onto) but not necessarily an injection unless \\(n = 1\\)."
