This concept is crucial in explaining the law of demand because it helps to illustrate why consumers are willing to pay less for additional units of a good (as they consume more and the marginal utility decreases. As the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded increases because the marginal utility per dollar spent remains relatively high, and thus the consumer gains more satisfaction per dollar spent. Conversely, at higher prices, the marginal utility per dollar decreases, leading to lower demand."
