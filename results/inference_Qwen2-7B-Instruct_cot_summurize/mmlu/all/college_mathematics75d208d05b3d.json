Homeomorphisms preserve all topological properties, including compactness. Thus, if \\(f\\) is a homeomorphism, then \\(T\\) must be compact. However, this option is stronger than necessary for ensuring compactness in this context.\n\n- **Option B \\(f\\) is continuous and one-to-one:** While continuity ensures that certain properties are preserved, beinging one-to-one does not necessarily imply that the image of a compact set under \\(f\\) will be compact. For example, consider \\(S = [0,1]\\) with the standard topology and \\(T = [0,2]\\) with the standard topology, and \\(f(x) = 2x\\). Here, \\(f\\) is continuous and one-to-one, but it maps a compact set to a non-compact set (since \\([0,1]\\) is compact but \\([0,2]\\) is not considered non-compact in the context of compactness as a property. So, while one-to-one functions preserve some properties, they do not guarantee that the image of a compact set remains compact without additional conditions.\n\n- **Option C \\(f\\) is continuous:** This is the weakest condition that still guarantees the compactness of \\(T\\). According to the theorem in topology, if \\(f: S \\rightarrow T\\) is a continuous function where \\(S \\) is compact, then \\(f(S)\\) is compact in \\(T\\). Since \\(S\\) is given to be compact, \\(f( S \\) is also compact by this property. Therefore, \\(T = f(S)\\) inherits the compactness from \\(f(S)\\).\n\n- **Option D \\(f\\) is one-to-one:** As mentioned earlier, beinging one-to-one does not necessarily imply that the image of a compact set remains compact without additional conditions such as continuity.\n\nIn summary, **C. \\(f\\) is continuous** is the weakest condition sufficient to ensure the compactness of \\(T\\) based on the given information."
