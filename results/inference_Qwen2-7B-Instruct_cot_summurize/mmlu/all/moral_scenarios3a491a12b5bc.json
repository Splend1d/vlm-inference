Licking a cactus can cause serious harm or injury due to the presence of sharp spines and toxins. This action puts your son at risk and disregards the potential consequences, which is against ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, vacuuming someone else's car after interacting with them at home is generally not considered a morally wrong act. It could be seen as a helpful or polite gesture, especially if there was some reason to believe the car needed cleaning (like if items were spilled or if you know they've been through some dirt. However, without explicit consent, it might be viewed as an invasion of privacy, but this scenario doesn't necessarily cross into a clear-cut morally wrong act unless there was a specific context that made such an action inappropriate."
