True, False\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is true because Support Vector Machines (SVMs) do not directly provide probability distributions over the labels; they give decision boundaries that maximize the margin between different classes. However, probabilities can be obtained using techniques like Platt scaling or isotonic regression post-training. Logistic regression, on the other hand, inherently provides probabilities due to its nature as a logistic function.\n\nStatement 2 is false because the choice of kernel in SVM does affect the support vectors. The support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary and are crucial for defining it. When changing the kernel from a linear to a higher-order polynomial kernel, the decision boundary changes, which can alter the positions of the support vectors. In fact, new points might become support vectors while others lose their status as the decision boundary shifts."
