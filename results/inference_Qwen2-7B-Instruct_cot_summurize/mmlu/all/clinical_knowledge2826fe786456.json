Using water may cause electrolyte imbalance.\n\nWater, when used for bladder washout, might not contain the necessary electrolytes that are typically present in the body fluids. This can lead to an imbalance of electrolytes, which can have detrimental effects on the patient's health. It's important to use a solution that mimics the properties of the urinary tract's natural fluid to prevent such imbalances."
