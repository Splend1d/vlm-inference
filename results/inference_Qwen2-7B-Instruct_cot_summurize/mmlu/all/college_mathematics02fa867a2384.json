                    "text": "To determine which statement(s) is(are true about the binary structure \\((\\mathbb{Z}, \\cdot)\\), let's examine each statement:\n\n### Statement I: The structure is not a group since the operation is not associative.\n\nFor a set with an operation to be a group, it must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. We need to check if the operation \\(\\cdot\\) is associative, meaning that for all \\(a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\((a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot ( (b \\cdot c)\\).\n\nLet's test this property:\n- Left-hand side: \\((a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = ( (m + n + mn) \\cdot c = ( (m+n+mn) + c + ( (m+n+mn)c = m + n + mn + c + mc + nc + mnc\\)\n- Right-hand side: \\(a \\cdot (b \\cdot c) = a \\cdot ( (m + n + mn) = a + ( (m + n + mn) + a(m + n + mn) = a + m + n + mn + am + an + amn\\)\n\nClearly, \\((a \\cdot b) \\cdot c \\neq a \\cdot ( (b \\cdot c)\\), showing that the operation is not associative. Therefore, **Statement I is true**.\n\n### Statement II: The structure is not a group since there is no identity element.\n\nAn identity element \\(e\\) in a group must satisfy \\(a \\cdot e = e \\cdot a = a\\) for any \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Let's see if we can find such an element \\(e\\):\n\n\\[a \\cdot e = a + e + ae = a\\]\n\nRearranging gives us \\(e + ae = 0\\), or \\(e(1 + a) = 0\\). For this to hold for all \\(a\\), \\(e\\) must be \\(0\\) (since if \\(e\\) were anything else, we wouldn't be able to satisfy the equation for all integers \\(a\\). \n\nThus, \\(0\\) acts as the identity element, satisfying \\(a \\cdot 0 = a\\). Therefore, **Statement II is false**.\n\n### Statement III: The structure is not a group since not all elements have an inverse.\n\nFor every element \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), there must exist an inverse \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element. We already established that \\(0\\) is the identity element.\n\nLet's consider finding an inverse for a general \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\):\n\\[a \\cdot b = a + b + ab = 0\\]\nRearranging gives \\(ab + b = -a\\), or \\(b(a + 1) = -a\\). For \\(b\\) to exist for all \\(a\\), this equation must hold for any \\(a\\). However, given that \\(a\\) can be any integer, \\(b\\) cannot universally satisfy this equation for all \\(a\\) due to the dependency on \\(a\\)'s value.\n\nThus, not all elements have inverses under this operation, making **Statement III true**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement I is true because the operation is not associative.\n- Statement II is false because \\(0\\) serves as the identity element.\n- Statement III is true because not all elements have inverses under this operation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. I and III only**."
