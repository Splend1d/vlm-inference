The following day, the man conveys the property to his sister; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the man executes an identical conveyance of the farm to a friend. The friend gives the man a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the sister. The sister, however, records her deed on February 6. The friend then conveys his interest in the farm to a farmer, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the friend. On February 5, the farmer purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the sister and duly records the deed. If the property in question was located in a state having a notice-type statute, which of the following parties would ultimately prevail?\n\nA. The farmer.\nB. The sister.\nC. The friend.\nD. The man.\n"

Therefore, in this scenario:\n\n- The friend recorded their deed on February 4, making them the first party to have their interest in the property officially recognized by the public records.\n- The sister, although she recorded her deed on February 6, did so after the friend.\n\nThus, under the principles of a notice-type statute, the farmer, who purchased the property from the friend (the first recorded owner, would ultimately prevail.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. The farmer."
