                    "text": "The correct answer is not directly listed in your options, but it can be deduced from economic theory. According to Keynesian economics and the concept of marginal propensity to consume ( (MPC), which is the proportion of additional income that is spent on consumption, when disposable income increases by $X:\n\n- Consumption will increase, but it's not necessarily true that it will increase by more than $X. The increase in consumption depends on the individual's or economy's MPC. If the MPC is high, then consumption might increase by a significant portion of $X, possibly close to $X if the individual spends nearly all extra income. However, if the MPC is low, consumption might increase by much less than $X.\n\n- Savings would then be the remainder of the increase in income after consumption. So, if consumption increases by less than $X, savings would increase by the difference, which could be less than $X if the MPC is low, or more than $X if the MPC is close to 1.\n\nTherefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D accurately represents a universally true statement for all individuals or economies. However, if we had to choose the option that best aligns with general economic principles, the closest answer would be:\n\nB. Saving increases by less than $X. This implies that after a certain point ( typically determined by the MPC, an increase in income leads to a smaller increase in savings as more income is allocated towards consumption."
