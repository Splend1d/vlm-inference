Meat and Dairy products\n\nRising incomes and urbanization typically lead to changes in dietary patterns as people have more purchasing power and access to a wider variety of foods. This often results in an increased consumption of meat and dairy products, as these are higher on the food expenditure curve compared to staple foods like grains, roots, tubers, fruits, and vegetables. People may opt for these protein-rich foods as part of a healthier or more varied diet, or due to cultural shifts that place greater value on meat consumption."
