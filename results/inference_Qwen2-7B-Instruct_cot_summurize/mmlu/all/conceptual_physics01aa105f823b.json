In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit for measuring energy, including heat, is the joule (J). However, in some fields such as nutrition or food science, the calorie (cal) is still commonly used.\n\n1 calorie is defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius at a pressure of 1 atmosphere. It's worth noting that there are slight differences between the calorie used in nutrition (the \"International Table (IT) calorie\" which is approximately 4.184 kilojoules, and the joule itself.\n\n1 joule is defined as the work done when a force of 1 newton is applied over a distance of 1 meter, and it's equal to approximately 0.239 cal (IT.\n\nSo while the question might be asking for the more appropriate term in a theoretical context, in practical terms, the answer could be either depending on the specific context of measurement."
