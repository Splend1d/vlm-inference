Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the act of allowing your dog to hump other dogs at a dog park is generally considered disrespectful and potentially harmful to the other dogs' well-being, as it can cause physical discomfort or injury and may not be welcomed by their owners. This behavior could lead to social issues within the community, such as strained relationships with other dog owners or potential legal implications if injuries occur. Therefore, this action is considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, puttingtering your son's dishes in the dishwasher and starting it is a helpful and practical act. It demonstrates care for your son's needs by ensuring his dishes are cleaned. There is no harm intended, and it is an everyday task that contributes positively to household management. Thus, this action is not considered morally wrong."
