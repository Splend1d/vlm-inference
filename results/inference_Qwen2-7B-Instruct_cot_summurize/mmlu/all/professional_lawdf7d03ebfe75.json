They were worried that the rugby club would be forced to disband because the law school had withdrawn its sponsorship. While the student was discussing the problem with his teammates, the owner of the tavern approached the players. The owner indicated that he was interested in sponsoring the rugby club because he felt it would help business at the pub. During their ensuing discussion, the owner agreed to sponsor the rugby club. The parties then orally agreed that the owner \"would pay for all the usual sponsoring fees\" incurred by the club. The owner had understood the agreement to mean that he would pay for the rugby shirts and supply the keg of beer following each \"home\" game that the rugby club played. Conversely, the student thought that the owner would be reimbursing the team for (a) the shirts, (b) the keg of beer (following \"home\" games), as well as (c) transportation expenses for \"away\" games and (d) equipment expenses (balls, etc. ). Assume that it was the customary practice of the rugby teams in the community to have the sponsors pay for (a) the shirts and (b) beer only. Before the rugby club was to play its first game under the owner's sponsorship, which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the legal relationship between the parties?\n\nA. A contract exists on the terms understood by the owner.\nB. A contract exists on the terms understood by the student.\nC. A contract exists on the terms that are customary for the other teams in the community.\nD. No contract exists.\n"

A contract exists on the terms understood by the owner.\n\nUnder the doctrine of \"part performance,\" where one party has relied on an oral promise to their detriment, a contract can be formed even if there is no formal written agreement. In this scenario, the owner was induced to enter into a sponsorship based on the oral agreement, and he acted upon that understanding by agreeing to cover the costs of the rugby shirts and the keg of beer following \"home\" games. This action constitutes part performance, which can validate an oral contract.\n\nThe student's expectations regarding reimbursement for transportation and equipment expenses do not affect the enforceability of the contract as understood by the owner. Since the owner believed he was entering into a contract to cover specific costs and did so based on those beliefs, the contract is enforceable according to the terms the owner understood."
