The protein requirement is equal to the demand multiplied by the efficiency of utilization.\n\nThis is because the actual amount of protein that an organism needs (the requirement) takes into account not only how much protein it needs based on its metabolic demands (the demand), but also how efficiently the body can use the protein provided (the efficiency of utilization. If the efficiency of utilization is less than 100%, then more protein than the simple demand would be required to meet the actual need."
