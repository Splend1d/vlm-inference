He proposed the concept of the \"Growth Zone\" model, which depicted cities as expanding in concentric circles or rings around a central business district (also known as the \"central business district\" or CBD. This model, often referred to as the \"Burgess Model,\" includes several zones such as the residential zone, the transition zone, the industrial zone, and the recreational zone, each expanding outward from the CBD.\n\nRostow was an economist, Ravenstein was a French geographer who developed the laws of migration, and Von Th\u00fcnen was a German economist who developed the theory of location of agricultural land use, none of whom focused on the concentric zones of urban growth specifically in the way Burgess did."
