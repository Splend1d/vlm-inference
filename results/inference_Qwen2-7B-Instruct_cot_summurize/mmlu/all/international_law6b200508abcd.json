This means that it encompasses military operations involving the use of armed forces or armed personnel. Therefore, the correct interpretation would be closest to option A: \"Armed attack includes all types of armed force.\" \n\nArticle 51 states that \"nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.\" This clause allows for the use of force in self-defense in response to an armed attack, but it does not explicitly grant the right to invade another state.\n\nIt's important to note that while the term 'armed attack' might be interpreted broadly to include various forms of armed conflict, it specifically excludes non-military forms of aggression such as economic sanctions or cyber-attacks unless they result in a physical threat that can be considered an armed attack. Additionally, the use of force must adhere to the principles of necessity and proportionality, as well as respect for international law."
