The path, made of concrete, led through the woods from a public highway to a pond in the rear of the woman's property. The pathway was used for sledding and the pond for skating by the residents of the neighboring areas, without the consent of the woman. Furthermore, the woman failed to post any signs forbidding trespassing. After the boy had been sledding down the pathway for approximately three hours one morning, he lost control of the sled, and steered it into a tree. The boy suffered serious injuries in the crash. If a suit is brought on the boy's behalf against the woman for the boy's personal injuries, the plaintiff will\n\nA. recover, under the \"attractive nuisance\" doctrine.\nB. recover, because the woman knew or should have known of the frequent trespasses.\nC. not recover, because the boy was a trespasser.\nD. not recover, because a 15-year-old boy should have realized the risk.\n"

This doctrine is based on the understanding that children may lack the maturity to recognize the risks associated with certain activities or objects, particularly those that might be considered attractive nuisances.\n\nIn this scenario, the pathway and the pond are likely considered attractive nuisances because they are used for recreational activities (sledding and skating respectively, which are would naturally attract children. Additionally, the fact that the woman failed to post any signs forbidding trespassing could also play a role in the case, as it indicates a lack of reasonable measures taken to prevent children from entering her property.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that laws regarding attractive nuisances vary by jurisdiction, and there may be other factors specific to the case that could influence the outcome. For example, the specific circumstances of how often the boy had used the pathway, his age, and whether he was aware of the potential dangers could all be considered by the court. Nonetheless, under general principles, the attractive nuisance doctrine seems like the most applicable doctrine here, leading to the conclusion that the plaintiff might recover damages."
