This period includes preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) which helps in maturation of the follicle and eventual release of the egg during ovulation. The conditions in the fallopian tubes, including temperature, fluid composition, and movement, are optimized to facilitate sperm survival and egg transport."
