Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, feeding your cat once a month with one small bowl of food might not be considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards, assuming it is an unintended oversight or a result of circumstances beyond your control ( such as financial hardship. However, it could be seen as neglectful if it consistently leads to your cat not receiving adequate nutrition, but without that context, it's generally not viewed as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, allowing a child to catch frogs can often be considered morally wrong, especially if it involves causing harm to the frogs, either directly or through environmental disruption. The treatment and care given to animals should generally include minimizing harm and promoting their well-being, which might not be guaranteed when engaging in activities like frog catching, particularly for recreational purposes. Therefore, while the act might not always be illegal, it can often be seen as morally questionable based on current US societal norms."
