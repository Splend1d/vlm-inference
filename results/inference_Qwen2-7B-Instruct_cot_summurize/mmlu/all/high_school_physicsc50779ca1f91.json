The net charge has become more negative.\nC. The net charge has not changed.\nD.

The net charge has not changed.\n\nWhen the circuit is connected and the light bulb lights up, the electrons flow through the circuit from the negative terminal of the battery to the filament of the light bulb. This does not change the total amount of charge in the system; it merely redistributes the charge among the components of the circuit (battery, wires, and light bulb. The electrons that leave the battery go into the bulb, but an equal number of electrons come off the bulb as it gives off light. Therefore, the net charge on the circuit elements remains the same."
