Money demand is nearly perfectly elastic.\n\nWhen money demand is nearly perfectly elastic, it means that a small change in interest rates will cause a large change in the amount of money demanded. This makes it difficult for a central bank to lower interest rates as much as it wants to stimulate the economy through expansionary monetary policy because people will still hold onto their money rather than borrow or spend it. This limits the effectiveness of lowering interest rates as a tool for stimulating economic activity."
