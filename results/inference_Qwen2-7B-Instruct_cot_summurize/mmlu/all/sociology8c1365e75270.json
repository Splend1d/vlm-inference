It involves the reduction of barriers to trade, investment, and communication, leading to the spread of goods, services, ideas, and people across borders.\n\nAn increasing awareness of the world as a whole ( (A) is a feature of globalization, as it promotes greater knowledge and understanding of different cultures, societies, and economies.\n\nThe destruction of distance through communications technologies ( (C) is also a feature of globalization, as it enables instant communication and information sharing across vast distances.\n\nThe stretching of social relations beyond national boundaries ( (D) is another feature of globalization, as it leads to the formation of global networks and communities that transcend traditional national boundaries.\n\nHowever, the extended power of nation states is not typically considered a feature of globalization. While globalization does involve the integration of national economies into a larger global economy, it does not necessarily lead to the extension of nation-state power. In fact, some argue that globalization has led to a decline in the power of nation-states due to increased competition from multinational corporations and other global actors."
