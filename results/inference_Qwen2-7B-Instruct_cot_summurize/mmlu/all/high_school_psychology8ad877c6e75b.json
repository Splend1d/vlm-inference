Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules.\n\nVariable ratio schedules provide rewards at unpredictable intervals, which often leads to higher and more consistent levels of behavior compared to fixed ratio schedules, where rewards occur after a set number of responses. This unpredictability makes it harder for subjects to learn when the next reward is coming, thus making the schedule more resistant to extinction. \n\nTo clarify why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. While fixed ratio schedules can require more time to reach a certain level of performance ( because they require a specific number of responses before reinforcement, this is not a reason a researcher would choose a variable ratio schedule over a fixed one. It's more about the nature of the schedules and their effects on behavior.\n\nB. The claim that variable ratio schedules produce results more quickly is not accurate. In fact, variable ratio schedules tend to maintain a high rate of response once established, but they do not necessarily lead to faster attainment of a certain level of performance.\n\nC. Generalization and the Premack principle refer to different concepts in learning theory. Generalization refers to the ability to apply learned behaviors to new situations, while the Premack principle suggests that high probability behaviors can be used to increase the occurrence of low probability behaviors. Neither of these principles specifically addresses why one might prefer a variable ratio schedule over a fixed one. Variable ratio schedules are indeed less prone to extinction, which indirectly reduces the likelihood of these phenomena affecting the behavior under study, but they do not directly prevent them."
