Assuming no other factors come into play (such as the bird being endangered or the action harming the bird's well-being), this scenario involves an individual engaging in a potentially amusing but harmless activity with wildlife. There is no clear evidence of wrongdoing here, as it does not cause any harm or exploitation.\n\nThus, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, one scenario involves a clear moral wrong (promoting misinformation about vaccines), while the other does not (feeding a bird a peanut."
