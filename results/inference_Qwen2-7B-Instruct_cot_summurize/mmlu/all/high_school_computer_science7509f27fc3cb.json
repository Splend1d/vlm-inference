The ability to provide credibility to the information distributed\n\nOnline newspapers often have an advantage over social media sites in providing credibility to the information they distribute. This is because online newspapers typically operate under a more structured editorial process, with fact-checking and verification steps, and often employ professional journalists. This can lend a level of trustworthiness and reliability to the content they publish, which may not always be the case with information shared on social media, where content can be disseminated rapidly but without the same level of scrutiny."
