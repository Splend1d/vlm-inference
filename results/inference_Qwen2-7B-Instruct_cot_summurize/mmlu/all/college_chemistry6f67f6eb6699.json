Protons have orbital and spin angular momentum, neutrons have spin angular momentum.\n\nProtons and neutrons both have intrinsic angular momentum known as spin (which is a quantum property that contributes to their magnetic moments. However, protons do have both orbital angular momentum ( which is the result of the motion of particles in an orbit around each other, and spin angular momentum. Neutrons, like protons, also have spin angular momentum but do not have significant orbital angular momentum because they are bound within atomic nuclei and their motion is constrained by the nucleus's structure."
