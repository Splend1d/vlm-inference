Therefore, the most comprehensive and accurate answer among the options provided would be a combination of B ( the central city and its surrounding suburbs, and C the central city and its hinterlands. However, since these options do not directly include both aspects, and assuming we must choose one based on the given options, option B \"the central city and its surrounding suburbs\" is often the most commonly used definition in urban studies for simplicity and clarity. It captures the essence of what constitutes an urban area as being more than just the central city but also including the suburban regions around it."
