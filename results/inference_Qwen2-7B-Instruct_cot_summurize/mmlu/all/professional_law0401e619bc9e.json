In this scenario, the pedestrian's statement was made immediately after witnessing the accident, which suggests they were in a state of excitement or shock due to the event. Therefore, the statement may be considered admissible under the excited utterance exception, assuming it falls within the requirements for such an exception ( like being made spontaneously, without time to deliberate or fabricate, and relate to the startling event itself."
