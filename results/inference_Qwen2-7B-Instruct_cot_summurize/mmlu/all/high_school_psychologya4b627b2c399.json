This includes using appropriate and current assessments that are are valid, reliable, and norm-referenced. Using outdated test forms may not accurately reflect the current abilities or skills of students, potentially leading to misinterpretation of results and inappropriate educational decisions.\n\nOptions A and B involve adapting or supplementing with outdated materials, which may not meet the ethical standards of using current and appropriate assessment tools. Option D, recommending that the assessment be canceled, is not the best course of action since it implies that no assessment should take place, which might not be feasible or necessary based on the situation's needs. \n\nOption C, insisting on using the most recent form of the test, aligns with maintaining professional ethics by ensuring that the assessment tool used is up-to-date, culturally relevant, and scientifically validated, thus providing accurate and fair evaluations of student performance."
