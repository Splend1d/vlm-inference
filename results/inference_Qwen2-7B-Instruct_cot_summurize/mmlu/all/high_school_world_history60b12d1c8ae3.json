A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nBased on the speech, the French saw Africa as which of the following?\n\nA. A collection of republics tottering into anarchy\nB. A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War\nC. Important due to the Sahara's natural resources\nD. A strong political union\n"

Instead, it indicates that they saw Africa as a region with resources, particularly in the Sahara, which could be exploited for their own interests. The mention of \"the scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara\" implies that the French were more concerned with their own strategic objectives rather than respecting African independence or unity. Therefore, option B, \"A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War,\" seems to align better with the perspective that the French might have had, given the context provided in the quote. However, the passage does not explicitly state the French viewed Africa as a resource for enhancing power in the Cold War; it merely highlights the exploitation of resources, which could be a component of their strategy in that broader context."
