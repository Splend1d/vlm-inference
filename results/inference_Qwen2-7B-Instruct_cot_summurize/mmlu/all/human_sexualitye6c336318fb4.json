However, according to multiple studies, the average erect penis length falls within a range that is typically considered to be around 5 to 6 inches. Therefore, the closest answer choice would be:\n\nB. 5 inches\n\nIt's important to note that this is an average measurement, and individual variations are quite common. The size of the penis does not necessarily correlate with sexual performance or pleasure for either partner."
