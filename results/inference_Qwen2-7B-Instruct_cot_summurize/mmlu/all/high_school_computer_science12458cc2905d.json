To determine if students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects, you would need to compare the GPA of computer science majors with those of students in other majors. This comparison can be made by filtering the data set for only computer science majors and then comparing their GPAs to the GPAs of students in other majors.\n\nB. To find out how many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state, you would need to calculate the percentage of female and male computer science majors in each state, then compare these percentages. This involves filtering the data set by state, calculating the gender distribution among computer science majors, and then comparing these distributions.\n\nC. To determine what percent of students attending college in a certain state are majoring in computer science, you would filter the data set for that specific state and then calculate the percentage of students who are majoring in computer science. This requires counting the number of computer science majors in that state and dividing it by the total number of students in that state.\n\nD. To find out which college has the highest number of students majoring in computer science, you would need to group the data set by college and count the number of students majoring in computer science at each college. Then, you would identify the college with the highest count.\n\nIn summary, each of these questions can be answered by analyzing the provided data set through appropriate filtering, grouping, and calculation operations."
