Now of fundamental importance to peace studies as a field of research, the creation of journals was not a prominent feature of the peace studies until late in the twentieth century.\n\nThis statement cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies because it contradicts historical facts. The creation of journals was indeed a prominent feature of peace studies from its inception in the mid-20th century, serving as platforms for scholars to publish their research and share ideas. Journals like \"Peace & Change,\" \"Journal of Peace Research,\" and \"Peace Studies\" were established early on to foster academic discourse in the field."
