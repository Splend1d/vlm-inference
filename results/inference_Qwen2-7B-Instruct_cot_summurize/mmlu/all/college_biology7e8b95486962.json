The innate component refers to the basic song template or the melody structure that is present in the brain of the bird from birth, which is shared across many species. This part of the song is genetically programmed and not influenced by environmental factors.\n\nThe learned component, on the other hand, involves the specific adjustments made to this basic melody based on the songs heard in the environment. Young birds learn their species-specific songs by imitating the songs they hear from adults of their own species. When a young male bird is raised in isolation and hears only the song of a different species, it does not learn its own species' song because it has not been exposed to it. Therefore, the development of its song repertoire is influenced by both its innate programming and the lack of exposure to its own species' song, leading to a song that lacks certain characteristics typical of its own species.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not accurately describe the complex process of song development in birds, as they either suggest that the song is entirely learned (which is not true since there is a genetic basis for song structure, entirely instinctive (which doesn't account for the learning component, or suggests that hormones play a role without providing context about the nature versus nurture debate in song development."
