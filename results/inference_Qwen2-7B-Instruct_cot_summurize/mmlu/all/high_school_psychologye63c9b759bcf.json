Classical conditioning involves pairing stimuli, and operant conditioning involves pairing a response with a stimulus.\nC. Operant conditioning is used to train organisms to perform specific acts, and classical conditioning is used to get organisms to stop performing specific acts.\nD. Classical conditioning is more difficult to use but more effective than operant conditioning.\n"

Classical conditioning involves pairing stimuli, and operant conditioning involves pairing a response with a stimulus. \n\nClassical conditioning, also known as Pavlovian conditioning, occurs when an organism learns to associate two stimuli. For example, in Ivan Pavlov's experiment, dogs learned to associate the sound of a bell (neutral stimulus) with the presentation of food (unconditioned stimulus), eventually salivating at the sound of the bell alone.\n\nOperant conditioning, on the other hand, involves learning through the consequences of behavior. In this type of conditioning, behaviors that lead to positive consequences are more likely to be repeated, while those leading to negative consequences are less likely to be repeated. For example, if a child receives praise (positive reinforcement) for cleaning their room, they are more likely to clean their room again in the future. Conversely, if a child gets a time-out (punishment) for not listening, they are less likely to repeat that behavior."
