Thrombin is an enzyme involved in blood coagulation, specifically in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which forms the clot matrix in a blood clot. \n\nB. Glycosaminoglycans (are components of the extracellular matrix found in connective tissues.\n\nC. Collagens are proteins that make up the majority of connective tissue and provide strength and support.\n\nD. Fibroblasts are cells found in connective tissue that synthesize collagen and other matrix components.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
