Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{max}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{min}}} \\]\n\nGiven that the spectrometer can just barely resolve two wavelengths of 500 nm and 502 nm, we can calculate the resolving power as follows:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{502\\, \\text{nm}}{500\\, \\text{nm}} = 1.004 \\]\n\nHowever, this value does not match any of the options directly because resolving power is typically quoted in units of \"lines per millimeter\" ( (lp/mm) when referring to the number of grooves per unit length on the grating that contribute to the resolution, or it can be expressed in terms of wavelengths or other measures.\n\nGiven the context and the options provided, the question seems to be asking for a theoretical interpretation rather than a direct calculation from the given wavelengths. In a typical scenario, the resolving power would be considered high enough if it allows for the differentiation between closely spaced wavelengths. The options suggest a numerical scale that is not directly related to the simple division of the wavelengths but rather reflects the capability to distinguish between them.\n\nIn the context of spectral resolution, a spectrometer capable of distinguishing between 500 nm and 502 nm might have a resolving power in the thousands, indicating its ability to separate very close wavelengths. Thus, the closest option that represents a plausible level of resolving power based on the given wavelengths is:\n\nC. 5,000\n\nThis choice reflects a spectrometer's capability to distinguish between wavelengths that are 2 nm apart, which is quite fine, suggesting a high resolving power suitable for applications requiring the differentiation of closely spaced spectral lines."
