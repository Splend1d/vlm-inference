There is a trade deficit.\n\nWhen a country, like the United States, experiences a negative balance in its current account, it typically indicates that there is a trade deficit. This means that the value of goods and services imported into the country exceeds the value of goods and services exported from the country. In other words, more money is spent on foreign goods and services than foreign entities spend on American goods and services. \n\nThe current account includes several components: merchandise trade (exports minus imports, income from investments abroad minus income from domestic investment, and net unilateral transfers (such as aid or remittances). A negative balance across the entire current account suggests that the country's imports outweigh its exports, leading to a trade deficit."
