(2) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the tract of land. (3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the woman delivered to her daughter, the woman promised to convey the tract of land to her daughter by quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. (4) In 2008, the woman delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. If the woman thereafter defaulted on the mortgage debt, which of the following is probably correct?\n\nA. Only the daughter has a cause of action against the woman.\nB. Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.\nC. Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman.\nD. Neither the daughter nor the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Mortgage Company's Cause of Action**: The mortgage company has a lien on the property based on the mortgage agreement. When the woman defaults on the mortgage debt, the mortgage company can pursue legal action to foreclose on the property to recover the outstanding balance of the loan. This is because the mortgage agreement provides security interests in the property as collateral for the debt.\n\n2. **Daughter's Cause of Action**: Although the daughter received a quitclaim deed from the woman, this deed does not mention the existing mortgage. A quitclaim deed simply transfers whatever interest the grantor (in this case, the woman) has in the property at the time of the transfer. It does not discharge any liens or encumbrances on the property, such as the mortgage. Therefore, if the woman defaults on the mortgage, the mortgage company could still enforce its rights against the property. The daughter might have a claim against the woman for breach of the 2007 signed writing where the woman promised to convey the property and pay off the mortgage upon its due date. However, the daughter would likely need to establish that the mortgage was not properly discharged through the quitclaim deed or that there was an agreement between the parties regarding the mortgage that was breached.\n\nTherefore, both entities could potentially take legal action against the woman based on their respective interests in the property: the mortgage company for non-payment of the debt secured by the mortgage, and the daughter for breach of contract related to the promise to convey and pay off the mortgage."
