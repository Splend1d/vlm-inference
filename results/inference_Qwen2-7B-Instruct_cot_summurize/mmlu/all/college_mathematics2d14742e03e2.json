This scenario occurs precisely when \\(R\\) is a commutative ring. In a non-commutative ring, there can be more than two right ideals due to the asymmetry in multiplication. Therefore, **I** must be true.\n\n### II. \\(R\\) is a division ring.\n\nA division ring is indeed a special case where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. However, this property alone does not necessarily imply that \\(R\\) has exactly two right ideals. For example, consider a finite field, which is a division ring but can have more than two right ideals depending on its structure. Thus, while it's possible for a division ring to have exactly two right ideals, it's not a necessary condition. So, **II** is not necessarily true based solely on having exactly two right ideals.\n\n### III. \\(R\\) is infinite.\n\nThe number of elements in \\(R\\) does not directly correlate with the number of right ideals it has. Rings can have exactly two right ideals regardless of whether they are finite or infinite. For instance, consider the ring of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) under addition and multiplication, which is infinite but has only two right ideals: \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) itself and the trivial ideal \\(\\{0\\}\\). Therefore, **III** is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis above, the correct answer is **A. I only**, as only statement I must be true for \\(R\\) to have exactly two right ideals."
