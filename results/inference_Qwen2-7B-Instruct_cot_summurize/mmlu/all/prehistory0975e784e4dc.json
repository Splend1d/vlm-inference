However, it's important to note that while they shared this trait, their specific adaptations for bipedalism differed significantly between the two species.\n\nB. a reliance on brachiation is not a commonality between Homo sapiens and Australopithecus afareens. Brachiation is a form of arboreal locomotion where an animal moves through trees by swinging from branch to branch using its arms. Australopithecus afarerensis likely used brachiation as part of their movement strategy, but humans did not rely on it for locomotion.\n\nC. a lack of sexual dimorphism refers to traits where males and females of a species do not differ significantly in size or appearance. While there is some debate about the degree of sexual dimorphism in early hominids like Australopithecus afarerensis, it's generally agreed upon that Homo sapiens exhibit less sexual dimorphism than many other primate species. However, it would be inaccurate to say that Homo sapiens and Australopithecus afarerensis lack sexual dimorphism entirely, given that modern humans also show some degree of sexual dimorphism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. a mode of locomotion."
