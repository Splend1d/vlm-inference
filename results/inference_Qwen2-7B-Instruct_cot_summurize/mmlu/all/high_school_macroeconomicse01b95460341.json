Given that the MPC is 0.75,\n\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, for every dollar spent, the initial expenditure leads to an increase in GDP four times larger due to the spending round trips through the economy. \n\nTherefore, the total increase in GDP is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Initial Expenditure} \\times \\text{Multiplier} = \\$1 \\times 4 = \\$4 \\]\n\nThe correct answer is D. $4."
