Establishing rapport to better understand the child's perspective on a problem\n\nChild interviews in a multimethod model of assessment are particularly useful for establishing rapport with the child. This helps in creating a comfortable environment where the child feels safe to express their thoughts and feelings openly. By doing so, the assessor can gain a deeper understanding of the child's perspective on the problem at hand, their experiences, and the impact of any issues they might be facing. This approach not only helps in gathering more accurate and detailed information but also ensures that the assessment is conducted in a sensitive and supportive manner, fostering trust between the assessor and the child."
