Investment theory. \n\nStandard developmental models of intelligence, such as those proposed by Spearman (G theory or General Intelligence), Sternberg's Triarchic Theory, Cattell's Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence, among others, generally focus on the structure, components, and development of intelligence rather than on investment theory.\n\nInvestment theory, while an economic concept that might be used metaphorically in discussions about the allocation of resources towards cognitive development, is not a core construct in traditional theories of intelligence development."
