So, the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\) is equivalent to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, 3\\sqrt{2})\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the extensions step by step:\n\n1. **Extension from \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\):** The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(x^2 - 2\\), which has degree 2. Thus, the degree of this extension is 2.\n\n2. **Extension from \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\):** We need to find the degree of the extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\). Since neither \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) nor \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is in the other, the degree of this extension is also 2 ( because the minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) is \\(x^2 - 3\\), which also has degree 2.\n\n3. **Extension from \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, 3\\sqrt{2})\\):** In this final step, we are considering the extension from \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, 3\\sqrt{2})\\). Since \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\) is already in the form of \\(a + b\\sqrt{c}\\) where \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(c\\) is one of our existing square roots (\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) or \\(\\sqrt{3}\\)), it does not introduce a new element that would require a degree higher than 1 in this context. Therefore, the degree of this final extension is 1.\n\nMultiplying the degrees of these extensions gives us the total degree of the original extension:\n\\[2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4.\\]\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2), \\sqrt{3), \\sqrt{18})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is **4**, which corresponds to option **B. 4**."
