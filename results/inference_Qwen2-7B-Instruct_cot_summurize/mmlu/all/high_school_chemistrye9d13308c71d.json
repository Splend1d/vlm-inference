N2(g)\n\nIn a redox reaction where NO(g) gets reduced and no nitrogen-containing compound is oxidized, the only way for this to occur is if the nitrogen atom in NO(g) gains electrons and combines with other atoms to form N2(g). The other options involve either the formation of nitrogen oxides compounds (like NO2(g), which would imply oxidation of nitrogen, or the formation of nitrogen ions (NO3-(aq) and NO2-(aq), which also involve oxidation states that contradict the given conditions."
