The international recognition of human rights after WWII.\n\nThe revival of natural law in the 20th century was largely influenced by the international recognition of human rights following World War II. This period saw the drafting of several key international documents that emphasized the inherent rights of individuals, which were rooted in the concept of natural law. These documents included the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ((UDHR) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, and later treaties like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ((ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ((ICESCR). \n\nThese international agreements acknowledged the existence of universal human rights that are not dependent on laws or societal norms, but rather inherent to human beings by virtue of their humanity. This recognition of universal rights is a cornerstone of the revival of natural law, as it sought to establish a moral and legal foundation for human rights that transcends cultural, political, and economic differences.\n\nThe other options listed do not directly contribute to the revival of natural law:\n\nA. The Depression of the 1930s - While this economic crisis had significant social and political impacts, it did not have a direct influence on the revival of natural law.\n\nB. The rise of Fascism - Although this period led to atrocities and violations of human rights, it was the aftermath of the war and the subsequent international response that contributed to the revival of natural law.\n\nD. The Bolshevik Revolution - This event primarily impacted the political landscape of Russia and Eastern Europe, but its influence on the revival of natural law was more indirect through its global implications rather than a direct cause."
