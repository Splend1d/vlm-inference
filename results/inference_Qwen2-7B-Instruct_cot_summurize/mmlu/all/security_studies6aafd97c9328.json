The referent object can be objectively studied and should be considered accordingly.\n\nCritical Security Studies (CSS) does not advocate for an objective, detached study of the referent object (what is being protected or secured). Instead, it critiques the very notion of an objective referent object and emphasizes the social, political, and cultural contexts that shape understandings of security. CSS recognizes that security discourse and practices are often influenced by power dynamics, interests, and ideologies, and thus, they cannot be studied in an objective manner."
