Recursive procedures\n\nRecursive procedures require stack-based storage allocation because each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack, consuming space on the stack for local variables and function return addresses. When the procedure returns from a recursive call, that layer is popped off the stack, freeing up the space it was using. This dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory is not possible with static allocation, which assigns fixed memory locations for variables before program execution starts and does not change throughout the execution."
