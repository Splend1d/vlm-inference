The state is willing to sell the crawfish to in-staters for $1 per pound and to out-of-staters who come to the state for $5 per pound. The state felt that the increased fee for out-of-staters was a reasonable contribution toward the protection they received from the state. Assume that the federal court decided to hear the case.

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The statute is likely to be found unconstitutional, because it places a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.\n\nIn the United States, the Commerce Clause of the Constitution empowers Congress to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. This power extends to the states through the 10th Amendment. When a state imposes a tax or regulation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce, it may violate the Commerce Clause. \n\nIn this scenario, the state's pricing mechanism for selling crawfish to in-state residents at $1 per pound and out-of-state residents at $5 per pound can be seen as discriminatory because it charges out-of-state buyers a significantly higher price than in-state buyers. This differential treatment could be viewed as an attempt to protect the local market and potentially discourage out-of-state competition, which might not be justified under the principles of fair trade established by the Commerce Clause.\n\nMoreover, the state's argument that the increased fee is a reasonable contribution toward the protection given to non-residents does not necessarily justify the discriminatory pricing structure under the Commerce Clause. The protection given by the state is a general service provided to all residents and visitors, and charging different prices based on residency status without a clear justification related to the cost of providing such services could still be deemed unconstitutional.\n\nTherefore, the statute is likely to be found unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, specifically because it discriminates against interstate commerce by imposing a higher price on out-of-state buyers compared to in-state buyers."
