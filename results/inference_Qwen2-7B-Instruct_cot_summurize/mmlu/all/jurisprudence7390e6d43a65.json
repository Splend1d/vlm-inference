This concept emphasizes that legal validity goes beyond what can be captured by the formal rules of a legal system, particularly the rule of recognition. It involves the moral and interpretive aspects of law that go beyond mere procedural correctness or formal compliance with statutory texts. The semantic sting highlights the importance of understanding the meaning behind the words in legal texts and the broader context in which they operate, including societal values, principles, and the purposes of the law."
