The concentration of wealth is a common feature.\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that throughout history, civilizations have often seen a concentration of wealth in the hands of certain individuals or groups, such as ruling elites, religious leaders, or landowners. This can manifest in various forms, including extensive property ownership, control over resources, and accumulation of valuable artifacts and treasures. While not all societies have exhibited this pattern, many historical civilizations have shown signs of wealth concentration."
