Sociobiologists propose that certain behaviors, including some paraphilias, may have evolved as adaptive traits in humans or other animals. For example, a preference for novelty in sexual stimuli could potentially help an individual explore new opportunities for mating, which could be advantageous for reproduction and the survival of the species. This does not mean that all males with paraphilias have these traits due to evolutionary selection; rather, it suggests that such traits might have been historically advantageous and thus selected for over time.\n\nIt's important to note that this explanation is based on sociobiological theories and should be considered alongside other explanations from psychology and neuroscience. Additionally, current scientific understanding does not support the notion that gender differences in brain development necessarily correlate with preferences or behaviors, including paraphilias."
