This could be viewed as morally wrong, especially if it leads to someone else covering for you or if it affects the workflow or expectations at work. It can be seen as taking advantage of your position or not being accountable for your actions, which are are against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, going grocery shopping during designated times for seniors (or those with health vulnerabilities) when you are young and healthy is generally not considered morally wrong. While it's commendable to respect such restrictions, not doing so does not necessarily violate any moral norms. It's more about social responsibility and consideration for others rather than a clear-cut moral issue. However, it can be seen as irresponsible or thoughtless, especially if it leads to overcrowding or potential spread of illness, but it doesn't necessarily cross a moral line."
