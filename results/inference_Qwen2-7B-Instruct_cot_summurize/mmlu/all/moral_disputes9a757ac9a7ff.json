The purpose of this comparison often aims to highlight that:\n\nC. Killing is not necessarily in itself morally worse than letting die.\n\nThe reasoning behind this perspective hinges on the context, intentions, and circumstances surrounding the actions. For example, in one scenario, if Smith actively causes the death of Jones through an action that could have been avoided (e.g., administering a lethal dose of a drug with the intent to kill, it might be seen as more morally culpable due to the direct causation involved. In contrast, if Jones were already terminally ill and would inevitably die without any intervention, and Rachel allows nature to take its course without taking any action to prolong life, the act of \"letting die\" might be viewed as less morally blameworthy because there was no intention or action to cause death.\n\nThus, while the specific details of Smith and Jones' situations can vary widely, the general argument is that the moral weight of killing versus letting die depends significantly on the context and the agent's intentions and actions, rather than being inherently more or less wrong based solely on the act itself. This perspective counters the idea that one action is universally more morally reprehensible than the other ( options A and B - and supports option C."
