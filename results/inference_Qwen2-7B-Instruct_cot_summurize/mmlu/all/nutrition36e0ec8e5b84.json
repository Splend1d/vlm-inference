In Europe, the infection rates have indeed been declining significantly. This decrease is attributed to various factors including increased awareness, access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and public health interventions. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ((ECDC), there has been a steady decline in new HIV diagnoses in Europe since 2010. However, it's important to note that while the overall trend is positive, disparities exist among different populations and countries, and continued vigilance and targeted interventions are needed to ensure the progress continues."
