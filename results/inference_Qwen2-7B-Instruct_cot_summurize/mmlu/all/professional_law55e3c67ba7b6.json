The high school was severely damaged and needed to be rebuilt. As a consequence, the city council held an emergency meeting to determine what measures should be taken to locate an appropriate alternative facility in which to conduct classes. Thereupon, the city council passed the following resolution: \"During restoration of the high school building, classes shall be conducted at the most suitable facility which submits the lowest bid. In determining a \u0080\u0098suitable' facility, the city council shall consider such factors as location and available classroom space. \"Several bids were submitted. The lowest bid was submitted by a church. The church was located on the same block as the high school and contained sufficient seating capacity for all students. In addition, there were a sufficient number of separate rooms to allow different classes to meet at the same time. The city council voted unanimously to accept the church's offer. Furthermore, the church agreed to remove all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms utilized by the students. Only the main chapel was exempt, so that it could remain open for prayer. No high school classes or activities were to be held in the main chapel. A parent of one of the high school students is upset at this arrangement. On his son's behalf, the parent has filed suit in federal district court to challenge the constitutionality of permitting public school classes to be held in a church. Judgment for whom?\n\nA. The city, because the classroom arrangement does not inhibit or advance religion.\nB. The city, because the church was the lowest bidder in accordance with the emergency ordinance.\nC. The plaintiff, because the present arrangement for conducting classes in a church-owned facility constitutes excessive entanglement with religion.\nD. The plaintiff, because the emergency measure was not necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The city, because the classroom arrangement does not inhibit or advance religion.\n\nThis question involves the principle of separation of church and state, specifically regarding the use of religious facilities for secular purposes. In this case, the city council decided to utilize a church facility due to its availability and suitability for educational purposes. The church agreed to remove all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms used by students, except for the main chapel which was kept open for prayer but not for school activities. This arrangement ensures that the religious facility is used for secular education without advancing any particular religion or inhibiting religious freedom.\n\nGiven this context, the city's decision would likely be upheld as constitutional under the principle of neutrality towards religion, provided that the facility is used solely for educational purposes and that no religious activities occur in the classrooms where students are taught. The fact that the church was the lowest bidder is also a relevant consideration under the emergency measure, but it does not directly impact the constitutional analysis of the use of the facility itself.\n\nThus, option A is the most appropriate choice, as the arrangement does not violate the constitutional principles related to the separation of church and state and does not excessively entangle government with religion."
