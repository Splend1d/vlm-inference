However, it could be considered wrong if the action causes significant distress or disappointment to the children, especially if they have been looking forward to receiving their gifts.\n\nEating a slice of your friend's pork shoulder without permission might be seen as disrespectful or potentially theft-like behavior, depending on the context and relationship between you and your friend. It's not typically considered a major moral issue, but it can certainly be viewed as wrong by some people's's moral standards. \n\nTherefore, under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, hiding gifts could be considered more clearly morally wrong than eating a slice of your friend's pork shoulder without asking."
