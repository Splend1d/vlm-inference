Influence the outcome of a Supreme Court case\n\nAn amicus curiae brief, also known as a friend-of-the-court brief, is a document submitted to a court by a person or organization that is not a party to the case but has an interest in the matter being decided. The purpose of such a brief is to provide the court with additional information, legal analysis, or insights that might help inform its decision-making process. It can potentially influence the outcome of a case by offering new perspectives or evidence that the court may find persuasive."
