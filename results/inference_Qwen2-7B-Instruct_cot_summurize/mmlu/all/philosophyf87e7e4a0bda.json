In his book \"The Four Concepts Which Explain Almost Everything,\" Peter Baggini argues that pessimists often confuse the two meanings of \"time.\" One sense refers to the physical dimension in which events occur, while the other refers to the temporal sequence or order of events. Pessimists, according to Baggini, tend to conflate these two meanings and use them interchangeably, leading to misunderstandings and misinterpretations."
