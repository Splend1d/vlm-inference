Adding them together results in `0`, which does not cause overflow because it is within the representable range.\n\nB. `00000001` is `1`, and `10000000` is `-1`. Adding them together results in `0`, which again does not cause overflow for the same reason as A.\n\nC. `11111111` is `-1`, and `10000001` is `-2`. Adding them together results in `-3`, which is still within the representable range, so there is no overflow.\n\nD. `10000001` is `-127`, and `10101010` is `-4`. Adding these two results would normally yield `-131`, but since we're dealing with an 8-bit system, this wraps around to `15` ( (`-128 + 15 = -131`). This wrapping is not considered overflow in the context of two's complement arithmetic; instead, it's a normal behavior of the system. However, the question asks for overflow, which typically refers to the situation where the result exceeds the maximum positive value that can be represented, or falls below the minimum negative value that can be represented. In this case, the direct addition of `-127` and `-4` in an 8-bit system would indeed result in an overflow if interpreted strictly as exceeding the representable range without considering wrap-around, but the correct interpretation in computer science terms is that it wraps correctly within the two's complement system, thus not causing overflow as per the question's phrasing. \n\nGiven the typical understanding of overflow in computer science ( specifically, exceeding the maximum positive value (which is `127` in an 8-bit system), option D is the one that could potentially lead to a misinterpretation of overflow due to its wrap-around behavior. However, based on the question's phrasing, which seems to be asking for an overflow condition that directly exceeds the representable range without considering wrap-around, none of the options directly cause overflow under this strict interpretation.\n\nIn a more precise technical sense, all options handle their operations within the bounds of 8-bit two's complement arithmetic without causing an overflow error as understood in terms of exceeding the maximum positive or minimum negative representable value. The confusion here arises from the specific interpretation of \"overflow\" in the context of addition in two's complement. Typically, in such systems, adding `-127` and `-4` would result in a value that, while outside the \"usual\" human expectation of the sum's magnitude, does not exceed the maximum positive value or fall below the minimum negative value representable by an 8-bit system. Thus, under the strictest interpretation of overflow as exceeding the representable range without considering wrap-around, **none** of the options directly cause overflow. However, the question might have been intended to explore the nuances of two's complement arithmetic, including wrap-around behavior, rather than the traditional binary overflow definition."
