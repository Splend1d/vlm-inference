On the south side of the river is situated a rural community with a population of 40,000. For many years, various civic groups have urged that both communities merge into one township with a single governmental body. Independent studies have indicated that such a merger would result in an enormous tax savings to the residents of both municipalities by eliminating the duplication of services. On one previous occasion, proponents of the merger pian succeeded in having the proposal appear as an election referendum in each community. Although the merger referendum passed in the industrial town by a sizable margin, the voters of the rural community rejected the measure, fearing the combined government would be dominated and controlled by its neighbor's larger representation. In order to alleviate the concern of the rural community's voters regarding under representation in a merged governmental system, the respective city councils of both municipalities appointed a steering committee to formulate a new proposal. Accordingly, the steering committee devised a merger scheme wherein the city council of the united city, would consist of eight members. Within this proposed new system of government, each former municipality would be divided into four districts. With respect to the industrial town, each district would consist of 25,000 persons and each would have one elected city council member. By the same token, the rural community would be divided into four elective districts, each containing 10,000 residents. One city council member would be elected from each of these districts as well. The mayor would be elected at large by a popular vote of all residents in the newly created eight districts. Before this merger proposal was placed on the ballot, the state attorney general issued an advisory opinion stating that the measure did not, in her opinion, violate any statutory or constitutional provisions. Thereafter, the proposal was placed on the ballot and was overwhelmingly passed by the voters in both municipalities. After the election, but before the merger had officially been carried out, two taxpayers from the industrial town initiated suit to enjoin the unification, attacking the constitutionality of the disproportionate representative districts. Which of the following represents the plaintiffs' strongest constitutional argument in support of their action?\n\nA. The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the equal protection of the law.\nB. The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the due process of the law.\nC. The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the privileges and immunities of citizenship as guaranteed by Article IV, Section 2.\nD. The merged city would not constitute a republican form of government.\n"

                    "text": "The plaintiffs' strongest constitutional argument in support of their action is:\n\nA. The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the equal protection of the law.\n\nThis argument focuses on the principle of equal representation, which is a component of the Equal Protection Clause found in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. In this context, the plaintiffs argue that the proposed merger creates districts with unequal numbers of constituents, leading to unequal representation between the industrial town and the rural community. Specifically, each district in the industrial town has 25,000 people, while each district in the rural community has only 10,000 people. This disparity could potentially lead to the industrial town having more influence over decisions made by the unified city council than the rural community, thus violating the principle of equal protection.\n\nThe other options do not directly address the issue of representation or equal treatment under the law:\n- B. \"Due process\" refers to the legal procedures that must be followed before the government deprives a person of life, liberty, or property. While the plaintiffs may argue that the process leading up to the merger referendum was flawed, this option does not specifically address the issue of representation.\n- C. \"Privileges and immunities of citizenship\" refer to protections provided by the Constitution to citizens of the United States. The argument that the plaintiffs have been denied these privileges and immunities is not as strong as the equal protection argument because it does not specifically address the issue of unequal representation.\n- D. The republican form of government argument might be relevant if the plaintiffs can show that the structure of the merged city violates the principles of representative democracy. However, this argument seems less directly tied to the specific issue of unequal representation presented by the differing district sizes."
