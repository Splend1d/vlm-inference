With the permission bf the husband, the attorney's law clerk also sat in on the consultation to see how the attorney conducted these meetings. Shortly after this initial consultation with the attorney, the secretary quit. During the divorce trial, the wife's attorney seeks to call the secretary to testify about what the husband told the attorney during the initial client consultation. Upon objection, the secretary's proposed testimony will most likely be\n\nA. admissible, because her presence during the meeting destroyed the attorney-client privilege.\nB. admissible, because the law clerk's presence during the meeting destroyed the attorney- client privilege.\nC. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege disqualifies the secretary from testifying to such confidential communications.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

The presence of a secretary or law clerk does not automatically destroy this privilege. In most jurisdictions, the privilege attaches to communications made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, regardless of who is present as long as they are not involved in the communication in a way that waives the privilege. \n\nIn this scenario, the secretary's presence during the meeting would not typically be sufficient to waive the attorney-client privilege unless she was actively participating in the discussion or the client specifically waived the privilege by acknowledging her presence. Since she quit shortly after the meeting, there is no indication that she was involved in the communication in a way that would waive the privilege. Moreover, even if she had been present, her testimony would still be inadmissible if the privilege has not been waived.\n\nIt's important to note that the specifics can vary by jurisdiction and the precise details of the case, so this answer provides a general understanding based on common principles of attorney-client privilege law."
