Adjoining the orchard directly to the west was a 10-acre vineyard that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. A four-lane highway adjoined the orchard directly to the east. The farmer discovered that the southern portion of the orchard was rarely used by the landowner for any of the landowner's farming activities and found a convenient gravel road leading from the vineyard across the orchard all the way to the four- lane highway. The farmer used this road adversely and openly for the entire 20-year prescriptive period, and in doing so, the farmer has acquired a prescriptive easement over the roadway across the orchard. Thereafter, the farmer conveys the vineyard to a buyer in fee simple. The deed recited that \"the grantor hereby conveys the vineyard, together with an easement for the right of way across the orcharX, to the grantee. \"After the buyer took possession of the vineyard, the landowner brought an appropriate action to prevent him from using the roadway across the orchard. The issue that will determine the outcome of this suit is whether\n\nA. the description in the farmer's deed to the buyer was adequate to identify the portion of the orchard that the farmer used as a roadway.\nB. the buyer will make excessive use of the roadway.\nC. easements can be reserved to third parties.\nD. the easement was appurtenant.\n"

                    "text": "The issue that will determine the outcome of this suit is **D. the easement was appurtenant**.\n\nIn the scenario provided, the farmer acquired a prescriptive easement over the roadway across the orchard after using it for 20 years. Prescriptive easements arise when someone uses another person's land openly, notoriously, and continuously for a certain period (in this case, 20 years), and the original owner fails to object. Once a prescriptive easement is established, it becomes a part of the land (and not just personal rights of the original user.\n\nWhen the farmer conveyed the vineyard to the buyer in fee simple, the deed stated that the vineyard was being conveyed \"together with an easement for the right of way across the orchard.\" This description indicates that the easement was intended to be appurtenant to the vineyard, meaning that it was granted specifically for the benefit of the vineyard rather than just the individual farmer who previously used the easement.\n\nAn appurtenant easement attaches to the land and continues to exist even if the original holder of the easement sells their interest. Therefore, the easement would pass to the new owner of the vineyard upon its conveyance. In this situation, the landowner is likely arguing that the easement was not properly described in the deed to the buyer, or that the easement should not have been appurtenant given the circumstances.\n\nThe court would need to determine whether the easement was indeed appurtenant and if so, whether the description in the deed to the buyer was adequate to identify the portion of the orchard that the farmer used as a roadway. If the court finds that the easement was appurtenant and the description was sufficient, the buyer would have the right to use the roadway as part of the vineyard's title."
