For 12 years after executing her will, the woman lived on her farm. Then she sold it and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, in which she lived until she died, never having changed her will. Following the admission of the will to probate, both the nephew and the niece claimed ownership of the home. There is no applicable statute. Who is the owner of the home?\n\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.\nB. The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\nC. The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.\nD. The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n"

The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nWhen a person dies intestate (without a will), their estate passes according to specific rules set out in state law, often referred to as the \"intestate succession.\" However, in this case, the woman did have a will that specifically bequeathed the residue (or remainder) of her estate to her niece. \n\nThe doctrine of ademption does not apply here because it refers to situations where a testator's specific bequest becomes impossible or incapable of fulfillment due to an event happening after the will was executed, such as the gift being destroyed or sold. In this scenario, there is no indication that the residue of the estate became impossible to fulfill.\n\nEquitable estoppel, which involves preventing someone from acting against what they previously represented to be true, also doesn't apply since there is no evidence the woman made any representations to the contrary regarding her will.\n\nLapse occurs when a contingent interest in a will fails to vest due to a condition precedent not being met. However, in this case, the niece's interest is not contingent but is part of the residue, which is specifically mentioned in the will.\n\nTherefore, since the woman's will clearly states that the residue of her estate ( including any assets acquired after the execution of the will, such as the home in the city, would go to her niece, the niece is the rightful owner of the home according to the terms of the will."
