Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously and collided. In the accident, one of the drivers suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Although the other driver's truck was slightly damaged, he did not suffer any physical injuries. Thereafter, the injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming that the city failed to provide adequate warning at the intersection, which she contended was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. At trial, the city attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, and no other accidents have occurred during that time. Upon objection by the injured driver's attorney, this evidence should be\n\nA. admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.\nB. admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.\nC. excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.\nD. excluded, because the dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues may tend to mislead the jury.\n"

This type of evidence can be problematic because it might suggest that the intersection is safe, despite the fact that the injured driver argues it is dangerous. This is considered \"improper negative evidence,\" meaning it suggests a lack of an adverse event (in this case, no accidents - but does not directly prove anything about the intersection's safety.\n\nMoreover, allowing such evidence could potentially lead to misleading the jury in several ways. It might cause the jury to incorrectly infer that since there were no accidents for 14 years, there should not be any now, or it might unfairly prejudice the jury against the injured driver's claim, as it might imply that she is somehow responsible for the accident due to some unexplained factor not related to the intersection itself.\n\nAdditionally, there's a risk of confusion of the issues. The focus of the case should be on whether the city negligently failed to provide adequate warnings or improvements to the intersection, rather than on the lack of accidents at the intersection over a long period of time.\n\nTherefore, the court should exclude this evidence under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which allows exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury."
