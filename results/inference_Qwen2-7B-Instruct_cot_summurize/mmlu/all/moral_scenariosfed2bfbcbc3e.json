Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nPlaying the guitar while someone is sleeping can be considered morally wrong if it disturbs their sleep or causes them discomfort, especially if they have expressed that they need quiet during certain times (this might not be explicitly mentioned in the scenario but is generally considered a reasonable expectation for a roommate. \n\nOn the other hand, adjusting the temperature in your home based on your personal comfort without consulting your wife first would typically not be viewed as morally wrong. However, it could be seen as considerate or thoughtless depending on the context (e.g., if it's unbearably hot and you know she struggles with heat, adjusting the temperature might be seen as helpful. But if there's no indication of her discomfort, simply adjusting the temperature without asking isn't necessarily wrong according to common moral standards."
