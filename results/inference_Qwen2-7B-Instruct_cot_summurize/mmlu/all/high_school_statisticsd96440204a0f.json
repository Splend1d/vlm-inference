                    "text": "The correct answer is A. I and III only.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **I. There is a strong positive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.** This statement is true. An R-squared value of 98.1% indicates that a very high percentage of the variability in the response variable can be explained by the linear relationship with the explanatory variable. Since the relationship is described as having an R-squared value close to 1, it suggests that as the explanatory variable increases, the response variable also tends to increase, indicating a strong positive correlation.\n\n- **II. There is a strong negative linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.** This statement is false. The description provided for the relationship ( \"strong positive linear relationship\" contradicts this option. If there were a strong negative linear relationship, the R-squared value would still be high ( but the interpretation would involve the response decreasing as the explanatory variable increases.\n\n- **III. About 98% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable.** This statement is true. The R-squared value directly represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). An R-squared of 98.1% means that nearly all the variability in the response variable is accounted for by the model using the explanatory variable.\n\nTherefore, options II and D are incorrect because they either suggest a negative relationship or focus solely on option III without correctly interpreting the implications of the given R-squared value in terms of both the nature of the relationship and its strength as reflected in the explanation of variance. Option B incorrectly suggests that either a positive or negative relationship could be true, which is not supported by the information given."
