The developer decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. When the building was completed, the homeowner discovered that the shadow created by the new higher building placed her building in such deep shade that her ability to lease space was diminished and that the rent she could charge and the occupancy rate were substantially lower. Assume that these facts are proved in an appropriate action that the landowner instituted against the developer for all and any relief available. Which of the following is the most appropriate comment concerning this lawsuit?\n\nA. The landowner is entitled to a mandatory injunction requiring the developer to restore conditions to those existing with the prior building insofar as the shadow is concerned.\nB. The court should award permanent damages, in lieu of an injunction, equal to the present value of all rents lost and loss on rents for the reasonable life of the building.\nC. The court should award damages for losses suffered to the date of trial and leave open recovery of future damages.\nD. Judgment should be for the developer, because the investor has no cause of action.\n"

The court should award damages for losses suffered to the date of trial and leave open recovery of future damages.\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves a situation where the landowner (the homeowner) is suffering from a decrease in property value due to the actions of the developer, specifically the creation of a shadow that diminishes the rental potential of the existing building. The homeowner can sue for compensation for the losses already incurred, which would be calculated based on the decrease in income from renting out the property since the new building was constructed. Additionally, the court may allow for future damages to be claimed if the situation continues or worsens, leaving the door open for further compensation as long as the developer's actions continue to impact the property negatively."
