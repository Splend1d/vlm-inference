He has no history of similar symptoms. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. He is alert. His pulse is 80/min and irregular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg. He follows commands but has nonfluent aphasia. There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation of the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Babinski sign is present on the right. His serum glucose concentration is 162 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Carotid duplex ultrasonography\nB. CT scan of the head\nC. EEG\nD. Lumbar puncture\n"

CT scan of the head\n\nThe patient's symptoms (word-finding difficulty, weakness, sensory loss in the right arm and leg, irregular heartbeat, and hypertension, suggest he might be experiencing a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA. A CT scan of the head is the most appropriate initial diagnostic step for assessing brain function, identifying signs of stroke such as hemorrhage or infarction, and guiding further treatment. \n\nCarotid duplex ultrasonography (A would be useful if there was suspicion for carotid artery disease, but it does not directly assess brain function or provide information about potential stroke.\n\nEEG (C would be more relevant for diagnosing seizure disorders or other neurological conditions that involve electrical activity in the brain, but it is less useful for detecting acute ischemic changes related to stroke.\n\nLumbar puncture/D would be considered if there was concern for meningitis or other conditions requiring cerebrospinal fluid analysis, but it is typically not the first-line diagnostic test for suspected stroke.\n\nTherefore, given the patient's symptoms and medical history, a CT scan of the head should be the priority to evaluate for stroke and guide subsequent management."
