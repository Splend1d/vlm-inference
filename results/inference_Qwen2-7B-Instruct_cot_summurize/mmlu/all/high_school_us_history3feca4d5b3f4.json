Washington's Farewell Address. \n\nWashington's Farewell Address was delivered in 1796 and emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and avoiding foreign entanglements. He warned against permanent alliances with foreign nations, which could lead to war. His address also stressed the need for neutrality and warned against political parties that might seek to manipulate the nation into conflict. These sentiments align closely with Wilson's declaration of neutrality during World War I, where he sought to keep the United States out of the European conflict while still respecting international law and maintaining a policy of impartiality towards the warring nations."
