Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nSinging and cheering at a football game is generally not considered morally wrong as it is a form of expressing enjoyment and support for a public event or team. This action does not cause harm to anyone else and is part of the normal experience of attending such an event.\n\nHowever, deciding to \"dash\" and dine, which implies eating a meal without paying for it, is considered morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. This action constitutes theft or fraud, as it involves taking something (in this case, food and possibly service) without paying for it, which violates the property rights of the business owner. It's important to note that the term \"dashing\" can have different meanings depending on context, but if it implies eating a meal without paying, it would be viewed negatively ethically."
