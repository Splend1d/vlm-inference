A higher proportion of older men and women are victims of cancer.\n\nThis is because cancer is not directly related to a specific age or gender in the sense that it does not necessarily increase with age or affect one gender more than another across all age groups. While cancer rates can vary by age and gender, the occurrence of cancer in older individuals is not solely due to age or gender differences but rather a combination of factors including genetics, lifestyle, and other health conditions. Cohorts, which refer to groups of people born and living around the same time period, often experience similar environmental exposures and generational trends, which could influence the incidence of diseases like cancer.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C describe characteristics that are more likely to be influenced by age and biological changes associated with aging, rather than cohort effects. These characteristics are more indicative of biological progression and thus more likely to be categorized as age differences rather than cohort differences."
