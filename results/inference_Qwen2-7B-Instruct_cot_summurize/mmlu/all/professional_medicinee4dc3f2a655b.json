Four days ago, he returned from a cruise to the Caribbean, during which he swam in the ship\u2019s pool and used the hot tub. He appears well. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows the findings in the photograph. The infectious agent causing these findings most likely began to proliferate in which of the following locations?\n\nA. Apocrine gland\nB. Dermis\nC. Eccrine gland\nD. Hair follicle\n"

Hair follicle.\n\nThe symptoms described\u2014red, itchy rash on the buttocks and legs\u2014are consistent with a skin infection, possibly caused by a fungal or bacterial organism. The photograph (which is not provided here) would show characteristic lesions that might suggest a diagnosis such as tinea corporis ( (a fungal infection), impetigo, or other similar conditions often affecting hair follicles.\n\nFungi and bacteria commonly infect hair follicles, leading to conditions like folliculitis, which can present with red, itchy lesions. Therefore, the infectious agent most likely began to proliferate within the hair follicles."
