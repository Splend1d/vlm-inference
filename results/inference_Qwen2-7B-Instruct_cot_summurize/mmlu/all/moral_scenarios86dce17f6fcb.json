Washing machines are not designed to handle metal objects, and doing so can lead to malfunctions or even pose safety risks. This action goes against the ordinary expectations of appliance use and care.\n\nPouring a cup of hot coffee for a baby, however, is generally not considered morally wrong. While it might seem risky due to the potential for burns, the act itself is not inherently morally wrong unless there is intent to harm or neglect the child's well-being. The concern would typically be about the safety of the action rather than a moral failing."
