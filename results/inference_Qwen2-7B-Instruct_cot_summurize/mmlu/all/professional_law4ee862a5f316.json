There has been considerable concern among state health officials who foresee that many of the senior citizens will become victims of price gouging on certain medical supplies and services. In an attempt to curb such fraudulent sales practices, the state legislature has enacted a law prohibiting the sale of hearing aids by non-physicians. The measure provides, however, that all non-physician sellers who are presently engaged in the business of selling hearing aids will not be affected. Assume that after the statute goes into effect, a non-physician moves to the state and wants to open a business selling hearing aids. After being advised that the state law prohibits him from doing so, he brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The most likely result is that the state law will be declared\n\nA. constitutional, because there is a rational basis for distinguishing between non-physicians are not so engaged.\nB. constitutional, because a state has the power to regulate any phase of local business, even though such regulations may have some effect on interstate commerce, provided that Congress has not enacted legislation regarding the subject matter.\nC. unconstitutional, because it denies non- physicians who are not presently engaged in the business of selling hearing aids the equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause, since Congress has plenary power to regulate any activity that has any appreciable effect on interstate commerce.\n"

In this case, the state law creates a distinction between current and future non-physician sellers of hearing aids, which potentially favors the latter group over the former. This differential treatment could be seen as discriminatory if it does not have a rational basis or serves a legitimate state interest equally.\n\nAssuming the state's primary goal is to protect consumers from potential fraud or unfair pricing, it would need to justify why it cannot apply this protection to all non-physician sellers equally, instead of creating an exemption for those already in the market. If the state cannot provide a compelling reason for this distinction, the court might rule that the law violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nOptions A, B, and D each address different legal principles, but they do not directly address the issue of equal protection as it applies to the scenario described. Option A focuses on the rational basis for the distinction, which is not the primary concern here. Option B pertains to the state's power to regulate commerce within its borders, which does not necessarily conflict with the equal protection analysis. Option D refers to the Commerce Clause, which deals with federal regulation of interstate commerce, and while it is relevant in cases involving state laws that impact interstate commerce, it is not the central issue when discussing equal protection concerns.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given and the principle of equal protection, option C seems to be the most appropriate choice for the outcome of the lawsuit."
