As they were swimming, both men saw what appeared to be a large fin entangled in a nearby coral reef. Simultaneously, they shot their spear guns at the projecting wing-like figure. Unbeknownst to either of the friends, it was not a fish but rather another scuba diver. The victim was struck and slightly wounded by one of the spears. The victim asserts a claim for damages against the two friends. At trial, the judge should instruct the jury to rule\n\nA. in favor of both defendants if no evidence is presented showing who actually shot the spear that injured the victim.\nB. against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.\nC. against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both acted independently and not jointly.\nD. against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both shot their spear guns simultaneously.\n"

This means that the victim can seek compensation from any one of the parties involved, and if the party sought to be compensated does not pay the damages, the other party ( or parties) can be held responsible for the unpaid portion. \n\nIn this case, since both friends used their spear guns simultaneously and one of the spears hit the victim, they can be held jointly liable for the damages caused to the victim unless one of them can prove that they did not fire their spear gun. If neither can prove their innocence, they would be held jointly liable for the damages."
