The family recently moved to the area. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in the patient 6 years ago. Since that time, he has been treated with insulin and dietary management. His insulin regimen has not changed during the past year; however, his mother says he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens. His diabetic diary shows home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations ranging from 140\u2013200 mg/dL during the past 3 months. He admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c obtained last week was 5.4%. The patient's vital signs are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 72/min, respirations 24/min, and blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c?\n\nA. His daily glucose control is better than recorded\nB. His glucometer is reading falsely high and should be replaced\nC. His hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated\nD. His sickle cell disease is affecting his hemoglobin A1c\n"

His daily glucose control is better than recorded\n\nGiven that the patient's hemoglobin A1c level is 5.4%, which is considered within the normal range ( (typically below 5.7% for people without diabetes), it suggests that his average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months have been well-controlled. However, the reported fingerstick blood glucose readings indicate higher, albeit within the target range for diabetes management ( (140-200 mg/dL), suggesting that the patient might not be consistently achieving these levels at home.\n\nThis discrepancy could be due to several factors including:\n1. **Inconsistent or improper use of the glucometer**: The glucometer may not be functioning correctly, leading to inaccurate readings.\n2. **Inadequate monitoring**: As the patient admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently, this could lead to underestimation of his true blood glucose levels when using the glucometer.\n3. **Timing of tests**: Fingerstick glucose checks taken at different times of the day can vary significantly and might not reflect the overall average glucose level as accurately as hemoglobin A1c does.\n4. **Patient compliance**: If the patient is not adhering to his insulin and dietary regimen as prescribed, this could also affect his blood glucose levels.\n\nIt's important to note that sickle cell disease itself does not directly affect hemoglobin A1c levels, although it can impact overall health and potentially lead to complications related to diabetes management. The focus here would be on addressing potential issues with monitoring practices and ensuring adherence to the treatment plan."
