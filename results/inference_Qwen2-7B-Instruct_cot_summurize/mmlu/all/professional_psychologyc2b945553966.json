This type of training is particularly important for professions where an individual might experience significant motion, such as pilots flying commercial aircraft. The training helps individuals develop strategies to manage symptoms like dizziness, nausea, or headache that could impair their performance.\n\nFor the other options:\n- B. Word processor: This role typically involves tasks that do not require adaptation to motion or movement.\n- C. Salesperson: While they may occasionally experience travel-related motion, this is not a primary concern in their job duties.\n- D. Clinical psychologist: This profession does not inherently involve exposure to motion that would necessitate vestibular training."
