Diamagnetism is a property of all materials, it is caused by the movement of electrons within an atom or molecule. However, the magnetic field produced by diamagnetic materials is very weak and in the opposite direction to an externally applied magnetic field. Thus, their magnetic susceptibility ( the ratio of the magnetic moment to the magnetic field strength - is negative."
