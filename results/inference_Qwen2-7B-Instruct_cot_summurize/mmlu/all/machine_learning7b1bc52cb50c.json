They process data in a single direction, from input to output, without any feedback connections.\nStatement 2 is also true. The original ResNet architecture does not utilize self-attention mechanisms. Instead, it relies on skip connections or \"residual blocks\" to facilitate learning. Self-attention, which allows the model to weigh different parts of the input differently, was introduced in the original Transformer architecture."
