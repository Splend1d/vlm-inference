Individual counseling for students resuming from an institutional care facility\n\nTertiary prevention focuses on reducing the impact of an existing condition or preventing complications. In a school setting, this would typically involve providing support to students who have already experienced significant challenges or difficulties. \n\nOption A fits this criterion as it provides individualized support for students returning from institutional care facilities, which could be due to various reasons such as mental health issues, substance abuse, or other challenges that require specialized attention upon their return to the school environment.\n\nThe other options do not specifically target tertiary prevention:\n- B. Career guidance is more focused on future planning and is often considered secondary prevention or even primary prevention ( depending on when it is provided.\n- C. Small-group counseling for students affected by the initial stages of divorce could potentially be seen as secondary prevention if the aim is to prevent negative outcomes, but it might also fall under tertiary prevention if it aims to mitigate the effects of the divorce.\n- D. Large-group programs emphasizing development of children's self-esteem is primarily a primary prevention strategy aimed at promoting well-being and resilience in the general student population."
