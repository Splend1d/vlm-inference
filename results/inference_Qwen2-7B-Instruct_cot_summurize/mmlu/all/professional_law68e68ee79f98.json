Shortly thereafter, while the purchaser was riding the bicycle along a city street, he saw a traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, the purchaser quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed. To avoid the traffic that was then crossing in front of him, the purchaser turned sharply to his right and onto the sidewalk, where he struck a pedestrian. Both the pedestrian and the purchaser suffered injuries. The pedestrian asserted a claim based on negligence against the bicycle company. At trial, it was found that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the bicycle, and that the bicycle company failed to conduct a reasonable inspection that would have led to the discovery of the existence of the defect. Will the pedestrian prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the bicycle company placed a defective bicycle into the stream of commerce.\nB. Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\nC. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser of the bicycle.\nD. No, because the purchaser was negligent in turning onto the sidewalk.\n"

Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\n\nUnder the doctrine of strict liability for defective products, manufacturers can be held liable for injuries caused by their products even if they did not intend to cause harm or were not negligent in creating the defect. This is particularly true when the defect arises from a failure to perform a reasonable inspection or testing that would have revealed the issue. In this scenario, since it was established that the brake failure was due to a manufacturing defect and the company failed to conduct a reasonable inspection, the pedestrian would likely prevail in a negligence claim against the bicycle company. The company's duty of care extended to ensuring the product was safe for its intended use, and the failure to meet that standard through adequate testing or inspection is grounds for liability."
