The question seems to ask specifically about kinetic energy, so the correct interpretation based on the provided options is that kinetic energy increases but less than doubles, because the doubling of kinetic energy implies a direct relationship with velocity squared, not simply velocity. The confusion might arise from the direct proportionality between momentum and velocity versus the quadratic relationship between kinetic energy and velocity."
