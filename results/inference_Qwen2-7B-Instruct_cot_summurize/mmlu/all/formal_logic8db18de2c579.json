In other words, there exists at least one senior who does not graduate, which aligns with the statement \"No senior graduates without a major\" since it implies that all seniors must have a major to graduate.\n\nExplanation of the other options:\nA. (\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 ~Gx) means \"For all x, if x is a senior then x does not graduate\", which contradicts the original statement.\nC.
