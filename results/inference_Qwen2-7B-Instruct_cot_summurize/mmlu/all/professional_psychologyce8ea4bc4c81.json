This means that the effect of one independent variable (IV) on the dependent variable (DV) changes depending on the level of another independent variable. In other words, it shows how two or more independent variables work together to influence the dependent variable. This is distinct from the main effects which would be the impact of each individual IV on the DV without considering the others."
