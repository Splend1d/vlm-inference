The threat must be severe enough to make non-compliance unacceptable to the adversary.\n2. The threat must be believable or credible.\n3. The adversary should have enough time to respond and comply with the demand.\n4. The coercer must reassure the adversary that compliance will not result in additional demands or escalations.\n5. The conflict should not be seen as a situation where one party's gain is at the direct expense of the other ( (zero-sum game).\n\nThe other options either include unnecessary restrictions (like excluding military intervention in option D) or miss critical elements like the assurance that compliance will not lead to future demands, which is important for building trust and preventing escalation ( (missing in option A). Option C also misses the assurance that compliance will not lead to future demands."
