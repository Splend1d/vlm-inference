Activation functions play a crucial role in neural networks as they introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn and represent complex patterns. Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), tanh (hyperbolic tangent), and softmax, among others. Depending on the specific requirements of the problem being addressed by the neural network, different or combinations of these activation functions can be utilized.\n\nOptions A and B do not accurately describe all aspects of neural networks. While some optimization problems involving neural networks might have convex objective functions, this is not universally true, as many real-world problems involve optimizing non-convex functions. Furthermore, while stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular method for training neural networks due to its efficiency and scalability, other optimization algorithms such as Adam, RMSprop, and others can also be used, depending on the specific characteristics of the problem and the dataset."
