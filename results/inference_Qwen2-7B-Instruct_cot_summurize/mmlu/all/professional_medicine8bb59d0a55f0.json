Examination of the tongue reveals wasting and fasciculation. Decreased deep tendon reflexes and fasciculation are noted in the left lower extremity. The deep tendon reflexes of the left upper extremity are hyperactive. The most likely diagnosis is\n\nA. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nB. Friedreich ataxia\nC.

It leads to muscle weakness and atrophy because the neurons that control voluntary muscles are damaged or destroyed. Common symptoms include difficulty speaking, swallowing, and breathing, muscle weakness, and wasting, fasciculations ( (visible muscle twitching), and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes.\n\nWhile the other conditions listed can present with similar symptoms, they do not typically exhibit the same pattern of symptoms:\n\n- Friedreich ataxia is characterized by progressive gait ataxia, dysarthria, and loss of deep tendon reflexes but usually does not present with swallowing difficulties or wasting of the tongue.\n- Pick disease typically involves behavioral changes, dementia, and motor deficits such as parkinsonism, but swallowing difficulties are less common.\n- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disorder caused by reactivation of the JC virus, often presenting with neurological signs like seizures, cognitive decline, and visual disturbances. Swallowing difficulties may occur but are not a hallmark symptom.\n\nTherefore, based on the presented symptoms, ALS is the most probable diagnosis."
