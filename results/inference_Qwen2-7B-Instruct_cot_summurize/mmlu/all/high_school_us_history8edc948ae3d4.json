When we found the last Summer that we were likely to get no Assistance from the Government, some Volunteers went out at our own Expense, determined to drive our Enemies from our Borders; & when we came near to the great Island, we understood that a Number of their Warriors had gone out against our Frontiers. Upon this we returned and came up with them and fought with them at the Munfey Hill where we lost some of our Men & killed some of their Warriors & thereby saved our Frontiers from this Story in another Expedition. But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter.\"\n\u2014\"Apology of the Paxton Boys\" (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: \"apology\" in this context should be read as an explanation, not an admission of guilt or regret.)\nWhich of the following events from either earlier or later in the colonial period can best be seen as being part of a continuity with the events described in the passage above?\n\nA. The expulsion of Anne Hutchinson from Massachusetts Bay Colony.\nB. Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\nC. The Boston Tea Party.\nD. The trial of John Peter Zenger.\n"

Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\n\nThe events described in the \"Apology of the Paxton Boys\" pamphlet, particularly the actions of the Paxton Boys against Native American tribes and the subsequent government intervention, can be seen as part of a continuity with the themes of frontier conflict, Indian removal policies, and the role of religious groups in colonial society that are also present in Bacon's Rebellion. Both events involve tensions between settlers and Native Americans, and the involvement of Quakers in advocating for Native American interests. Additionally, the Paxton Boys' actions and the government's response highlight the broader issues of colonial expansion and the challenges faced by governments in managing conflicts arising from territorial disputes and cultural differences."
