Mani was a prophet in the religion of Manichaeism, which he founded in the 3rd century AD. Manichaeism blends elements from Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and other religions.\n\nMani referred to God by several names and concepts, including:\n\n- **Light (** Often associated with his belief in the dual nature of light and darkness.\n- **The Ineffable One (** A title that refers to the divine, beyond human comprehension.\n- **The All-Pervading One (** Indicates the omnipresence of the divine.\n- **The Beneficent One (** Describes a deity who bestows blessings and goodness.\n- **The Creator One / The Creator Father / The Creator Lord / The Creator God / The Creator Spirit.**\n\nGiven these options, \"Ineffable Lover\" could be interpreted as a poetic way to describe the divine in Manichaean theology, but without more specific information about Mani's personal terminology or the context of the question, none of the provided options directly matches the names used by Mani."
