She is sexually active and does not use any contraception. Her last menstrual period ended 6 days ago. Temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101.0\u00b0F). Physical examination discloses abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants bilaterally with rebound and guarding. Pelvic examination discloses leukorrhea at the cervical os and tenderness of the uterus to palpation. The adnexal areas are tender but no masses are palpable. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic study?\n\nA. Cervical culture\nB. Culdocentesis\nC. Laparoscopy\nD. Serum \u03b2-hCG concentration\n"

Serum \u03b2-hCG concentration.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, such as severe lower abdominal pain, nausea, and the timing relative to her last menstrual period ( 6 days ago, it suggests possible pregnancy complications or another gynecological issue. The \u03b2-hCG test is used to detect human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone produced during pregnancy. An elevated level of \u03b2-hCG could indicate an ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, or other pregnancy-related conditions that require immediate medical attention. \n\nThe other options:\nA. Cervical culture is typically done to check for infections like chlamydia or trichomoniasis, which might cause similar symptoms.\nB. Culdocentesis is a procedure used to drain fluid from the cul-de-sac between the uterus and the rectum, usually done if there is suspicion of a ruptured ovarian cyst or other intra-abdominal bleeding.\nC. Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that involves inserting a small camera into the abdomen through a small incision to look for internal injuries or abnormalities, often reserved for more invasive diagnosis or treatment when less invasive methods fail to provide enough information.\n\nTherefore, given the symptoms and the need for a quick diagnosis, testing the serum \u03b2-hCG concentration would be the most appropriate first step."
