Thereafter, the proposal was placed on the ballot and was overwhelmingly passed by the voters in both towns. After the election, but before the merger had officially been carried out, two taxpayers from one of the towns initiated suit to enjoin the unification, attacking the constitutionality of the proposal. The suit reached the state supreme court and was found to be constitutional under both state and federal law. The plaintiffs now file a motion seeking to have thiscase reviewed by the U. S. Supreme Court. The Court may\n\nA. not hear the case, because it was decided on independent state grounds.\nB. not hear the case, but may have it remanded to federal district court.\nC. hear the federal issues involved, but decline to rule on the state issue.\nD. rely on the advisory opinion rendered by the state attorney general and not hear the case on its merits.\n"

In this scenario, since the state supreme court found the proposal to be constitutional under both state and federal law, the case might fall under this category if the U.S. Supreme Court decides not to hear it. This is known as the doctrine of \"original jurisdiction\" where the U.S. Supreme Court can choose not to take up a case that was decided based on state law alone."
