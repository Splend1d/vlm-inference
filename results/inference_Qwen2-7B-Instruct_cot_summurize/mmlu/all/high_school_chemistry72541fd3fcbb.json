The entropy of the system increases due to the separation of the electron from its atom.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Energy contained in the light can be used to overcome the Coulombic attraction between electrons and the nucleus.\n\nIn photoelectron spectroscopy, photons ( which carry energy - are absorbed by an atom or molecule. This energy is used to overcome the electrostatic attraction between the electron and the nucleus, causing the electron to be ejected from the atom or molecule. This process is endothermic, meaning it requires energy input rather than releasing it. However, the question seems to imply that despite ionization being generally non-favored thermodynamically, it can occur due to the energy provided by the light photons. The correct explanation for why this happens, focusing on the provided options, is that the light's energy is used to overcome the Coulombic attraction between the electron and the nucleus."
