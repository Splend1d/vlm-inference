An increase in corporate optimism typically leads to an increase in investment plans, as companies feel more confident about future profits and growth prospects. This increase in investment requires more capital, thereby increasing the demand for loanable funds. As a result, if the supply of loanable funds remains constant, the higher demand will lead to an increase in the interest rate to balance the market. Therefore, an increase in corporate optimism would likely cause an increase in demand for loanable funds, leading to an increase in the interest rate."
