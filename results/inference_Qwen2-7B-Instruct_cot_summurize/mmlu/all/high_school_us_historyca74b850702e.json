We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nThe sentiments expressed in the speech above most directly influenced which of the following?\n\nA.

The passage of the War Powers Act of 1973\n\nThe sentiments expressed by Senator George McGovern in his speech against the Vietnam War likely influenced the passage of the War Powers Act of 1973. This act was designed to limit the President's ability to commit U.S. forces to armed conflict without the consent of Congress. It reflects a broader pushback against the perceived overreach of executive power in conducting foreign wars without adequate oversight from the legislative branch. While the other options listed ( B. The Tet Offensive of 1968, C. The resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974, and D. The emergence of a youth counterculture also relate to events surrounding the Vietnam War, they do not directly align with the specific content of Senator McGovern's speech."
