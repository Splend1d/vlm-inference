They believed that wages and prices were flexible and could adjust swiftly to changes in supply and demand, which means:\n\nI. Wages fluctuate quickly: Classical economists often argued that wages are flexible and can adjust rapidly to changes in market conditions, including changes in productivity and the availability of labor.\n\nIII. Input and output prices will stay in line with each other: This is related to their belief in the natural rate of unemployment where supply and demand for labor and goods would be in equilibrium, leading to prices adjusting accordingly.\n\nIV. The government should not worry about maintaining aggregate demand at an adequate level: Classical economists tended to view economic fluctuations as temporary and self-correcting, suggesting that government intervention to stimulate demand might not be necessary or effective.\n\nSay's Law, which states that \"supply creates its own demand,\" is indeed a principle associated with classical economics, so it doesn't fit into the dichotomy presented ( (it's not that they believed it doesn't hold, but rather that it's a foundational concept of their theory). Therefore, the correct answer to the question considering the provided options is:\n\nB. I III and IV only"
