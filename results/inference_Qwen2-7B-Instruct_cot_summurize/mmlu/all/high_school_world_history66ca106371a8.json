It suggests that while the international community might publicly condemn apartheid, there could be underlying fears or economic interests that prevent strong opposition or action against it. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:\n\nB. The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination.\n\nThis option acknowledges that the world might not openly endorse apartheid but could still perpetuate discriminatory practices or overlook injustices due to various reasons such as economic ties, political alliances, or strategic interests."
