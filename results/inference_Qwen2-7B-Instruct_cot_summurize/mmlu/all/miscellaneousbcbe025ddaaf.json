A frontier camp meeting of the Second Great Awakening during the early nineteenth century\n\nThe description you provided is consistent with the atmosphere and activities observed during the Second Great Awakening, particularly at frontier camp meetings. These events were characterized by fervent religious activities including multiple preachers speaking simultaneously, singing, praying, and emotional displays like weeping and seeking mercy.
