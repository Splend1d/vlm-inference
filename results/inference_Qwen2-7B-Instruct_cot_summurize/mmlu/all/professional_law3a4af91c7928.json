To prove negligent design by the manufacturer, the driver offers the portion of the transcript from a prior trial in which an expert witness testified that in his opinion the car was unsafe as designed. The testimony could qualify under the hearsay exception for former testimony\n\nA. only if the manufacturer had been a party to the former proceeding.\nB. whether or not the manufacturer had been a party to the former proceeding.\nC. if this exception has been held incompatible with the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\nD. if the manufacturer had an opportunity to cross-examine the expert at the former preceding.\n"

Whether or not the manufacturer had been a party to the former proceeding.\n\nThe hearsay exception for former testimony applies when a declarant (in this case, the expert witness who provided the testimony about the car's unsafe design) is unavailable to testify at the current proceeding and the statement was made under oath in a prior proceeding where the declarant had the opportunity and incentive to speak truthfully. The fact that the manufacturer was or was not a party to the previous trial does not affect the applicability of this exception.\n\nTo summarize the criteria for this exception:\n1. The declarant must be unavailable to testify at the current proceeding.\n2. The statement must have been made under oath in a prior proceeding.\n3. The declarant had the opportunity and incentive to speak truthfully in the prior proceeding.\n\nProviding that these conditions are met, the testimony can be admitted as evidence, regardless of whether the manufacturer was a party to the prior proceeding or not."
