The plaintiff was severely injured in the reservoir when he dove from a boat into what he thought was deep water and hit an unmarked submerged island. The plaintiff alleges that the company was negligent in failing to mark the submerged island. At trial, the plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as an expert in managing reservoirs. Which of the following opinions by the plaintiff's expert is the court most likely to admit?\n\nA. \"The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made.\"\nB. \"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300.\"\nC. \"The company was required by federal law to mark the island.\"\nD. \"The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.\"\n"

Expert testimony on legal issues is generally admissible if it involves matters within the expert's area of knowledge or expertise.\n\nOpinion A (\"The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film\") is more likely to be excluded as it goes beyond the realm of the expert's qualifications in managing reservoirs and may involve speculation about the specific events of the accident.\n\nOpinion B (\"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300\") is also less likely to be admitted because while it involves an estimation of costs and time, it might not directly address the legal requirements under federal law that the company had to follow in marking the island.\n\nOpinion D (\"The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent\") is not likely to be admitted as an opinion by the plaintiff's expert, as this would be a question of fact for the jury to determine based on evidence presented during the trial, rather than a legal conclusion provided by an expert witness."
