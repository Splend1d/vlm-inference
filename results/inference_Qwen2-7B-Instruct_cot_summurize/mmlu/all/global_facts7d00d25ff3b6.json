He led in the polls and garnered substantial support, particularly from voters dissatisfied with the incumbent President George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee. Perot's peak in the polls was indeed around 39% in June 1992. However, when it came to the actual election results on November 3, 1992, Ross Perot received approximately 8.4% of the popular vote. This places the correct answer as:\n\nB. 7 ( (This option is closest but not exactly accurate. The precise percentage is 8.4%, which is not listed among the provided choices.)"
