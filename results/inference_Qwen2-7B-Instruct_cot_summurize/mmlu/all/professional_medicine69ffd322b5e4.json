Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22\u2013 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?\n\nA. The patient has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD\nB. The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD\nC. The patient is not a carrier of the DMD based on her normal creatine kinase concentration\nD. The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation\n"

The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD\n\nThe presence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in both her brother and maternal uncle indicates that she likely inherited an affected X chromosome from her mother. Since DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder, males (who have only one X chromosome - receive it from their mother - will express the disease if they inherit the affected gene. Females, who have two X chromosomes, can be carriers if they inherit the affected gene on one of their X chromosomes but typically do not express symptoms unless there is a second mutation or if they experience skewed X inactivation leading to high expression of the affected gene.\n\nThe elevated muscle creatine kinase (CK) concentration in both the patient and her mother also suggests that they may be carriers of the disease. Typically, carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy exhibit slightly elevated levels of CK in their blood, though not as high as those seen in affected males. The CK levels alone do not definitively diagnose carrier status, but they are consistent with it.\n\nGiven the family history and the elevated CK levels, it is reasonable to conclude that the patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD. However, a definitive diagnosis would require genetic testing, which could include DNA sequencing or analysis of the dystrophin gene to confirm the carrier status. Without such testing, the uncertainty about her carrier status due to potential skewed X inactivation remains, making option D a less accurate choice compared to option B. Options A and C are incorrect because they make assumptions about the risk of her offspring developing DMD or lack of carrier status that are not supported by the information given."
