Exerting economic power to advance peace and freedom: By imposing economic penalties, countries can discourage undesirable actions and encourage compliance with international norms or policies changes.\n\nB. Ending economic support for morally unacceptable regimes: Sanctions can be targeted at specific individuals or entities within a country, such as government officials or companies involved in human rights abuses, to pressure those regimes into changing their behavior.\n\nC. Isolating dangerous regimes and weakening threats to regional or global security: By cutting off trade, financial flows, and other forms of interaction, sanctions can make it more difficult for a regime to sustain itself, fund its military or other activities, or project power beyond its borders.\n\nTherefore, sanctions can be used as a tool to promote peace, freedom, and security by leveraging economic leverage against nations or groups that violate international norms or pose a threat."
