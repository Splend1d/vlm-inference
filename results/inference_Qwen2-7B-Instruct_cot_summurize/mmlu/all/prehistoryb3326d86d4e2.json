This culture was one of the earliest in China to engage in agriculture and settle in permanent villages, marking significant developments in human history. \n\nBeans, wheat, and peas were not domesticated in China but rather in other regions such as Mesoamerica (for beans), the Fertile Crescent (for wheat), and the Indian subcontinent (for peas). Sorghum originated in Africa, and emmer is a type of wheat that was domesticated in the Middle East."
