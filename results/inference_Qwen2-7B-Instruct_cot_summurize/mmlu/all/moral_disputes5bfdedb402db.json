This critique suggests that van den Haag's reasoning supports the idea of retribution, which is essentially \"an eye for an eye\" or a form of vengeance, whereas the death penalty might not align perfectly with this concept due to various ethical considerations. Reiman likely points out that the right to retaliate is a complex issue, involving not just the punishment of the guilty but also broader implications such as justice, mercy, and the societal role of punishment. The critique by Reiman would focus on the moral and philosophical underpinnings of these arguments, suggesting that they may fall short when critically examined through the lens of contemporary ethical theory."
