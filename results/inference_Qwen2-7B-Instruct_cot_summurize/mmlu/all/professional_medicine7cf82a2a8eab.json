This is likely a case of oral thrush, which is a common fungal infection in infants, particularly those who are are breastfed or have had prolonged antibiotic use. Nystatin is an antifungal medication used topically to treat oral thrush and other fungal infections of the mouth. It works by disrupting the cell membrane of the fungus, leading to its death. The other options listed ( Acyclovir, Fluconazole, and Valacyclovir, are antiviral medications and are not typically used as first-line treatment for oral thrush."
