The streamlined body has a selective advantage in that environment.\n\nTuna, sharks, and dolphins all have streamlined bodies because this shape provides them with an advantage in their aquatic environments. Streamlining reduces drag and makes it easier for these animals to swim efficiently through water, which is crucial for both speed and energy conservation. This adaptation is not due to sharing a recent common ancestor ( (A), sustaining the same set of mutations ( (B), or simply acquiring this body type without any specific benefit ( (C). Instead, the streamlined body shape evolved as a result of natural selection favoring individuals with this trait in terms of survival and reproduction in their respective marine habitats."
