By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following attitudes prevalent after the First World War is evident in the passage above?\n\nA.

Increased disillusionment and cynicism\n\nThe passage indicates that the fear of a revolution similar to that in Russia, which had been a driving force behind Addison's Act, began to recede by 1920. This suggests that there was an initial optimism or hope for social change following the war, but this was later replaced by disillusionment and a more cynical view, as evidenced by the government's decision to cut back on the housing program."
