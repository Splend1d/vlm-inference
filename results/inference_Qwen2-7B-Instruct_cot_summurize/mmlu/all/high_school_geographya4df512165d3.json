They are usually restricted to certain neighborhoods.\n\nThis statement is not entirely accurate, as restrictions on neighborhood placement for immigrants vary greatly across European countries and within them. However, it was historically common in some European cities where policies or social dynamics led to segregated areas with higher concentrations of immigrants. \n\nIn recent years, many European countries have made efforts to promote integration and reduce segregation. Nevertheless, issues related to housing, employment, and access to public services can still lead to certain neighborhoods having a higher concentration of immigrants, though this is not necessarily due to formal restrictions imposed by authorities. \n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Most find citizenship easy to get in host countries. - Citizenship requirements and processes can vary significantly between European countries, and acquiring citizenship is often challenging, involving language tests, knowledge of the country's laws, and sometimes long residency periods.\n\nB. Muslims immigrants from North Africa are well integrated in France. - Integration varies widely among different immigrant groups and can depend on various factors including language skills, education level, job opportunities, and cultural assimilation. There is no blanket statement that can apply to all Muslim immigrants from North Africa in France or any other European country.\n\nC. Immigrants to European cities rarely bring their families. - This is generally not true. Immigrants often migrate with their families, especially for reasons such as reunification, education, or employment opportunities. The presence of family members can be crucial for integration and social support."
