This theory suggests that ideas, technologies, and cultural practices spread from a central origin to other regions.\n\nCultural evolution ( (A) refers to the development of culture over time through natural selection or adaptation.\nMigrationism  ( (B) focuses on the movement of people as the primary driver of cultural diffusion and technological transfer.\nAnti-originalism  ( (D) typically refers to a position against the idea of a single, unchanging source or origin for cultural elements."
