This property is known as neuroplasticity or brain plasticity. It allows the brain to adapt to new situations, learn, and recover from injury or damage. Younger brains generally exhibit higher levels of plasticity compared to older brains, which means they can potentially recover more quickly from brain damage.\n\nContralateral control refers to the coordination between the left and right hemispheres of the brain, where each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body.\n\nKlinefelter's syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by having an extra X chromosome, usually in males, which can affect brain development and function.\n\nAn effective psychological environment can support recovery and rehabilitation but is not a biological property of the brain that facilitates faster recovery from brain damage."
