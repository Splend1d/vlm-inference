It plays a role in cell growth and division, and elevated levels have been linked to a higher risk of prostate cancer development. However, it's important to note that the relationship between specific dietary factors, alcohol consumption, salt intake, and prostate cancer risk is also being studied, but they do not have as strong evidence compared to insulin-like growth factor-1."
