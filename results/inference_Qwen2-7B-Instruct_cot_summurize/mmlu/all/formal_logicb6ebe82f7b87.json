From premise 1, we know that if E is true, then ~F must be true, but this does not lead directly to F being true.\n\nB. F \u2283 G - This is also not an immediate consequence. Premise 2 tells us that if ~F is true, then G must be true, but it does not tell us anything about F leading to G.\n\nC. G \u2283 E - This is not an immediate consequence. We do not have any information that allows us to infer E from G.\n\nD. ~~F - This is an immediate consequence. Since we have ~G ( (not G), and from premise 2, ~F \u2283 G, we can use the contrapositive of premise 2 which is F \u2283 ~G. Since G is false, by contraposition, F must be true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. ~~F."
