The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 35 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.\nB. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained. This is because heat transfer occurs from the hotter body (the sample at 100\u00b0C) to the cooler body (the water at 22\u00b0C). Since the final temperature reached by both is the same (35\u00b0C, it implies that the sample had to lose more heat to cool down to this temperature compared to the heat absorbed by the water to reach the same temperature from 22\u00b0C. However, the total heat lost by the sample equals the total heat gained by the water, as they are in thermal equilibrium at the final temperature. \n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because the magnitude of temperature change does not directly correlate with the heat energy exchanged. The heat capacity (Cp) is a property of the substance itself, not determined by the rate of temperature change.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the total energy of the system (sample + water) does not necessarily decrease when heat is transferred from one part of the system to another. The decrease in energy in one part is balanced by an increase in the other part, maintaining the system's total energy constant, assuming no external work or heat exchange with the surroundings."
