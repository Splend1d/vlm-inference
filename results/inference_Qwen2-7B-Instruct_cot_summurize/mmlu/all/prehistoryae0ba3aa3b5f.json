This could mean that different groups or regions began to adopt similar beliefs, symbols, or practices, which can foster a sense of unity and shared identity among diverse populations. This unity might have been promoted by various factors such as trade networks, conquests, migrations, or religious missions. However, it's important to note that while this can lead to a period of relative peace due to shared values and goals, it doesn't necessarily imply the end of violence or human sacrifice, nor does it directly correlate with the development of organized religion or the use of money. Each civilization's response to religious iconography is complex and multifaceted, influenced by numerous historical, social, and economic factors."
