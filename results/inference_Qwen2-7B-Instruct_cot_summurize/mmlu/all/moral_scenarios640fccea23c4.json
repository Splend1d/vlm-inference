This action can be seen as indecent exposure or lewd behavior, which is morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, tossing your car keys to your daughter so that she can go for a drive with you is a normal and safe action if done responsibly. It allows her to participate in an activity that you both enjoy, assuming she has a valid driver's license and it is legal for her to operate the vehicle. This action does not violate any ordinary moral standards."
