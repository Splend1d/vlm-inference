The principle of attribution is crucial here, and it generally follows these lines:\n\nC. The conduct of any State organs shall be considered an act of that State, provided that it is intra vires.\n\nThis means that any act performed by a state organ, if within the scope of its authority (intra vires), can be attributed to the state and thus considered as an act of the state. This includes both executive, legislative, and judicial actions, as long as they fall within the lawful powers of the organ performing them.\n\nIt's important to note that while the act must be within the organ's authority (intra vires, it does not necessarily need to have been authorized or ratified by the state at the highest level. The key is that the act is part of the state's official policy or practice, or that it represents the state's interests sufficiently, regardless of whether it was formally approved by the highest authorities.\n\nTherefore, options A and D are too restrictive, and option B is also incorrect because it excludes lower echelons of the government from being able to attribute their actions to the state. Option C accurately captures the essence of how state organs' actions can be attributed to the state under international responsibility principles."
