In 1797, while excavating near Sidlesham in Sussex, England, he discovered stone tools which were later identified as being of Neanderthal origin. These findings were some of the earliest evidence of prehistoric tool-making and significantly advanced the understanding of early human history. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
