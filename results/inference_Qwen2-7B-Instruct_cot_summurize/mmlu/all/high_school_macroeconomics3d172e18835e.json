Higher disposable income higher consumption higher real GDP lower unemployment\n\nWhen the government lowers personal income taxes, it increases the disposable income of individuals. This is because they get to keep more of their earnings after taxes, which can lead to an increase in spending (consumption. As people spend more, it boosts demand for goods and services, potentially leading to higher production levels and thus increasing the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP. The higher demand for labor might also help reduce unemployment rates as businesses hire more workers to meet the increased demand. However, these effects are not always guaranteed and depend on various economic factors and conditions."
