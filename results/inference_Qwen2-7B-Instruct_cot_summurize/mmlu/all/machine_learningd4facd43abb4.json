For \\(x \\geq 0\\), the gradient is 1 because the function is linear and increases at a rate of 1.\n- The claim about the sigmoid function's gradient is more nuanced. The sigmoid function is defined as \\(\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\\). Its derivative, which represents the gradient, is \\(\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))\\). This derivative is always positive and decreases as \\(x\\) moves away from 0. It reaches its maximum value of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) when \\(x = 0\\), but it never exceeds this value. Therefore, the statement that the sigmoid gradient \\(\\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x)) \\leq \\frac{1}{4}\\) for all \\(x\\) is actually true because the maximum value of the derivative of the sigmoid function is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), and this value is reached precisely when \\(x = 0\\).\n\nStatement 2: The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient.\n\n- This statement is false. The ReLU function has a continuous gradient everywhere except at \\(x = 0\\), where the gradient jumps from 1 to 0. The sigmoid function, on the other hand, has a continuous gradient everywhere because its derivative is also a continuous function.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
