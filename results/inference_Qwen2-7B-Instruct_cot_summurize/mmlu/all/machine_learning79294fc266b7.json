In a Bayesian network, the joint probability of multiple variables can be calculated as the product of their conditional probabilities given the parents of each variable in the network. Given the structure H -> U <- P <- W, we have:\n\n- H has no parents, so its probability is unconditional.\n- U is conditioned on both P and W.\n- P is conditioned on W.\n- W has no parents, so its probability is unconditional.\n\nThus, the joint probability P(H, U, P, W) can be expressed as:\nP(H, U, P, W) = P(H) * P(W) * P(P | W) * P(U | H, P).\n\nThis matches option C."
