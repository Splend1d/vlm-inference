Individual enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n\nIndividuals, unlike states and international organizations, generally do not possess full international legal personality on their own. They can, however, enjoy certain rights under international law when they are are part of specific legal arrangements or agreements, such as treaties, or when they act in a capacity that grants them rights, such as in the case of diplomatic agents or stateless persons. In general, though, their rights under international law are derived from the entities with which they are associated or through special provisions granted by international treaties."
