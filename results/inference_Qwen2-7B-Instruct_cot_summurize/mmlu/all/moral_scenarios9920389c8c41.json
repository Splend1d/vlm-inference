There's no intention to deceive or mislead anyone, and no resources are being wasted or damaged.\n\nScenario 2: Sliding down a slide alone is also generally considered harmless behavior. There is no indication of any property damage, violation of rules, or disrespect for others' belongings or safety. It's a common recreational activity that doesn't involve others."
