Instead, it indicates a problem with model selection or omitted variable bias. Mis-specification of functional form typically refers to choosing the wrong mathematical relationship between variables. For instance, using a linear model when the true relationship is quadratic ( (A), using a log-log model when the relationship is multiplicative but not logarithmic (B), or assuming a direct relationship when it should be inverse ( (C) all involve mis-specifyinging the functional form. Omitting a relevant variable, however, affects the model's ability to accurately estimate and interpret the effects of included variables rather than specifying the functional relationship incorrectly."
