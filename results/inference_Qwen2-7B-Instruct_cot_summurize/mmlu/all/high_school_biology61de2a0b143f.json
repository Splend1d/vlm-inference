It posits that species evolve over generations through the mechanisms of mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. These processes lead to changes in the traits of organisms that affect their survival and reproduction, resulting in the adaptation and diversification of species. The theory of evolution is supported by a vast body of evidence from various fields such as genetics, paleontology, comparative anatomy, and ecology."
