This can help attract individuals who are genuinely interested in and suited for the role, thereby potentially reducing the likelihood of dissatisfaction once they start the job. By setting realistic expectations, it also helps in minimizing on-the-job conflicts and turnover, as people are less likely to leave a job if they know what they're getting into from the beginning."
