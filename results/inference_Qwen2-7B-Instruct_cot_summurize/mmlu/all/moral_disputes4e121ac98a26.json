In the context of sexual relations within marriage, Kant argues that true respect and dignity should be extended to one's spouse. This means that sexual activity should not be used solely for personal gratification but should be part of a mutual commitment that respects the whole person of the other. The idea of \"equally and reciprocally transferring their whole person\" refers to the deep emotional, intellectual, and physical connection that should exist between spouses, where each person fully commits to the other, not just in the sense of physical union but also in terms of love, care, and mutual respect."
