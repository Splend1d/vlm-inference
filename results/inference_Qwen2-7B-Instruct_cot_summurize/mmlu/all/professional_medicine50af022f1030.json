The student met the woman when he was assigned to her care during her 2-week hospitalization for treatment of major depressive disorder. He has not treated or seen the patient since she was discharged from the hospital. He is attracted to this former patient and would be interested in dating her. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the medical student regarding this patient's invitation?\n\nA. He can date her because he was a medical student, not a physician, when he contributed to her care\nB. He can date her because she is no longer his patient\nC. He can date her, but only after at least 1 year has passed since he treated her\nD. He cannot date her because she was once his psychiatric patient\n"

He cannot date her because she was once his psychiatric patient.\n\nThere is a conflict of interest when a healthcare provider begins a romantic relationship with a former patient. This can potentially affect the quality of care provided, as well as create ethical dilemmas and boundaries issues. It is recommended that a cooling-off period of at least one year should pass before a healthcare provider can consider dating a former patient. Option A is incorrect because being a medical student does not change the potential for harm in forming a relationship with a former patient. Option B assumes that the patient-physician relationship ends immediately upon discharge, which is not always the case. Option C specifies a timeframe but does not address the fundamental issue of the conflict of interest."
