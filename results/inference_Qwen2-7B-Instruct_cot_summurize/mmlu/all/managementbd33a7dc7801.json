Collective output - Teams work together to produce results that are often more complex or larger than what an individual could achieve.\n\nC. Individual and collective responsibility - Team members have both personal accountability for their contributions as well as shared responsibility for the team's success.\n\nD. Fluid dimension to roles and tasks - Team roles and responsibilities can shift based on the task, skill set, or needs of the project, allowing for flexibility and adaptability within the team structure. \n\nMinimal and formal knowledge sharing would hinder effective collaboration and performance in a team setting."
