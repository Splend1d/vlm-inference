So, the points of intersection are \\((-1, 1)\\) and \\((1, 1)\\).\n\n2. **Intersection with \\(y = 9\\):** Setting \\(x^2 = 9\\), we get \\(x = \\pm 3\\). So, the points of intersection are \\((-3, 9)\\) and \\((3, 9)\\).\n\nThus, the area \\(A\\) under the curve \\(y = x^2\\) from \\(x = -3\\) to \\(x = 3\\) (and above the line \\(y = 1\\) but below the line \\(y = 9\\) can be found by integrating the difference between the upper and lower boundaries of \\(y\\), which in this case is \\(9 - x^2\\) from \\(-3\\) to \\(3\\).\n\n\\[A = \\int_{-3}^{3} (9 - x^2 \\, dx\\]\n\n\\[= \\left[9x - \\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{-3}^{3}\\]\n\n\\[= \\left(9(3) - \\frac{3^3}{3}\\right) - \\left(9(-3) - \\frac{(-3)^3}{3}\\right)\\]\n\n\\[= \\left(27 - 9\\right) - \\left(-27 + 9\\right)\\]\n\n\\[= 18 + 18\\]\n\n\\[= 36\\]\n\nHowever, since the question seems to ask for the area between the parabola and the lines \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 9\\), we should actually calculate the area under the line \\(y = 9\\) and subtract the area under the line \\(y = 1\\) ( because the area we're interested in is specifically between \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe correct calculation should be:\n\n\\[A = \\int_{-3}^{3} (9 - (1 \\, dx\\]\n\n\\[= \\int_{-3}^{3} 8 \\, dx\\]\n\n\\[= [8x]_{-3}^{3}\\]\n\n\\[= 8(3) - 8(-3)\\]\n\n\\[= 24 + 24\\]\n\n\\[= 48\\]\n\nIt seems there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the question's intent or potential m in the provided answer choices. Based on the correct calculation following the description of the problem as presented, the area would indeed not directly match any of the options given without further context or correction in the interpretation. Given the correct process, the area calculated would be 48 square units, which does not appear among the provided options A through d. It's crucial to ensure that all details of the question are accurately understood and addressed."
