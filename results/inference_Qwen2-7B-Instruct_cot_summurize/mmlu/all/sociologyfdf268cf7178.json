This group tends to be composed of individuals who are often share similar characteristics, such as wealth, education, and social status.\n\n- B) Vilfredo Pareto, on the other hand, developed the concept of \"the law of the uneven distribution of income\" or the Pareto principle, which can be applied to various aspects of society, including the distribution of power. He argued that in any social system, a small number of people ( roughly 20% - hold a disproportionate amount of power, resources, or influence. This implies that elites form coalitions based on their unique skills and abilities that they bring to the table.\n\n- C) Both thinkers would likely agree that elites tend to circulate between high-status positions and that they have mechanisms in place to maintain their control over these positions. This could include systems of patronage, nepotism, or meritocracy, depending on the context and historical period under consideration.\n\nIn essence, both Mosca and Pareto's ideas overlap significantly, suggesting that elites are a minority group that occupies key positions of power, form coalitions based on shared skills and abilities, and tend to maintain their positions through various means. Therefore, option D, stating that all of the above apply, accurately captures their contributions to understanding ruling elites."
