When it revolves around the z-axis, it creates a torus with a circular cross-section that is offset from the z-axis.\n\nThe standard equation for a torus centered at \\((R, 0, 0)\\) with a tube radius \\(r\\) is:\n\\[\n\\left(R - \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\right)^2 + z^2 = r^2\n\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and \\(r\\) is the radius of the tube.\n\nIn our case, since the circle is centered at \\((0, 3, 0)\\), the center of the torus is at \\((0, 3, 0)\\), so \\(R = 3\\), and the radius of the tube is \\(r = 1\\).\n\nSubstituting these values into the torus equation gives:\n\\[\n\\left(3 - \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\right)^2 + z^2 = 1^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\\[\n9 - 6\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + (x^2 + y^2) + z^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nRearrange terms:\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8 = 6\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root (note: this step might introduce extraneous solutions, but in this context, we're looking for the equation form that matches the given options):\n\\[\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C**. \\( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2) \\)."
