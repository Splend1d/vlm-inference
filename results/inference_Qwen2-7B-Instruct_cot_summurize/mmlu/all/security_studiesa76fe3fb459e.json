Indiscriminate attack. \n\nSurgical strike, smart bomb, and precision target all suggest a high degree of accuracy and minimal collateral damage, which aligns with the principles of RMA ( focusing on precise, effective, and less destructive military operations. On the other hand, an indiscriminate attack suggests a lack of discrimination or consideration for civilian safety and property, which is generally not aligned with the more targeted and strategic approach of RMA."
