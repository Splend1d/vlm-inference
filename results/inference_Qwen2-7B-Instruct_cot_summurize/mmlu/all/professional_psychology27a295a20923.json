In this context, the psychologist is fulfilling their role as a mental health professional to provide assistance and guidance. However, it's important to note that if the psychologist is also supervising the intern, there might be ethical considerations related to boundaries and potential conflicts of interest. This could be considered a dual relationship, which requires careful management to avoid any exploitation or harm to the intern. The psychologist should ensure that the therapeutic relationship is separate from the supervisory role and that there are are no power imbalances that could affect the treatment's effectiveness or the intern's well-being. Therefore, while the psychologist's initial action to provide help is ethically commendable, ongoing supervision must adhere to strict ethical guidelines to maintain professional integrity."
