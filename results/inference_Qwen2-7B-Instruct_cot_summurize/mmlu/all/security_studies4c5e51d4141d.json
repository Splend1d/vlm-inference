Liberalism is a fundamentally pessimistic approach that regards the international system as destined to the escalation of conflict. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.\nB. Liberalism is a novel conception in the theory of international politics. It is an optimistic approach that defines the ways in which states should relate to one another, particularly during conflict situations.\nC. Liberalism is an optimistic approach, offering an orientation for the better conduct of international affairs in the belief that a more peaceful world is possible. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.\nD. Liberalism does not exist as a mainstream theory within International Relations, but rather offers a set of guidelines and advice for states and political actors wishing to accrue power within the international system independently from the restrictions of traditional security paradigms.\n"

It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.\n\nLiberalism in international relations theory emphasizes cooperation, free trade, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law as key principles for promoting peace and stability among states. It advocates for institutions-building, such as international organizations and legal agreements, as mechanisms for resolving disputes and managing collective action problems. The liberal perspective holds that an open and interconnected global community is more likely to avoid conflict and achieve mutual prosperity than a closed or competitive one. This view contrasts with realist theories, which often emphasize power, security, and the anarchic nature of the international system."
