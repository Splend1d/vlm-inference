Social ostracism\n\nResearch suggests that social ostracism, or beinging socially isolated and excluded by others, can have a significant impact on individuals with antisocial personality traits. This is because individuals with antisocial personality disorder often lack empathy and a strong sense of morality, leading them to disregard social norms and relationships. Social ostracism can exacerbate these issues by increasing feelings of alienation and potentially worsening behavioral problems.\n\nMoney, tranquilizers, and physical punishment may also play roles in different contexts or for various individuals, but they do not seem to have as direct an influence on learning as social ostracism does for people with antisocial personalities."
