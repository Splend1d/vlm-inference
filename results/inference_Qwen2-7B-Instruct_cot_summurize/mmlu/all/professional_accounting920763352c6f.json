Select at random a different account for confirmation that is approximately the same size.\n\nIn auditing, account receivables are often confirmed with the customer to verify the existence of the amounts owed to the company. If the client has a valid reason for not wanting a specific account receivable to be confirmed, the auditor should select another account of a similar size for confirmation. This maintains the integrity of the audit process while addressing the client's concerns.\n\nA is incorrect because it does not address the need for confirmation of the receivable and instead focuses on verifying the balance through other means.\nC is incorrect because management representation letters are not typically used to address specific account confirmations; they are used to provide assurance on matters such as going concern and fraud.\nD is incorrect because the decision to disclaim an opinion is made based on the overall audit findings, not solely on the confirmation of a single account receivable. The auditor would need to consider the nature and extent of the reasons for not confirming the account and assess whether this impacts the audit opinion."
