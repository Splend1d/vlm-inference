The employee determined that his boss was not breathing, immediately rendered CPR to his boss, and succeeded in reviving him. The employee then called the paramedics, who took the boss to the hospital. Two week later, the boss returned to work. Grateful for the employee's quick action in saving his life, the boss said to the employee, \"You'll have ajob with me for life. \"Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date?\n\nA. &s per the boss's oral promise, the employee had an enforceable lifetime employment contract.\nB. The boss had a duty to pay the employee reasonable compensation for saving his life, based upon a contract implied-in-fact.\nC.

This act of providing CPR was voluntary and was done out of altruism. For this reason, there is no formal agreement or contract between the two parties regarding the employee's future employment status. \n\nThe concept of 'consideration' in contract law refers to something of value exchanged between parties. In this case, since the employee did not receive any form of payment or compensation before rendering the aid, there was no 'consideration' from the employee's perspective. Therefore, the boss's promise to offer lifetime employment as gratitude for saving his life cannot be considered a valid contract because it lacks the necessary consideration from the employee.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment."
