This usually results in several characteristics:\n\n1. **More Consumer Choices**: As new firms enter the market, they offer different products or services, increasing consumer choice.\n2. **Lower Price Elasticity of Demand**: In such markets, demand might be less sensitive to price changes because consumers have multiple options to choose from.\n3. **More Competitors**: With low barriers to entry, the number of firms in the market tends to increase.\n\nGiven these points, the best match for \"relatively free or easy entry\" with \"low or nonexistent barriers to entry\" would be:\n\n**A. More consumer choices, greater price elasticity of demand, more competitors.**\n\nThis option directly correlates with the typical outcomes of a market with low barriers to entry, where competition is high, consumer choice is expanded, and demand is relatively more elastic due to the availability of substitutes."
