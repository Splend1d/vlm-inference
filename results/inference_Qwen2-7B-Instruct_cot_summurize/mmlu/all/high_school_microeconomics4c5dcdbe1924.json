The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost of the fourth hour.\n\nThe student's decision to study one more hour suggests that she believes the benefit from this additional hour will outweigh its cost. If the student finds the material easy and comprehensible, the marginal benefit (the additional knowledge gained in the fourth hour compared to the third hour\u2014may be high enough to justify the marginal cost, which is the time spent studying instead of potentially more productive activities. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least equal to the marginal cost, given her decision to study further."
