This last right allows citizens to formally request that the government address and remedy issues or injustices they believe exist.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. Due process of the law is protected under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, not the First Amendment. It ensures that individuals receive fair treatment through the judicial system.\n\nB. The protection against unlawful seizures of private property without just compensation is found in the Fifth Amendment, specifically the Takings Clause.\n\nC. Protection against excessive fines and cruel or unusual punishment is found in the Eighth Amendment, which applies to criminal cases, not necessarily all government actions.\n\nThus, while the First Amendment safeguards many liberties, petitioning the government for a redress of grievances is the specific right mentioned among your options."
