In exchange for $1 received this day, I agree that you can have one month from today's date to decide whether to accept this offer. \"The first student then signed the paper and handed it to the second student. The second student handed a one dollar bill to the first student and left. One week later, the second student succeeded in obtaining a $1,000 loan from his parents. He then telephoned the first student to accept the offer. Upon hearing the second student say hello, and before the second student could accept the offer, the first student said, \"I've changed my mind. I do not want to sell my car. \"Can the second student still accept the first student's offer?\n\nA. No, because $1 is inadequate consideration.\nB. No, because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.\nC. Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\nD. Yes, based on the principal of promissory estoppel.\n"

Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\n\nIn this scenario, the first student's written offer to sell the car for $1,000 included terms such as the payment of $1 and a one-month window for the second student to decide whether to accept the offer. By paying the $1 and accepting the offer over the phone, the second student has demonstrated an intention to enter into a binding contract. The fact that the first student changed their mind after the offer was accepted but before a formal agreement was reached does not automatically void the transaction. \n\nThe concept of promissory estoppel may also apply here, which prevents a party from going back on a promise or agreement where the other party has relied on that promise to their detriment. In this case, the second student has relied on the offer by paying the $1 and arranging the loan, potentially losing the opportunity to buy another car at a different price or under different conditions. If the court finds that the second student has suffered a detriment due to the first student's change of heart, promissory estoppel could support the second student's claim to enforce the offer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, as the first student's offer created a valid option that the second student could accept, even if the first student later decided to retract their offer."
