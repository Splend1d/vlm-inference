Left and right submandibular lymph nodes.\n\nThe lymphatic drainage of the tongue involves several lymph nodes, including the submandibular lymph nodes which drain the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The posterior one-third of the tongue drains into both the submandibular and sublingual lymph nodes. Therefore, for the left side of the tip of the tongue, the lymph would typically drain into both the left and right submandibular lymph nodes."
