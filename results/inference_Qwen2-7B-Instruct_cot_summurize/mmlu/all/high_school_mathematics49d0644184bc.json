So, there are 7 ways to choose a male for the male lead.\n\n3. **Three Different Objects by Either Gender**: After selecting the leads, we have 6 members left. We need to choose 3 of them to play the objects. The order in which these 3 members play the objects matters since they are distinct roles. This is a permutation problem where we are choosing 3 out of 6 members, and the order matters.\n\nThe formula for permutations is \\(P(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items to pick from, and \\(k\\) is how many items you're picking.\n\nSo, for the 3 objects, we use \\(P(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{(6-3)!} = \\frac{6!}{3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{1} = 120\\).\n\nMultiplying the choices together gives the total number of ways to assign all roles:\n\n\\[4 \\text{ (female leads} \\times 7 \\text{ {male leads}} \\times 120 \\text{ {objects}} = 4 \\times 7 \\times 120 = 3360\\]\n\nNone of the options provided match this result, indicating a potential error in the options or in the interpretation of the question.
