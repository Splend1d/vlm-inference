Few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients.\n\nWhen an auditor uses a blank form of positive confirmation, they send out a confirmation request with no pre-filled balances. Recipients then need to manually fill in their balances and return the form. This process requires more effort from the recipients, which can lead to lower response rates. If many recipients do not respond, the sample used for testing may not be representative of the entire population, potentially leading to less effective audit conclusions."
