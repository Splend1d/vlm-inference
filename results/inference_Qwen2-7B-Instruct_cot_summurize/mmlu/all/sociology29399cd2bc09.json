Among the options provided, the concept most closely alignss with option C: scanning a table to identify general patterns and significant figures. This is often used in data analysis where one quickly looks over a set of numbers or data points to get an overall sense or spot any obvious trends or outliers. However, the term \"eyeballing\" is somewhat informal and context-dependent, so its exact meaning might vary slightly depending on the specific field or situation."
