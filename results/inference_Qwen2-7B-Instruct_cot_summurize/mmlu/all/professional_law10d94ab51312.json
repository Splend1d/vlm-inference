It is necessary to show that every reasonable effort has been made to procure his attendance.\n\nWhen a party wishes to establish the unavailability of a witness at trial, they must demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps to secure the witness's presence. This could involve various methods such as sending formal notices, making phone calls, sending emails, or attempting to locate the individual through other means. The specific methods may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the circumstances surrounding the case. \n\nIt is not enough to merely show that the witness is not currently in court (option A), nor does showing that the witness has died automatically prove unavailability (option B). Furthermore, while proving the witness's insanity might be relevant in some contexts, it is not the primary criterion for establishing unavailability (option D).\n\nTherefore, option C correctly identifies that the party seeking to prove a witness's unavailability must show that they have made every reasonable effort to procure the witness's attendance."
