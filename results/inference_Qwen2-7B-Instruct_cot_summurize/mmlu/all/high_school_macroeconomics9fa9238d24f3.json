This leads to a budget deficit because expenditures exceed revenues.\n\nDuring an economic expansion, when the economy is growing, employment increases, leading to higher tax revenues. Simultaneously, the need for certain social programs might decrease as the economy improves. This situation often results in a budget surplus, where government revenues surpass expenditures."
