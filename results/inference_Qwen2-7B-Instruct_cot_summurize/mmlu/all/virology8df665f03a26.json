Ability to distinguish self and non self\n\nAdaptive immunity, also known as acquired immunity, is characterized by its ability to distinguish between the body's own cells (referred to as \"self\") and foreign invaders such as pathogens (referred to as \"non-self\". This specificity allows the immune system to target and neutralize foreign substances without attacking the body's own cells. This feature distinguishes it from innate immunity, which has a more generalized response to threats. \n\nThe other options are not exclusive features of adaptive immunity:\n\nA. While adaptive immunity does respond faster upon re-exposure to a specific antigen due to the development of memory cells, this is not a defining characteristic that separates it from innate immunity.\n\nC. While adaptive immunity can differentiate between different types of pathogens like viruses and bacteria, this isn't unique to it - both innate and adaptive immunity have mechanisms to recognize these types of foreign entities.\n\nD. The \"short memory\" refers to the fact that the adaptive immune response is more specific but less long-lasting than innate immunity, but this isn't a defining feature that sets it apart. Adaptive immunity does develop a \"memory\" component, which allows for a faster and more potent response upon subsequent encounters with the same antigen, but this doesn't necessarily mean it has a shorter memory in the sense of duration."
