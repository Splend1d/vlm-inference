Bob was so grateful for the loan that he named his business \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and purchased signs and advertising displaying this name. He also listed Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar as \"partners\" on his stationery. When Ted found out, he was flattered to the point that he voluntarily reduced Bob's interest rate from 9 percent to 8 percent per annum. A few weeks later, Pete Smith, who had assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the hardware store and was not familiar with the true situation, sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Pete Smith has been unable to collect for the goods and he seeks your advice. Your advice to Pete is\n\nA. only Bob Wilson is liable.\nB. Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\nC. Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\nD. only the de facto partnership arising from the relationship between Wilson and Lamar is liable.\n"

Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\n\nIn this scenario, even though Bob Wilson named his business \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and displayed it on signs and advertising, and also listed himself and Ted Lamar as \"partners\" on his stationery, there was no formal partnership agreement or legal partnership formation between Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar. Therefore, the partnership is considered a de facto partnership, which means that it exists based on the actions and representations made by the parties involved rather than being formally established.\n\nSince Pete Smith reasonably believed that both Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar were partners in the hardware store, they can be held jointly liable for the debt owed to Pete Smith under the principle of apparent authority. This principle allows third parties, like Pete Smith, to hold all partners responsible for the debts incurred by any one of them when they have reason to believe that all partners are involved in the business.\n\nThus, Pete Smith would be entitled to seek payment from both Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar for the goods sold, assuming they were used in the operation of the business and were intended to benefit both parties."
