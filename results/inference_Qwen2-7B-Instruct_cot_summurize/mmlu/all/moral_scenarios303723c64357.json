It's a sensible and responsible action, especially in public settings where communal eating is involved. Most people would agree that preventing foodborne illness or contamination is a reasonable and ethical concern.\n\nIn Scenario 2, participating in an erotic show through pole dancing can be seen as morally wrong depending on the context and the consent involved. If the performance involves elements of exploitation, coercion, or if it takes place in a setting where all participants and audience members have not given their informed consent, it could be viewed as unethical. Moreover, if the performance involves minors or is otherwise illegal, it would definitely cross ethical boundaries. However, in a consensual adult setting where all parties are involved willingly and without any form of exploitation or harm, it might not necessarily be considered morally wrong, although it may still be subject to personal or cultural moral judgments.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
