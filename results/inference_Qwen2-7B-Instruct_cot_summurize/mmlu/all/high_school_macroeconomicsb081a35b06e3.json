The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nWhen consumer confidence increases, it leads to higher spending and increased demand for goods and services. This shift in the demand curve to the right, assuming all else remains constant, would lead to both a higher equilibrium price level and a higher equilibrium quantity of output. \n\nThe upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies that as prices rise, the quantity supplied also increases, but not necessarily at the same rate. Therefore, with an increase in demand, the economy moves along the aggregate supply curve towards a new equilibrium point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied at a higher price level and quantity of output."
