Impacts: Although impacts on Venus might not be as common as on other bodies in our solar system due to its dense atmosphere, there are still some indications of impact craters found on its surface.\n\nB. Erosion: Venus has a strong greenhouse effect that keeps its surface warm and wet, leading to significant erosion. The high atmospheric pressure and temperature allow for heavy rain and strong winds, which can erode the planet's surface over time.\n\nC. Volcanism: Venus is volcanically active, with numerous volcanoes and extensive lava flows covering much of its surface. The planet's thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and high surface temperatures provide an environment conducive to volcanic activity."
