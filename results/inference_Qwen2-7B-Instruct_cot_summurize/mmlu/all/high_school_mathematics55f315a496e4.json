The total number of outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36 \\).\n\nFirst, let's break down how many times each number can be the maximum of the two numbers rolled:\n\n- Number 1: Can only be the max if both dice show 1. This happens once.\n- Number 2: Can be the max in 3 cases: (1,2; 2,1; 2,2.\n- Number 3: Can be the max in 5 cases: 1,3; 3,1; 2,3; 3,2; 3,3.\n- Number 4: Can be the max in 7 cases: 1,4; 4,1; 2,4; 4,2; 3,4; 4,3; 4,4.\n- Number 5: Can be the max in 9 cases: 1,5; 5,1; 2,5; 5,2; 3,5; 5,3; 4,5; 5,4; 5,5.\n- Number 6: Can only be the max if both dice show 6. This happens once.\n\nSo, the frequencies for each maximum number are:\n- Max 1: 1 time\n- Max 2: 3 times\n- Max 3: 5 times\n- Max 4: 7 times\n- Max 5: 9 times\n- Max 6: 1 time\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value by multiplying each maximum number by its frequency and then dividing by the total number of outcomes (36:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{(1 \\times 1) + ( (2 \\times 3) + ( (3 \\times 5) + (4 \\times 7) + ( (5 \\times 9) + (6 \\times 1)}{36} \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 + 6}{36} \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{101}{36} \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled on two fair six-sided dice is \\( \\frac{101}{36} \\), which is not listed among the options you provided. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or error in the options given, as none of them match the correct calculation. The correct answer based on the calculation would be \\( \\frac{101}{36} \\)."
