Conduction: Heat is transferred through direct contact between particles in a solid or liquid.\nB. Radiation: Heat is transferred through electromagnetic waves, which can travel through a vacuum and does not require a medium.\nC. Convection: Heat is transferred by the movement of fluids (liquids or gases.\n\nInduction refers to the process of generating an electric current in a conductor using a changing magnetic field, and it is not related to the transfer of thermal energy."
