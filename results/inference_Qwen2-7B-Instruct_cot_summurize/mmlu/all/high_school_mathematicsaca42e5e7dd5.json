However, we don't actually need to solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) explicitly to answer the question about \\(f(-2)\\).\n\nTo find \\(f(-2)\\), substitute \\(-2\\) for \\(x\\) in the original function:\n\n\\[f(-2) = a(-2)^6 - b(-2)^4 + (-2) - 1\\]\n\n\\[f(-2) = a(2^6) - b(2^4) - 2 - 1\\]\n\n\\[f(-2) = 64a - 16b - 3\\]\n\nNotice that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in \\(f(-2)\\) are identical to those in \\(f(2)\\), except for the constant term which changes from \\(+1\\) to \\(-3\\). Since \\(f(2) = 5\\), we can say:\n\n\\[64a - 16b + 1 = 5\\]\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides of the equation gives:\n\n\\[64a - 16b = 1\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[f(-2) = 64a - 16b - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2\\]\n\nHowever, none of the provided options (A. 1, B. 3, C. 0, D. 5 match our calculation. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question's setup or the provided options. Given the steps and logic followed, the correct answer based on the calculations would be \\(-2\\), which is not listed among the options. This suggests either an error in the question's premise or in the interpretation of the options."
