The relationship between these quantities can be described by the following equation:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{2L} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( f \\) is the frequency of the standing wave,\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound, and\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe.\n\nSince the length of the pipe remains constant, any change in the frequency will be directly related to changes in the speed of sound.\n\nGiven that the speed of sound is reduced by 3% on the cold day, we need to find out how this affects the frequency. If the original speed of sound is \\( v \\), then on the cold day, the new speed of sound becomes \\( 0.97v \\) ( (since it's 3% less).\n\nUsing the formula for frequency, we substitute \\( v \\) with \\( 0.97v \\):\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{0.97v}{2L} \\]\n\nWe can see that the new frequency \\( f_{\\text{new}} \\) is proportional to the old frequency \\( f \\) by the factor \\( \\frac{0.97}{1} \\). \n\nSo,\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{new}} = f \\times 0.97 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given value of \\( f = 440 \\) Hz:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{new}} = 440 \\times 0.97 = 426.8 \\] Hz\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us \\( f_{\\text{new}} = 427 \\) Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 427 Hz."
