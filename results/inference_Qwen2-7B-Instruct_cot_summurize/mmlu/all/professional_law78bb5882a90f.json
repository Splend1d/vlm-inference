The dealer lived approximately two miles from the theater. After picking up the marijuana, the classmate then drove to the concert. As he was driving to the concert, the classmate smoked two marijuana cigarettes so that he could be \"high\" for the show. While the car was parked outside the theater, through no fault of the classmate, it was struck by another car and damaged. Repairs will cost $750. The driver of the vehicle that struck the student's car fled the scene and cannot be identified.

The damage occurred while the car was under the classmate's control, even though the damage itself was caused by an external event (the other car hitting it. The student had no fault in the incident, and since they lent the car with the understanding that it would be used as intended, they can likely recover the repair costs from the classmate. This is typically based on the principle of responsibility for damages when someone has lawful possession or control over an item belonging to another person."
