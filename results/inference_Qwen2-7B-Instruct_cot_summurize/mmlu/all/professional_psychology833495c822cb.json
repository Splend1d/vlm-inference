Adams, suggests that individuals evaluate their relationships based on the perceived fairness of the exchange of inputs (such as effort, time, or resources) for outputs (like rewards or benefits. According to this theory, a person's satisfaction in a close personal relationship is influenced by their perception of the contribution/reward ratio they receive compared to what their partner receives in the relationship.\n\nIn other words, if an individual feels satisfied when they believe they are contributing equally to the relationship and receiving equivalent rewards, while also considering how their partner is contributing and being rewarded. This comparison is crucial in determining whether the relationship feels fair and equitable, which in turn affects satisfaction levels.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. Perceptions of the relative utility of the relationship refer to how valuable each person finds the relationship, but it doesn't specifically address the balance of contributions and rewards, which equity theory focuses on.\n\nC. Comparisons with past relationships might influence an individual's expectations and feelings about their current relationship, but equity theory is more concerned with the balance of contributions and rewards within the current relationship.\n\nD. Comparisons with the outcomes of other people's relationships can provide context for what is considered \"normal\" or \"good,\" but equity theory is more about internal perceptions of fairness within the relationship itself, rather than external benchmarks."
