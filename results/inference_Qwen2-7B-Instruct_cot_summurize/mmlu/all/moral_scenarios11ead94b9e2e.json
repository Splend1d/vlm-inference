Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, setting off dynamite during work at a mine can be considered morally wrong because it involves creating a significant safety hazard for oneself and others, potentially leading to severe injuries or fatalities. This action disregards the safety and well-being of colleagues and the general public, violating ethical principles of care and responsibility.\n\nIn Scenario 2, asking Hank for help in thinking of a title for an essay is not morally wrong. It is a common academic practice and demonstrates a willingness to learn and seek advice, which are both positive behaviors. There is no violation of trust or manipulation involved in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing, while the second does not."
