Nearly all of the enzyme molecules are interacting with acetaldehyde molecules.\n\nAt the maximal rate of reaction, most of the enzyme molecules would be bound to acetaldehyde molecules, participating in the conversion process. This is because the enzyme is saturated with substrate ( in this case, acetaldehyde, and thus cannot bind more without reaching its capacity. \n\nThe other options do not accurately describe the conditions at the maximal rate of reaction:\n\nB. The activation energy of the reaction does not decrease; it remains constant for a given chemical reaction.\n\nC. The change in free energy of the reaction (\u0394G\u00b0, which determines whether a reaction is spontaneous or not, does not decrease; it is determined by thermodynamic properties of the reactants and products, not by the reaction rate or the concentration of one of the reactants.\n\nD. The enzyme specificity does not change; enzymes are highly specific for their substrates due to their unique shape, so they remain specific for acetaldehyde even when the reaction rate has reached a maximum."
