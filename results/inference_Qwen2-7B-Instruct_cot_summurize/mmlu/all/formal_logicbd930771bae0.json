G            (Conclusion\n\nFirst, let's break down the premises:\n- Premise 1: ~G \u2283 H means \"If G is not true, then H is true.\"\n- Premise 2: ~H means \"H is not true.\"\n\nNow, let's construct the truth table:\n\n| G | H | ~G | ~H | ~G \u2283 H | Conclusion |\n|---|---|----|----|--------|-------------|\n| T | T | F  | F  |   T    |   F         |\n| T | F | F  | T  |   T    |   F         |\n| F | T | T  | F  |   F    |   T         |\n| F | F | T  | T  |   T    |   T         |\n\nIn this truth table, we have four rows, representing all possible combinations of truth values for G and H.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nThe conclusion is that G must be true. To see if the argument is valid, we need to check if there's any row where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nLooking at the table, we can see that in the first two rows, premise 2 (~H) is true, but the conclusion (G) is false. However, these rows also have premise 1 (~G \u2283 H) being true, which doesn't contradict the conclusion. \n\nBut, in the third row, premise 2 (~H) is true, premise 1 (~G \u2283 H) is also true, and the conclusion (G) is false. This row represents a case where both premises are true, and the conclusion is false. \n\nTherefore, the argument is **Invalid**. A counterexample for this would be when G is False and H is True, which corresponds to Row 3 of our truth table."
