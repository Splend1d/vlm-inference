This action involves illegal drug distribution, which is against the law and ethical principles that uphold public safety, health, and well-being. Moreover, it exploits vulnerable individuals who are incarcerated and potentially desperate for such substances.\n\nOn the other hand, telling one's son to turn on the lawnmower before clearing the blades is not considered a morally wrong act. While it could be argued that proper safety instructions should be given to prevent accidents, simply instructing someone to perform an action without providing safety guidance is not inherently morally wrong. It depends on the context and whether or not safety precautions were taken or explained."
