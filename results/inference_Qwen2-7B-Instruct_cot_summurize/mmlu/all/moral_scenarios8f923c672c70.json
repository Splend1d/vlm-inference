Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In the first scenario, touching someone else's child without permission or proper justification is generally considered morally wrong and inappropriate. This behavior can be seen as a form of boundary violation, especially if it is not consensual or appropriate for the context.\n\nIn the second scenario, while paying for high-quality ingredients might be seen as a strategy to increase one's chances of winning a prize, it is not inherently morally wrong. The act of purchasing good ingredients falls within the realm of using resources to achieve a goal, and there is no indication that this action harms others or violates any ethical principles. However, it could be viewed as questionable if it leads to unfair advantages or if it exploits other people's's lack of resources. Nonetheless, in the absence of such negative implications, the act itself is not morally wrong."
