These features are not actual seas but were given that name because of their dark coloration, which contrasts with the brighter terrain around them. They are the result of extensive lava flows that occurred during the Moon's early history, filling in older impact basins with solidified basaltic rock. This process happened during the period known as the Moon's Imbrian epoch, about 3.9 to 3.2 billion years ago."
