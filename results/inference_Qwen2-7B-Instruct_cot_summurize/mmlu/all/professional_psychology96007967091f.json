While preparing her lecture the night before the presentation, Dr. Black decides it would be valuable to demonstrate some of her techniques with the group. She decides that, instead of lecturing for the full four hours, she will have attendees divide into groups for the last two hours to experiment with the techniques. According to ethical standards, this is:\n\nA. ethical if she allows participants to leave after the lecture portion of the seminar.\nB. ethical if the demonstration is well executed and educational.\nC. unethical since she advertised the seminar as a \u201clecture.\u201d\nD. unethical because she plans to spend some of the time lecturing when the most beneficial part will probably be the experiential portion\n"

By advertising her seminar as a \"lecture\" and then changing its format to include more interactive, experiential components without clearly informing the attendees of this change, Dr. Black could potentially mislead her audience about what they are paying for. This could lead to dissatisfaction among the attendees who were expecting a traditional lecture format and might feel misled or underwhelmed by the shift towards more hands-on activities. It's important for Dr. Black to ensure that all changes to the advertised format are communicated to the attendees before they decide to participate, so there are are no misunderstandings or disappointments."
