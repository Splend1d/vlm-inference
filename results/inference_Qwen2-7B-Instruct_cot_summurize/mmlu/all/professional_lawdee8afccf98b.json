Call us to reserve your table. \"The response to the promotion was more than the restaurant expected, and the restaurant was soon overbooked for the Mother's Day brunch. On the day before Mother's Day, the restaurant owner decided to double-check inventory to make sure the restaurant had enough food and supplies to handle the large Mother's Day crowd. To her horror, she discovered that the restaurant was almost out of eggs. Knowing that a large supply of eggs would be needed for the omelet station, the owner immediately sent the following e-mail to her egg supplier:\"Desperately need 20 flats of Grade AA eggs for tomorrow's brunch. Money is no object. The eggs must be delivered today. \"The supplier e-mailed back:\"No problem! I'll load them on the truck and deliver them within the hour. \"With respect to the agreement between the owner and the supplier, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the omittance of a fixed contract price?\n\nA. The contract is unenforceable as violative of the statute of frauds.\nB. The contract is unenforceable, because of indefiniteness.\nC. The contract may be enforceable if it is later modified to include the price term.\nD. The contract is enforceable with reasonable price being fixed at time of delivery.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The contract may be enforceable if it is later modified to include the price term.\n\nIn this scenario, there is an initial agreement between the restaurant owner and the egg supplier where the supplier agrees to deliver 20 flats of Grade AA eggs for the next day's brunch without specifying a fixed contract price. This agreement can be considered an oral contract, which might be enforceable under certain circumstances. However, contracts involving the sale of goods worth more than $500 typically require a written agreement to be enforceable, according to the Statute of Frauds. Since the value of the eggs could potentially exceed $500, this might initially seem like an issue. However, the Statute of Frauds applies to the writing requirement, not necessarily to the enforceability of the agreement itself.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the supplier has already agreed to deliver the eggs, and there is mutual assent (the agreement on the terms of the transaction. The fact that the price was not initially specified does not automatically make the contract unenforceable. Instead, it creates a situation where the parties need to agree upon the price at a later date. This is known as an executory contract, where the final terms are to be determined through further negotiation or by applying a standard market rate or other means of establishing a fair price.\n\nThus, option C is the most accurate statement, indicating that the contract may be enforceable if it is later modified to include the price term. This modification could happen through a written agreement specifying the price or by an oral agreement if both parties agree to the price and terms."
