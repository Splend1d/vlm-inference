One of these rules states that if there was \"substantial authority\" for the tax shelter position taken, the preparer penalty does not apply. Substantial authority generally means that a \"preponderance of reliable\u6743\u5a01 sources\" support the tax shelter position. This implies that it's significantly more likely than not that the position will be upheld by the IRS. Therefore, option A is correct."
