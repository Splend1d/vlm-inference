This is because language development typically begins around 12-15 months when children start to babble and make sounds that resemble words. By around 18-24 months, many children can produce simple sentences using two words ( such as \"more juice\" or \"mommy gone\". \n\nWhile all of these skills are important for child development, learning to say a sentence is generally the first step in language acquisition. Learning to write with a pencil, cut with a knife, and clap hands come later as they involve more complex motor skills and coordination."
