This concept emphasizes that power is not only held by the economic elite ( (like the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat) but also by a political elite who hold significant influence within the state apparatus. The power elite concept suggests that these two groups often overlap and collaborate, maintaining their power through various means including institutional structures, social networks, and shared interests.\n\nTo clarify further:\nA. \"The ruling class, or bourgeoisie, who exploit the proletariat\" describes aspects of Marxist theory focusing on economic exploitation.\nB. \"A capitalist class dependent on property ownership and advantaged life chances\" aligns more closely with Marxist or sociological theories that emphasize the role of the capitalist class in society.\nC. \"An alignment of classes with shared interests but no state power\" doesn't directly match Scott's use of the term 'power elite', which specifically refers to those who wield significant power within the state."
