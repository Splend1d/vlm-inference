The entity's intention to omit from the financial statements substantially all of the disclosures required by GAAP.\n\nAccountants have a professional responsibility to ensure that financial statements comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( (GAAP) or other applicable accounting standards. Omitting substantial disclosures required by GAAP could lead to misleading financial statements, which would violate the accountant's ethical and professional obligations. Therefore, an accountant might decline such an engagement to avoid being associated with potentially compromised financial reporting."
