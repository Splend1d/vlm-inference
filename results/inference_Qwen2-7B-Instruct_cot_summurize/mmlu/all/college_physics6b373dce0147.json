This relationship is given by:\n\n\\[ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{R^3}{GM}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\( M \\) is the mass of the central body ( (the planet),\n- \\( R \\) is the orbital radius of the satellite,\n- \\( T \\) is the period of the orbit.\n\nAnalyzing this equation, we can see that:\n- \\( T \\) is independent of \\( M \\), which corresponds to option A.\n- \\( T \\) is not directly proportional to \\( m^{1/2} \\), so option B is incorrect.\n- \\( T \\) is not linear in \\( R \\), so option C is incorrect.\n- \\( T \\) is proportional to \\( R^{3/2} \\), making option D correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
