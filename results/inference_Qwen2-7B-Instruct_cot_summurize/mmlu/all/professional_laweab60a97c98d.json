                    "text": "After graduating from law school, a graduate moved to a city where she had been offered a position in an entertainment law firm. When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody. Terribly upset, the graduate was unable to take the bar exam and, thus, lost her job at the entertainment law firm. If the graduate asserts a claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company.\nB. Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.\nC. No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress.\nD. No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is B. Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.\n\nIn this scenario, the bar review company could potentially be liable for infliction of emotional distress if it engaged in outrageous conduct that caused the graduate significant emotional distress. The fact that the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, leading to the issuance of a warrant for the graduate's arrest, can be considered outrageous conduct. Even though the company later learned that the graduate had paid the enrollment fee, its failure to inform the prosecutor promptly could contribute to the claim of emotional distress.\n\nHowever, the other options do not necessarily lead to a clear conclusion for the graduate's potential claim:\n\nA. Intent to defraud is not directly relevant to the claim of infliction of emotional distress. The focus is more on the company's actions and their impact on the graduate.\n\nC. Intent to cause emotional distress is also not the primary factor here. The question is whether the company's actions were outrageous enough to cause distress.\n\nD. Whether filing a complaint with the prosecutor was \"outrageous\" depends on the circumstances and the company's intent. If the company acted reasonably and believed in good faith that the graduate had not paid, this might not constitute outrageous conduct. However, if the company pursued legal action aggressively or without proper consideration of the facts, it could be seen as engaging in outrageous conduct.\n\nGiven the specific facts provided, option B seems the most appropriate choice, as it directly addresses the company's conduct in failing to communicate the payment of the fee to the prosecutor, which could be seen as contributing to the graduate's emotional distress."
