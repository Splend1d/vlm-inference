He posits that a person who is indifferent to the suffering of others, i.e., unaffected by images of human happiness or misery, would likely lack empathy and compassion. Empathy and compassion are are foundational to recognizing and valuing virtue ( (goodness) and vice (evil). Virtue encompasses behaviors and actions that are considered morally good, while vice refers to morally bad actions.\n\nFurthermore, Hume suggests that our appreciation of art and beauty often involves feelings of pleasure and satisfaction that are intertwined with our emotional responses to the world around us. If a person is completely unresponsive to images of human happiness or misery, they might also struggle to appreciate or find value in art and beauty that evokes these emotions.\n\nTherefore, based on Hume's philosophical stance, the answer would be D. all of the above. A person who is unaffected by images of human happiness or misery would likely be indifferent not only to virtue and vice but also to art and beauty."
