Denying the Antecedent\n\nThis logical fallacy occurs when someone argues that because the initial statement (\"when you are intelligent\") is true, then the consequent (\"you'll succeed\") must also be true for everyone who fits the initial description. However, this ignores the fact that there can be other factors influencing success, and not everyone who is intelligent will necessarily succeed. It also doesn't account for those who might succeed despite not being considered \"intelligent\" by conventional standards."
