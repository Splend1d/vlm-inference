Mg(OH)2 precipitates\n\nExplanation: The addition of HCl, a strong acid, will react with any present Mg(OH)2 according to the reaction:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mg(OH)_2(s)} + \\text{2H}^+(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{Mg}^{2+}(aq) + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\]\n\nThis reaction consumes hydroxide ions and magnesium ions, potentially shifting the solubility equilibrium of magnesium hydroxide towards its formation as it tries to replenish the consumed ions. If the concentration of magnesium or hydroxide ions rises above their respective solubility product constants (Ksp values, Mg(OH)2 will precipitate out of the solution.\n\nIt's important to note that the addition of HCl doesn't directly increase the solubility product constant (Ksp for Mg(OH)2, nor does it cause magnesium chloride (MgCl2) to precipitate from the solution under standard conditions since magnesium chloride is highly soluble in water. Additionally, adding HCl should not lead to an increase in the concentration of water molecules ([H2O]) as this is not a change in the composition of the solvent itself but rather a chemical reaction involving the solvent."
