Connecticut ( (1965) was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States established a constitutional right to privacy, albeit not explicitly stated in the Constitution. The case involved a challenge to a Connecticut law that prohibited the use of contraceptives by married couples. The Court ruled that the law violated the right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects against state infringement of fundamental rights.\n\nRoe v. Wade (1973) is another landmark case that further expanded the concept of privacy rights. This case addressed a Texas law that banned abortion except to save the life of the mother. The Supreme Court, citing the right to privacy established in Griswold v. Connecticut, ruled that there is a fundamental right to privacy in the Constitution, which includes a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. This decision became a cornerstone in reproductive rights in the United States.\n\nThese cases have had significant impacts on American society, influencing laws and public policy related to personal autonomy and individual liberties."
