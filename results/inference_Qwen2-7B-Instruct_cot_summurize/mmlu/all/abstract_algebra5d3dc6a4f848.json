Let's find \\(e\\) first.\n\nIf we take \\(a = b\\), then \\(a * a = a + a + 1\\), which simplifies to \\(2a + 1\\). For \\(a = 0\\), this gives us \\(2*0 + 1 = 1\\), so \\(e = 1\\).\n\nNow, we want to find \\(a^{-1}\\) such that:\n\n\\[a * a^{-1} = 1\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a * a^{-1}\\) with \\(a + a^{-1} + 1\\):\n\n\\[a + a^{-1} + 1 = 1\\]\n\nSove for \\(a^{-1}\\):\n\n\\[a + a^{-1} + 1 = 1\\]\n\\[a + a^{-1} = 0\\]\n\\[a^{-1} = -a\\]\n\nSo, the inverse of \\(a\\) is \\(-a\\), which is not listed in your options directly, but if you consider option C: \\(a-2\\), it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the formulation or interpretation of the options provided.\n\nBased on the given operation and the steps followed, the correct answer would be derived from understanding that the inverse operation leads to \\(a^{-1} = -a\\), which isn't exactly represented by any of the options A through D as they are given. \n\nTherefore, none of the options A. 0, B. -2, C. a-2, D. (2+a)*-1 directly correspond to the correct mathematical derivation based on the operation given. If option C was intended to represent \\(-a\\), then it would be closest to the correct answer, albeit presented differently than mathematically expected."
