The closest match to our calculation would be A. 7, but this doesn't perfectly divide 56 into 8 equal parts without a remainder. \n\nGiven the context and options provided, if we were to choose the most fitting answer based on the information given, and assuming a possible slight misinterpretation or error in the question's setup, the correct answer might be considered as **A. 7**, though it does not exactly solve the problem as described mathematically."
