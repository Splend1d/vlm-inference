According to Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) theory, the body goes through three stages in response to stress: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. During the exhaustion stage, the body becomes overwhelmed by prolonged stress and is no longer able to cope effectively. This can lead to a weakened immune system, making individuals more susceptible to diseases."
