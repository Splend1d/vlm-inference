This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.\n\u2014John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545\nWhich of the following is the biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists when compared to their fellow Protestant Lutherans?\n\nA. Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.\nB. Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.\nC. Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.\nD. Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.\n"

Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.\n\nCalvinists, also known as Reformed Christians, typically recognize only two sacraments - Baptism and the Lord's Supper ( (Communion), based on their interpretation of Jesus' words and practices during his time. In contrast, Lutherans, part of the broader Protestant tradition, generally uphold the concept of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist and recognize the Sacrament of Baptism and the Sacrament of the Altar ( (also known as the Lord's Supper or Communion) as essential parts of their liturgy and doctrine. They believe in Transubstantiation, which means that the bread and wine become the actual body and blood of Christ after the consecration, although the specifics of this doctrine can vary among Lutheran denominations."
