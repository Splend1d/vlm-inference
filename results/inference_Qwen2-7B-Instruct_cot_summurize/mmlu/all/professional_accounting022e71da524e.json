Use more experienced audit team members to perform year-end testing.\n\nThis decision acknowledges the increased risk identified and leverages more seasoned professionals to conduct the critical year-end testing. Experienced auditors are likely to have a deeper understanding of potential risks, better judgment, and more effective strategies to mitigate those risks, which can help ensure the accuracy and reliability of the financial statements.\n\nOption A ( Moving detailed analytical procedures from year-end to interim might not necessarily address the issue if the problem lies with the underlying transactions rather than the analytical techniques used.\n\nOption B Increasing the dollar threshold for vouching customer invoices could potentially overlook smaller discrepancies that might still be significant or indicative of larger issues within the accounts receivable process.\n\nOption C Sending negative accounts receivable confirmations instead of positive ones is typically used when the auditor has concerns about the existence of receivables. However, it does not directly address the need for more experienced personnel to handle the situation.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most suitable choice in this context."
