For impulsive children, this might involve teaching them to replace automatic, impulsive thoughts with more constructive, focused statements that encourage them to engage with tasks rather than reacting impulsively.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nA. Attending better to tasks by writing down their lesson objectives in advance is part of goal-setting strategies, which can be effective for many children but specifically focuses on written goals rather than verbal self-instructions.\n\nC. Focusing thoughts on mood-elevating cognitions might be beneficial for some children experiencing low mood, but it doesn't directly address the issue of impulse control or task engagement, which is the primary concern in self-instructional training for impulsive children.\n\nD. Using programmed instructions to shape adaptive behavior gradually refers to a broader category of techniques such as Applied Behavior Analysis ( (ABA), which might include self-instructional training but encompasses a wide range of behavioral interventions designed to improve specific behaviors over time. While it could potentially include self-instruction, it's not the most specific answer to how self-instructional training is used for impulsive children."
