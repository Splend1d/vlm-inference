                    "text": "The Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP) is a common law doctrine that generally limits interests in property to those that vest, or become possessory, within a period of 21 years after some life in being or lives in being plus 21 years. The purpose of this rule is to prevent the indefinite or remote vesting of property interests.\n\nIn the scenario presented:\n\nA. The son's interest is not contingent upon the survival of the veterinarian's dogs; it is triggered by the condition that the son must own any dogs at the time of the veterinarian's death. This does not make it a contingent remainder.\n\nB. An executory interest of a shifting type involves a situation where the interest shifts from one person to another as events occur. However, without knowing exactly how the shifting occurs in this case, we can't definitively say it's a shifting type interest. More importantly, the RAP would apply based on the structure of the interest, not its shifting nature.\n\nC. An executory interest of a shifting type that is void under the RAP would imply that the interest shifts in such a way that it does not vest within the perpetuity period. Since the son's interest is contingent on owning dogs at the time of the veterinarian's death, it's not clear how this would fall under the category of a shifting type interest void under the RAP, especially without more context about the shifting mechanism.\n\nD. An executory interest of a springing type becomes possessory when a certain event occurs. In this case, the son's interest springs into existence if he owns dogs at the time of the veterinarian's death. This fits the description of a springing interest. Moreover, since the son's interest is contingent on him owning dogs at the time of the veterinarian's death, it could potentially violate the RAP if there is no guarantee that he will own dogs at that point, making the interest uncertain and potentially void.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer would likely be D: an executory interest of a springing type that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities, because it hinges on an uncertain future event (the son owning dogs at the time of the veterinarian's death. However, the precise classification may depend on additional details about the conditions under which the son's interest becomes possessory and whether the RAP is interpreted to allow for such a conditional vesting. Without more specific information about the exact wording and conditions of the will, the most accurate choice based on the given options is D."
