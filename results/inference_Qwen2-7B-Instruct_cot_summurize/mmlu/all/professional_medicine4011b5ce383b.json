She does not use condoms or other contraception. The mother is concerned about her behavior. The patient's parents separated 3 months ago. She had been an honor student and excelled in sports and leadership positions at school before the separation. Since the separation, however, she has become sullen, defiant, and rebellious. She has begun smoking cigarettes, disobeying her curfew, and being truant from school. This patient is most likely using which of the following defense mechanisms?\n\nA. Acting out\nB. Displacement\nC. Projection\nD. Reaction formation\n"

Among the options provided:\n\nA. Acting out: This refers to expressing emotions through behavior rather than words. It seems fitting that she might be acting out her feelings of loss, anger, or confusion.\n\nB. Displacement: This is redirecting feelings towards an easier target. If she feels anger or sadness about her parents' separation, she might be displacing these feelings onto others by becoming defiant or rebellious.\n\nC. Projection: This involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. It's possible that she might project her own feelings of vulnerability or shame onto others.\n\nD. Reaction Formation: This is the opposite of one\u2019s true feelings. For example, if she truly feels vulnerable and seeks comfort, she might act like she doesn't need anyone.\n\nGiven the context and the behaviors described, option A, Acting Out, seems to be the most fitting choice for this scenario, as it directly addresses her engagement in risky behaviors and defiance as outward expressions of internal turmoil. However, it's important to note that this analysis is based on the information provided and in a clinical setting, a thorough evaluation would be necessary to determine the specific defense mechanism(s) at play."
