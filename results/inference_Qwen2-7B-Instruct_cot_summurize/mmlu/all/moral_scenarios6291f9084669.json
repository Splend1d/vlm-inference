This action violates basic human rights and principles of equality and respect for all people regardless of their background. \n\nGoing to the bathroom inside an elevator is generally not considered morally wrong. While it might be inconvenient for others using the elevator at the same time, it's a personal choice that doesn't harm or disrespect others. However, it might be considered rude or inconsiderate, depending on the context and the situation, but it's not necessarily morally wrong."
