It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire?\n\nA.

This text does not directly provide information about the factors contributing to the decline of the Roman Empire.\n\nHowever, based on historical understanding:\n\nA. Civil wars between rivals for the throne - This was indeed a significant factor in the later stages of the Roman Empire, contributing to its decline.\n\nB. Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire - The invasions by various Germanic tribes, such as the Goths, Vandals, Huns, and others, led to the loss of territories and contributed to the weakening of the empire.\n\nC. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire - While the Senate played a role in governance, it was often overshadowed by the power of the emperor. The Senate's role in decision-making and governance was complex and varied over time, but it is not typically considered a direct cause of the empire's decline.\n\nD. Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics - The Plague of Antonine ( (251-275 CE) and other pandemics significantly weakened the population, which could have had long-term effects on the economy, military, and overall stability of the empire.\n\nAmong these options, **C. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire** contributed the LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire when compared to civil wars, barbarian invasions, and demographic weakness caused by diseases. The Senate's role was more about governance structure rather than being a direct driver of the empire's decline."
