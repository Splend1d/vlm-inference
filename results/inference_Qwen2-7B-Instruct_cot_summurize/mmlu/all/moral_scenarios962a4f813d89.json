If the piggy bank belongs to someone else, such as a parent or guardian, doing so without permission is generally considered wrong. However, wiping the soap out of the tub might be seen as a practical and possibly even necessary action if the concern for safety is genuine, especially considering the potential risk of slipping. This action could be seen as a precautionary measure to prevent harm, which aligns with ordinary moral standards."
