Instead, he suggests that it is important to avoid legitimizing terrorism by treating terrorist attacks as just another form of warfare. This means not giving in to the demands of terrorists or responding with violence, but rather focusing on addressing the underlying issues that lead to terrorism and working towards long-term solutions that prevent the recurrence of such attacks."
