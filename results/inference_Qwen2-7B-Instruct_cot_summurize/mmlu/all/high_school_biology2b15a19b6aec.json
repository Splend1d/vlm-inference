When a large proportion of loci ( or specific locations on chromosomes where genes are found - are \"fixed,\" it means that there is no variation at those particular locations. This results in lower nucleotide variability because there are fewer differences among individuals.\n\nC. Average heterozygosity is the measure of genetic diversity within a population. Fixed loci reduce heterozygosity because they result in identical alleles being present at those loci across the entire population, thus reducing the number of different alleles present.\n\nB. Genetic polyploidy refers to organisms having more than two sets of chromosomes. It doesn't directly correlate with the proportion of fixed loci in a population. Populations can be polyploid regardless of their level of locus fixation."
