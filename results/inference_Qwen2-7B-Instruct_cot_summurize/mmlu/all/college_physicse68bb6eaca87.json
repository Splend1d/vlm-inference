Gravity acts only on the vertical direction, so it does not affect the horizontal (or in this case, the northward) velocity.\n\nTherefore, 4.0 seconds after it is released, the velocity of the payload relative to the plane would still be 100 m/s north.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 100 m/s north"
