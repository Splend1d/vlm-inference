Every second number is divisible by 2, so there are \\( \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\) numbers divisible by 2.\n\nNext, we want to exclude those numbers which are also divisible by 3, because we're interested only in numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3. To find out how many numbers are divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., divisible by 6, we divide 100 by 6, getting \\( \\frac{100}{6} = 16.\\overline{3} \\). Since we can't have a fraction of a number, there are 16 numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 6.\n\nTherefore, to find the numbers that are divisible by 2 but not by 3, we subtract the numbers divisible by 6 from the total number of numbers divisible by 2:\n\n\\[ 50 - 16 = 34 \\]\n\nSo, there are 34 numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 2 but not by 3.\n\nThe total number of integers in the set is 100. Thus, the probability that a randomly selected integer in the set is divisible by 2 but not by 3 is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{34}{100} = \\frac{17}{50} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. \\(\\frac{17}{50}\\)**."
