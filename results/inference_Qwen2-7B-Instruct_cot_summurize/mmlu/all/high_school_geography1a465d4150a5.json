Similarly, Mecca in Saudi Arabia is the most important religious site in Islam and serves as a destination for the annual pilgrimage known as Hajj, which is mandatory for all able-bodied Muslims who can afford it.\n\nWhile Varanasi and Mecca are both significant cultural and religious centers, they do not fit the descriptions provided in options A, C, and D:\n\nA. Neither Varanasi nor Mecca was historically a country that was colonized by the English. Varanasi is part of India, which has a complex history of colonization by various European powers, but not specifically the British. Mecca is part of Saudi Arabia, which was never directly colonized by the British either, though it was under influence from colonial powers like the Ottoman Empire and Portugal.\n\nC. Varanasi and Mecca are not major financial centers for the global economy. While both cities have economic activities, their primary roles are as spiritual and religious destinations rather than financial hubs.\n\nD. Varanasi and Mecca do not exemplify modern urban planning. Both cities have evolved over centuries, often with constraints due to their sacred status or historical development patterns, rather than being planned according to contemporary urban design principles."
