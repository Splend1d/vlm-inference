The accountant must maintain independence in mental attitude in all matters relating to the engagement.\n\nAn accountant conducting a review of interim financial information is required to maintain independence in mental attitude, meaning they should remain impartial and objective throughout the process. This ensures that their judgment and findings are not influenced by personal biases or interests. \n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. While it's true that an accountant may need to note inconsistencies in GAAP usage between periods, this is typically part of an audit, not necessarily a review engagement.\n\nB. A review engagement does not provide an opinion on the financial statements; rather, it involves a limited examination of the financial information to determine if it appears free from material misstatement.\n\nD. In a review, the accountant is not required to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to support an opinion as in an audit. Instead, they are expected to perform inquiries and analytical procedures to gather information that provides a reasonable basis for their conclusions."
