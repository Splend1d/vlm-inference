While technical considerations are important for a company's operations, they are not usually categorized as a direct competing responsibility alongside ethical, economic, and discretionary factors in the context of CSR. Corporate social responsibility ( (CSR) generally involves balancing the interests of various stakeholders including shareholders, employees, customers, the community, and the environment, while adhering to ethical standards and considering economic implications. Discretionary actions refer to those that go beyond legal requirements and voluntary initiatives taken by a company for social good."
