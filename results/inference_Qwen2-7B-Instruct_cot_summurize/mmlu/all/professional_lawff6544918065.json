Move for a new trial or in the alternative for remittitur to reduce the award in light of the shortened duration of the plaintiff's injuries.\nB. Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the judgment was based on the jury's mistaken belief that the plaintiff's injuries would be permanent.\nC. Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff committed a fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries.\nD.

The video tape shows the plaintiff jogging with her doctor, suggesting that her injuries might not be as severe as initially represented.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(2), a party may move for relief from a judgment based on \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\" In this case, the defendant argues that the jury's finding of permanent injuries was based on a mistake due to the lack of available evidence at the time of trial that contradicted the plaintiff's claims. The newly discovered evidence could potentially show that the plaintiff's condition was not as severe as initially believed, thus justifying relief from the judgment.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the defendant will have to demonstrate that the newly discovered evidence could not have been discovered earlier through reasonable diligence and that it is material and would likely result in a different outcome if the case were retried."
