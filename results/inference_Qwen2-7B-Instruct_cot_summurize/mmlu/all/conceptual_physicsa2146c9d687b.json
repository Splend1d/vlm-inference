This force is provided by the horizontal component of the tension in the string. The vertical component of the tension balances the weight of the ball (mg, just as before. \n\nThe magnitude of the centripetal force required depends on the speed of the ball. If the ball moves too slowly, the tension will not need to provide enough force to create the necessary centripetal acceleration, thus T will be less than mg. Conversely, if the ball moves fast enough, the tension must increase to provide the required centripetal force, making T greater than mg. Therefore, the tension can vary depending on the speed of the ball, making option D the correct choice."
