Since the stone is thrown horizontally, its vertical motion is solely due to gravity and is independent of its horizontal motion.\n\nThe vertical distance \\(y\\) the stone falls can be described by the equation:\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\]\n\nWe are given that \\(y = 80 \\, \\text{m}\\) and need to find \\(t\\), the time it takes for the stone to hit the water.

This indicates there might have been a misunderstanding in the question's options or assumptions. Based on the given choices and assuming they are meant to be approximate, none of them exactly matches the precise calculation. However, if we had to choose the closest option considering typical rounding practices in such problems, option B ( 2 s would not be correct based on our calculation. A more accurate answer based on the calculation would suggest none of the provided options are correct."
