The genome has been identified by the new method of deep sequencing\n\nThe reason why members of the astrovirus family were only recently recognized as significant enteric viruses for humans is largely due to advancements in molecular biology techniques, particularly in the field of next-generation sequencing or \"deep sequencing.\" This technology allows for the rapid and comprehensive analysis of viral genomes, which was not possible with previous methods of detection and identification. As a result, many viruses, including certain strains of astroviruses, have been discovered and recognized as important human pathogens that were previously overlooked or undiagnosed.\n\nWhile the other options listed ( B. A new vector has been discovered, C. They infect a wide range of domestic animals and so contaminate meat, and D. Knowledge of their replication as positive sense ssRNA viruses is now complete \u2013 all could be true statements about astroviruses, they do not explain why these viruses were only recently recognized as significant human pathogens. The key factor is the technological advancement that enabled the identification of their genetic material in human samples."
