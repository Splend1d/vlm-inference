Which of the following is true about water potential?\n\nA. An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\nB. Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.\nC. Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\nD. Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.\n"

Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\n\nWater potential (\u03a8w is calculated as \u03a8w = \u03a8p + \u03a8s, where \u03a8p is the pressure potential and \u03a8s is the solute potential. Both components can influence the direction of water flow. In this scenario, when a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution is placed into a beaker with a 0.6 M solution, water will move from the area of higher water potential ((the beaker) to the area of lower water potential ((the dialysis bag). This movement continues until both areas have equal water potential, which is known as equilibrium. \n\nOptions A, B, and D are not entirely accurate because they either describe only one component of water potential or suggest a directional movement based on a single potential type without considering the balance between pressure and solute potentials."
