These organizations often establish PACs to contribute funds to political campaigns and influence legislation that could impact their industries or specific business interests. \n\nEnvironmental activists and labor unions also have their own PACs, but they generally do not create as many as for-profit businesses. Religious institutions may occasionally establish PACs, but this is less common compared to other interest groups."
