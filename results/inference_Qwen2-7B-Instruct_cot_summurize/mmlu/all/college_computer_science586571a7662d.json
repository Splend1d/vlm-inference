It's possible for a recursive procedure to terminate without using any local variables.\n\nII. For a recursive procedure to guarantee termination, it must have at least one execution path where it does not call itself. This is often achieved through a base case\u2014a condition under which the procedure does not call itself again but instead returns a value directly. This ensures that the recursion eventually stops.\n\nIII. P needing to either refer to a global variable or have at least one parameter is indeed crucial for a recursive procedure. Without such references, there would be no mechanism for the procedure to know when to stop calling itself (since there would be no external information guiding the termination condition. The parameters or global variables provide the means to check for the termination condition.\n\nTherefore, statements II and III are necessary for ensuring that a recursive procedure will terminate, making option D the correct choice."
