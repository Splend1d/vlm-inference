This is often based on the laws governing partnerships in the jurisdiction where the partnership operates, which usually grant general partners broad powers to bind the partnership in ordinary course of business without the need for unanimous consent from all partners. \n\nThornton's lack of authority under the internal partnership agreement does not affect his ability to enter into binding agreements with third parties like Clark, provided these agreements are within the scope of the partnership's business activities and reasonable under the circumstances."
