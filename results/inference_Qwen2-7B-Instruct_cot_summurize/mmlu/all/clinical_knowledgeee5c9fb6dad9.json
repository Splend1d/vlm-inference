It can cause dryness of the skin.\n\nShampoo is formulated primarily to cleanse and care for hair, which has a different pH level and oil production compared to the skin. When used on the skin, it can disrupt the natural oils and pH balance, potentially leading to dryness, irritation, and other skin issues. Skin care products like body washes or soap are specifically designed to clean the skin gently without causing these adverse effects."
