When the elevator stopped on the fifth floor, a man entered the elevator smoking a cigar. The man was standing in front of the elderly woman on the elevator when the woman tapped him on the shoulder. When the man turned around, the woman pointed to the \"No Smoking\" sign and said, \"Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting that cigar out?\" The man indignantly responded by inhaling heavily on his cigar, and then he blew a big puff of smoke into the woman's face. When the elevator stopped on the next floor, the man then departed. If the woman brings a civil suit against the man for battery, who will prevail?\n\nA. The woman, because the smoke touched her face.\nB. The woman, because she had a reasonable basis for fearing that the man would attack her.\nC. The man, because he did not touch the woman.\nD. The man, because his conduct was annoying but did not inflict any bodily injury on the woman.\n"

Battery is a legal term used to describe an intentional act that causes another person to reasonably fear imminent harmful or offensive contact, or actually results in harmful or offensive contact.\n\nThe key elements that the woman needs to prove for a successful battery claim are:\n\n1. **Intentional Act**: The man intentionally inhaled and blew smoke into the woman's face, which is an intentional act.\n2. **Harmful or Offensive Contact**: The smoke from the cigar coming into direct contact with the woman's face can be considered offensive contact, especially since it is unwanted and potentially irritating.\n3. **Reasonable Fear**: Although the woman did not explicitly express fear, the fact that she asked the man to put out his cigar indicates that she reasonably perceived the situation as potentially harmful or offensive due to the smoke.\n\nGiven these elements, it seems clear that the man's actions meet the criteria for battery under the law. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The woman, because the smoke touched her face."
