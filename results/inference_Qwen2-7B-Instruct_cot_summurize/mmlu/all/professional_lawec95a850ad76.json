The testimony about the water is an admissible statement of an opposing party, but the rest of the testimony is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses.\n\nExplanation:\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, statements made by an opposing party may be admitted into evidence if they are offered against the party who made them. In this case, the statement about the water being an issue on the floor could potentially be considered a statement against interest, assuming that the presence of water on the floor was relevant to the plaintiff's claim (e.g., it created a dangerous condition that caused her to slip and fall. This type of statement would likely be admissible under Rule 801(e) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which allows statements that are \"against the declarant's proprietary or proprietary interest\" to be treated as non-hearsay.\n\nHowever, the store manager's subsequent statement offering to pay for the ambulance and hospital bills is more problematic. Such an offer to pay medical expenses could be seen as an attempt to induce the plaintiff to settle the claim, which is generally not admissible as substantive evidence of liability or damages under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 403 allows a court to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\n\nTherefore, while the part of the statement regarding the water might be admissible, the part regarding payment for medical expenses would likely be excluded due to concerns over potential jury influence and the risk of unfair prejudice."
