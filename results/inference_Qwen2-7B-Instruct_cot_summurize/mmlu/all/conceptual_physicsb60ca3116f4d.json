Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\n\\[ KE_{avg} = \\frac{3}{2}kT \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant, \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature, and \\( m \\) is the degree of freedom. For diatomic gases like oxygen (O_2 and nitrogen N_2, the degree of freedom is 5 (since they can move in three translational directions and also rotate around their axis), while for monatomic gases like hydrogen H_2, the degree of freedom is 3 (because they can only move in three translational directions.\n\nSince all gases are at the same temperature and assuming no external forces acting on them, the faster molecules would be those with more kinetic energy, which is directly related to their mass. Given that hydrogen has the smallest atomic mass, its molecules will have the highest average kinetic energy and thus be the fastest on average compared to oxygen and nitrogen molecules."
