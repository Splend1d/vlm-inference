A Japanese tourist vacationing in the United States\n\nIf the value of the United States dollar increases relative to the Japanese yen, it means that each yen can buy more dollars than before. This makes travel and goods/services from the US cheaper for Japanese tourists. Therefore, they would be able to get more value for their money when visiting the US.\n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are not as directly beneficial:\n\nA. A United States car dealer importing Japanese cars: While this might seem like a positive scenario, an increase in the value of the dollar against the yen actually makes Japanese cars more expensive for American buyers, potentially reducing demand for Japanese imports.\n\nC. A worker in the United States beer industry: The value of the dollar doesn't directly impact a worker's income or job security in the beer industry. It could affect the price of imported ingredients (like hops, but since this is not specified, we cannot conclude it benefits them specifically.\n\nD. A Japanese baker buying United States wheat: Similar to option A, an increase in the value of the dollar against the yen makes US wheat more expensive for Japanese buyers, which could negatively impact the baker's costs and potentially their profit margins."
