Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. A skull x-ray shows a linear, nondepressed basal skull fracture. Two weeks later, the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range, increased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Following the administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increases. The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following?\n\nA. Adenylyl cyclase\nB. Ca2+ channels\nC. Janus kinase\nD. Serine kinase\n"

Ca2+ channels.\n\nDesmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone ( ADH. Its primary function is to regulate water balance in the body by controlling the permeability of the renal tubules to water. By activating calcium channels in the collecting ducts of the kidneys, desmopressin increases the reabsorption of water, leading to an increase in urine concentration ( osmolality. This is particularly useful in conditions like central diabetes insipidus where the body produces too much urine because it doesn't respond properly to vasopressin or ADH.\n\nThe other options do not relate directly to the mechanism of action of desmopressin:\n\nA. Adenylyl cyclase is activated by hormones such as adrenaline and plays a role in various cellular responses, but it's not the mechanism through which desmopressin works.\n\nC. Janus kinase ( (JAK) enzymes are are part of a signaling pathway that activates transcription factors when they are phosphorylated, but they're not typically involved in the direct effects of desmopressin.\n\nD. Serine kinases are a family of enzymes that add phosphate groups to proteins, often acting as a part of signaling pathways. They are not directly related to the action of desmopressin on kidney function."
