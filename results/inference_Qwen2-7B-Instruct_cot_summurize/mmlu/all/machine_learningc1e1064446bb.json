To avoid overfitting the training set\n\nPruning a decision tree is a technique used to reduce the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improving predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. Pruning can help here as it reduces the complexity of the final classifier."
