Since this is a reaction of the type:\n\n\\[ \\text{Br}_2(\\text{g}) + \\text{Cl}_2(\\text{g}) \\rightleftharpoons 2\\text{BrCl}(\\text{g}) \\]\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the reaction is:\n\n\\[ K_c = \\frac{[\\text{BrCl}]^2}{[\\text{Br}_2][\\text{Cl}_2]} \\]\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of BrCl would be \\(0.00813 - 2x\\) ( because for every mole of BrCl formed, two moles of BrCl are reactants are consumed, and since the stoichiometry is 2:1, for every mole of BrCl formed, there would be half a mole of each reactant consumed.\n\nGiven that the initial concentrations of Br2 and Cl2 are not provided, we can assume that they are equal to each other as the reaction starts and that their concentration decreases equally as the reaction proceeds. So, at equilibrium, both [Br2] and [Cl2] would be \\(0.00813 - x\\).\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n\n\\[ 15.0 = \\frac{(0.00813 - 2x)^2}{(0.00813 - x)^2} \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{15.0} = \\frac{0.00813 - 2x}{0.00813 - x} \\]\n\nLet's solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{15.0} = \\frac{0.00813 - 2x}{0.00813 - x} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{15.0} * (0.00813 - x) = 0.00813 - 2x \\]\n\n\\[ 0.00813 * \\sqrt{15.0} - \\sqrt{15.0} * x = 0.00813 - 2x \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{15.0} * x = 0.00813 - 0.00813 * \\sqrt{15.0} - 2x \\]\n\n\\[ (\\sqrt{15.0} + 2)x = 0.00813(1 - \\sqrt{15.0}) \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{0.00813(1 - \\sqrt{15.0})}{\\sqrt{15.0} + 2} \\]\n\nNow, calculating the value of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ x \\approx \\frac{0.00813(1 - 3.87298)}{\\sqrt{15.0} + 2} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx \\frac{-0.00813 \\times 2.87298}{\\sqrt{15.0} + 2} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx \\frac{-0.0233}{\\sqrt{15.0} + 2} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx \\frac{-0.0233}{3.87298 + 2} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx \\frac{-0.0233}{5.87298} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx -0.00397 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nThis calculation suggests a negative change in concentration which doesn't make sense in this context, indicating a mistake in the process"
