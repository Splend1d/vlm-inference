By recognizing $10,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nUnder the revaluation model in IFRS, when an asset is revalued, any increase in its fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI (and not in profit or loss). This is because the revaluation model aims to provide a more accurate reflection of the current value of the asset, aligning with the principles of IFRS 165 \"Revaluations and Depreciations\". \n\nIn this case, the fair value of the land increased from $90,000 at the end of year 1 to $105,000 at the end of year 2. The increase of $15,000 would typically be recognized in OCI. However, since there was was a decrease in the carrying amount in year 1 ($100,000 to $90,000), and then an increase back to $105,000, the net increase from the original cost ($100,000) to the new fair value ($105,000) is only $5,000. This $5,000 increase would be recognized directly in profit or loss as part of the amortization of the revaluation surplus. The remaining $10,000 increase from the adjusted carrying amount after the initial decrease ($90,000) to the new fair value ($105,000) is indeed recognized in other comprehensive income."
