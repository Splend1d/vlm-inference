She went to the home with an investigative team including a drug-sniffing dog. On the front porch of the home the dog began pacing back and forth frantically, which indicated smelling illegal drugs. The team retreated while some of them went to get a warrant. A warrant was issued based on the dog's behavior. The search inside revealed large quantities of marijuana. The homeowner was arrested. Through counsel, he filed a motion to suppress based on the assertion that the use of the dog was an illegal search without probable cause thus rendering the warrant invalid. Should the court suppress the evidence?\n\nA. No, because the detective had probable cause after receiving the anonymous call, which justified the use of the dog for a valid search -- the warrant was thus valid and the evidence will not be suppressed.\nB. No, because the detective had a right to take the dog to make a reasonable search, which led to the finding of probable cause and the issuance of a valid warrant.\nC. Yes, because the anonymous call was insufficient cause to allow for a search of the front porch with the dog, which made the warrant invalid \u0080\u0093 the suppression motion will be granted.\nD. Yes, because the dog's reaction did nothing to tell them that there were drugs inside \u0080\u0093 a warrant can never be based on a dog's information.\n"

Yes, because the anonymous call was insufficient cause to allow for a search of the front porch with the dog, which made the warrant invalid \u0080\u0093 the suppression motion will be granted.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe use of a drug-sniffing dog by law enforcement is generally considered a lawful search if it is conducted in conjunction with a valid search warrant or probable cause. However, in this scenario, the anonymous tip alone did not provide probable cause for the initial use of the dog to conduct a search of the home. Probable cause must be supported by specific and articulable facts that lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed and that evidence of the crime will be found at a particular place.\n\nIn the case described, the dog's behavior on the front porch provided some indication of possible illegal activity, but this alone does not constitute probable cause for a search. The fact that the team retreated and obtained a warrant based on the dog's behavior suggests that they recognized this as well. However, the warrant itself would need to be based on additional information beyond the dog's reaction to be considered valid.\n\nGiven that the homeowner argues the use of the dog was an illegal search without probable cause, and assuming that the warrant was solely based on the dog's behavior ( which is likely insufficient for probable cause, the court should grant the motion to suppress. This is because the evidence obtained through the search, which relied on an invalid warrant, cannot be used in court proceedings."
