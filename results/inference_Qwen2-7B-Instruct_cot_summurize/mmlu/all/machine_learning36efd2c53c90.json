The F1 score is particularly useful in scenarios where there is a significant class imbalance, as it balances precision and recall. It is not overly influenced by the prevalence of the majority class, making it a good choice for imbalanced datasets.\nStatement 2 is false. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC curve ( (AUC-ROC) is indeed a widely used metric for evaluating binary classifiers, but it is more commonly associated with traditional classification tasks rather than specifically for assessing anomaly detectors. While AUC-ROC can provide insights into the performance of anomaly detection models, specialized metrics like Precision at Recall (P@R), Detection Error Tradeoff ( DET curve, or Isolation Score might be more directly relevant to evaluating anomaly detection systems."
