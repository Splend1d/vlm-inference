                    "text": "To find the shortest distance from the curve \\(xy = 8\\) to the origin, we can use the formula for the distance between a point and a curve. The distance \\(D\\) from the origin \\((0,0)\\) to any point \\((x,y)\\) on the curve \\(xy=8\\) can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[D = \\frac{|Ax + By + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}\\]\n\nHere, \\(A=0\\), \\(B=-1\\), and \\(C=-8\\) ( since the equation of the curve is in the form \\(xy - 8 = 0\\). Thus,\n\n\\[D = \\frac{|0*x + (-1)*y + (-8)|}{\\sqrt{(0)^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{|-y - 8|}{\\sqrt{1}} = |y + 8|\\]\n\nSince \\(xy = 8\\), we have \\(y = \\frac{8}{x}\\). Substituting this into our distance formula gives:\n\n\\[D = | \\frac{8}{x} + 8 |\\]\n\nTo minimize this distance, we take the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) and set it equal to zero.\n\n\\[D' = -\\frac{8}{x^2} + 0 = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{8}{x^2} = 0\\]\n\nThis equation doesn't directly solve for \\(x\\) because there's no solution that satisfies this equation (since the derivative is actually:\n\n\\[D' = \\frac{-8}{x^2}\\]\n\nWe made an error in our differentiation step; let's correct that. The correct approach is to recognize that minimizing \\(D = |y + 8|\\) given \\(xy = 8\\) involves finding the value of \\(x\\) that minimizes \\(D\\). Since \\(y = \\frac{8}{x}\\), we substitute \\(y\\) in the distance formula:\n\n\\[D = | \\frac{8}{x} + 8 |\\]\n\nTo minimize \\(D\\), we look at the nature of the function inside the absolute value: \\(f(x) = \\frac{8}{x} + 8\\). This function decreases as \\(x\\) increases, and since \\(xy = 8\\), the minimum distance occurs when \\(x = y\\), due to symmetry and the nature of the hyperbola \\(xy = k\\) where the shortest distance to the origin occurs along the line \\(y = x\\) or \\(y = -x\\) for \\(k > 0\\).\n\nGiven \\(xy = 8\\), setting \\(x = y\\) gives us \\(x^2 = 8\\), so \\(x = \\pm\\sqrt{8} = \\pm2\\sqrt{2}\\). Since \\(x = y\\), we choose the positive value for simplicity (the negative value would yield the same distance due to the squared term in the distance formula.\n\nThus, \\(x = y = 2\\sqrt{2}\\), and substituting back into \\(xy = 8\\) confirms our choice. Now, calculating the distance:\n\n\\[D = |2\\sqrt{2 + 2\\sqrt{2}| = |4\\sqrt{2|\\]\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance from the curve \\(xy = 8\\) to the origin is \\(4\\sqrt{2\\), which corresponds to option D."
