In such cases, it becomes difficult to determine which action is morally preferable.\n\nGiven this perspective, Nagel would likely deny option B: \"can implies ought.\" This principle suggests that if something is possible (i.e., one has the capability or opportunity to do it), then one ought to do it. However, in the context of moral dilemmas, where doing one thing requires sacrificing another equally valuable thing, simply having the ability to act does not necessarily imply that one ought to do so.\n\nInstead, Nagel might argue for a more nuanced understanding of moral obligations and capabilities, where the right course of action may not always be clear-cut, even when one has the ability to act in certain ways. This alignss with his view on moral complexity and the limitations of moral principles in certain contexts."
