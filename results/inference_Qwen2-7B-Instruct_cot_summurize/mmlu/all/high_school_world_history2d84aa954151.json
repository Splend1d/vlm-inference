The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.\nIbn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185\nThe first passage tends to support which of the following traditional historical assumptions?\n\nA. That the majority of Muslims were more peaceful than Christians during the crusading era\nB. That most Muslims were interested only in protecting their own territory during the crusading era\nC. That many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent\nD. That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era\n"

That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era\n\nThe first passage you've quoted from Robert Irwin's \"Islam and the Crusades\" ( discusses the view among most Muslim authorities that the obligation of jihad ( a concept often translated as 'struggle' or 'war', did not end until the entire world was under the sway of Islam. It also mentions that the first duty of a Muslim ruler was to wage jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, suggesting that this was considered a serious obligation. This alignes with the notion that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era.\n\nThe second passage, from Ibn Jubayr, describes the interactions between Christians and Muslim hermits, indicating a degree of tolerance and kindness shown by Christians towards Muslim individuals, but it doesn't directly support or contradict the traditional historical assumptions related to the seriousness of the jihad ideology among Muslim elites. \n\nSo, based on the first passage, the answer that best fits is D: That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era."
