Twenty days after being served, the retailer, which is incor-porated in State C and has its principal place of business in State B, filed a notice of removal in a federal district court in State B. Was the action properly removed?\n\nA. No, because the notice of removal was not timely filed.\nB. No, because the retailer is a citizen of State B.\nC. Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.\nD. Yes, because the retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C.\n"

In this case, since the parties are citizens of different states ( (the woman from State A and the retailer from State C with its principal place of business in State B), and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 ( ($100,000), the action can be properly removed to a federal district court under the diversity jurisdiction."
