The friend told him that a former employee, who was a \"hothead\", was making harassing phone calls and threats. He faxed the officer a oneparagraph summary of the matter. The officer questioned the prior employee, who became verbally abusive and vehemently denied making the calls. The officer arrested him for criminal harassment and wrongful use of a communications device, stating, \"I'm going to teach you a lesson.\" The criminal case was thrown out, however, at the preliminary hearing when the police could not produce proof that the former employee made any phone calls to the business. The former employee then sued the police officer and the business owner for the tort of malicious prosecution. Leaving aside any considerations of immunity for the officer, can the former employee allege facts sufficient to support a malicious prosecution case?\n\nA. No, because the officer received enough facts from the owner to establish the elements of the criminal charges that he filed against the former employee.\nB. Yes, there were sufficient facts for the former employee to establish the basic elements of the malicious prosecution tort.\nC. No, because the business owner knew that it was the former employee who made the calls even if he could not prove it.\nD. Yes, the officer committed abuse of legal process when he improperly initiated the case.\n"

Yes, there were sufficient facts for the former employee to establish the basic elements of the malicious prosecution tort.\n\nMalicious prosecution is a tort that occurs when someone files a lawsuit against another person with no probable cause, intending to cause harm or with reckless disregard for the truth. For a successful claim of malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must typically show:\n\n1. That a criminal or civil proceeding was brought against them,\n2. That the proceeding was initiated without probable cause or with malice,\n3. That the proceeding terminated in their favor ( (i.e., the charges were dismissed or judgment was in their favor),\n4. That they suffered damages as a result of the proceeding, and\n5. That the defendant had no justifiable interest in bringing the proceeding.\n\nIn this case, the former employee can argue that the police officer filed criminal charges against him without probable cause, based solely on hearsay information from his employer, and with the intent to punish him for being a \"hothead\" and retaliate for unspecified grievances. Even though the criminal case was later dismissed due to lack of evidence linking the former employee to the phone calls, the fact that the charges were initiated without sufficient evidence and resulted in an arrest can be seen as meeting the first two elements of a malicious prosecution claim.\n\nFurthermore, the officer's statement \"I'm going to teach you a lesson\" suggests a motive to harm or punish the former employee, which may be interpreted as acting with malice. If the former employee can also demonstrate that he suffered damages as a result of the arrest and the time spent dealing with the false allegations, he would have a strong basis for a malicious prosecution claim. \n\nThus, under these circumstances, the former employee can likely allege sufficient facts to support a claim of malicious prosecution."
