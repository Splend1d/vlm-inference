The manager takes a random sample of 10 salespeople from each location independently and records the sales revenue generated by each person during the last four weeks. He decides to use a t-test to compare the mean sales revenue at the two locations. Which of the following assumptions is necessary for the validity of the t-test?\n\nA. The population standard deviations at both locations are equal.\nB. The population standard deviations at both locations are not equal.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.\n\nFor a t-test to be valid, several assumptions need to be met:\n\n1. **Independence**: The samples must be independent of each other. This means that the selection of one sample does not affect the selection of another, and the samples should not overlap.\n\n2. **Random Sampling**: The samples should be randomly selected from their respective populations to ensure that they are representative.\n\n3. **Normality**: The data should come from a normally distributed population, especially when sample sizes are small ( (less than 30). For larger samples, the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal, even if the underlying population is not.\n\n4. **Equal Variance (Homogeneity of Variance)**: This assumption applies specifically to the pooled t-test ( or when using an independent samples t-test with equal variances option. It assumes that the variances of the two groups being compared are equal. However, this is not a requirement for the validity of the t-test under all circumstances, particularly when using the Welch's t-test which does not assume equal variances.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\n- A) Assumes that the population standard deviations at both locations are equal, which is related to the homogeneity of variance assumption but not directly required for the t-test to be valid without adjustments like Welch's t-test.\n- B) Contradicts the typical approach where either equal variances are assumed or not, depending on the type of t-test used.\n- C) Assumes that the population standard deviations at both locations are are known, which is rarely the case in practical applications and not a requirement for conducting a t-test.\n- D) Correctly identifies the critical assumption for the t-test to be valid, especially when dealing with small sample sizes, which is that the populations of the sales records at each location are normally distributed.\n\nTherefore, the necessary assumption for the validity of the t-test in this scenario is that the population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed ( (Option D)."
