This represents the cost of the merchandise that was was was was sold during June.\n\nSince we don't have the exact amounts of purchases made in June, we can use the change in accounts payable for purchases as an indicator of the purchases made. Accounts payable for purchases at the beginning of the month is $85,000 and at the end of the month is $75,000. This indicates that the company made payments towards its June purchases in the amount of $85,000 - $75,000 = $10,000 less than the total purchases made during the month.\n\nTo find out the total purchases made during June, we would add back this difference to the accounts payable at the end of the month:\n\nTotal purchases = Accounts payable for purchases at June 30 + Difference in accounts payable\nTotal purchases = $75,000 + $10,000 = $85,000\n\nNow, to find the budgeted cash disbursements for June purchases, we take the total purchases and subtract the ending inventory from the beginning inventory:\n\nCash disbursements for June purchases = Total purchases - (Beginning inventory + Ending inventory\nCash disbursements for June purchases = $85,000 - $150,000 + $180,000\n\nCash disbursements for June purchases = $215,000\n\nThis value isn't listed among your options, which suggests there might have been a misunderstanding or error in the provided data or calculations. Given the steps and the numbers provided, the correct answer based on the calculation would be closest to option A ($220,000), but the precise calculation results in $215,000. If you're looking for the closest match among the choices provided, option A might be the best choice based on the calculation process described. However, please double-check the numbers and the question details as there seems to be a discrepancy."
