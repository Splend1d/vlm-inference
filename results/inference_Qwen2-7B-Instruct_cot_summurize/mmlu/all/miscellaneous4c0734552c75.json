Design and construct a three-dimensional model of a low-income, multifamily dwelling unit.\n\nThis objective directly engages students in the process of problem-solving and design thinking, which are are crucial skills for addressing complex societal issues. By designing and constructing a model, students can apply their knowledge of materials, systems, and processes to create a practical solution to a real-world problem ( in this case, creating affordable housing. This hands-on experience helps students understand the challenges involved in designing and building structures that meet specific needs, such as those of low-income families, and encourages them to think creatively about how to address these challenges with limited resources."
