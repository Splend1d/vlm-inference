A condition where people exist independently of state support, where human life is self-sufficient in that individuals do not require the assistance of state apparatus in order to live securely.\n\nHuman security is fundamentally about protecting individuals and communities from various forms of harm and ensuring their well-being. It encompasses several dimensions including personal safety, food security, health security, environmental security, economic security, and political security. The concept inherently involves the role of the state in providing protection, services, and policies frameworks to ensure these dimensions of security for its citizens. Thus, a scenario where people do not need state support to live securely contradicts the very essence of human security, which relies on the state's responsibility to protect its citizens."
