This type of offer is known as an \"invitation to treat,\" which typically does not create a binding contract until there is a formal acceptance from the buyer.\n\nOptions A, C, and D involve offers that are are intended to be binding upon acceptance by the buyer. In these cases, the seller's ability to revoke the offer before acceptance would depend on whether the offer explicitly states it will be irrevocable within a certain period or if there are other circumstances that make the offer binding.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, an offer can be revoked before acceptance if the offer does not specify it cannot be revoked. However, once the offer is accepted, a contract is formed, and the terms of the contract become legally binding on both parties."
