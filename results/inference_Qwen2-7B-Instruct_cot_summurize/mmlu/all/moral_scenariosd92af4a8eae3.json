This action goes against the principles of child safety and well-being, which are widely accepted as part of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Carpooling multiple children with an oversized SUV, while perhaps seen as a logistical challenge, is not inherently morally wrong; it's about ensuring the safety and comfort of all passengers, which can be managed through proper seat arrangements and supervision."
