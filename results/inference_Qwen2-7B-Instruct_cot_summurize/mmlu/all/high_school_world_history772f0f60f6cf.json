                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following later developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage?\n\nA. The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China.\nB. Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War.\nC. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry.\nD. Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution.\n"

                    "text": "The statement from Mao Zedong expresses a vision for agricultural transformation in China that aims to improve the lives of peasants and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance through socialist methods. This includes the eventual socialist transformation of agriculture, alongside industrialization and the transformation of other economic sectors.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China. This would not undermine the hopes expressed by Mao since it aligns with broader economic reforms and modernization efforts that could potentially benefit peasants indirectly through urban growth and increased trade opportunities.\n\nB. Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War. This event would not directly undermine the agricultural goals described by Mao, as it pertains more to geopolitical dynamics rather than internal economic policies.\n\nC. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry. This scenario directly contradicts Mao's vision, as it suggests that instead of improving the peasants' conditions, agricultural collectivization and industrial focus led to negative outcomes. This would undermine the hopes for a better life for peasants and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, as it results in famine and poverty.\n\nD. Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaoping were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution. While this could impact policy-making and governance, it does not directly address the agricultural transformation or peasant welfare that Mao was advocating for.\n\nTherefore, the option that most undermines the hopes expressed by Mao is **C. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry**."
