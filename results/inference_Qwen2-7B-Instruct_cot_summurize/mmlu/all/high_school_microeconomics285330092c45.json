Neither party has an incentive to deviate from their strategy.\n\nIn game theory, a Nash equilibrium occurs when each player in a game is playing a strategy that maximizes their own benefit given the strategies of the other players. At this point, no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy because doing so would not lead to a better outcome for them.\n\nLet's clarify why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. The intersection of the supply and demand curves represents the market equilibrium, but it does not necessarily indicate a Nash equilibrium. In a Nash equilibrium, it's about strategic interactions between players, not just market forces.\n\nC. The marginal revenue (cost curve intersection refers to the profit-maximizing output level for a single firm, not the strategic interaction between multiple parties as seen in a Nash equilibrium.\n\nD. This statement contradicts the definition of a Nash equilibrium. At a Nash equilibrium, there is no incentive for any player to switch strategies, hence stability is a defining characteristic."
