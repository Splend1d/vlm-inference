They raised livestock at the site, including cattle, sheep, and goats.\n\nThis suggests that the builders of Stonehenge engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, which was an important part of their society. The presence of these domesticated animals indicates a settled lifestyle, as opposed to a nomadic one. However, without further evidence, it's not possible to definitively conclude that they also brought animals to the site from outside of the region ( (option B), hunted specific animals like antelope, gazelle, or bear ( (option D), or that they had no domesticated animals and relied solely on hunting wild animals for meat ( (option C). The analysis of animal teeth typically provides information about what animals were consumed or raised, but not always the full context of how those animals were obtained or the extent of local versus imported resources."
