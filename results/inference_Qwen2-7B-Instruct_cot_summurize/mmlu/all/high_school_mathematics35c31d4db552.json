                    "text": "To determine which statement must be false when \\(f\\) is a linear function with a nonzero slope and \\(c < d\\), let's consider the properties of linear functions.\n\nGiven that \\(f\\) is a linear function with a nonzero slope, it means that \\(f(x)\\) can be represented as:\n\n\\[f(x) = mx + b\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the y-intercept. Since \\(m \\neq 0\\), this implies that the graph of \\(f(x)\\) is a straight line that is either increasing or decreasing depending on the sign of \\(m\\).\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\nA. \\(f(c) = f(d)\\)\n\nThis could be true if \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are happen to be at the same \\(y\\)-value on the graph of \\(f\\). However, it does not have to be true for all cases of \\(c < d\\) and \\(f\\) being a linear function with a nonzero slope.\n\nB. \\(f(c) \\neq f(d)\\)\n\nThis is always true because for any two different values \\(c\\) and \\(d\\), where \\(c < d\\), the output of \\(f\\) will also differ due to the nature of a linear function with a nonzero slope. The value of \\(f(x)\\) increases or decreases as \\(x\\) increases, ensuring that \\(f(c) \\neq f(d)\\).\n\nC. \\(f(c) > f(d)\\)\n\nThis statement could be true if the slope \\(m\\) is negative (\\(m < 0\\)). In this case, as \\(x\\) increases (\\(d > c\\)), the value of \\(f(x)\\) would actually decrease, making \\(f(c) > f(d)\\) possible under these conditions.\n\nD. \\(f(c) < f(d)\\)\n\nThis statement could also be true if the slope \\(m\\) is positive (\\(m > 0\\)). Here, as \\(x\\) increases (\\(d > c\\)), the value of \\(f(x)\\) would increase, making \\(f(c) < f(d)\\) possible under these conditions.\n\nGiven the options, the statement that must be false in all scenarios described is:\n\nA. \\(f(c) = f(d)\\)\n\nThis is because, by definition, for a linear function with a nonzero slope, there cannot exist two different \\(x\\) values \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) where \\(c < d\\) such that \\(f(c) = f(d)\\). The function will always produce different outputs for different inputs unless those inputs yield the same \\(y\\)-value, which is not guaranteed by the conditions given.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A.**"
