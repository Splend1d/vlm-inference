However, among the options provided, it is the correct answer as herpes viruses do not cause infantile paralysis. \n\nB. Encephalitis - Herpes viruses can cause encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain.\n\nC. Sexually transmitted disease - Many herpes viruses, including HSV-1 and HSV-2, are sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nD. Cancer - Some studies have suggested a link between certain types of herpes viruses and the development of cancer, though the evidence is not conclusive. For example, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) has been associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer in some populations."
