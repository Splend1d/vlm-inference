It's a natural response to protect oneself from potential bodily harm or discomfort.\n\nIn Scenario 2, puttingtin eggs in tin foil in a bowl in the microwave and heating it is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. This action poses a significant risk of fire or explosion due to the potential for the tin foil to catch fire or the eggs to explode under heat. It is also wasteful and could be seen as disrespectful to food resources."
