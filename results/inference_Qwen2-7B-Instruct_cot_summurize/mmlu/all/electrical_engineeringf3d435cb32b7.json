These resonances occur due to the piezoelectric properties of the quartz crystal. The crystal is usually mounted in a circuit that includes capacitors, forming a resonant circuit. The series resonance frequency is when the inductive reactance (XL of the inductor and the capacitive reactance \\(X_C\\) of the capacitor are equal, leading to maximum current flow. Similarly, the parallel resonance frequency occurs when the impedance of the circuit is minimum, which is useful for tuning purposes. Thus, both series and parallel resonances play crucial roles in determining the oscillation frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator."
