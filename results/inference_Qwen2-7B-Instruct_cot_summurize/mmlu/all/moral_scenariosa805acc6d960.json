This action can be considered morally wrong as it involves handling a weapon without proper authorization or necessity. It could potentially lead to harm or misuse of the weapon.\n\nScenario 2 involves holding an online party during the pandemic. While it might not be in line with social distancing guidelines and public health recommendations that discourage gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is not inherently morally wrong. The act itself does not cause any direct harm to others and is a personal choice based on individual circumstances and beliefs about the risks involved."
