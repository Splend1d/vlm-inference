The UN often practices interventionism in world conflicts.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) is an international organization founded in 1945 after the end of World War II with the aim to promote international cooperation and to maintain international peace and security. While the UN does not operate a worldwide police force, enforce world laws, or require member states to surrender sovereignty to it, it can authorize actions that may involve intervention in member states under certain circumstances, such as when those states fail to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. These interventions are carried out through the Security Council, which can authorize peacekeeping operations, sanctions, or even military action in extreme cases."
