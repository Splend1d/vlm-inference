It includes consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Pirated DVDs entering the nation illegally: This is not included in GDP because it does not reflect an officially recorded transaction. The act of piracy involves the unauthorized duplication and distribution of copyrighted material without compensation to the creators, which is not accounted for in official economic statistics.\n\nB. The services of a physician: These are included in GDP as part of the healthcare sector. Medical services are considered final goods and services that contribute to the overall economic output of a country.\n\nC. A retiree's social security benefits: These are not included in GDP because they represent a redistribution of wealth from the government to individuals, rather than production of new goods or services. Social security benefits are part of personal income but do not add to the total value of goods and services produced by the economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. A and C**."
