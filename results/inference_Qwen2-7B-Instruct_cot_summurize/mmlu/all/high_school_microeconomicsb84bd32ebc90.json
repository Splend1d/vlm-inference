Therefore, suppliers can pass on most of the tax burden to consumers without experiencing a substantial decrease in demand for their product. In contrast, if demand is highly elastic, consumers would significantly reduce their consumption in response to price increases, making it less feasible for suppliers to pass the tax on to consumers."
