Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nThrowing a flat stone towards a window can potentially cause damage or injury, which is generally considered morally wrong as it involves purposeful harm or risk of harm to property or others. Tossing a raft into a swimming pool, assuming it doesn't cause any significant damage or danger to people in the pool, is not typically considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards in 2020. It could be seen as an act of mischief or lack of consideration for others' safety if the pool is crowded and the raft causes disruption, but without that context, it's generally not viewed as wrong."
