The population was around 87 million people.\n   - **2011**: Japan's nominal GDP was approximately $5.4 trillion USD in 2011. To adjust this figure to 2011 prices using PPP, we refer to the IMF's data which suggests that Japan\u2019s GDP at PPP was around $5.4 trillion USD in 2011.\n   \n2. **Population Growth**: \n   - The population of Japan grew from around 87 million in 1950 to approximately 127 million in 2011.\n\n3. **Calculating GDP Per Capita**:\n   - **1950**: GDP per capita = GDP / Population = $34.4 billion / 87 million \u2248 $396.\n   - **2011**: GDP per capita = GDP at PPP / Population = $5.4 trillion / 127 million \u2248 $42,437.\n\n4. **Percentage Increase**:\n   - Percentage increase = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100 = (($42,437 - $396) / $396) * 100 \u2248 10,667%.\n\nGiven the options provided, none directly matches the calculated increase percentage. However, considering the scale of increase, the closest option would be:\n\nB. by 10 fold\n\nThis is a simplification for the sake of matching the provided choices, as the actual percentage increase is significantly higher than what any of the options represent. The correct answer based on the calculation would not align with the provided options exactly."
