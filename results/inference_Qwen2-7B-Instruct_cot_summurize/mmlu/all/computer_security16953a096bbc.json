True, True\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1: A U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) USB dongle enhances security by providing an additional layer of authentication that is not tied to the user's device. When used in conjunction with a password or other form of authentication, it makes it much harder for malware to steal credentials, even if the device is turned off. The dongle requires physical access and a correct PIN or biometric input to authenticate, which helps prevent remote attacks or malware from impersonating the user.\n\nStatement 2: When a server uses U2F, it can reliably verify that the user attempting to log in is the rightful owner of the U2F key. This is because each U2F key has a unique identifier that is registered with the server. When a login attempt is made, the server checks the U2F response to confirm that the key matches the one on file and that the user has physically presented their key (and possibly entered a PIN). This provides a reliable way to ensure that the person logging in is the intended user, assuming the key has been properly secured and not lost or stolen."
