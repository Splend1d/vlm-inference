Changing the units of measurement (from seconds to minutes in this case, does not affect the relative standing of a particular data point within the distribution. This means that the standardized score (z-score) remains the same regardless of whether the data is measured in seconds, minutes, or any other unit.\n\nTherefore, if one student's time had a standardized score of \\(z = 2.40\\) when measured in seconds, it will still have a standardized score of \\(z = 2.40\\) when the times are are changed to minutes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. z = 2.40"
