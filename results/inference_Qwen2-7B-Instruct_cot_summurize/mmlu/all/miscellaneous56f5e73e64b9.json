The correct answer isn't listed because it's not possible for an average United States citizen to have spent \"as president\" in any of the provided options ( (seconds, seconds, minutes, minutes). \n\nHowever, if we interpret the question more generally, the average number of years a person serves as President of the United States can vary widely depending on how you define \"average.\" The shortest presidency was that of William Henry Harrison, who served for only 32 days in 1841 before he died of pneumonia. The longest was that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who served for a total of 12 years across four terms. \n\nIf you're looking for an average term length, the average U.S. president serves for about 8.7 years based on the total duration of all presidencies divided by the number of presidents ( (since there have been 46 presidencies, excluding the current one, from George Washington to Joe Biden).\n\nNone of these details are represented in your provided options, so the question might need clarification or correction."
