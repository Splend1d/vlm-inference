A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\nC.

A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\n\nThis is because, in a partially executed contract, it implies that some performance has occurred from both parties, not just one. The term \"partially executed\" typically refers to a situation where one or more obligations under the contract have been fulfilled, but not all. \n\nLet's clarify the other options for completeness:\n\nA. A wholly executory contract is indeed correct. This describes a situation where neither party has yet performed any of their contractual obligations.\n\nC. An executed contract is also accurate. It signifies that both parties have fulfilled all their contractual duties, leaving no further obligations.\n\nD. A partially executed contract correctly states that at least one party has started performing their part of the agreement, but not necessarily completed it, and the other party might still have obligations pending.\n\nTherefore, option B is the least correct due to the incorrect implication that only one party has completed performance."
