Arrangements regarding fees and billing. \n\nAn auditor typically includes details about fees, billing arrangements, and other terms of engagement in the engagement letter to ensure clear communication and understanding between the auditor and the client. However, it's important to note that specific audit procedures, indications of negative cash flows, or identification of working capital deficiencies are not typically detailed in the engagement letter but rather addressed during the audit process itself. The engagement letter serves as a formal agreement outlining the scope of the audit, responsibilities of both parties, and the basis for the fee."
