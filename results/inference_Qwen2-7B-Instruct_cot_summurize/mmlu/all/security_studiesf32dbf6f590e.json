Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective.\nB. Security is best defined using the traditional paradigm, with the state as the referent object to be secured using extraordinary measures where possible.\nC. To best understand security one must adopt a constructivist approach, threats exist only when articulated by a wider audience and may warrant the implementation of emergency measures.\nD. Security exists as an empirically verifiable and independent condition that changes only slightly, if at all, with regards to the social context in which it is applied.\n"

Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective.\n\nThe Copenhagen School, a group of political scientists associated with the University of Copenhagen, emphasizes that security is not an objective, universally applicable condition but rather a concept that is shaped by social interactions and the specific cultural, political, and historical contexts within which it is embedded. This perspective challenges traditional views of security that often focus on military defense or state sovereignty, and instead highlights how security is negotiated and contested within societies."
