The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the International Association of Diabetes Epidemiology (IADNE) have established criteria for diagnosing diabetes. These include:\n\n- Fasting Plasma Glucose: A fasting plasma glucose level \u2265 126 mg/dL on two separate occasions.\n- Random Plasma Glucose: A plasma glucose level > 200 mg/dL at any time, with symptoms of diabetes or with a known history of diabetes.\n- 2-Hour Postprandial Glucose After Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: A 2-hour plasma glucose level \u2265 200 mg/dL.\n\nTherefore, out of the options given, option D \"fasting blood glucose \u2265 126 mg/dl\" is the confirmed value that meets the diagnostic threshold for diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association's guidelines."
