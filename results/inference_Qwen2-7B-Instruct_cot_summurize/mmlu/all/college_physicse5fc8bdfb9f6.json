                    "text": "The correct answer is C. 0.36c.\n\nTo understand why, let's consider the principles of special relativity. The speed of light in vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion relative to the light source. When two light sources are separated by a distance, and an observer is located midway between them, the time difference between observing the lights from each source depends on the relative velocity of the observer with respect to the light sources.\n\nIn this case, we have an observer (O who sees both lights flash simultaneously. However, according to another observer O' moving parallel to the x-axis, there is a 13 ns delay between the observation of one light flash compared to the other. This delay is due to the time dilation effect predicted by special relativity, which states that time appears to move slower for an object moving relative to an observer.\n\nThe time difference observed by O' can be related to the relative velocity \\(v\\) between O and O' through the Lorentz factor \\(\\gamma\\), defined as:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(c\\) is the speed of light. The time dilation formula is given by:\n\\[\n\\Delta t' = \\gamma \\Delta t\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta t'\\) is the time interval measured by O' and \\(\\Delta t\\) is the time interval measured by O. In this scenario, the time difference \\(\\Delta t\\) is 13 ns, and since O measures the events to occur simultaneously (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\)), the time difference observed by O' corresponds to the time it takes for light to travel the extra distance due to its relative motion.\n\nGiven that the distance between the sources is 10 meters, and the time delay is 13 ns, we can find the relative velocity using the relationship between distance, velocity, and time:\n\\[\nv = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{10 \\text{ m}}{13 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}}\n\\]\nConverting the units to match the speed of light (\\(c = 3 \\times 10^8\\) m/s) and calculating \\(v\\):\n\\[\nv = \\frac{10}{13 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{10}{1.3 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 7.69 \\times 10^7 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\nThis velocity needs to be converted into a fraction of the speed of light:\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{7.69 \\times 10^7}{3 \\times 10^8} \\approx 0.256\n\\]\nThus, the speed of O' relative to O is approximately \\(0.256c\\), which is closest to option C. 0.36c when considering the options provided."
