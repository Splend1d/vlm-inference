The bartender served the drink, even though the accountant looked and acted as though he was already very intoxicated. The accountant soon had consumed five more cocktails, which the bartender served, despite the accountant's obviously and unmistakably drunken condition. After finishing his sixth drink in the bar, the accountant said good night to the bartender, staggered out of the bar, got into his car, and drove away. After weaving back and forth across the road for several blocks, the accountant crashed his car into a pedestrian who was walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The pedestrian suffered serious injuries to his back and legs. The bartender's act of serving drinks to the accountant would most likely be viewed as the\n\nA. proximate cause of the pedestrian's injuries.\nB. superseding cause of the pedestrian's injuries.\nC. direct cause of the pedestrian's injuries.\nD. intervening cause of the pedestrian's injuries.\n"

Proximate cause refers to the legal concept that establishes a direct link between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's harm. Here, the bartender continued to serve alcohol to the visibly intoxicated accountant, contributing to his impaired state. This impairment then led to the accountant's decision to drive under the influence, resulting in the accident that injured the pedestrian. Thus, the bartender's actions were a significant factor in causing the pedestrian's injuries, making them the proximate cause in this context."
