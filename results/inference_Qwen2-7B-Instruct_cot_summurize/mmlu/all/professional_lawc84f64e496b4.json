The statute appropriates the necessary funds but provides that the funds may not be expended until both houses of Congress have adopted a concurrent resolution, not subject to presentment to the President, approving the agency's plans for the monument's location and design. Is the provision requiring further congressional approval before expenditure of the funds constitutional?\n\nA. No, because decisions regarding the placement and design of government-owned structures are an exclusively executive function with which Congress may not interfere by any means.\nB. No, because the provision amounts to an unconstitutional legislative interference with an executive function.\nC. Yes, because Congress may attach reasonable conditions to its appropriation of funds to executive departments, and its special interest in the members of its own police force makes the provision a reasonable condition.\nD. Yes, because the provision is part of a statute that was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President.\n"

Yes, because Congress may attach reasonable conditions to its appropriation of funds to executive departments, and its special interest in the members of its own police force makes the provision a reasonable condition.\n\nThe Constitution grants Congress the power \"To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than one Year\" ( and \"To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States\". These powers allow Congress to attach conditions to the appropriation of funds, including requirements for the expenditure of funds, such as the need for additional congressional approval before funds can be spent. In this case, Congress has an interest in ensuring that the monument honors its own police force appropriately, and thus it has attached a reasonable condition to its appropriation of funds."
