A failure to address the importance of a wide range of actors in the decision-making processes of the international system.\n\nThis statement is not a purported limitation of the liberalist approach. On the contrary, one of the core tenets of liberalism in international relations theory is that it emphasizes the role of various actors, including states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and even private actors, in shaping international politics and policies outcomes. It posits that cooperation among these actors leads to peace and stability. Therefore, this option does not represent a critique or limitation of liberalism; rather, it aligns with its foundational principles."
