They both deal with acute risks.\n\nExplanation: While both issues management and crisis management involve dealing with risks, they do not necessarily deal with \"acute risks\" exclusively. Acute risks refer to situations that are immediate, severe, and potentially catastrophic. Issues management typically deals with more long-term, less immediate concerns that may still impact an organization's reputation or operations but are not as urgent as acute risks. Crisis management specifically focuses on responding to and resolving acute risks that threaten the organization's survival. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that both issues management and crisis management deal with acute risks equally."
