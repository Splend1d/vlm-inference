The mean life expectancy of one model is twice that of the other.\nB. The mean life expectancy of one model is 6 years, while the mean life expectancy of the other is 12 years.\nC.

We should be 90% confident that the difference in life expectancies is between 6 and 12 years.\n\nThe confidence interval of (6, 12) indicates that based on the data collected, we can be 90% confident that the true difference in the mean life expectancy between Model A and Model B refrigerators lies somewhere between 6 and 12 years. This means that Model A has a higher mean life expectancy than Model B, and this difference is statistically significant at the 90% confidence level.\n\nThe other options either make incorrect assumptions or misinterpret the confidence interval:\n- A. Does not necessarily follow from the confidence interval provided; it does not specify the relationship between the means of the two groups.\n- B. Assumes that the confidence interval directly translates to specific values for each group's mean, which is not the case. It merely states the range within which the true difference likely falls.\n- C. Confuses the confidence level with the probability of the difference being real. The confidence level (90% here does not imply a 0.90 probability that the means are different; rather, it reflects our confidence in the interval containing the true difference."
