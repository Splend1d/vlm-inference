This scenario could potentially fit under the broader category of logical fallacies but isn't accurately captured by \"Extension,\" \"a priori,\" \"Complex proposition,\" or \"Appeal to ignorance.\"\n\nA more precise term for this kind of logical fallacy might be \"fallacy of composition,\" which occurs when someone assumes that what is true for a part of something must also be true for the whole. However, since this term wasn't provided as an option, the closest answer based on your choices would likely be C, \"Extension,\" though it's not a perfect fit."
