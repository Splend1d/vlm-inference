This lack of competition allows the monopolist to set prices above marginal cost, resulting in a price that is higher than the marginal revenue ( (price > MR). \n\nIn contrast, in a perfectly competitive market, where there are numerous small firms producing identical products, firms operate at the point where price equals marginal cost ( (P=MC) and marginal revenue ( (MR), because any deviation from this would lead to either entry by new firms (if profits are high enough) or exit of existing firms (if losses are incurred).\n\nAs for the other options:\nA. Monopolies often offer fewer choices of products compared to a perfectly competitive market, where many firms offer similar but slightly differentiated products. \nB. Efficiency is not necessarily higher in a monopoly; rather, it may be lower due to lack of competition and incentive to minimize costs. \nC. Prices are generally higher in a monopoly as the monopolist can charge a premium due to its market power, whereas in perfect competition, prices are typically lower as they reflect the marginal cost of production."
