                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.\n\nIn this scenario, since the ice is frictionless, there are no external forces acting on the system of the two skaters. Therefore, according to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. This means that linear momentum is conserved.\n\nAdditionally, because the skaters stick together after the collision, the collision between them is perfectly inelastic. In a perfectly inelastic collision, kinetic energy is not conserved, but linear momentum is. So, while option C states that only kinetic energy is conserved, that statement is incorrect. The correct emphasis is on linear momentum being conserved."
