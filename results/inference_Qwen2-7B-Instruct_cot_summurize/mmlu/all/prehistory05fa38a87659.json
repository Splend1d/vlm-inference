There were a far greater number of genera than today: Fossil records indicate that during the time when apes diverged from their common ancestor with humans, there were indeed more genera of apes than there are today. This diversity reflects the evolutionary branching and extinction of different ape lineages over millions of years.\n\nB. They flourished in a broader area of the world than today's apes: The earliest apes lived in various regions around the world, including Africa, Europe, and Asia. This global distribution contrasts with the more localized range of modern apes, which are primarily found in Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nC. Some ancient species were larger than today's apes: Fossils show that some extinct ape species were significantly larger than any living ape species. For example, Gigantopithecus blacki was one of the largest known apes, estimated to have been about 1.5 meters tall at the shoulder, larger than any modern ape.\n\nTherefore, all three statements accurately describe aspects of the first apes based on current scientific understanding."
