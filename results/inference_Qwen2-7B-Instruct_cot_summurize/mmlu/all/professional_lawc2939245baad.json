Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of this land, the county leased most of it to a company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate luxury hotel \u0080\u0094complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina \u0080\u0094and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up management and operations bylaws for its new hotel, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The hotel announced that the least expensive room was $1,000 per night. Much of the population in the county cannot afford to stay at the new hotel. One resident who cannot afford to pay the hotel fees brings an action against the company, claiming that the high fees operate to discriminate against the poor, in violation of the constitutional right to equal protection. What is the most likely result of this action?\n\nA. The company will lose because social class constitutes a suspect classification under the equal protection clause.\nB. The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.\nC. The resident will win because all public rights cannot be limited to those who can afford them.\nD. The resident will win because discrimination against poor people violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

In this case, the county leased the land to the company, and the company operates the hotel under the terms of the lease. Therefore, the hotel's pricing policies would typically be considered a matter between the company and its customers, rather than a direct state action subject to equal protection scrutiny.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has generally held that economic discrimination based on the ability to pay is not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Discrimination based on wealth is not considered a suspect classification, and thus, it would not trigger heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. The Court would likely consider whether the pricing policy of the hotel is related to the cost of providing the services, the value of the location, and whether it serves a legitimate business purpose, such as ensuring profitability and maintaining the quality of the facility.\n\nGiven that the hotel's pricing is set at $1,000 per night for the least expensive room, it appears to be targeting a luxury market. If the hotel's operation and pricing are are consistent with fair market practices and do not involve discriminatory practices (\u2014such as charging different prices based on race, gender, religion, or national origin\u2014the company is likely to prevail in the argument that the pricing policy does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that legal outcomes can vary based on specific factual details, precedent, and interpretations of law, and this answer provides a general perspective based on common legal principles."
