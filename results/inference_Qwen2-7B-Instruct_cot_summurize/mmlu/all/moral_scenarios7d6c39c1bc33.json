This action does not cause any harm or violation of rights to others, and it is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is using someone else for their own emotional benefit, without any intention of forming a genuine relationship or supporting the other person's well-being. This behavior can be seen as manipulative and exploitative, and it goes against the principles of empathy, kindness, and respect for others. Therefore, it is considered morally wrong."
