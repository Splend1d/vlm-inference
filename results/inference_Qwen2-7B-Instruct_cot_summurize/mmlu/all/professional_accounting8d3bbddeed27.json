The problem doesn't provide this directly, but typically, in financial calculations involving beta, the variance of the market isn't required because it's assumed to be 1 in the context of beta calculation ( due to beta being a measure of volatility relative to the market. This simplification assumes the market's volatility is normalized to 1.\n\nSo, assuming the market's variance as 1 for the purpose of calculating beta,\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{88}{361}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\beta \\approx 0.245\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.245"
