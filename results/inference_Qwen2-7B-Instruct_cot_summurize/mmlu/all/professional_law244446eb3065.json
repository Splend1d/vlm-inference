The pedestrian must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the painting company was negligent.\n\nIn a negligence case, the plaintiff (in this case, the pedestrian) has the burden of proving that the defendant (the painting company) breached a duty of care, which caused harm or injury to the plaintiff. This is typically done by showing that the defendant's actions were more likely than not the cause of the injury (the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard). \n\nThe doctrine of res ipsa loquitur ( (which means \"the thing speaks for itself\") can sometimes apply in negligence cases where certain circumstances indicate that the defendant is likely responsible for the accident, but it does not shift the burden of proof to the defendant to prove they were not negligent. Instead, it allows the jury to infer negligence from the mere occurrence of the accident under certain conditions, such as when the accident is not easily explainable by the plaintiff's own actions. However, this doctrine would only apply if it could be shown that the accident was not the result of the plaintiff's own actions or any obvious intervening cause that could be clearly attributed to someone other than the defendant.\n\nTherefore, option B accurately reflects the burden of proof in this scenario."
