The charge enclosed by this surface is:\n\\[ Q_{\\text{enc}} = \\int_{0}^{r} 4\\pi s^2 \\rho(s) ds \\]\nGiven \\(\\rho(s) = as\\), we have:\n\\[ Q_{\\text{enc}} = \\int_{0}^{r} 4\\pi s^3 as ds = 4\\pi a \\int_{0}^{r} s^4 ds = 4\\pi a \\left[\\frac{s^5}{5}\\right]_0^r = \\frac{4\\pi a r^5}{5} \\]\n\nApplying Gauss's law:\n\\[ \\Phi_E = \\frac{Q_{\\text{enc}}}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{\\frac{4\\pi a r^5}{5}}{\\varepsilon_0} \\]\n\nThe electric field \\(E\\) is the flux per unit area, so:\n\\[ E = \\frac{\\Phi_E}{4\\pi r^2} = \\frac{\\frac{4\\pi a r^5}{5}}{\\varepsilon_0 4\\pi r^2} = \\frac{ar^3}{5\\varepsilon_0} \\]\n\nThis shows that the electric field \\(E\\) increases with the cube of the radius \\(r\\), not linearly or in any simple manner suggested by the options provided. Therefore, none of the given options A through D accurately describe the behavior of the electric field based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, if one were to interpret the question's intent to match the closest possible option considering the mathematical description derived, option C (\"It increases linearly for r > R.\") would not accurately reflect the cubic relationship between the electric field and the radius derived above. \n\nThe correct interpretation based on the mathematical derivation is that the electric field increases as \\(r^3\\), which is neither linear nor nonlinear in the conventional sense described in the options, but rather a polynomial increase with the third power of the radius. None of the provided options A-D accurately describe the cubic relationship derived here."
