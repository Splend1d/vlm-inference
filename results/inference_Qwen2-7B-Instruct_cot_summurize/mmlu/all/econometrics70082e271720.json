Cointegration implies that although the individual series may be non-stationary, some linear combination of them is stationary, suggesting a long-run equilibrium relationship.\n\nWhen applying the Engle-Granger test to the residuals of a potentially cointegrating regression, the null hypothesis being tested is:\n\nA. The variables are cointegrated\n\nThe alternative hypothesis is that there is no cointegration (the variables are not cointegrated). If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, it suggests that the variables share a common stochastic trend and are thus cointegrated. This means that any deviations from the long-run equilibrium relationship will eventually be corrected over time."
