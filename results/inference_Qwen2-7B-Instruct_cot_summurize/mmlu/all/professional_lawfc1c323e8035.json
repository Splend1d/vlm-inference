This rule generally prohibits the introduction of evidence of a person's past crimes or bad acts to prove that they acted in a certain way on a particular occasion. The rationale behind this rule is that such evidence can unfairly prejudice the jury against the defendant and lead to a conviction based on the defendant's character rather than the specific act for which they are being on trial.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions to this rule. For instance, if the prosecution can show that the defendant's past crimes were part of a \"common plan or scheme,\" it may be admissible to prove the defendant's intent or motive. However, this requires clear and convincing evidence that the past crimes are closely connected to the current charges.\n\nIn this case, without further information about the nature of the previous incidents and how they relate to the current charge, the general rule would likely apply, making the evidence of past crimes inadmissible. Therefore, the judge should find the evidence inadmissible under the rule against propensity evidence."
