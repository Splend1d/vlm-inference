It is particularly useful when the distributional properties of the actual data are unknown (iii), or when the sample size is very small (iv), because it makes assumptions about the data's distribution more flexible and relies on the empirical distribution of the observed data.\n\nPure simulation, on the other hand, typically requires explicit knowledge of the underlying probability distributions to generate synthetic data.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- Situation (ii) suggests exact known distributional properties, which is not a situation where bootstrapping would be preferred over pure simulation. Instead, if the distribution is known, pure simulation might be preferred for its precision.\n- Situation (i) aligns well with bootstrapping's purpose of replicating the characteristics of the actual data.\n- Situation iii) is another scenario where bootstrapping shines, given that the true distribution is unknown.\n- Situation iv) also supports the use of bootstrapping, especially when the sample size is small and the empirical distribution provides a reliable basis for inference.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
