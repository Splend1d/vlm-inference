The Bill of Rights was proposed in response to the Anti-Federalists, who argued that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and could lead to tyranny. By including provisions for freedom of speech, religion, assembly, and the press, as well as protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Bill of Rights sought to limit the power of the federal government and ensure individual rights. This was a direct response to the fears of the states that the new central government might become too powerful."
