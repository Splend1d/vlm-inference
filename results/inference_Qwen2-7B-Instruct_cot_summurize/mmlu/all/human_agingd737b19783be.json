Secondary control.\n\nResearch has shown that individuals who engage in high levels of self-care behaviors tend to have higher levels of secondary control. Secondary control refers to the ability to cope with stress and adversity through cognitive strategies, such as problem-solving, planning, and seeking social support, rather than through external control mechanisms like blaming others or attributing events to fate.\n\nSelf-care behaviors, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, adequate sleep, and stress management, help individuals maintain their physical and mental health, which can contribute to better emotional regulation and coping skills. This, in turn, can enhance one's ability to exert secondary control over life's challenges.\n\nIt's important to note that while self-care and secondary control are positively correlated, they are not the same thing. Self-care is an active practice focused on maintaining well-being, while secondary control is a more general psychological capability related to how one copes with stress and uncertainty."
