If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nThe long-term effects of Otto von Bismarck's speech include which of the following?\n\nA.

Development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe\n\nOtto von Bismarck's speech in 1884 laid the groundwork for significant social reforms in Germany and influenced the development of socialized programs across Europe. He introduced the first modern welfare state with measures such as workers' compensation, old age pensions, and health insurance, which aimed to address the insecurities and vulnerabilities faced by workers. These initiatives contributed to the establishment of social security systems that would later be emulated and expanded upon in other European countries. Thus, the long-term effects of Bismarck's speech include the development of socialized programs that became foundational to many welfare states in Europe."
