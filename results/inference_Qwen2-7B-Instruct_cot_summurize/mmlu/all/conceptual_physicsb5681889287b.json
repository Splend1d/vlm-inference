The weight of this displaced fluid is equal to the weight of the object due to the principle of buoyancy, as described by Archimedes' principle. This principle states that any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object (option A). The density of the displaced fluid also plays a role since it affects the buoyant force and can influence whether the object floats or sinks. Therefore, all three options are correct in different aspects related to the displacement of a submerged object."
