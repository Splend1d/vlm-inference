Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in accounting estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred, the change should be considered a change in estimate.\n\nExplanation:\n- A. Most changes in accounting estimates are accounted for retrospectively: This statement is not accurate because changes in accounting estimates can be accounted for prospectively under certain conditions, especially when the change results from the adoption of a new accounting standard that requires immediate recognition of the effect on the financial statements.\n- B. Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in an estimate or a change in principle occurred, the change should be considered a change in principle: This statement is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes that all undetermined changes should be treated as changes in principle. The determination depends on the nature of the change and its impact on the financial statements.\n- C. Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in accounting estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred, the change should be considered a change in estimate: This statement is correct. Generally, if the distinction between an accounting estimate and a change in accounting principle cannot be made with certainty, the change should be treated as an estimate change.\n- D. It is easier to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a change in accounting principle than it is to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a correction of an error: This statement is incorrect because differentiating between a change in accounting estimate and a change in accounting principle can be challenging due to their being overlapping characteristics. Differentiating between a change in accounting estimate and a correction of an error is often more straightforward since errors typically involve misapplication of existing principles rather than a genuine change in assumptions."
