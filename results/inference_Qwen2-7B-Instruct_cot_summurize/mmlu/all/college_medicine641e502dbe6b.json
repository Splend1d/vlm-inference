Enzymatic\n\nEnzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They can often be proteins or RNA molecules and can play roles in regulating gene expression by influencing the synthesis of nucleic acids. The fact that this hormone increases the amount of nucleic acid in the cell suggests it might have regulatory functions at the molecular level, consistent with enzymatic activity.\n\nSteroids ( (Option B) are are a class of lipids derived from four interconnected carbon rings, but they typically do not function inside cells in the way described.\n\nPeptides ( (Option C) and Amino acids ( (Option D) are could potentially be involved in similar cellular processes, but based on the description provided, the enzyme characteristic points more towards an Enzymatic hormone. \n\nPlease note that the classification of hormones can sometimes overlap, and additional information about the specific properties and actions of this hormone would be necessary for a definitive identification."
