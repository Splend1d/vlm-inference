Although no teacher or school official either encouraged or discouraged the practice, all but two teachers, when present, joined in the invocation. A student and his parents protested to the school superintendent, but they refused to intervene on the grounds that the matter was entirely up to the students. Moreover, school board officials pointed out that the students who led the recital always sat at a table in the rear of the cafeteria and that no one was required to participate in the blessing. In an action by the student's parents to enjoin the daily luncheon invocation at the high school, the court will most likely\n\nA. grant relief, since the invocation violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\nB. grant relief, since the primary effect of the invocation is to advance religious beliefs.\nC. deny relief, since the lunch hour is not part of the educational process.\nD. deny relief, since the noncompulsory nature of the invocation would not be violative of the establishment clause.\n"

Invocations at a public high school lunch are typically considered part of the non-educational activities that take place during lunch periods, which are are not subject to the same restrictions as classroom activities. The Supreme Court has generally held that non-compulsory prayer activities, such as student-led invocations, do not violate the Establishment Clause because they are not state-sponsored or coercive.\n\nIn this case, the fact that only two teachers did not participate, and all participants were volunteers, suggests that the practice is non-coercive. Additionally, since students are not required to participate and the invocations occur during lunchtime, which is outside the traditional bounds of the educational day, the court might rule that the invocations do not violate the Establishment Clause."
