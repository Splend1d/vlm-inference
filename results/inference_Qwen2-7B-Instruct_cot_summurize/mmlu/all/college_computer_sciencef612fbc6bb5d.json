Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority\n\nThis approach does not prevent deadlock. While it might help in resolving the situation where higher-priority processes are waiting for lower-priority ones, it does not address the core issues of deadlock such as circular wait, mutual exclusion, hold and wait, and no preemption. Prioritization does not ensure that the conditions for deadlock are not met, especially in scenarios where multiple processes each hold a resource and are waiting for another resource held by a different process.\n\nThe other options either prevent deadlock altogether (by ensuring resources are not requested all at once (option B), enforce a specific order in resource requests (option C), or introduce a mechanism for processes to attempt to resolve the deadlock by restarting after a timeout (option D)."
