                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy (\\(\\Delta U\\)) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (\\(Q\\)) minus the work done by the system (\\(W\\)). In an isobaric process, \\(P = \\text{constant}\\), and the work done can be expressed as \\(W = P\\Delta V\\). However, without knowing if heat was added or removed during the process (and thus the sign of \\(Q\\)), we cannot conclude that \\(\\Delta U\\) is simply equal to the work done during the isobaric step.\n\nB. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step minus the work done during the isothermal step.\n\nThis statement is also not necessarily true for the same reason as above. Without information on the heat transfer during each process, we cannot equate the change in internal energy to the work done during just one process minus another.\n\nC. The total work done during the cycle is positive.\n\nThis statement could be true or false depending on the specific conditions of each step. If the net work done during the isobaric step (plus the work done during the isothermal step (equals the work done during the isochoric step, then the total work would indeed be positive. However, this depends on the specifics of the process and cannot be generally assumed.\n\nD. The total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.\n\nThis statement is true based on the first law of thermodynamics, which states that \\(\\Delta U = Q - W\\). In a cyclic process, the change in internal energy over the entire cycle is zero because the system returns to its initial state. Therefore, the total heat transferred into the system over the cycle must equal the total work done by the system over the cycle. Since the system returns to its initial state, the total work done by the system over the cycle is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the total heat transferred into the system over the cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D**."
