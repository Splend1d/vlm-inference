However, the GDP Deflator measures the inflation rate based on all goods and services produced within a country's borders. Since forklifts are imported, they wouldn't be included in this calculation unless they significantly influence the overall production costs within the U.S., which is unlikely. Therefore, the GDP Deflator would likely remain unaffected by this specific import price change."
