                    "text": "The foreign currency gain that a company recognizes in its income statement typically refers to the gain or loss resulting from translating the financial statements of a foreign subsidiary into the reporting currency of the parent company. This gain or loss comes from two sources: remeasurement and translation.\n\nRemeasurement occurs when the transactions denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency are are translated into the parent company's reporting currency. Any differences due to changes in exchange rates between the functional currency and the reporting currency are recorded as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss.\n\nTranslation, on the other hand, happens when the entire financial position (assets, liabilities, etc.) of the foreign subsidiary is converted into the parent's reporting currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. This can result in a gain or loss if there is a significant difference between the historical cost of the assets and liabilities in their original currency and their value when converted into the reporting currency.\n\nIn this scenario, Mentor Co. recognized a $25,000 gain from remeasurement and a $40,000 gain from translation. Both gains are foreign currency gains because they result from converting the Swiss corporation's financial statements into the U.S. dollar.\n\nSince both are considered foreign currency gains, the total foreign currency gain that Mentor Co. should recognize in its income statement is the sum of these two amounts:\n\n$25,000 ( (remeasurement gain) + $40,000 ( (translation gain) = $65,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $65,000."
