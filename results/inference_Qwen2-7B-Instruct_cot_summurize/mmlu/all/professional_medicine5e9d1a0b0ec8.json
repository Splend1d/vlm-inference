The symptoms described such as fever, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, strawberry tongue, erythematous truncal rash, and edema of the hands and feet are all characteristic of Scarlet Fever.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of Scarlet Fever would be intravenous immune globulin ( (IVIG). IVIG can help neutralize circulating toxins produced by the bacteria and prevent the development of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis in severe cases.\n\nOptions B ( Intravenous penicillin, C Intravenous prednisone, and D Oral isoniazid are might not be the best choice as:\n\n- Penicillin is typically used to treat bacterial infections but might not be effective against group A Streptococcus if the patient has developed a complication such as a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.\n- Prednisone is an immunosuppressant that could worsen the infection or delay healing.\n- Isoniazid is an antitubercular drug and is not typically used for treating Scarlet Fever.\n\nHowever, always consult a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."
