In such systems, the equations are ordered in a way that allows each equation to use the variables from the previous equations as exogenous. Therefore, you cannot estimate the parameters using separate applications of OLS to each equation without violating the assumption of exogeneity.\n\nii) This statement is true. In a triangular system, the independent variables in one equation can indeed be correlated with the error terms in other equations because the system's structure does not enforce orthogonality between the error terms of different equations.\n\niii) This statement is not necessarily true. While 2SLS (two-stage least squares) can provide consistent (but not necessarily unbiased) parameter estimates in systems where there is endogeneity (i.e., correlation between the independent variables and the error terms, this is not specific to triangular or recursive systems but applies generally in systems with endogenous regressors.\n\niv) This statement is true. In a recursive system, the independent variables within an equation are indeed potentially correlated with the error terms in the same equation due to the presence of unobserved factors or omitted variable bias that might influence both the dependent variable and the independent variables in the same equation."
