All Native Americans, both ancient and modern, are derived from a single migration of Austral-Melanesians into the Americas by about 13,000 years ago.\nC.

Native Americans in North America and South America genetically diverge from each other and their ancestors in the far north by about 30,000 years ago**.\n\nThis conclusion comes from genetic studies that have been conducted to understand the ancestry and migration patterns of Native American populations. These studies suggest that there were at least two distinct migrations into the Americas, one into North America and another into South America, with each region showing genetic diversity that reflects their own unique histories. The divergence noted around 30,000 years ago indicates that these migrations and the subsequent population growth and spread led to significant genetic differentiation between populations in North and South America."
