A monopsonist is characterized by a single buyer of labor services, meaning there is only one employer in the market for a particular type of labor. This structure gives the monopsonist significant power to influence wages and employment levels.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. While it's true that a monopsonist may pay a wage lower than the marginal revenue product of labor (because they have market power and can suppress wages, this option does not define a monopsony. It describes the wage-setting behavior rather than the nature of a monopsony itself.\n\nB. An employment level greater than that of a competitive labor market is not typical for a monopsony. Monopsonists often face shortages of labor because they can set wages below the equilibrium level, which attracts fewer workers compared to a competitive market.\n\nC. A wage payment higher than that of a competitive labor market is not characteristic of a monopsony either. Monopsonists tend to pay lower wages due to their market power, not higher ones."
