                    "text": "The thermic effect of food, also known as the food-induced thermogenesis, refers to the energy expenditure associated with the digestion, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients. Here's a brief overview of each option:\n\nA. The thermic effect of food is not substantially higher for carbohydrates than for proteins. In fact, the thermic effect of food is generally higher for proteins than for carbohydrates. This is because the body needs to expend more energy metabolizing proteins compared to carbohydrates or fats due to the need for amino acids' synthesis.\n\nB. The thermic effect of food does not typically lead to a slight decrease in body core temperature. Instead, it can cause a temporary increase in metabolic rate, which might result in an overall increase in body temperature, especially if the individual is physically active after eating.\n\nC. The thermic effect of food is indeed partly related to sympathetic activity stimulation in the postprandial ( (post-meal) phase. Sympathetic nervous system activity increases after meals, which can lead to an increase in metabolic rate and energy expenditure.\n\nD. The thermic effect of food can be attenuated by food malabsorption. When there is poor absorption of nutrients, the body may have less need to expend energy on digestion and metabolism of those nutrients, potentially reducing the thermic effect of food.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer that best encapsulates the nuanced understanding of the thermic effect of food would likely be a combination of C ( (sympathetic activity stimulation in the postprandial phase) and D ( (is not always unaffected by food malabsorption), acknowledging that while sympathetic activity plays a role in increasing metabolic rate, the presence of malabsorption could influence this effect."
