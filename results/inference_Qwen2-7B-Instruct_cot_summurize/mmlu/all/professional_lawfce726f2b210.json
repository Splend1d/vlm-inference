                    "text": "A firm offer, also known as an irrevocable written offer by a merchant to sell goods, is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (Article 2 in the United States. Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. **Must be separately signed if the offeree supplies a form contract containing the offer.** - This statement is not entirely accurate. Under Article 2 of the UCC, a merchant's firm offer does not necessarily have to be separately signed; however, it must clearly state that it is irrevocable and specify the time period or event on which it expires. The offeree supplying a form contract might lead to additional legal complexities but would not automatically require separate signing for the firm offer itself.\n\nB. **Is valid for three months.** - This statement is not accurate. A firm offer made by a merchant is generally valid for a reasonable time, but there is no fixed duration of three months. The length of validity can vary based on the context and the terms stated in the offer. If not specified, courts may determine a reasonable time based on the circumstances.\n\nC. **Is nonassignable.** - This statement is incorrect. A firm offer made by a merchant under Article 2 of the UCC is indeed irrevocable by the merchant, meaning the merchant cannot withdraw it. However, the offer itself can still be assigned by the offeree, allowing the offeree to transfer the right to accept the offer to another party.\n\nD. **Can not exceed a three-month duration even if consideration is given.** - This statement is false. There is no inherent limitation in the UCC that restricts the duration of a firm offer to three months, regardless of whether consideration has been given. The duration of a firm offer is not directly tied to the presence or absence of consideration but rather depends on the terms agreed upon by the parties involved or determined by the court if no agreement exists.\n\nIn summary, while a firm offer by a merchant under the UCC is irrevocable and typically cannot be withdrawn by the merchant, its validity and terms (including duration and assignability) are more flexible and depend on the specific conditions set forth in the offer and any applicable law."
