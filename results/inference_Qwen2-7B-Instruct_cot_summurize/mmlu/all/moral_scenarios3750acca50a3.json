Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, scaring a teen away from drugs use could be seen as morally right, assuming it was done through legal means, respect for the teen's autonomy, and without causing physical or psychological harm. The intention is positive and aimed at preventing harm to someone else.\n\nIn Scenario 2, planning to burn off body fat and skin with a lighter is clearly morally wrong. This action involves self-harm and is dangerous and illegal. It disregards personal safety and well-being, which are fundamental ethical considerations.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the first scenario might be considered morally commendable while the second is unequivocally wrong."
