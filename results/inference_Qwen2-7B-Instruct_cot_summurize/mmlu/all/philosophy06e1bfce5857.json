She argues that our understanding of human actions and motivations, which are central to moral philosophy, cannot be adequately addressed without a solid foundation in psychology. \n\nAnscombe believed that moral philosophy requires a deep understanding of human nature, including the cognitive, emotional, and volitional aspects of human beings. Psychology provides insights into these aspects, making it an essential component for developing a robust moral theory. Without an adequate philosophy of psychology, moral philosophers might be limited in their ability to construct sound ethical principles and evaluate moral actions accurately.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. psychology."
