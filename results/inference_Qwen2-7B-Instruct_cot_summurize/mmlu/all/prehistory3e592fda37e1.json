Anthropology is holistic and integrative in its approach.\n\nAnthropology studies humans across different dimensions, including biology, culture, language, society, and evolution. It looks at these aspects in their entirety rather than isolating them. This holistic approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of human behavior and societies.\n\nIn contrast:\n- Economics primarily focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, with a strong emphasis on quantitative data and market forces.\n- Sociology examines social structures, interactions, and groups, often looking at how societies are organized and how people behave within those structures.\n\nThus, while all social sciences have their unique areas of focus, anthropology stands out for its broad, interconnected, and culturally inclusive perspective."
