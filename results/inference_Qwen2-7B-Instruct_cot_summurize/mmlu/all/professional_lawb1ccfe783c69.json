To succeed in a strict products liability case, a plaintiff typically needs to show that the product was defective, that the defect caused the injury, and that the injury occurred while the product was being used as intended.\n\nGiven the scenario:\n\n- The immigrant suffered injury ( (A) from using the shampoo, which suggests that the injury was caused by the product.\n- The product had a warning about potential allergic reactions due to its chemical composition, which implies that there was a known defect related to its safety ( (this would be part of proving the product was defective).\n- The immigrant did not follow the instructions ( (\"make a patch test\"), which could potentially argue against her claim if the defendant argues that her failure to follow instructions contributed to her injury ( (D).\n\nHowever, under strict products liability, the plaintiff does not have to prove negligence on the part of the manufacturer. The fact that the immigrant did not understand the warning label due to language barriers might be a mitigating factor that could influence the court's decision, especially if the manufacturer did not provide instructions in a language accessible to all potential users.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n**Answer C ( lose, because she didn't read or speak English** is not entirely accurate, because language barriers are not typically a defense for manufacturers under strict products liability laws. Manufacturers are expected to ensure their products warnings are clear and accessible to all potential users, regardless of language.\n\n**Answer D lose, because she assumed the risk by not making the 'patch test'** could be argued, but this assumes that the warning was clear and understood by the user. Since the immigrant could not understand the warning due to language barriers, this argument might not hold up in court.\n\n**Answer B win, because the manufacturer was aware that a small percentage of the population would suffer an allergic reaction to the shampoo**, could also apply here. If the manufacturer knew about the potential allergic reactions and failed to adequately warn users, they could be held liable for any resulting injuries.\n\n**Answer A win, because she suffered injury from her use of the product**, is the most likely correct answer under strict products liability principles, assuming the other conditions for liability are met. The immigrant's injury was a direct result of using the product, and the product had a known defect related to its safety ( the warning about potential allergic reactions.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of strict products liability and considering the given scenario, the most likely outcome would be **Option A**: The immigrant would win the case because she suffered injury from her use of the product."
