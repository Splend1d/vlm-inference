                    "text": "To find the largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number, we need to consider the highest value hexadecimal digits and their corresponding base-10 values.\n\nIn hexadecimal (base-16), the digits range from 0 to F, where A-F correspond to decimal values of 10 to 15. Therefore, the highest hexadecimal digit is F, which corresponds to 15 in base-10.\n\nThe largest two-digit hexadecimal number would consist of an F in the \"tens\" place and another F in the \"ones\" place. In base-10, this would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Value} = (\\text{Hexadecimal Digit}) \\times (\\text{Base of Hexadecimal System})^{\\text{Position}} + (\\text{Hexadecimal Digit}) \\times (\\text{Base of Hexadecimal System})^{(\\text{Position} - 1)} \\]\n\nHere, the position is counted from right to left, starting at 0 for the least significant digit ( Since we're dealing with a two-digit hexadecimal number, the positions would be:\n\n- \\(15 \\times 16^1\\) for the tens place,\n- \\(15 \\times 16^0\\) for the ones place.\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ \\text{Value} = 15 \\times 16^1 + 15 \\times 16^0 = 15 \\times 16 + 15 \\times 1 = 240 + 15 = 255 \\]\n\nSo, the largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number is 255.\n\nThe correct answer is **C. 255**."
