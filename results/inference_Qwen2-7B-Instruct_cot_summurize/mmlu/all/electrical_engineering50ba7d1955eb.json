They are very fast, allowing the CPU to access them quickly. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU performs operations like addition, subtraction, etc., on these registers, and the Control Section directs the operation of the CPU based on instructions fetched from memory. \n\nAccumulators are specifically used for arithmetic and logic operations in some CPUs. Decoders convert binary codes into action signals that the CPU can understand. Buffers are temporary storage areas used to hold data while it is being transferred between different parts of the computer system. \n\nTherefore, both the ALU and control section of a CPU employ registers, which are a type of special-purpose storage location."
