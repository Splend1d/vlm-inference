After 10 years of marriage, the couple began experiencing marital difficulties. In 1992, they separated and the husband moved to another state where his family lived. The woman continued to reside in the dwelling. In 1994, the husband quitclaimed his interest in the home to his son, who promptly recorded his deed. In 1995, the couple divorced. In 1996, the woman changed the locks to the home, preventing the son from entering the property, and the woman refused the son's repeated demands to allow him access to the home and property. From 1995 to 2005, the woman paid all the taxes and insurance on the property. She also was responsible for making whatever repairs were necessary. The period of adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 10 years. In 2006, the woman filed suit to quiet title to the home claiming absolute fee simple ownership. The son has countersued asserting that he owns an undivided 50 percent interest in the property. If the court rules in favor of the woman, it will be because\n\nA. the son will be unjustly enriched, inasmuch as the woman has paid all the taxes, insurance, and made necessary repairs.\nB. the son acquired his interest in the property by quitclaim deed.\nC. the deed from the husband to the son was void for lack of consideration.\nD. the woman obtained the son's interest by adverse possession.\n"

                    "text": "If the court rules in favor of the woman, it will be because:\n\nD. the woman obtained the son's interest by adverse possession.\n\nThe doctrine of adverse possession allows a person to acquire legal title to property by meeting specific requirements set by law, such as possessing the land openly, notoriously, continuously, and without permission for a certain period (in this case, 10 years, which is the period required in this jurisdiction. The woman has been residing in the property, paying taxes and insurance, making repairs, and generally treating the property as her own for the entire 10-year period since the separation in 1992. This behavior meets the criteria for adverse possession.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the woman would have legal title under the circumstances described. \n\n- A. While the son may be unjustly enriched if the court rules in favor of the woman, this does not directly provide a legal basis for the woman to claim title; it addresses the potential moral or equitable considerations.\n- B. The fact that the son received an interest in the property through a quitclaim deed does not automatically negate the woman's claim to adverse possession. The deed itself is only valid if it transfers a valid interest, and if the transferor had the right to do so.\n- C. The validity of the deed from the husband to the son could potentially be challenged, but simply because the deed was void for lack of consideration does not automatically mean the woman wins the case. It depends on whether the other conditions for adverse possession were met by the woman.\n\nTherefore, the most direct reason for the court to rule in favor of the woman would be that she successfully proved her claim to the property through adverse possession."
