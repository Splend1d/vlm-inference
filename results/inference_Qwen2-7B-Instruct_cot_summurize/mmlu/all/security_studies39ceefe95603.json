Environmental security entails a consideration of the security of the global environment, as well as its nested sub-systems and social systems beyond the boundaries of the nation state.\nB. Environmental security is a critical security project in that it questions who and what is to be secured and from what threat by orthodox security policies, or whether linkages between environmental, security and development issues can be made.\nC. Environmental security is a practical endeavour to assess how environmental change causes violent conflict within and between countries, and the ways in which environmental security can undermine national security.\nD. All of these options. The environment is both an object to be secured and a source of risk, although it may mean different things to different people. Whilst deepening the concept of security it has both critical and practical dimensions although the utility of the concept is contested.\n"

The environment is both an object to be secured and a source of risk, although it may mean different things to different people. \n\nEnvironmental security encompasses a range of concerns that impact the stability and safety of human societies, as well as the health of ecosystems. It involves considerations about the security of the global environment, including climate change, pollution, and loss of biodiversity, which can have significant impacts on human security. For instance, environmental degradation can lead to resource scarcity, which might fuel conflicts over water, land, and other resources, affecting regional and national security.\n\nMoreover, environmental security also questions traditional notions of security by integrating environmental factors into broader security policies. This approach considers not only physical threats but also the interplay between environmental conditions, economic development, and social stability. It challenges orthodox security policies by emphasizing the importance of environmental sustainability and the need for collaborative international action to address global environmental issues.\n\nAdditionally, environmental security is often viewed as a practical endeavor aimed at understanding how environmental changes can lead to violent conflict within and between countries. For example, droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events can exacerbate existing social tensions, leading to displacement and conflict. By addressing environmental security, nations can develop strategies to mitigate these risks and strengthen their resilience against potential shocks.\n\nIn summary, the environment can be considered a security concern due to its potential to influence geopolitical stability, contribute to resource-related conflicts, challenge traditional security paradigms, and impact the likelihood of violent conflicts. The concept of environmental security acknowledges the complex relationships between the environment, human societies, and security, highlighting the need for integrated approaches to address environmental challenges alongside broader security concerns."
