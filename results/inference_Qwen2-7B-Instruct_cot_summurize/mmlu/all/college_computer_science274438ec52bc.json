The best way to achieve this is by creating a tree-like structure where each component is a single path or a cycle, and these paths/cycles do not share nodes.\n\nGiven 6 edges, the maximum number of connected components we can have is when each component is a tree with 2 edges (forming a path. We can have up to 3 such trees because:\n\n- 1st tree: 2 edges ( (nodes: A-B-C)\n- 2nd tree: 2 edges (nodes: D-E-F)\n- 3rd tree: 2 edges ( (nodes: G-H-I-J)\n\nThis leaves us with node K which doesn't connect to any other nodes in these trees. Therefore, \\(M = 4\\) (since we have 4 separate connected components (the 3 trees and the isolated node).\n\n### Minimum Number of Connected Components (\\(m\\))\n\nFor \\(m\\) to be minimized, we want to maximize connectivity within the graph. This means trying to form a single large connected component.\n\nGiven that we cannot have cycles (because then we would have more than 6 edges, given the constraint), the best we can do is to connect nodes in a way that forms a tree with as few branches as possible while still using all 6 edges. \n\nThe best configuration here is to have a star-shaped graph, where one central node is connected to all other 9 nodes, using 9 edges. However, since we only have 6 edges, we must instead form a linear chain of nodes with 5 edges, leaving one node unconnected. This results in a single connected component, but it violates the condition of having exactly 6 edges. Thus, aiming for a star configuration directly leads to an impossibility under our constraints.\n\nThe correct approach considering the constraints is to visualize forming a linear chain of nodes using 5 of the 6 edges ( (nodes: A-B-C-D-E) and then realizing the 6th edge must connect two of these nodes to ensure every node is part of the same component. For instance, adding an edge between B and C, we get a single connected component with 6 edges.\n\nTherefore, \\(m = 1\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis above:\n- \\(M = 4\\) ( because we can distribute the 6 edges across 4 separate connected components ( the 3 trees and the isolated node.\n- \\(m = 1\\) because the best configuration is a single connected component formed by connecting all 10 nodes in a linear chain with the addition of one edge to ensure connectivity.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. M = 10, m = 1**. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the provided options as none directly match the derived values. Based on the logic applied:\n\n- Option B incorrectly states \\(M = 10\\), which was not calculated or intended based on the constraints given.\n- Option C and D suggest configurations that don't align with maximizing or minimizing the number of connected components under the specified constraints.\n\nGiven the constraints and logic applied, the closest correct interpretation aligning with the explanation provided would suggest an oversight in the options given, as they do not accurately reflect the calculated values for \\(M\\) and \\(m\\). The correct understanding based on the constraints and logic applied would be that \\(M = 4\\) and \\(m = 1\\), which does not match any of the provided options exactly."
