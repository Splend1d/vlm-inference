This increase in wealth can lead to higher consumer confidence, causing consumers to spend more (an increase in the consumption function. As consumption is a component of aggregate demand, this increased spending also results in an increase in aggregate demand. Therefore, both the consumption function and aggregate demand are likely to increase."
