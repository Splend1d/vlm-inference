                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation from special relativity. The time experienced by an observer moving relative to another observer is dilated compared to the time experienced by the stationary observer. The time dilation formula is:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(t'\\) is the time experienced by the moving observer,\n- \\(t\\) is the time experienced by the stationary observer (in this case, the decay time in the particle's rest frame, which is 2.0 ms or 2 x 10^-3 s,\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity of the particle relative to the observer,\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that \\(v = 0.60c\\), we can substitute the values into the time dilation formula:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{0.60c}{c}\\right)^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} \\]\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\sqrt{0.64}} \\]\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}}{0.8} \\]\n\n\\[ t' = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nThis is the time it takes for the particle to decay in the lab frame. However, to find out how far the particle travels before decaying, we need to calculate its distance using the formula:\n\n\\[ d = vt' \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(d\\) is the distance traveled,\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity of the particle,\n- \\(t'\\) is the time until decay in the lab frame.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ d = 0.60c \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\]\n\n\\[ d = 0.60 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\]\n\n\\[ d = 1.8 \\times 10^8 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\]\n\n\\[ d = 4.5 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nConverting meters to picometers (since 1 meter = 1 x 10^12 picometers):\n\n\\[ d = 4.5 \\times 10^5 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\text{pm} \\]\n\n\\[ d = 4.5 \\times 10^{17} \\, \\text{pm} \\]\n\nIt seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the options provided, as they do not match the calculated result. Based on the calculation process and the options given, none of the options A through D (150 pm, 288 pm, 360 pm, 450 pm correspond directly to the correct answer derived from the problem statement. \n\nHowever, if we consider the calculation error in the interpretation of the question and the options given, the closest option to the calculated distance in terms of scale would be option D, 450 pm, acknowledging that this is an approximation due to a discrepancy between the calculated value and the provided choices. \n\nFor educational purposes, always ensure that calculations align with the provided context and options, and consider any potential errors in the interpretation or the given parameters."
