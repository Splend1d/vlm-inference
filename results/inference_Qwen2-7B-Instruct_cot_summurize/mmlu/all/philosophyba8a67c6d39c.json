This theory suggests that our minds are equipped with an innate understanding of these abstract concepts before we are exposed to the physical world. Here's why option D is the most accurate representation of how Plato would argue that all knowledge is innate:\n\nD. Since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\n\nPlato believed that the knowledge we gain about the world is not derived solely from our sensory experiences, which he considered to be imperfect reflections of the true forms. Instead, he posited that our innate knowledge of these forms is what allows us to recognize and understand the particulars we encounter in the physical world. Sensory experience plays a role in triggering this innate knowledge, helping us to identify and associate the physical manifestations with their corresponding forms. However, the core knowledge is not acquired through the senses; it is present within us from birth and is revealed when we contemplate the forms directly. \n\nOptions A, B, and C do not fully capture the essence of Plato's argument. Option A incorrectly suggests that we are born knowing what things are in terms of ideas we get through our senses, conflating innate knowledge with sensory input. Option B inaccurately assumes that relying solely on senses leads to certain knowledge, ignoring the distinction between innate understanding and sensory perception. Option C suggests that our knowledge is not of the sensible world but of a world grasped mathematically and ideally, which is a more nuanced view than simply stating that knowledge is innate, as it implies a specific method of accessing that knowledge ( through mathematical and ideal contemplation."
