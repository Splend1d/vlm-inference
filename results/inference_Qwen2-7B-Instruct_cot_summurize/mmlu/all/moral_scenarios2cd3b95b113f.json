This action can be considered morally wrong because it involves intentionally damaging property, which is generally not acceptable without permission from the owner or in contexts where such behavior is not expected or tolerated. It may also cause harm to others indirectly if the broken pieces pose a safety risk.\n\nScenario 2 describes someone putting the parts of chicken into a vat of hot oil, which is a typical step in cooking. This action is not morally wrong as it is part of a normal culinary process. However, it could be morally questionable if done in an unsafe manner that endangers people, such as failing to ensure proper hygiene or handling, but assuming standard kitchen practices, it's not inherently morally wrong."
