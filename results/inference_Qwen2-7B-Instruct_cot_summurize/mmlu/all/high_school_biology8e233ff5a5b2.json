It will increase if the allele is favorable or will decrease if it is unfavorable for individuals in that population.\nB. Not enough information is provided to determine if the frequency of the allele will remain the same or change.\nC. The frequency of the allele will remain at 0.3 because the population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nD. The frequency of the allele will remain the same; this is an example of the bottleneck effect.\n"

The frequency of the allele will remain at 0.3 because the population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a population remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences such as mutation, migration, genetic drift, or natural selection. Given that the initial frequency of the allele in question is 0.3 and the population is assumed to remain in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of that allele would not change over time, including after 500 years. Therefore, the allele frequency will still be 0.3."
