                    "text": "The total energy released during the impact of a comet on Earth can be understood by considering the kinetic energy of the comet and the gravitational potential energy it gains as it falls towards the Earth.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the comet just before impact is given by:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the comet, and \\(v\\) is its velocity at impact.\n\nWhen the comet hits the Earth, its kinetic energy is converted into various forms of energy, including heat, sound, and deformation of the Earth's surface. However, the question asks for the \"total energy released\" in the impact. This typically includes both the kinetic energy of the comet and the gravitational potential energy gained by the comet as it falls from infinity to the Earth's surface.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy (\\(PE\\)) of an object of mass \\(m\\) at a distance \\(r\\) from the center of the Earth with mass \\(M\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ PE = -\\frac{GMm}{r} \\]\n\nAt the Earth's surface, the distance \\(r\\) is equal to the Earth's radius \\(R\\), so the potential energy becomes:\n\n\\[ PE = -\\frac{GMm}{R} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in the impact is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy:\n\n\\[ E_{total} = KE + PE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R} \\]\n\nHowever, since the comet impacts the Earth at its minimum impact speed, the kinetic energy term \\(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\) is actually zero because the speed at which the comet impacts the Earth is such that all its kinetic energy is converted into other forms of energy upon impact. \n\nSo, the total energy released in the impact simplifies to the gravitational potential energy gain of the comet:\n\n\\[ E_{total} = -\\frac{GMm}{R} \\]\n\nNone of the options A through D directly match this simplified result exactly. However, the closest correct expression to the simplified answer based on the provided options is:\n\nC. \\(0.5*m*(2GM/R)\\)\n\nThis is not exactly right but seems to be the best choice given the options, considering the simplification where kinetic energy is negligible due to the impact being happening at minimum impact speed. In reality, the correct expression without simplification should not include a factor of 0.5, reflecting the direct conversion of kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy."
