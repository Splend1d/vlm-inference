Can the surviving wife enforce the automatic reverter putting title back in herself?\n\nA. No, this is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\nB. No, an automatic reverter is unenforceable.\nC.

                    "text": "The answer to whether the surviving wife can enforce the automatic reverter depends on the specific laws of the jurisdiction where the property is located, as well as the language of the conveyance document. However, based on general principles of property law, I would lean towards option D: Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n\nAn automatic reverter is a legal device that allows a grantor (in this case, the husband) to reclaim property if certain conditions are met, such as the property being encumbered by a mortgage during the grantor's lifetime. This type of clause can be seen as a reasonable restraint on alienation because it limits the grantee's ability to freely transfer the property without the consent of the grantor, thereby preserving the grantor's interest in the property.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that automatic reverters may be subject to certain limitations. For example, some jurisdictions may consider an automatic reverter to be an unreasonable restraint on alienation if it significantly undervalues the property or is not in line with the grantor's intentions. In this scenario, the fact that the property was conveyed at a substantial discount below market value might raise questions about the reasonableness of the restraint.\n\nAdditionally, the specific language of the conveyance is crucial. The phrase \"should the property conveyed herein ever be mortgaged or encumbered within the life time of either Grantor\" suggests that the reverter applies only if the property is encumbered during the grantor's lifetime, which might mitigate concerns about an unreasonable restraint.\n\nGiven these considerations, while option D seems most aligned with the general principle that an automatic reverter can be enforceable as a reasonable restraint on alienation, the final determination would depend on a thorough review of the applicable laws and the specific terms of the conveyance."
