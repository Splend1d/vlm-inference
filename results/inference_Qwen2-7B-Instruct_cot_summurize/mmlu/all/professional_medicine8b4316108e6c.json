                    "text": "A 40-year-old female secretary comes to the office because of a 2-month history of fatigue, and generalized aching and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities. The patient initially noticed the weakness only while she was getting in and out of her car, but during the past 2 weeks, the weakness has progressed, so that she now has difficulty combing her hair. Since the symptoms began, she also has had aching of the joints in her hands that has responded partially to ibuprofen. She was adopted and family history is unknown. She has two teenaged children who are well. She appears uncomfortable. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 68 kg(150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination discloses cracking of the skin of both hands that involves the tips and lateral sides of several fingers. The muscles of the upper arms and legs are somewhat tender to pressure. Results of serum laboratory studies show a creatine kinase concentration of 600 U/L and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of 800 U/L. Results of complete blood count are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Fibromyalgia\nB. Myasthenia gravis\nC. Polymyositis\nD. Scleroderma\n"

                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis for this patient would be C. Polymyositis. \n\nPolymyositis is an inflammatory muscle disease characterized by muscle weakness, particularly in the proximal muscles of the limbs. It often presents with muscle pain and stiffness, as well as skin changes such as redness or a \"red-brown\" rash over the knuckles, elbows, knees, and shoulders. The patient's symptoms, including muscle weakness, joint pain, and skin changes on the hands, align with this condition. Additionally, the elevation of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels in the blood, which can occur due to muscle inflammation and damage, further supports the diagnosis of polymyositis. \n\nF. Fibromyalgia, B. Myasthenia gravis, and D. Scleroderma do not typically present with similar symptoms or laboratory findings. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain and fatigue, without specific muscle weakness or elevated enzyme levels. Myasthenia gravis is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness, especially in the eye, face, and neck muscles, and does not typically involve proximal muscle weakness or skin changes. Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the skin and connective tissues, and while it may cause some muscle weakness, it usually does not present with the specific symptoms mentioned."
