Recently the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the placement of any sign with dimensions larger than six feet on the exterior of any commercial building. Furthermore, signs within the guidelines of the ordinance could only relate to advertising the business of the property's occupant. The intended purpose of the ordinance was to advance the municipality's interests in traffic safety and aesthetics. An owner of an office building in the newly developed section of town, placed a 10-foot sign on the outside of his building endorsing his brother's political candidacy. The city council has ordered the owner to remove the sign from his building, but he has refused to take it down until after the election. If the owner challenges the city ordinance, the most likely result is that he will\n\nA. prevail, because the ordinance violates his freedom of speech.\nB. prevail, because such a time, place, and manner restriction on private property is discriminatory and overbroad.\nC. not prevail, because although commercial speech is protected by the First Amendment, it is subject to greater regulation than other forms of protected speech.\nD. not prevail, because the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n"

Commercial speech, which includes advertisements for goods and services, is generally given less protection under the First Amendment than non-commercial speech. This is because commercial speech can potentially mislead consumers or distort the marketplace of ideas, making it more susceptible to government regulation.\n\nIn cases where there is a conflict between commercial speech and other important interests ( like traffic safety and aesthetics in this case), courts have typically upheld reasonable regulations that serve those interests. The Supreme Court has established a test for evaluating restrictions on commercial speech: the restriction must be \"directed at the problem posed by the deceptive or misleading character of the commercial message\" and must \"leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\"\n\nGiven that the city's ordinance seems to be aimed at promoting traffic safety and maintaining aesthetic standards in the downtown area, it might be considered a reasonable regulation that serves these interests. The fact that the sign in question is endorsing a political candidacy rather than simply advertising a business might not change the fundamental analysis significantly, as the endorsement still involves commercial elements (i.e., the use of the property for promotional purposes.\n\nTherefore, the owner would most likely not prevail in challenging the city ordinance, especially if the court determines that the regulation is rationally related to a legitimate state interest, such as maintaining traffic flow and preserving the attractiveness of the downtown area."
