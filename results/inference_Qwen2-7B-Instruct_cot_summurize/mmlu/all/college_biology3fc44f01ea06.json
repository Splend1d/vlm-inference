                    "text": "The correct answer is A. When the external pH is low, it decreases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+ outside the mitochondria. To maintain the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, the mitochondria will pump H+ ions into the intermembrane space. This process is part of the proton motive force that drives ATP synthesis through chemiosmosis. The increased concentration of H+ inside the matrix relative to the intermembrane space then facilitates the production of ATP via the action of ATP synthase."
