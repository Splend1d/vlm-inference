It impacts workplace productivity and may lead to others covering for the individual, causing additional stress or burden. This behavior could also potentially result in disciplinary actions or loss of job if it becomes excessive and disruptive to the workplace environment.\n\nIn Scenario 2, telling a bartender you are 24 when you are only 17 is not necessarily a morally wrong act. While it might be illegal to consume alcohol at the age of 17 in many jurisdictions (since the legal drinking age is typically 21 in the United States, this scenario assumes the legal drinking age is lower than 21), the act itself doesn't inherently involve any direct harm or deception that would classify it as morally wrong. However, it's important to note that lying about one's age to consume alcohol is generally considered dishonest and could lead to legal penalties, which might be seen as a negative action but not necessarily a moral wrongdoing in terms of ethical standards."
