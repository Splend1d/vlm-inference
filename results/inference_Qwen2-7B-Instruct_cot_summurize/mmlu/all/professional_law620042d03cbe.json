Two days after the robbeiy, one of the men was involved in an auto accident. The man was rushed to the hospital and taken to the x-ray room. A doctor positioned the man so that the x-ray technician would be able to take x-rays of his lower back area. Based on the man's complaints about the area of pain, the doctor stated, \"It seems as if you might have a fractured pelvis. If you do, you'll have to stay in bed for several weeks. \" The man responded that he couldn't do that because he had to meet the other man tomorrow. A technician who was in the room at the time overheard the man's response to the doctor. Subsequently, both men are charged with robbery and conspiracy. At the man's trial, as evidence of a conspiracy, the prosecution attempts to introduce the doctor's testimony that the man said, \"I have to meet the other man tomorrow. \" The defense objects. This evidence is\n\nA. inadmissible, because it violates the physician- patient privilege.\nB. admissible, because the technician overheard the conversation.\nC. admissible, because of the nature of the man's statements.\nD. admissible, because the statement was not confidential, under the circumstances.\n"

This privilege is designed to encourage patients to share honest information with their healthcare providers without fear of those communications being used against them in court. \n\nIn this scenario, the man's statement to the doctor about needing to meet the other man the next day is considered part of a privileged communication because it was made in the context of medical care and diagnosis. The fact that a technician overheard the conversation does not negate the privileged nature of the statement, especially since the doctor was the intended recipient and the conversation was within a professional setting where confidentiality is expected.\n\nTherefore, the prosecution's attempt to introduce the doctor's testimony regarding this statement as evidence of conspiracy would likely be ruled inadmissible due to the violation of the physician-patient privilege."
