According to Thomas and Chess's 1977 \"goodness-of-fit\" model, maladjustment in children is due to a mismatch between the child's basic temperament and his/her parents' childrearing practices. The model suggests that if a child's inherent traits (such as being easily upset, adaptable, or difficult to soothe, for example - do not align well with how their parents or caregivers generally respond and react, this can lead to stress and difficulties for the child, potentially resulting in maladjustment. This mismatch can manifest in various forms of behavioral issues, emotional problems, or developmental challenges."
