None of the above.\n\nAccording to Immanuel Kant's ethical philosophy, actions are morally right if they are performed out of respect for the moral law, which is universalizable and can be applied to everyone without contradiction. Sexual activities, including masturbation, engaging in prostitution, or consensual sexual activity outside of marriage, do not necessarily violate this moral law when considered within the context of mutual consent, respect for individuals involved, and adherence to societal laws. However, Kant's moral philosophy does not provide explicit guidance on these specific acts, focusing more broadly on the intentions behind actions and the maxim that guides them. Therefore, whether such activities are morally permissible depends on how they align with one's personal moral principles and the context in which they occur, rather than being directly addressed by Kant's categorical imperative."
