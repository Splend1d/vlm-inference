Ultrasonography\n\nGiven that the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median, this suggests an elevated risk for neural tube defects or other anomalies in the fetus. While further testing is necessary, ultrasonography is a non-invasive method that can provide valuable information about the fetal development, including the presence of structural anomalies that could be associated with high MSAFP levels.\n\nRepeating the MSAFP measurement might help confirm if the initial result was a one-time anomaly or indicative of a persistent issue, but it does not provide detailed anatomical information.\n\nTriple screening involves measuring serum \u03b2-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein, and estriol concentrations, which can help assess the risk for chromosomal abnormalities and neural tube defects. However, ultrasonography offers more direct visualization of potential anomalies compared to these biochemical markers alone.\n\nAmniocentesis involves the removal of amniotic fluid from the uterus for laboratory analysis to determine the genetic makeup of the fetus. This procedure is invasive, carries a small risk of miscarriage, and is typically reserved for cases where the risk assessment from other tests indicates a high probability of fetal abnormalities, or when there is a need to determine the specific cause of the elevated MSAFP level.\n\nTherefore, given the current information and the aim to assess the fetus without additional risks, ultrasonography is the most appropriate initial step."
