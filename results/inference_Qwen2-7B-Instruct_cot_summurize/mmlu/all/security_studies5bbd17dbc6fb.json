All of these options.\n\nSocietal security involves multiple aspects including sovereignty, identity, and other factors that contribute to the stability and well-being of a society. Sovereignty ensures that a nation has control over its own affairs without external interference. Identity helps in maintaining cultural, social, and national cohesion among the populace. Hegemonic ethnicity, while it might play a role in certain contexts, is not universally essential for societal security as it can also lead to exclusion and conflict. Therefore, all three options can be considered essential depending on the specific context and the definition of societal security being applied."
