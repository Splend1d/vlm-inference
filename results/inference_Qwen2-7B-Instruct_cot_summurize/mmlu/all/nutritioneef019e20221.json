The number decreased, but not by nearly enough to meet the Summit's goal.\n\nThe 1996 World Food Summit aimed to reduce the number of undernourished people in the world by half by the year 2015. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization ( (FAO), global hunger did decrease between 1996 and 2015. However, it did not decrease enough to meet the target set by the summit. As of 2015, the number of people facing hunger had been reduced from about 842 million to around 731 million, falling short of the summit's goal of halving the 1990-1992 level of 808 million. This indicates that while progress was was made, it was not sufficient to achieve the ambitious target set by the World Food Summit."
