She says that she is more fatigued than she was at 65, but she still gardens and drives to the grocery store. Routine laboratory studies reveal a leukocyte count of 25.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/mcL (reference range 4.5-11.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/mcL) and 97%\u00a0mature-appearing lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the lymphocytes to be of\u00a0B-cell\u00a0origin.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( (CLL)\n\nCLL is characterized by the accumulation of a large number of mature B-cells in the blood and lymph nodes. These cells often have a characteristic appearance under the microscope, with a small nucleus and abundant cytoplasm. The presence of high levels of lymphocytes (in this case, 97% mature-appearing lymphocytes), and the finding of B-cell origin on immunohistochemical stains align well with the diagnosis of CLL.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n- A. Acute lymphocytic leukemia ( involves a rapid increase in immature lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and blood.\n- B. Acute myelogenous leukemia involves the rapid proliferation of immature myeloid cells.\n- D. Chronic myelogenous leukemia is characterized by the accumulation of white blood cells (myeloid cells) rather than lymphocytes.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms (increased fatigue, but still able to engage in activities like gardening and driving, and the laboratory findings, CLL seems to be the most fitting diagnosis."
