Advertising. \n\nAdvertising utilizes non-personal media such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, and online platforms to communicate messages directly to a broad audience. The goal is to create awareness, build brand recognition, and influence purchasing decisions without direct interaction with the consumer. Unlike direct marketing which targets specific individuals, public relations which focuses on managing the company's image, and sales promotions which offer incentives for immediate purchases, advertising aims to engage large audiences through mass media."
