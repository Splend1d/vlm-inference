Tracking the number of products reworked. \n\nInternal failure costs refer to the costs associated with errors or defects that occur within an organization before the product reaches the customer. These costs include rework, scrap, and inspection costs. Tracking the number of products reworked directly measures these internal failure costs and can indicate improvements in product quality. As the number of reworks decreases, it suggests that the quality of the products is improving."
