                    "text": "The correct answer is B. An ARMA(p,q) model has an autocorrelation function (ACF) that theoretically decays geometrically after lag p, because the moving average (MA) component of the model will remove any remaining autocorrelation in the errors after lagging q times. Meanwhile, its partial autocorrelation function (PACF) should be zero after lag p due to the autoregressive (AR) component of the model which removes the effect of the previous lags.\n\nHere's a quick explanation of each option:\n\nA. This would indicate that both the ACF and PACF decay geometrically, which is not necessarily true for an ARMA(p,q) model. It could be indicative of an AR or MA process but not necessarily an ARMA(p,q).\n\nB. This is correct. The PACF will cut off after lag p, indicating the AR part of the model, while the ACF will decay geometrically, indicating the MA part of the model.\n\nC. This suggests that the ACF cuts off after q lags, which would indicate an MA(q) process, not an ARMA(p,q). The PACF should instead cut off after p lags if it's an ARMA(p,q).\n\nD. This option suggests that both the ACF and PACF cut off after q lags, which would imply both an AR and an MA process have been completely accounted for, but this is only true when q = p. Otherwise, one or the other should cut off first based on whether it's an AR or MA process dominating the data."
