The contract signed by the parties required the senior citizen to be at the crosswalk every weekday afternoon from 2 pm to 4 pm, and to escort children leaving the school across the street. The senior citizen was to be paid $250 per week for his efforts. The contract also stressed the importance of the safety of the children, and stated that if the senior citizen should fail to show up for work without giving notice in advance so a substitute can be located, the senior citizen would be subject to a $200 per incident penalty. The contract provision making the senior citizen liable for a $200 per incident penalty may best be described as a (an)\n\nA. liquidated damage clause.\nB. unliquidated damage clause.\nC. penalty and forfeiture clause.\nD. aleatory clause.\n"

This amount is not a punishment but is intended to cover the actual harm or loss resulting from the breach. In this case, the clause aims to ensure the senior citizen will provide sufficient notice if unable to work, thus allowing the school to arrange a substitute, and to compensate the school for any potential loss due to the lack of notice."
