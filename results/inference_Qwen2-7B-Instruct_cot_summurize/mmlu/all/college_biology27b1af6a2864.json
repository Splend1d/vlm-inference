Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage. \n\nThis experiment directly tests the hypothesis that the ants are protecting the tree from leaf-feeding insects by removing them and observing if there is an increase in damage caused by these insects. If the leaves show increased damage after the ants are removed, it supports the idea that the ants were playing a protective role."
