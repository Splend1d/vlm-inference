It advocates the inclusion of non-governmental organisations and other actors to encourage cooperation and build communities.\n\nThis statement best captures the essence of liberalist attitudes toward international organizations. Liberalism generally views international cooperation as a means to achieve peace and stability through institutions like the United Nations, World Trade Organization, and others. It supports the idea that these organizations facilitate dialogue, establish rules, and promote economic interdependence among states, which are in turn reduces the likelihood of conflict. Additionally, the liberalist perspective often includes the view that NGOs and other non-state actors play a crucial role in promoting human rights, democracy, and environmental protection, thereby contributing to global security."
