No, because payment of the $2,000 to the creditor would undermine the statutory public policy against enforcement of stale claims.\nB. No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\nC. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is enforceable by the creditor regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything.\nD. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor revived the uncollectible debt.\n"

No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\n\nIn this scenario, the debtor has sold their car to the buyer for $2,000, with the buyer agreeing to pay that amount to the creditor as satisfaction of the debtor's debt. However, since the debt is barred by the statute of limitations, the creditor may not have been able to collect on it otherwise. \n\nThe buyer's promise to pay the creditor is indeed enforceable, but it is subject to any defenses the debtor might have had against the creditor. If the debt was unenforceable due to the statute of limitations, the buyer could potentially argue that they should not be held liable either, especially if they were unaware of the limitations period or did not receive proper notice from the creditor about the debt being owed. \n\nTherefore, option B accurately reflects that the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to the same defenses that the debtor had against the creditor."
