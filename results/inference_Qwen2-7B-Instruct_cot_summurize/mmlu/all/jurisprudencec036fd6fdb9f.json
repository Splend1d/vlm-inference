When no-one would prefer another's bundle of resources to his or her own.\n\nRalph Ernest Dworkin, a prominent legal philosopher and moral theorist, argues for an egalitarian view of justice that focuses on equality of resources rather than merely equality of welfare. He posits that true equality of welfare cannot be secured through conventional economic measures alone because people have different preferences and capabilities, which can lead to unequal satisfaction even when welfare levels appear equal. \n\nAccording to Dworkin, a fair distribution should ensure that no individual would prefer to swap their entire bundle of resources ( including both financial assets and non-financial goods like health, education, and leisure time - with another's bundle, assuming they have the same preferences. This conception of equality aims to capture the idea that everyone should have an equal opportunity to live a meaningful life, taking into account their unique circumstances and desires.\n\nThis notion of equality is not based solely on economic measures such as income or property ownership ( option B), nor is it determined by societal norms or community decisions about what constitutes equality ( option D). It also differs from measuring equality by the amount of income tax paid ( option C), as this could incentivize behaviors that do not necessarily reflect one's resource holdings or welfare.\n\nIn essence, Dworkin's approach to equality of resources seeks to address the shortcomings of other conceptions by accounting for individual differences in a more nuanced way, ensuring that justice is not merely about equalizing outcomes but also about equal opportunities to flourish according to each person's unique situation."
