This association might be due to hormonal changes related to excess body fat.\n\nC. **Type 2 diabetes (maturity onset)**: Obesity is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Excess body weight can lead to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders that are characteristic of this condition.\n\nThus, it's important to manage body weight through a healthy diet and regular physical activity to mitigate these risks."
