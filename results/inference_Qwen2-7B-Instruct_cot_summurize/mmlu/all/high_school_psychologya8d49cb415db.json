Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in memory, learning, and other cognitive functions. In Alzheimer's disease, there is a notable decrease in acetylcholine levels due to the death of neurons that produce this neurotransmitter. This reduction in acetylcholine is thought to contribute to the cognitive decline seen in patients with Alzheimer's."
