Subsidize the firm or its customers. \n\nWhen there is a positive externality associated with the production of a private good, it means that the production of this good generates benefits for third parties not accounted for in the market price. This leads to an underproduction of the good because the market price does not reflect the true social value of the good. The government can correct this inefficiency by subsidizing the firm (making it cheaper for them to produce the good, or by subsidizing the consumers (making the good cheaper for them to buy. Both actions aim to increase the quantity produced and consumed until it reaches the socially optimal level where the marginal social benefit equals the marginal social cost."
