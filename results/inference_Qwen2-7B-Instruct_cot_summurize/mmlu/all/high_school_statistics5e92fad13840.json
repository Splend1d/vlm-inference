He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?\n\nA. Because tis more extreme than \u00b11.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nB. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nC. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis.

We look up the critical t-value for 17 degrees of freedom and an area of 0.025 in each tail in a t-distribution table or use a statistical calculator.\n\nThe critical t-values for 17 degrees of freedom at a 2.5% significance level in each tail are approximately \u00b12.110.\n\nGiven our calculated t-value is -1.973, it falls within the range where the absolute value is less than the critical t-value of 2.110. Therefore:\n\n- It is less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, indicating that we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n- This means we do not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these h**ns is different from 55 grams.\n\nThus, the correct conclusion is **B. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 55 grams.**"
