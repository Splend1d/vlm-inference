I'll pay you $275 if you will change the oil, replace the oil filter, and adjust the carburetors by February 10. \"The mechanic received the man's letter on February 3. That same day, he telephoned an auto supply company and ordered the necessary materials to perform the repair work. Two days later, the mechanic met the man at a party and this conversation took place:The man: \"Disregard the letter I sent you last week. \"The mechanic: \"No way, man, I already ordered the materials on from the auto supply company. \"The man: \"Sorry, but I sold my car yesterday, so forget the repair work. \"If the mechanic initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is the man's strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the parties?\n\nA. The mechanic had not completed performance before the man revoked his offer.\nB. The man's offer could only be accepted by a return promise.\nC. Because the man made his offer by letter, the mechanic could accept only in the same manner.\nD.

Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.\n\nIn contract law, an offer can be revoked before acceptance takes place, unless the offer explicitly states it cannot be revoked or there is consideration for the promise not to revoke. In this case, since the man revoked his offer before the mechanic had started performing any of the requested tasks (such as changing the oil, replacing the oil filter, or adjusting the carburetors), the mechanic would not have a valid basis for claiming breach of contract. The fact that the mechanic had ordered materials to prepare for the job does not constitute acceptance of the offer since the act of ordering materials is not equivalent to performing the requested services."
