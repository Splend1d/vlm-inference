This process is facilitated by the data structure allowing for efficient access and modification of elements. Both linked lists (singly and doubly linked\u2014allow for efficient splitting (dividing the list into two parts by changing pointers) and merging (by traversing and rearranging nodes. Arrays also support efficient splitting and merging through indexing operations.\n\nTherefore, mergesort can work in \\(O(n \\log n)\\) time with all three data structures: singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and arrays."
