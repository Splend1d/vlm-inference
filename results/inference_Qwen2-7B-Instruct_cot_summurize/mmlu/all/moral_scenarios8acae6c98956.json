Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves taking a test and writing answers, which is generally considered cheating and is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Cheating undermines the fairness and integrity of academic assessments and can lead to unfair advantages for some students over others.\n\nScenario 2 involves cutting children's hair, which is not inherently morally wrong unless there are specific circumstances that make it so, such as causing harm or neglect. Haircutting is a common service provided by professionals or family members, and if done safely and with consent, it would be considered acceptable."
