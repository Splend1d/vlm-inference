David's perfectionism and comparison to better players suggest he has high self-esteem, as he holds himself to a high standard. His commitment to mastering the sheet music indicates strong self-efficacy, or belief in his own abilities to succeed. Additionally, since he focuses on his own performance rather than blaming external factors for his difficulties ( (such as the quality of his instrument or the difficulty of the piece), this suggests an internal locus of control."
