Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWhen two heterozygous individuals (each with the genotype Bb) mate, the probability of producing offspring with each genotype can be calculated using a Punnett square or basic probability principles. Here's how it breaks down:\n\n- Each parent has a 50% chance of passing on the dominant allele (B and the recessive allele b.\n- Therefore, when they mate, there's a 1/4 chance of getting the genotype BB ( which results in a black coat,\n- A 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 chance of getting the genotype Bb which also results in a black coat,\n- And another 1/4 chance of getting the genotype bb which results in a white coat.\n\nSo, given that three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter have white coats, the genotypes of the parents must have been Bb \u00d7 Bb."
