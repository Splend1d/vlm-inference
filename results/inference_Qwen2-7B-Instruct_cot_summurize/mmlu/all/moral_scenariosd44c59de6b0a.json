This decision could be seen as a responsible use of resources, depending on the context and whether the lamp was in use when you unplugged it.\n\nIn Scenario 2, intentionally letting go of someone who is struggling and teetering backward can be considered morally wrong. This action endangers the well-being of the other person and could result in physical harm, which goes against the moral principle of not causing harm to others."
