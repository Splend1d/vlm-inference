During the divorce proceedings, the husband's lawyer calls a neighbor to testify that the market value of the home exceeds $100,000. She states that her testimony is based on an estimate contained in an appraisal report that she saw. The appraisal had been prepared at the husband's request by a well-known real estate company in the area.

One of these criteria is that the witness must have expertise or knowledge relevant to the subject matter they are testifying about. In this case, since the neighbor is not an expert in real estate market values, her testimony might not be considered reliable or relevant enough to be admissible. The fact that she claims to have seen an appraisal report does not automatically qualify her as an expert; she would need to demonstrate expertise or be qualified in evaluating property values in the real estate market.\n\nAdditionally, the neighbor's testimony might also be challenged under the hearsay rule, which generally prohibits the use of statements made outside of court to prove the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception applies. The fact that the testimony is based on seeing an appraisal report does not necessarily make it admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, especially if the appraisal itself is not introduced into evidence and the neighbor does not provide sufficient detail about the methodology or qualifications used in the appraisal process."
