Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?\n\nA.

When TP53 is mutated, as in this case, the cell loses its ability to effectively repair DNA damage or halt the cell cycle before damaged DNA is replicated.\n\nGiven that the patient's tumor cells contain a point mutation in the TP53 gene leading to an inactive p53 protein, and the tumor continues to grow despite radiation therapy, the progressive tumor growth is most likely related to a defect in cell cycle arrest during the G1 phase. This is because the G1 checkpoint is where the cell checks for DNA damage before proceeding with DNA replication and entering the S phase of the cell cycle. An inactive p53 protein would not be able to properly perform this check, allowing damaged DNA to proceed through the cell cycle and potentially leading to further mutations and tumor progression.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
