Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .\nYou must know that I am not content with the Courtier unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .\nI wish our Courtier to guard against getting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who do not deserve it.\n\u2014From Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, 1528\nWhich of the following reforms would Castiglione most likely want to institute?\n\nA. The creation of coeducational public high schools paid for by the state\nB. The creation of male-only public high schools paid for by the state\nC. The creation of public universities without tuition where all students of both genders could learn\nD. The creation of private high schools for elite young men with many extracurricular activities\n"

This holistic approach to education is geared towards the development of a gentleman who excels in both physical prowess and intellectual pursuits. The focus on private education suggests an emphasis on quality over quantity, targeting a select group of young men who could afford or merit such an educational experience. Additionally, the inclusion of extracurricular activities hints at the importance of developing well-rounded individuals capable of excelling in various domains, which is consistent with the modern concept of a \"well-rounded\" education.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting reform for Castiglione would be the establishment of private high schools tailored for elite young men that incorporate his desired curriculum and values."
