Centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization.\n\nThis context is most appropriate because the data shows a significant increase in literacy rates among the Russian-speaking population over a period of time that coincides with the establishment and development of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government implemented various policies and initiatives aimed at promoting education and increasing literacy as part of its broader program of modernization and industrialization. These efforts were often centralized and directed by the state, reflectinging the top-down approach typical of socialist planning systems."
