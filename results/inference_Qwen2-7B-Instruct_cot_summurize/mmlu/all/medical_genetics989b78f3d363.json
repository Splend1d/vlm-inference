However, individuals with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk for various health issues due to the chronic inflammation and thick mley production that characterizes the disease. This can lead to complications such as:\n\nA. Cancer of the oesophagus: While not common, people with cystic fibrosis have a slightly higher risk of developing certain types of cancer, including oesophageal cancer.\n\nB. Congenital absence of the vas deferens: This is a rare condition that may be associated with cystic fibrosis due to the genetic mutations that cause both conditions.\n\nD. Liver cirrhosis: The liver plays a crucial role in detoxifyinging the blood and metabolizing medications. People with cystic fibrosis often develop liver disease due to the thick mley obstructing bile flow, leading to cirrhosis over time.\n\nTherefore, diabetes mellitus (C. is not a direct complication of cystic fibrosis, though people with cystic fibrosis may still develop diabetes due to other factors like genetics or lifestyle."
