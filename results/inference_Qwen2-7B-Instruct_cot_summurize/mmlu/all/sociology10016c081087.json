This shift reflects changes in the nature of work, the roles of technology, and societal structures, with greater emphasis on intellectual labor and the service sector. The other options do not accurately encapsulate Bell's theory:\n\nA. While trade unions have historically played significant roles in industrial societies, Bell's focus is more on the broader economic and social transformations rather than the specific dynamics of labor relations.\nB. This statement contradicts Bell's prediction. He argued that the post-industrial society would see a decline in traditional manufacturing jobs as the economy moved away from physical goods production.\nD. Given the explanation for option C, this choice is incorrect because it does not include all aspects of Bell's theory."
