In this study, Harlow separated baby monkeys from their mothers shortly after birth and provided them with two surrogate mothers: one made of wire with a bottle attached for feedingings (and another made of soft material for comfort and contact. The results showed that while the baby monkeys used the wire mother for feedings, they spent most of their time with the soft mother, seeking comfort and security.\n\nThis experiment demonstrated the critical role of physical contact and proximity to a caregiver during early development, which has implications not only for primate behavior but also for human child development. It suggested that emotional bonds and attachment are are just as important as physiological needs fulfillment for overall well-being and development."
