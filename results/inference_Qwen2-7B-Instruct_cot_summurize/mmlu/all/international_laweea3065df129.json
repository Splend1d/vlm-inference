Obligations under international law prevail over domestic law\n\nCountries cannot rely on their domestic law as an excuse to violate their obligations under international law. International law, particularly treaties and conventions that countries agree to join, often have precedence over conflicting domestic laws. This principle is known as \"pacta sunt servanda,\" which means treaties must be fulfilled in good faith. When there is a conflict between international law and domestic law, the international obligation typically takes precedence.\n\nIt's important to note that the relationship between international law and domestic law can vary depending on the legal system of the country. In some systems, international law is directly incorporated into domestic law, meaning it becomes part of the national legal framework without the need for specific legislative action. In other systems, international law needs to be implemented through domestic legislation before it can take effect within the country."
