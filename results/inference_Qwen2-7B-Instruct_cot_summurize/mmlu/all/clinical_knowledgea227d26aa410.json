One common cause is leakage of effluent (such as stoma output) onto the peristomal skin. This can lead to constant wetness and irritation, which increases the risk of skin damage. \n\nOptions A, B, and D do not typically cause skin excoriation:\n\nA. A well-fitting pouch: While it's generally beneficial for a pouch to fit well, a perfectly snug fit doesn't usually cause skin excoriation unless there are are other issues like excessive pressure or leakage.\n\nB. Changing the pouch every day: Regular pouch changes are are part of good peristomal care and should not cause skin excoriation if done correctly. In fact, it helps prevent skin problems by removing waste products that can irritate the skin.\n\nD. The use of unscented soap to cleanse the skin: Using unscented soap may help avoid irritation from fragrances, but it's more important to ensure the skin is thoroughly cleaned and dried, and that any products used are are hypoallergenic and designed for sensitive skin."
