Low resistance when forward biased, while high resistance when reverse biased.\n\nIn a diode, the forward bias refers to applying a voltage in the direction of the diode's arrow (from the anode to the cathode. Under this condition, the diode conducts electricity efficiently due to the creation of a low resistance path through the p-n junction. On the other hand, during reverse bias, where the voltage is applied from the cathode to the anode, the diode does not conduct electricity well, resulting in a high resistance path."
