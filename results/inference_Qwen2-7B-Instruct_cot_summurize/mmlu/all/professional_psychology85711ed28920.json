Dr. Solo receives a call from his son's teacher who says she would like to begin therapy with him. As an ethical psychologist, Dr. Solo should:\n\nA. tell the teacher that he is ethically prohibited from seeing her because to do so would constitute a multiple (dual) relationship.\nB. begin therapy with her and discuss the potential for conflicts during the initial session and, if necessary, in subsequent sessions.\nC. begin therapy with her but seek consultation if any problems arise.\nD. begin therapy with her but take special precautions to ensure that client confidentiality is maintained.\n"

This situation represents a clear case of a \"multiple\" or \"dual\" relationship, which can compromise the therapeutic relationship and lead to exploitation or harm. The ethical principle most relevant here is **conflict of interest**, which requires psychologists to avoid situations where personal relationships could affect their professional judgment or integrity. Therefore, Dr. Solo should not engage in therapy with his son's teacher under any circumstances."
