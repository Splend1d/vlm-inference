The scoring criteria it includes are primarily focused on aspects that help interpret the psychological state or personality traits of the test-taker. These categories generally encompass:\n\n1. **Content** - This refers to the narrative or story that a person creates when interpreting the inkblots.\n2. **Location** - This criterion looks at where on the page the person directs their attention or draws their responses.\n3. **Process** - This involves how the individual arrives at their interpretation, including any hesitations or difficulties they might have encountered.\n\nThe Exner Scoring System does not explicitly include a category for **Color** as a primary criterion for scoring responses. While color might be noted in the content or process of a response, it is not typically categorized as a separate scoring criterion within the system. Therefore, the correct answer to your question is:\n\nA. Color"
