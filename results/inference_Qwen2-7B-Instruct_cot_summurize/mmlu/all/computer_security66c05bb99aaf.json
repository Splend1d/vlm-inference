                    "text": "A. No string boundary checks in predefined functions: In C and C++, strings are often represented as arrays of characters with a null terminator at the end. Functions that manipulate strings (such as `strcpy`, `strcat`, or `gets` do not inherently perform bounds checking on the destination buffer. If the source string is longer than the destination buffer, it can lead to overwriting memory beyond the allocated space for the buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow.\n\nB. No storage check in the external memory: In C and C++, memory allocation and deallocation is handled manually by the programmer using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`. This manual management means that it's up to the programmer to ensure that they're allocating enough memory and properly freeing it when no longer needed. Failure to do so can result in memory leaks or, if memory is allocated incorrectly, in accessing memory outside of what was intended, potentially leading to buffer overflows.\n\nC. No process power check: This option does not directly relate to buffer overflows in the context of programming languages like C and C++. However, it could refer to security vulnerabilities where an attacker might try to exploit a buffer overflow to gain more control over the system or to execute arbitrary code. This could involve manipulating input to exceed the bounds of a buffer, but it's more about the exploitation rather than a language-specific limitation.\n\nD. No database check: While this option is not directly related to buffer overflows either, it could imply that applications developed in C or C++ that interact with databases might be vulnerable if they don't properly sanitize user inputs or handle data from the database. For instance, SQL injection attacks often exploit vulnerabilities in how applications handle untrusted input, which can lead to unintended execution of commands or access to unauthorized data. However, this issue is more about application-level security practices rather than a fundamental limitation of the C or C++ languages themselves.\n\nIn summary, buffer overflows are primarily a consequence of not properly handling the boundaries of data structures and manually managing resources in languages like C and C++, particularly in the context of string manipulation and memory allocation."
