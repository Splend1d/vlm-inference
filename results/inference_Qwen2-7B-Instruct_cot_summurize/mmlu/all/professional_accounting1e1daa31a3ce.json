According to the problem statement:\n\nPX = $45 ( (price of one share of X)\nPY = $30 ( (price of one share of Y)\n\nX offers 3/4 of a share of its stock for each share of Y. Therefore, if we consider one share of Y, the equivalent amount in terms of shares of X would be (3/4 * PX / PY.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n(3/4 * PX / PY) = (3/4 * $45 / $30) = (3 * $45) / (4 * $30) = $135 / $120 = 1.125\n\nSo, the ratio of the exchange of market prices is 1.125. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1.125."
