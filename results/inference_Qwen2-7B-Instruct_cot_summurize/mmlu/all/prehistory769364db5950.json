This scene symbolizes his coronation or the passing of power to him. The most accurate representation based on the information provided would be:\n\nD. the founder of the dynasty \u201cpassing him the torch.\u201d\n\nThis imagery reflects a common theme in Mesoamerican art where rulers are often depicted receiving their power or authority from a divine source, often a deity or a predecessor. It is a way to legitimize the ruler's right to rule by linking them to a divine lineage."
