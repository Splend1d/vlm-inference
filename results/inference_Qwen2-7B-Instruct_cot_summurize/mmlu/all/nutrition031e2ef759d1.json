Older adults may be more prone to vitamin B12 deficiency because of several factors:\n\nA. **Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor**: This is a glycoprotein produced by the parietal cells in the stomach lining. Intrinsic factor binds to vitamin B12, facilitating its absorption in the ileum (the last part of the small intestine. As people age, the production of intrinsic factor can decrease, leading to reduced absorption of vitamin B12.\n\nB. **Atrophic gastritis**: This is an inflammation of the stomach lining that often occurs with age. It can lead to a decrease in the production of hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, which can impair vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nC. **Helicobacter pylori infection**: This is a type of bacteria that can infect the stomach lining. H. pylori can cause inflammation and ulcers, leading to decreased secretion of intrinsic factor and potentially disrupting vitamin B12 absorption. Although this is less directly related to aging, it is a common issue that can occur at any age, including in older adults.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors can contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults."
