The customer contended that at the time of the mishap, the doors were programmed to swing outward, taking would-be customers entering the store, by surprise. At trial, the customer testified to both the nature of his injuries and the events leading up to their occurrence. The grocery store denied that the doors to its store were in any way unsafe or that the customer's injuries were caused by his encounter with the doors. The customer's sister testified at trial that she accompanied her brother to the store the day of the accident and witnessed the outward swinging doors, which struck him. She further alleged that when she returned to the store the following week, the doors had been re-programmed to swing inward. The trial judge should rule the sister's testimony\n\nA. admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.\nB. admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent.\nC. inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy.\nD. inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations.\n"

This falls under the category of admissions by a party-opponent, which are are generally admissible in court. These admissions can be used against the party who made them, as they may indicate an acknowledgment of liability or a specific state of affairs."
