It is intended to measure the cost of living.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. accurately estimates changes in the cost of living.\n\nIt's important to note that while the CPI is designed to provide an accurate reflection of cost of living changes, it can have limitations and may not perfectly capture all aspects of price changes due to various factors such as substitution bias, quality improvements, and other economic phenomena. However, in general, it serves as a widely accepted and used measure for these purposes."
