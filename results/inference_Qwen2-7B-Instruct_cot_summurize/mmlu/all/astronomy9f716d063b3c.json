He used the difference in the angle of the Sun's rays at two locations, Syene (now Aswan, Egypt, and Alexandria, to calculate the circumference of the Earth. He knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the Sun shone directly into a well in Syene, meaning it was directly overhead. In Alexandria, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of Syene, he measured the angle of the shadow cast by a vertical stick. This angle, which was about 7.2 degrees, represented approximately 1/50th of the Earth's circumference. Using this information, along with the distance between the two cities, he calculated the Earth's circumference to be around 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers), remarkably close to modern values."
