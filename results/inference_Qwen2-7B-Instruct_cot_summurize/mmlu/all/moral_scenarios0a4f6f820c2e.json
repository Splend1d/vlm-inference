Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1 involves using a copier to make duplicates of money, which is considered theft and is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Counterfeiting or creating unauthorized copies of currency is illegal and violates property rights.\n\nScenario 2 involves making small talk while playing cards. This action does not involve any clear violation of laws or ethical principles. Making small talk is generally seen as a polite and social behavior that does not have negative moral implications."
