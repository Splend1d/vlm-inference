All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because while it's true that all moving charges experience a force in an electric field (parallel to the field lines), they do not necessarily experience a force perpendicular to a magnetic field for all scenarios. The force on a moving charge in a magnetic field is actually perpendicular to both the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field, as described by the Lorentz force law. Therefore, option D incorrectly states that the force is perpendicular to the magnetic field for all cases, when in fact, it should be the other way around (the force is perpendicular to the velocity of the charge, not the magnetic field directly."
