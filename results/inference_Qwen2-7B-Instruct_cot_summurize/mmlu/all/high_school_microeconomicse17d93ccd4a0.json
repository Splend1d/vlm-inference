Environmental concerns reduce the yearly amount of timber that can be harvested. \n\nThe supply curve shifts to the left when the quantity supplied decreases at every given price. In this case, if environmental concerns lead to a reduction in the amount of timber that can be harvested, it would limit the resources available for paper production, thus reducing the quantity of paper that can be supplied at any given price. This results in a leftward shift of the supply curve."
