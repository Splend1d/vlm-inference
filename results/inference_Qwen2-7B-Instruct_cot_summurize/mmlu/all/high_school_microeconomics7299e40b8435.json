Free riders: This refers to the fact that individuals can consume a public good without having to pay for it, which is one of the reasons why the market may fail to provide public goods efficiently.\n\nII. Adding demand curves vertically to find the demand curve for society: This is a method used to aggregate individual demand for a public good into a societal demand curve. Each individual's demand curve is shifted upward by the amount they are willing to pay for the public good, and these shifted curves are then summed up to get the total societal demand.\n\nIII. Nonrivalry in consumption: This means that one person's consumption of the good does not reduce the amount available for others. For example, if you watch a fireworks display, this does not prevent me from watching it as well.\n\nIV. Nonexcludability: This means that it is impossible or very difficult to exclude people who do not pay for the good from consuming it. \n\nTherefore, all of these (I, II, III, and IV - are characteristics associated with public goods. The correct answer is D."
