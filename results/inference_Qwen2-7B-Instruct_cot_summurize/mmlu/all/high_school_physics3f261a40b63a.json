If two objects collide and the force applied is the same ( (which we assume to be the case since no specific forces are mentioned), then the object with less mass will have a greater acceleration than the one with more mass, as long as there are no external forces changing the direction of motion.\n\nGiven that the truck's mass is double the car's mass, if they experience the same force during the collision, the car will accelerate at twice the rate of the truck because it has less mass. Thus, the acceleration of the car will be half the magnitude of the acceleration of the truck ( (since \\(a_{car} = 2a_{truck}\\) given \\(m_{car} = \\frac{1}{2}m_{truck}\\)), and in the same direction ( assuming both are moving in the same direction before or after the collision, due to conservation of momentum and the lack of information suggesting otherwise."
