In this case, since both populations are relatively small and isolated, the random loss or fixation of alleles (A1 or A2) could occur, leading to genetic variation within each population. The fact that all individuals in each population have homozygous genotypes (A1A1 for population 1 and A2A2 for population 2, indicates low genetic diversity within each population. The observed genetic variation here would be mostly likely due to genetic drift, as the other options ( gene flow, disruptive selection, and discrete variation - do not fit the scenario described. Gene flow would involve exchange of genes between populations, which isn't happening, and disruptive selection and discrete variation refer to specific evolutionary processes that are not applicable based on the information provided."
