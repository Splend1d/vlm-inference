After he lets go, the puck continues to travel across the table, coming to rest at position x = 1.2 m. When the puck is at position x = 1.0 m, which of the following is a correct assertion about the net force on the puck?\n\nA. The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.\nB. The net force is down, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 downward.\nC. The net force is in the positive direction, because the student\u2019s push caused the puck to speed up in the positive direction.\nD. The net force is zero, because the student\u2019s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.\n"

The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.\n\nWhen an object slows down while moving in a particular direction, it means that there is a force acting against its motion in that direction. In this case, the puck is moving to the right (positive direction, but it's slowing down, indicating that a force in the negative direction (opposing its motion) is acting on it. This could be due to friction or other resistive forces."
