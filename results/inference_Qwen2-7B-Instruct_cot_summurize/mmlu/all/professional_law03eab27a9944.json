Late one night, the two men broke into the warehouse and proceeded to load the large crates of defibrillators onto their truck. As they were leaving, one of the men inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a refuse pile of old cardboard boxes and papers. Soon afterward, the refuse ignited into a small fire. Although the men had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, they did not do so. Instead, they fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames. If the defendant is later charged as a co-conspirator, in all likelihood he would be held responsible as\n\nA. an accessory before the fact.\nB. a principal in the second degree.\nC. an accomplice.\nD. not respbnsible.\n"

In this case, the defendant provided information about the location of the defibrillators, which facilitated the crime committed by the two men. However, since the defendant did not actually break into the warehouse or participate in the theft, the charge of being a principal in the second degree acknowledges the defendant's role in the conspiracy while not holding them to the same level of responsibility as someone who directly participated in the commission of the crime."
