At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal. Is the evidence offered admissible?\n\nA. No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.\nB. No, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit.\nC. Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.\n"

Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nExplanation: The learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule allows for certain types of information contained within books, treatises, or compilations that have been recognized as reliable sources of information to be admitted into evidence. This is typically used when the information is factual, well-known, and generally accepted within a particular field. In this case, the prosecutor can offer the excerpts from the medical treatise as evidence, assuming they meet the criteria for being considered a \"learned treatise\" under applicable law.\n\nThe other options do not accurately reflect the legal standards for admitting such evidence:\n\nA. The fact that the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert does not automatically disqualify them from being admitted under the learned treatise exception. While expert testimony might be necessary in some cases to authenticate the treatise or explain its contents, the exception does not require it.\n\nB. While the treatise itself must be introduced into evidence, this is not the only requirement for the learned treatise exception. The content of the treatise must also be relevant and fall within the scope of what is considered a learned treatise.\n\nD. The lethal nature of the substance may be relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent, but this relevance does not necessarily make the treatise excerpts admissible under the learned treatise exception. The exception applies to the content of the treatise itself, not just its relevance to the case."
