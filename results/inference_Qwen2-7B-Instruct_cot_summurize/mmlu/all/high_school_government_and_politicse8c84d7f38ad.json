This setup encourages a balance of perspectives in formulating and enforcing regulations. \n\nOption B, while it may involve cooperation, doesn't necessarily insulate the agencies from political influence as it still requires coordination with Congress, which can be politically influenced.\n\nOption C, requiring reapplication for funding each year, could create an environment where the agency's decisions are heavily influenced by the need to secure funding, potentially compromising its independence.\n\nOption D, having all planned policy changes submitted to the President for approval, would significantly undermine the independence of these agencies as it would subject their actions to presidential discretion, potentially leading to political interference."
