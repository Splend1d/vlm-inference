A restaurant owner purchased food stamps from an undercover federal agent several times for a price below face value. At trial, the judge refused to charge the jury that this was a specific intent crime requiring proof that the defendant knew that he was acting illegally. The government urged that no mens rea, or \"evil-meaning mind\" had to be proved. The court simply told the jury that \"knowingly\" means that the Defendant realized what he was doing, and did not act through ignorance, mistake, or accident. The owner was convicted and appealed. What will the federal appellate court likely decide regarding the lower court's interpretation of the criminal intent required under the statute?\n\nA. Some statutes are written without the need to prove any particular mens rea, and this statute appears to be one of them, making the court's instructions appropriate.\nB. Where all that is available regarding intent is the use of the word \"knowingly\", the prosecution must at least prove that the defendant knew his conduct to be unauthorized by statute or regulations.\nC. This is a strict liability crime that requires no proof of criminal knowledge or specific criminal intent.\nD. The prosecution must prove that the defendant had specific knowledge of the precise provisions of the federal food stamp law and the specific actions that were prohibited.\n"

Where all that is available regarding intent is the use of the word \"knowingly\", the prosecution must at least prove that the defendant knew his conduct to be unauthorized by statute or regulations**.\n\nIn interpreting criminal statutes, courts generally require some form of mens rea ( or \"guilty mind.\" When a statute uses the term \"knowingly,\" it typically implies that the prosecution must prove that the defendant was aware that their actions were unauthorized by statute or regulation. The lower court's instruction that the defendant merely needed to realize what they were doing and not act through ignorance, mistake, or accident is insufficient for a conviction on a knowing violation of the statute. \n\nThus, the federal appellate court would likely find that the lower court erred in its instruction to the jury, as it did not properly align with the requirement to prove that the defendant knew their actions were unauthorized under the statute or regulations. The prosecution should have been required to show that the defendant knew their conduct violated the law, not just that they were aware of their actions."
