Interval\n\nInterval recording is particularly useful for behaviors that don't have distinct onsets or offsets, such as fidgeting, talking out of turn, or daydreaming. This method involves noting the behavior whenever it occurs within a set time interval, making it suitable for capturing behaviors that may not always be immediately identifiable as starting or stop points. It allows for tracking the frequency of these behaviors over time without the need to pinpoint exact moments when they begin and end."
