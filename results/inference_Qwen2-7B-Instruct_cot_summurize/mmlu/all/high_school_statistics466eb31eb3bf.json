A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. A value of 0 indicates no linear correlation.\n\nIn this scenario, the number of hours students studied for the first exam and the number of hours they studied for the second exam are perfectly positively correlated because every student studied exactly 10 hours for the second exam. This means there is a perfect positive linear relationship between the two variables.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1"
