I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nThe Puritans believed that the freedom to practice religion should be extended to\n\nA.

Williams seems to argue against the imposition of a particular religion, worship style, ministry, oaths, tithes, times, days, marriage practices, and burial rites mandated by the civil state. This suggests that he was in favor of allowing individuals the freedom to choose their own religious practices without interference from civil authorities.\n\nGiven this context, the most appropriate answer choice would be:\n\nC. all Christians only\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is an interpretation based on the text provided, which focuses on religious freedom for Christians. The other options presented (A, B, and D, seem too restrictive, suggesting that Williams' views were more inclusive than those choices indicate. If the intention of the question is to find the most accurate representation of Williams' stance given the text, option C might be the closest, but it still falls short of capturing the full breadth of his beliefs. Williams' actual stance could be broader than just allowing freedom to \"all Christians\" due to his apparent disregard for the distinction between different Christian denominations and his criticism of imposing any religious practices by the civil state."
