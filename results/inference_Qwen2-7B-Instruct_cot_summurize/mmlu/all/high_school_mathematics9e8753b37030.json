                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of arithmetic sequences and how they relate to the sum of odd numbers.\n\nThe sum \\(S\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:\n\\[S = \\frac{n}{2} [2a + ( (n-1)d]\\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the number of terms.\n\nFor consecutive odd integers, the common difference \\(d\\) is 2. The sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is given by the formula:\n\\[S = n^2\\]\n\nGiven that the sum of the sequence is 240, we have:\n\\[n^2 = 240\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\\[n = \\sqrt{240}\\]\n\nSince \\(n\\) must be an integer, let's find the nearest perfect squares around 240:\n\n- \\(15^2 = 225\\)\n- \\(16^2 = 256\\)\n\nThus, the only integer value of \\(n\\) that makes sense in this context is \\(n = 15\\), as it is the closest integer value to \\(\\sqrt{240}\\) that would yield a sum close to but not exceeding 240 when squaring.\n\nHowever, this approach directly addresses finding a sequence that sums to 240 without considering all possible sequences of odd integers that meet this criterion. Let's correct the approach to directly address the question with the understanding that we're looking for sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240.\n\nGiven the sum of an arithmetic sequence of odd numbers (which can be simplified to \\(n^2 = 240\\) for a direct count of such sequences where each term is an odd number (not necessarily starting from the smallest odd number), we need to adjust our understanding based on the original question's intent, which seems to focus on sequences of consecutive odd integers, not necessarily starting from 1.\n\nLet's reframe our approach considering sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240. The key here is recognizing that the sum of an arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers (starting from \\(a\\) and having \\(n\\) terms, follows the pattern where each term increases by 2 ( (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...). \n\nFor any sequence of consecutive odd integers, the sum can be represented as:\n\\[S = n^2\\]\nThis comes from the fact that the sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is \\(n^2\\).\n\nSo, solving for \\(n\\) in \\(n^2 = 240\\):\n\\[n = \\sqrt{240}\\]\n\\[n \u2248 15.49\\]\n\nSince \\(n\\) must be an integer and represent the number of terms in the sequence, and knowing that \\(15^2 < 240 < 16^2\\), we conclude that there are are exactly 15 terms in the sequence if it were starting from the first odd number (1. However, the question implies considering sequences starting from any odd number, not just the first one.\n\nThe key insight is realizing that for any sequence of consecutive odd integers summing to 240, the number of sequences isn't directly tied to the square root calculation but rather to identifying all valid starting points and lengths that fit within the constraint. \n\nGiven the nature of odd numbers and their sequential addition, the number of sequences (not the length of each sequence) that sum up to 240 is actually dependent on how we interpret \"consecutive odd integers\" and \"sequences\". If we consider the direct interpretation of \"sum to 240\" and apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, the question might have been intended to explore the number of ways to reach this sum, considering the constraints on the sequence's length and starting point.\n\nRevisiting the problem statement and considering the typical approach to solving such problems involving sequences and sums, it's clear that my initial explanation inadvertently focused too much on the direct application of formulas related to odd numbers without fully addressing the question's nuances about \"sequences\" and \"consecutive odd integers.\"\n\nGiven the clarification needed, let\u2019s refine the approach considering the essence of the question:\n\nTo find the number of arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240, we should think more about the possible sequences rather than directly applying the square root concept as initially done. \n\nThe correct approach should involve recognizing that for a sum of 240, the number of sequences can be determined by considering the factors of 240 that could potentially represent the number of terms in a sequence of consecutive odd integers (since the sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is \\(n^2\\), but does not directly translate to finding"
