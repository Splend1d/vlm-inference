He has a 15-year career history of sandblasting old buildings. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. The patient is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 94/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. On physical examination he is in moderately severe distress with pursed lips and cyanotic nail beds. Chest has an increased anteroposterior diameter. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered wheezes and rhonchi over all lung fields. Cardiac examination discloses muffled heart sounds and an S4. Fingers are clubbed. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs, flattened diaphragm, large, irregular opacities in the upper lobes, and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?\n\nA. Azathioprine therapy\nB. Bronchoscopy\nC. Continuous humidified oxygen\nD. Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n"

The presence of brownish-yellow sputum indicates chronic bronchitis, which is a hallmark of COPD. The patient also exhibits signs of respiratory distress, including pursed-lipped breathing and cyanosis.\n\nGiven the severity of his condition and the findings on the chest X-ray ( such as hyperinlated lungs, flattened diaphragm, large, irregular opacities in the upper lobes, and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes, it's likely that he has emphysema and/or bronchiectasis, which are are common in advanced COPD.\n\nConsidering the options provided:\n\nA. Azathioprine therapy: This is not typically used in the treatment of COPD. It is an immunosuppressant used in the management of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, not for COPD specifically.\n\nB. Bronchoscopy: While bronchoscopy can be useful for diagnosing or treating certain conditions, in this case, given the patient's presentation and the suspicion of advanced COPD, it might not be the primary intervention. However, it could potentially be used for further diagnosis if needed, especially to look for complications such as infection or bronchiectasis.\n\nC. Continuous humidified oxygen: This is often recommended for patients with COPD who have difficulty maintaining adequate oxygen saturation levels, especially those with severe respiratory failure. Given the patient's low oxygen saturation of 70% on room air, this would be an appropriate intervention to improve oxygenation and reduce symptoms of hypoxia.\n\nD. Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): This is typically used for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), not directly related to COPD. However, some patients with COPD may also have OSA, and CPAP could help manage that aspect of their condition, but it's not a primary intervention for COPD itself.\n\nGiven the context and the severity of the patient's condition, the most appropriate intervention based on the information provided would likely be **C. Continuous humidified oxygen** to address the immediate issue of low oxygen saturation. However, the actual treatment plan should be determined by a healthcare professional considering the full clinical picture and other potential interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation, bronchodilators, and possibly long-term oxygen therapy if required."
