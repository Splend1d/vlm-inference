It describes a process that creates estimates that are too high on average or too low on average.\n\nBias refers to systematic errors in statistical analysis or data collection that cause the results to be consistently skewed in one direction. This means that the estimates derived from the data will tend to be either consistently higher or lower than the true value, rather than being centered around it. \n\nB. Describes sampling bias, which occurs when the sample does not accurately reflect the characteristics of the population due to some non-random aspect of how the sample was selected. \n\nC. Describes a lack of randomization, which can lead to bias if certain groups are systematically more likely to be included or excluded from the study.\n\nD. Describes non-representative samples, which is a symptom of bias but does not fully capture what bias means in the context of statistics and research methodology. Bias specifically refers to the systematic error, not just the lack of representativeness."
