He believed that humans have the ability to choose between good and evil. However, regarding your question, Augustine's views on human error are not as clearly defined by a single statement like \"we can never err\" under specific conditions. His works do discuss the nature of human actions and their consequences, but he did not provide a precise formulation of options A, B, C, or D.\n\nIn general, Augustine taught that humans often err due to sin, which is a consequence of the fall of humanity into original sin. This suggests that he might lean towards viewing human error as primarily connected to wickedness ( Option C. However, it's important to note that Augustine's thoughts on this topic were complex and nuanced, and they evolved over time. He also recognized that ignorance can lead to error (Option B, and that temptations from the devil and the world can influence human decisions, though these would be understood within the context of human free will and responsibility.\n\nGiven the complexity and depth of Augustine's thought, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact answer that matches one of the options you've provided without delving deeper into his extensive writings. For a more precise understanding, one would need to study his texts on free will, sin, and the human condition."
