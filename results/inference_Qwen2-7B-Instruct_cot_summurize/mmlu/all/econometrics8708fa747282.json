(i), (ii), and (iii).\n\nLet's break down why each of these points is an advantage of using panel data:\n\n(i) **The use of panel data can increase the number of degrees of freedom and therefore the power of tests:** Panel data, which combines cross-sectional and time-series data, provides more information than either pure cross-sectional or pure time-series data alone. This additional information increases the degrees of freedom in statistical tests, leading to more powerful tests that are better able to detect true effects.\n\n(ii) **The use of panel data allows the average value of the dependent variable to vary either cross-sectionally or over time or both:** Panel data allows for the analysis of how the average outcome changes across different entities (over time (or both). This flexibility enables researchers to study dynamic relationships and trends that might not be observable with pure cross-sectional or time-series data.\n\n(iii) **The use of panel data enables the researcher allows the estimated relationship between the independent and dependent variables to vary either cross-sectionally or over time or both:** Panel data allows for the examination of heterogeneous effects, meaning that the relationship between independent and dependent variables might differ across entities (or change over time. This capability is crucial for understanding complex phenomena where relationships are not constant.\n\nTherefore, all three statements represent valid advantages of using panel data over pure cross-sectional or pure time-series modeling."
