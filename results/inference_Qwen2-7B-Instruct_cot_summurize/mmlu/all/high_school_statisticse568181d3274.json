The 25th percentile is also known as the first quartile (Q1.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 45 g\n- Standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 4 g\n\nWe can use the z-score formula to find the corresponding value for the 25th percentile:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the value we want to find, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFor the 25th percentile, the z-score corresponding to this percentile in a standard normal distribution is approximately -0.64 ( (since 25% of the data falls below this point in a normal distribution).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ -0.64 = \\frac{X - 45}{4} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(X\\):\n\n\\[ X = -0.64 \\times 4 + 45 \\]\n\\[ X = -2.56 + 45 \\]\n\\[ X = 42.44 \\]\n\nSo, the mass of egg that would be the 25th percentile of the masses of all the eggs is approximately 42.44 g.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\n\nC. 42.4 g"
