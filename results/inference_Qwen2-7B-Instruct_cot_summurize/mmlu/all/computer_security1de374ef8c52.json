In symmetric-key cryptography, both parties must securely share the same secret key in advance, which can be challenging and potentially insecure. With public-key cryptography, each party has a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be freely shared without compromising security, while the private key remains secret. This eliminates the need for a secure channel to exchange the key.\n\nWhile public-key cryptography may have some disadvantages compared to symmetric-key cryptography (such as slower encryption speed and larger key sizes), its ability to simplify key exchange makes it a valuable tool in many cryptographic applications."
