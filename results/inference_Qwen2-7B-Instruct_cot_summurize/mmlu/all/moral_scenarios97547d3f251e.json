While it might be seen as irresponsible if it's causing harm or neglecting important responsibilities, it's not inherently immoral unless there are specific circumstances that make it so ( for example, if it's leading to addiction and causing significant harm to oneself or others.\n\nIn scenario 2, engaging in sexual activity with a corpse is clearly morally wrong and illegal in the US as of 2020. This act violates fundamental ethical principles concerning respect for human dignity and the sanctity of life, and it's against laws that protect individuals from exploitation and ensure respect for the dead.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 1 is not morally wrong while scenario 2 is morally wrong."
