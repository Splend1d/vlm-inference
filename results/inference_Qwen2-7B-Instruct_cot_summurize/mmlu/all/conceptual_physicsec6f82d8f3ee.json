The formula to calculate the average molecular speed (v_avg is:\n\n\\[ v_{avg} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8RT}{\\pi M}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( R \\) is the ideal gas constant,\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin,\n- \\( M \\) is the molar mass of the gas.\n\nAmong hydrogen ( H2 (molar mass = 2 g/mol), oxygen O2 (molar mass = 32 g/mol), and nitrogen N2 (molar mass = 28 g/mol), hydrogen has the smallest molar mass. Thus, it will have the highest average speed at the same temperature as it takes less energy for hydrogen molecules to move compared to oxygen or nitrogen molecules. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Hydrogen."
