Toward the end of the seventh year of the term, a violent storm blew off several of the roof shingles. The tenant noticed a leak through the roof where the shingles had blown off, but didn't make any repairs. A month later, a severe rain storm occurred and water leaked through the roof, causing damage to the valuable parquet floors in the two rooms below. In a subsequent proceeding by the landlord against the tenant to recover for the damage to the parquet floors resulting from the leak, liability would most likely be imposed upon\n\nA. the landlord, because he was under an implied obligation to keep the premises in a habitable condition.\nB. the landlord, because he was under an affirmative obligation to deliver the premises in a reasonable state of repair.\nC. the landlord, because of the contractual obligation under the lease to make all necessary repairs during the term of the lease.\nD. the tenant, because a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property.\n"
