True, False\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is true because ImageNet is known to contain images of various resolutions, as it was designed to be a large and diverse dataset for machine learning tasks.\nStatement 2 is false because, in reality, ImageNet typically contains far more images than the Caltech-101 dataset. ImageNet has over 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 has around 9,298 images, focusing on fine-grained visual categorization."
