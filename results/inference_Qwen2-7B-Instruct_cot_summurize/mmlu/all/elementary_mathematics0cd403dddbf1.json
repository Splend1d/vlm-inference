Let's denote the total number of coins in her collection as \\(X\\).\n\nGiven that 7 coins make up 5% of her collection, we can write this relationship as:\n\\[7 = 0.05 \\times X\\]\n\nSolving for \\(X\\) involves dividing both sides by 0.05:\n\\[X = \\frac{7}{0.05} = 140\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of coins in Kate's coin collection is 140.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 140."
