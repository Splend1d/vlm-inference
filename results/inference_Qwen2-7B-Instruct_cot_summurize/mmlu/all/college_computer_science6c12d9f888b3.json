For each type of interconnection of n processors, a figure of merit can be formed as the product of the number of links required for the network times the worst-case path length connecting any two processors. The ratio of this figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network, for even n > 2, is\n\nA. 1/(n^2)\nB. 1/(n(n-1))\nC. 1/n\nD. (n-1)/n\n"

Thus, each processor has \\(n-1\\) connections. However, since each connection involves two processors, the total number of links is \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\).\n- **Worst-Case Path Length**: In a fully connected network, the maximum distance between any two nodes is always 1, because any two nodes are directly connected by a link.\n- **Figure of Merit**: The product of the number of links and the worst-case path length is \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\).\n\n### Ring Network:\n- **Number of Links**: Each processor is connected to exactly two others, forming a circular structure. Hence, there are are exactly \\(n\\) links in a ring network.\n- **Worst-Case Path Length**: In a ring network, the longest path between any two nodes is \\(n/2\\) if \\(n\\) is even ( (since you can go either clockwise or counterclockwise to reach any node). If \\(n\\) is odd, it's not directly applicable here but doesn't change the fundamental calculation for even \\(n\\).\n- **Figure of Merit**: The product of the number of links and the worst-case path length is \\(n \\times \\frac{n}{2} = \\frac{n^2}{2}\\).\n\n### Ratio Calculation:\nThe ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}{\\frac{n^2}{2}} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{n^2} = \\frac{n-1}{n}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. \\((n-1)/n\\)**."
