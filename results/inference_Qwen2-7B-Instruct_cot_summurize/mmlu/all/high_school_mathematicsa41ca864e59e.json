The GCD will give us the largest number that divides both 120 and 40 without leaving a remainder. Then, we can determine how many positive divisors this GCD has.\n\nLet's start by finding the prime factorization of both numbers:\n\n- \\(120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n- \\(40 = 2^3 \\times 5\\)\n\nThe GCD is found by taking the lowest power of each common prime factor:\n- Common prime factors are 2 and 5.\n- The lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is \\(2^3\\) and for 5 it is \\(5^1\\).\n\nThus, the GCD of 120 and 40 is \\(2^3 \\times 5 = 8 \\times 5 = 40\\).\n\nNow, let's find the number of positive divisors of 40. To do this, we use the formula for finding the total number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization. If \\(n = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{a_k}\\), then the total number of divisors of \\(n\\) is given by \\((a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\ldots ( (a_k + 1)\\).\n\nFor 40, the prime factorization is \\(2^3 \\times 5^1\\). Thus, the total number of divisors is \\((3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n\nTherefore, there are 8 positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 8**."
