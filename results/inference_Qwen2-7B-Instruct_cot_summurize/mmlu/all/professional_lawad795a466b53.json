Hundreds of tourists poured into the area to work on the large block of ice. They made a gigantic ice palace for a variety of Disney princesses. To handle the needs of a great number of tourists, food vendors came from all over and set up their carts. To solve the problem of congestion, safety, and insufficient security, the town passed an ordinance restricting all street vendors to a specified parking lot area. The food vendors and others were losing money under the regulation. Would a commerce clause challenge to the parking lot requirement be successful by the food stand owners?\n\nA. No, because there is a legitimate state or local interest here which is promoted by an even-handed procedure to control the flow of traffic for public safety, and the impact on commerce is incidental.\nB. No, because the food stands do not have a significant commerce clause claim in that they are still able to sell food, and what they do does not affect interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the state is interfering with the food cart owners' legitimate business operations, which impact heavily on interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because the local interest is favored in a discriminatory manner against all of the food cart owners from other states.\n"

No, because there is a legitimate state or local interest here which is promoted by an even-handed procedure to control the flow of traffic for public safety, and the impact on commerce is incidental.\n\nThe Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power \"To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" However, this power is not absolute and can be limited by the states through reasonable regulations that serve important state interests, such as public safety.\n\nIn this scenario, the town's ordinance restricting street vendors to a specific parking lot area appears to be designed to manage traffic congestion, ensure public safety, and provide adequate security for the large number of tourists visiting the ice palace. These are all legitimate local interests. The fact that the regulation may negatively impact the food vendors is an incidental effect rather than a purposeful discrimination against interstate commerce. \n\nCourts generally uphold such regulations if they are not discriminatory and are rationally related to a legitimate local public health, safety, welfare, or general economic concern. Therefore, unless the food vendors can show that the regulation is discriminatory (for instance, if the town had a policy excluding food vendors from the lot but allowed only local vendors to operate elsewhere without restriction, then option D might suggest a more favorable outcome for the vendors. However, based solely on the information provided, the most plausible answer leans towards A."
