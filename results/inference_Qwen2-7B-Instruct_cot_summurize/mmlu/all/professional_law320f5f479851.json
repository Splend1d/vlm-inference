The parents of two students who attend a public high school in the state sue for a declaratory judgment and injunction in federal court, claiming that the state statute violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment. Assume that the federal court decides to hear the case on its merits. Which of the following is the state's LEAST persuasive argument for sustaining the validity of the statute?\n\nA. The state statute benefits the parents or guardians of all the children in private schools, religious and nonreligious.\nB. The primary effect of the state statute is not to advance or inhibit religion.\nC. The administration of the state statute by the department of education does not foster excessive governmental entanglement with religion.\nD. The state statute is a valid exercise of state regulatory action in the field of education.\n"

The state statute benefits the parents or guardians of all the children in private schools, religious and nonreligious.\n\nWhile this argument might seem appealing because it suggests a neutral benefit to all, it does not address the core issue of the Establishment Clause which concerns whether the government has impermissibly favored one religion over another or promoted religion generally. The fact that the benefit goes to both religious and non-religious institutions does not automatically resolve the constitutional concerns about the purpose or effect of the law.\n\nThe other options ( B, C, and D, each touch on critical aspects of the Establishment Clause analysis:\n\nB addresses the principle that laws should not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, which is a key consideration under the Lemon Test used by courts to evaluate such statutes.\n\nC discusses the potential for excessive entanglement between church and state, which is another factor considered under the Lemon Test, indicating that government actions should not lead to ongoing, extensive, and potentially compromising interactions with religious entities.\n\nD points to the state's authority to regulate education within its jurisdiction, which could be argued as a legitimate secular function of government that does not necessarily involve an impermissible endorsement of religion."
