The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by all the partners in the partnership.**\n\nHere's how the tax treatment works based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Acre's Initial Contribution:** Acre contributes land with a fair market value of $100,000 and a tax basis of $60,000. This means Acre has a built-in capital gain at contribution time of $40,000 ($100,000 FMV - $60,000 basis).\n\n2. **Sale of Land:** The land is sold for $160,000. This results in a total gain of $60,000 ($160,000 sales price - $100,000 FMV).\n\n3. **Allocation of Gain:** According to the partnership agreement, gains and losses are are shared equally among the partners. However, there's also a specific rule about the built-in gain from Acre's contribution.\n\n   - **First $40,000:** This portion of the gain is allocated to Acre because it represents the built-in gain that Acre had at the time of contribution. This allocation does not trigger any taxable event for Acre at this stage, as it's simply recognizing the gain that was already present in the property.\n   \n   - **Remaining Gain:** After allocating the first $40,000 to Acre, the remaining $20,000 ($60,000 total gain - $40,000 allocated to Acre) is then shared equally among all three partners (since they share profits and losses equally according to the partnership agreement. This means each partner gets an additional $6,666.67 ($20,000 / 3).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, which accurately reflects the tax treatment described above."
