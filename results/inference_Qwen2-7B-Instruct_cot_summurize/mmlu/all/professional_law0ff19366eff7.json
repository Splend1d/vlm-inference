Summary judgment can be entered only after all discovery has been completed.\nB. Motion for summary judgment is the proper motion on the ground that plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action.\nC. Since both parties have filed summary judgment motions that assert there are no genuine issues of material fact, summary judgment for plaintiff or defendant will be granted.\nD.

Since both parties have filed summary judgment motions asserting there are no genuine issues of material fact, summary judgment for plaintiff or defendant will be granted.\n\nExplanation:\n- A. This statement is incorrect because a court may enter summary judgment before the completion of discovery if it determines that there are are no genuine issues of material fact.\n- B. This statement is also incorrect because a motion for summary judgment is not specifically used to argue that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action; rather, it is used to argue that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n- C. This statement is correct. When both parties file motions for summary judgment, the court reviews the evidence submitted by each side to determine if there are any genuine issues of material fact that need to be resolved by a jury or judge. If neither side has presented evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find for the opposing party (i.e., if there are no genuine issues of material fact), then the court may grant summary judgment in favor of one party or the other.\n- D. This statement is incorrect because it implies that if the plaintiff's proof is not contradicted, summary judgment will automatically be granted, regardless of whether there are any genuine issues of material fact. The court must still consider whether there are any genuine issues of material fact before granting summary judgment."
