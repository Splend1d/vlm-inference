As long as Timmy has at least one supportive and accepting caregiver he will have a healthy development.\n\nTimmy's development is more likely to be characterized by having a healthy development if he has at least one supportive and accepting caregiver, regardless of whether that caregiver is Darla or Janice. The gender of the caregiver(s) does not directly determine how Timmy will develop socially, emotionally, or otherwise. What matters most is the level of support, acceptance, and nurturing provided by the caregivers. \n\nIt's important to note that a child's development is influenced by many factors, including but not limited to, family structure, environment, interactions with peers, and personal interests and experiences. The options A, B, and D suggest assumptions that are not necessarily supported by research on child development and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes."
