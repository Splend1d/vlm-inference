This virus was named the Rous Sarcoma Virus ((RSV). They found that when the viral RNA was injected into healthy chickens, it could cause tumors. Further experiments showed that this virus contained a unique enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which allows the virus to convert its RNA genome into DNA, which can then integrate into the host cell's genome. This process of using RNA as a template to create DNA is what defines retroviruses, hence the name \"retrovirus\". The discovery of RSV was pivotal in understanding how viruses can cause cancer and laid the foundation for the field of virology."
