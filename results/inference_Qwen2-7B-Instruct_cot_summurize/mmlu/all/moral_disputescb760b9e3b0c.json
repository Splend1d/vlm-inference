Hardin, an environmental scientist, is known for his concept of the \"tragedy of the commons,\" which he used to argue that unregulated use of shared resources can lead to depletion and failure. In the context of world hunger and poverty, Hardin suggests that high population growth rates ( or reproduction rates - can strain resources such as food, water, and land, leading to scarcity and increased poverty. This argument emphasizes the need for sustainable resource management and potentially for population control measures to alleviate these issues."
