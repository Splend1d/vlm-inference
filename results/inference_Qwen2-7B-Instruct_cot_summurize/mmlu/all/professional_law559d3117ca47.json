The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.\nB. The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\nC. The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.\nD. The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.\n"

The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSince the preferred stock is non-voting, the common shareholders cannot approve actions that affect the rights or preferences of the preferred shareholders without their consent. In this case, only 400 preferred shareholders voted in favor, which is less than the required majority (in this case, at least 501 preferred shares since there are 1,000 preferred shares in total. Therefore, the proposal did not receive the necessary approval from the preferred shareholders."
