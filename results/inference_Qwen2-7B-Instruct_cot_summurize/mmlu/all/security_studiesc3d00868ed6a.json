By regarding the state as the most important actor, constructivism neglects internationalization in a globalized world.\n\nThis statement is not a widely articulated or valid criticism of constructivism. While it is true that constructivism places significant emphasis on the role of states and their interests, it does not necessarily neglect internationalization. Constructivism argues that state identities and interests are socially constructed through interactions, which can evolve over time and be influenced by non-state actors, transnational processes, and globalization. Therefore, this perspective does not inherently deny the importance of internationalization; rather, it offers a different way of understanding how international relations are shaped by social constructs."
