This figure was part of a broader statistic indicating that about 35.7% of adults were obese, with a BMI of 30.0 or higher. The total percentage of adults who were either overweight or obese would thus be closer to 72.7%, which is significantly more than any of the options provided.\n\nGiven the options you've listed, none directly match this detailed breakdown, but option C (40% represents the approximate percentage of adults who were considered overweight according to the CDC's data from around that time. It's crucial to note that these percentages can vary based on different studies and updates in health statistics."
