Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens\n\nAcne is often associated with increased androgen levels during adolescence, which can stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum ( oil. This increase in sebum production can lead to clogged pores and subsequent acne formation. The other options listed do not directly explain the typical hormonal changes that contribute to adolescent acne."
