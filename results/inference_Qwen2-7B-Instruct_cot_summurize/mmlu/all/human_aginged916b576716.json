Alzheimer's: There has been an increase in awareness and recognition of Alzheimer's as a major health issue, partly because of improved diagnosis methods, not necessarily an increase in incidence.\n- B. Cancer: While cancer is a broad category that includes various types, it is generally recognized that there has been an increase in cancer-related deaths due to various factors including aging populations, lifestyle changes, and improvements in cancer detection.\n- C. Cardiovascular diseases: There has been a decrease in cardiovascular disease mortality rates globally due to advances in medical treatments, lifestyle changes, and preventative care measures.\n- D. Homicide: This can vary significantly by region and time period, but generally, homicide rates have been declining in many developed countries due to improved law enforcement and societal changes.\n\nWithout specific data, it's challenging to definitively state which one has seen a \"huge\" increase over the last decade or two. However, cancer is often mentioned in discussions about rising death rates due to its complexity, variety of forms, and the ongoing battle against new treatments and understanding of the disease. For the most accurate information, consulting the latest global health statistics from reliable sources would be advisable."
