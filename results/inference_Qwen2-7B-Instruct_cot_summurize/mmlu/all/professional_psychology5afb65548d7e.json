It is indeed used when there is one Independent Variable (IV) with more than two levels (or groups). The levels refer to the different categories or conditions of the IV.\n\nSo, for instance, if you're testing the effect of different teaching methods ( which would be your IV - on student performance, and you have three different teaching methods, then you'd use One-Way ANOVA to see if there's a significant difference in the mean scores of the students across these different teaching methods. \n\nB, C, and D are incorrect because they involve more than one independent variable (which would require a Two-Way ANOVA or higher, not a One-Way ANOVA."
