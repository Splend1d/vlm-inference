Since we're only constructing three sides of the rectangle with the fence, we can express the total length of the fence, \\(x\\), as:\n\n\\[2W + L = x\\]\n\nWe want to maximize the area \\(A\\) of the rectangle, which is given by:\n\n\\[A = L \\times W\\]\n\nFirst, let's solve for one of the variables in terms of the other using our equation for the perimeter of the three sides:\n\n\\[L = x - 2W\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(L\\) in the area formula:\n\n\\[A = (x - 2W) \\times W = xW - 2W^2\\]\n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(W\\) and set it equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n\\[\\frac{dA}{dW} = x - 4W = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(W\\):\n\n\\[4W = x\\]\n\\[W = \\frac{x}{4}\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(W\\) back into the equation for \\(L\\):\n\n\\[L = x - 2(\\frac{x}{4}) = x - \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{x}{2}\\]\n\nSo, the dimensions that maximize the area are when the width \\(W\\) is \\(\\frac{x}{4}\\) and the length \\(L\\) is \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\).\n\nThe maximum area \\(A\\) is then:\n\n\\[A = L \\times W = \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right) = \\frac{x^2}{8}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. \\(x^2/8\\)**."
