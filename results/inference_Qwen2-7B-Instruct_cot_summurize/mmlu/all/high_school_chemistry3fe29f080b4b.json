CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-.\n\nResonance in chemistry refers to the depiction of a molecule as having two or more valid Lewis structures that can be interconverted by a series of formal charge shifts. This occurs when there are are electron density delocalizations that can't be accounted for by a single Lewis structure. \n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. CO2 has a simple linear structure with no need for resonance. It does not have any double bonds that could potentially shift charges between atoms.\n\nB. NO2- also doesn't require resonance. The nitrogen atom forms a double bond with one oxygen and a single bond with another, leaving one lone pair on the nitrogen. This arrangement satisfies the octet rule without needing to distribute charges differently.\n\nC. CO32- ( while it might seem like it could benefit from resonance because of its central carbon atom bonded to three oxygens, it actually only needs one structure to satisfy the valence requirements of all atoms involved. Each oxygen forms a double bond with carbon and a single bond with another oxygen, and there is an unshared pair on each oxygen atom.\n\nD. NO3- and NO2-, however, do require resonance. \n\nNO3- has a nitrogen atom at the center bonded to three oxygens. Two of these bonds are double bonds, and one is a single bond. The negative charge cannot be placed on any of the oxygen atoms because they already have six electrons in their valence shell ( two from the nitrogen, one from the single bond, and three from the double bonds. Therefore, the negative charge must reside on the nitrogen atom, which requires resonance to distribute the formal charges properly among the atoms.\n\nNO2- similarly has a nitrogen atom bonded to one oxygen with a double bond and another with a single bond, with the remaining electron pair on the nitrogen. Similar to NO3-, the negative charge resides on the nitrogen atom and must be distributed across the structure through resonance to satisfy the octet rule for all atoms.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect, but option D correctly identifies the molecules that require multiple resonance structures: NO3-, NO2-."
