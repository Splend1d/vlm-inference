This means before half went to the computer lab, there were \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) students.\n\n2. **End of the first process**: At the beginning of the class period, half of the students went to the library, leaving 16 students. This implies that before half went to the library, there were \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\) students.\n\nTherefore, the original number of students in the class was **32**.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 32 students**."
