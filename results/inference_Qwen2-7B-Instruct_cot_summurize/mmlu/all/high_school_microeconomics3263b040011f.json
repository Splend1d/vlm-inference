The deadweight loss in this market would decrease.\n\nWhen a monopoly is regulated to produce at the allocative efficient quantity, it means that the output level is adjusted to where the marginal cost equals the marginal benefit or the demand curve. This typically results in a higher output and lower prices compared to the monopoly's natural tendency to produce less and charge higher prices to maximize profits. By doing so, the quantity supplied increases, moving closer to the competitive equilibrium. \n\nDeadweight loss refers to the reduction in total surplus ( the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus - that occurs because the market is not operating efficiently. In a monopolistic market, there is usually a deadweight loss because the monopolist produces less than the socially optimal amount, leading to a gap between the quantity demanded at the marginal cost and the quantity supplied by the monopolist.\n\nBy forcing the monopoly to produce at the allocative efficient quantity, the government intervention effectively reduces this inefficiency, thus decreasing the deadweight loss. The exact impact on the monopoly's profits (whether they break even, incur a loss, or make a profit) depends on the specifics of the cost structure and the regulatory mechanism used, but the key point here is that such regulation leads to a more efficient allocation of resources and a reduction in the deadweight loss."
