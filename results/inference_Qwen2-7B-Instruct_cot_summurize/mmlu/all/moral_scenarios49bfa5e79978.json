This action involves physical harm and could potentially cause lasting emotional or physical trauma, which is not an acceptable method of discipline under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking down a sign that offers a reward for a lost pet is not inherently morally wrong, especially if you have found the pet. This action is typically seen as a positive act of returning lost property, which is in line with societal norms and laws concerning lost and found items."
