Services need to communicate with `oklogd` using file descriptors, as this is how they can share data and communicate effectively. Without the ability to pass file descriptors, this communication mechanism would break down, making it impossible for services to send messages to `oklogd`.\n\n2. Similarly, services also need to establish TCP connections to a database proxy. File descriptors are used to represent such connections, allowing processes to maintain stateful communication sessions. Without the ability to pass these file descriptors, services would not be able to create or maintain connections to the database proxy.\n\nTherefore, both statements in option A are true, making A the correct answer."
