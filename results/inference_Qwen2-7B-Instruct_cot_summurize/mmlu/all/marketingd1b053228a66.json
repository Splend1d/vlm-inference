Examples include rent, salaries, insurance, and depreciation. These costs do not change with the level of output or services provided within a relevant range.\n\nB. Moving assets could refer to various things, but if it's referring to assets that can be moved from one location to another, such as delivery vehicles or office furniture, these would generally be part of fixed capital (not necessarily fixed costs. Fixed capital refers to the long-term assets used in the operations of a business, such as machinery, buildings, and equipment.\n\nC. Working capital is a measure of a company's operational liquidity - the amount of short-term assets like cash, inventory, and accounts receivable minus short-term liabilities like accounts payable and accrued expenses. It can fluctuate based on the level of production or sales, so it's not strictly a fixed cost.\n\nD. Fixed capital refers to tangible assets that a company owns and uses over an extended period to generate income. This includes property, plant, and equipment, among other things. While it's not a cost itself, it's related to fixed costs because depreciation on fixed capital is often considered a fixed cost.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be A. Fixed costs."
