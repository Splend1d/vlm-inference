This leads to firms earning zero economic profits as new entrants come into the market and compete away any excess profits. The other options do not accurately describe the characteristics of monopolistic competition:\n\nA. Strong barriers to entry - This is more typical of monopoly markets, where it's difficult for new firms to enter and compete.\n\nB. Homogeneous products - This is a characteristic of perfect competition, not monopolistic competition, where products are very similar but not identical.\n\nD. Minimum average total cost equals price - This is a feature of a perfectly competitive market, not monopolistic competition, where prices are determined by supply and demand rather than individual firm costs."
