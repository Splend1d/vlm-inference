For example, pollution from factories affects the health of nearby residents. To correct this externality, a government might implement a policy like a subsidy for firms that reduce their negative externalities, encouraging them to operate in a more environmentally friendly manner. This subsidy effectively internalizes the externality by reducing the cost of production for firms that take on the burden of reducing pollution.\n\nThe other options do not typically address the issue of negative externalities:\n\nB. A government tax can discourage activities with negative externalities by increasing the cost of those activities, but it does not necessarily correct or internalize the externality.\n\nC. A lower price reduces the incentive for producers to supply more of a good, potentially decreasing the externality, but it doesn't directly correct the externality.\n\nD. A higher level of output increases the externality, as more units of a product are produced and thus more negative impacts occur."
