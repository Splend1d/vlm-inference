At sentencing the court made additional factual findings, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that resulted in the addition of a 10-year enhancement to the sentence, which was over and above the maximum provided for by the jury's verdict. Defense counsel objected that the judge-made enhancement was unconstitutional and denied his right to a jury trial on that issue. Does counsel have a valid constitutional argument?\n\nA. No, sentencing laws widely authorize the sentencing court to engage in fact-finding that is based on a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. No, it has never been decided that a defendant has a right to be judged on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nC. Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional for a court to use its discretion to fashioning a defendant's sentence.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\n\nIn the United States, the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right to a jury trial in criminal cases. This right includes the requirement that the jury must determine all facts necessary to impose a sentence within the statutory range. The Supreme Court has held that this right applies not just to the guilt or innocence determination but also to the fact-findingings that increase the defendant's punishment. In the case of Apprendi v. New Jersey ( (2000), the Court ruled that \"any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nThus, if a judge makes additional factual findings based on a preponderance of the evidence that result in a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the jury's verdict, this would likely be unconstitutional as it deprives the defendant of the Sixth Amendment right to have a jury determine all facts necessary for the imposition of a sentence."
