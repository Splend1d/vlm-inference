The tag on the window indicated a special 30-point inspection was done on the car. The 30 points included the drive train, the engine, spark plugs, oil, transmission, and numerous other major items. The man put a $1,000 down payment on the car. He took the car to an independent mechanic who told him that the car had been in an accident and had sustained severe damage, including a cracked engine block. The mechanic offered that the dealer must have known of that kind of massive damage. The man tried to return the car and get his down payment back, but the dealer refused, claiming the car was sold \"as is,\" and all express or implied warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code were disclaimed in the purchase contract. Stuck with a lemon, the man sued the company under a common law fraud theory. The company counterclaimed for the balance of the purchase price. Will the man likely prevail in the litigation against the car dealer?\n\nA. Yes, because the dealer withheld material information intentionally and knowingly misrepresented the condition of the car.\nB. Yes, because the dealer has a duty to give every reason why an \"as is\" car may go bad and to list those reasons on the window.\nC. No, because the dealer cannot be held responsible for possible damage that the used car may have developed after years of use.\nD. No, because the dealer is absolutely protected when he sells a used car in \"as is\" condition, and where the warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code are duly waived.\n"

Yes, because the dealer withheld material information intentionally and knowingly misrepresented the condition of the car.\n\nIn this scenario, the man purchased a car from the dealer with the understanding that it had undergone a 30-point inspection and was in good condition. However, upon further investigation by an independent mechanic, it was discovered that the car had sustained significant damage, including a cracked engine block. This information was not disclosed to the buyer before the sale, which constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty and intentional misrepresentation. The fact that the car was sold as-is does not absolve the dealer of liability for willfully concealingning vital information about the vehicle's condition. Therefore, the man could potentially prevail in a lawsuit based on common law fraud."
