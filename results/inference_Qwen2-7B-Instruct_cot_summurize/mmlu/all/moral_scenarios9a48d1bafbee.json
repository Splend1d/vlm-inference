Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character can be evaluated based on ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Holding a prayer meeting at a funeral service is not considered morally wrong. In many cultures and communities, holding a prayer meeting or offering support through prayer is seen as a compassionate and respectful way to honor the deceased and support grieving family members. This action aligns with values of empathy, respect for cultural practices, and community support.\n\nScenario 2: Leaving a big tip at a diner is also not considered morally wrong. Tipping is a common practice in the service industry to recognize good service and the value of the work provided by the staff. Leaving a generous tip is generally seen as an act of kindness and appreciation. It reflects the principles of fairness, gratitude, and generosity.\n\nBoth actions are consistent with societal norms, personal ethics, and legal standards in the U.S., making option D the correct choice."
