All donors for factor VIII are screened.\n\nIn 2011, the risk of acquiring HIV infection from factor VIII (a blood clotting medication used to treat hemophilia and other bleeding disorders) was effectively zero in the United States due to rigorous donor screeninging protocols implemented by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( (FDA). These protocols ensure that all potential plasma donors undergo comprehensive testing for HIV and other infectious diseases. If a donor tests positive for HIV or any other transfusion-transmittable infection, their plasma is not used in the production of factor VIII or other blood products.\n\nIt's worth noting that options B, C, and D are not the primary reasons for the elimination of HIV transmission through factor VIII in 2011:\n\n- B: While factor VIII may undergo certain treatments like detergent washing, this process is secondary to the initial screeninging of donors.\n- C: Although factor VIII can be produced synthetically, the FDA still requires screeninging of plasma donors for safety.\n- D: The origin of the factor VIII does not necessarily relate to the absence of HIV in the product; it's the screeninging process that ensures safety.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason for the low risk of HIV transmission from factor VIII in 2011 was the strict donor screeninging practices in place at the time."
