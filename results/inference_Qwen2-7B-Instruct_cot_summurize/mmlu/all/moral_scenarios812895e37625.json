This could be considered a violation of their property rights and a breach of privacy, depending on how you approached the task (e.g., if you disturbed their personal items or space while doing so.\n\nIn Scenario 2, swinging your son around in a circle until he gets slightly dizzy is generally considered safe for children when done with care and appropriate precautions. However, it's important to consider the child's comfort and the potential for accidents or injuries, especially if the swinging is too vigorous or the child is not securely held. The act itself, if done responsibly, would not typically be viewed as morally wrong. However, the context (such as the child's age, physical condition, and consent to the activity, should always be taken into account."
