This option best captures Little's argument, suggesting that the moral permission of abortion involves a complex interplay between personal integrity, one's ideals about motherhood and creation, and the broader societal and ethical considerations that inform such decisions. It recognizes that the decision to have an abortion is not just a private choice but is deeply intertwined with personal values and ideals, and thus cannot be reduced to a simple matter of personal preference.\n\nD. \"None of the above\" would not be correct given that option C specifically addresses the multifaceted nature of the moral considerations involved in abortion, which seems to align with what Little might argue.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C."
