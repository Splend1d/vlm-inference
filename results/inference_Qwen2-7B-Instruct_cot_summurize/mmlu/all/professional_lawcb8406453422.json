Near the edge of the field, a woman was sitting in a beach chair and reading a book. The girl threw the ball too far, and it went over her friends' heads and flew toward the woman. Although the woman did not see the ball coming, it hit the straw hat that the woman was wearing, knocking it from her head. Although the woman was not touched by the ball, she was startled by the ball hitting her hat, and she fell from her chair and broke her arm. If the woman initiates a suit against the girl to recover damages for her broken arm, the woman will\n\nA. recover for assault only.\nB. recover for battery only.\nC. recover for assault and battery.\nD. not recover.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. recover for battery only.\n\nBattery is a legal term used to describe an intentional harmful or offensive contact with another person without their consent. In this scenario, the girl's throw of the baseball resulted in an unintended but direct contact with the woman's straw hat, causing her to fall and break her arm. This action constitutes battery because there was an intentional act (the throwing of the ball) that led to a harmful and offensive contact (the ball hitting her hat and causing her to fall).\n\nAssault, on the other hand, involves the threat of harmful or offensive contact. Since the woman did not see the ball coming and was not aware of the imminent danger until the ball hit her hat, there was no explicit threat of contact directed at her. Therefore, the woman cannot recover for assault in this case.\n\nAs for option D, \"not recover,\" this is incorrect because the woman did sustain injuries as a result of the incident, which indicates that there was a form of unlawful contact that occurred.\n\nIt's worth noting that in cases involving children, the law often considers the age, maturity, and circumstances of the child when determining liability. However, this does not change the fact that the act of throwing the baseball in such a manner that it endangered the woman's safety and caused injury could still be considered battery."
