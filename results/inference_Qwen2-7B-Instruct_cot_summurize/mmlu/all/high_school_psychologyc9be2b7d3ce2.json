                    "text": "\"C. might have been due to chance\" is the correct answer. When a result is not statistically significant, it means that the observed data does not provide enough evidence to conclude with confidence that there is a true effect or relationship beyond what could be explained by random variation or chance. In Barry's case, this suggests that the apparent relationship between religiosity and academic grades could simply be a coincidence within the sample data used for the study, rather than a reliable finding that would hold true across different populations or samples. It's important to note, however, that non-significance does not necessarily mean there is no relationship at all\u2014it just means the data doesn't support a conclusion of significance at the chosen level of confidence."
