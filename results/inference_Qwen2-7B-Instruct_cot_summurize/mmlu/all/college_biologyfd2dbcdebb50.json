Occasionally the chromosome number of such a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously. Which of the following best describes the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number?\n\nA. The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants.\nB. The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress.\nC. The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.\nD. The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n"

The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n\nWhen a hybrid's chromosome number doubles spontaneously, it often means that the hybrid has now reached a ploidy level (diploid, tetraploid, etc.) that is compatible with one or both of its parent species. At this point, the chromosomes can pair properly during meiosis, allowing for normal gamete formation. This means the hybrid, and subsequently its descendants, can reproduce sexually like the parent species. \n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer."
