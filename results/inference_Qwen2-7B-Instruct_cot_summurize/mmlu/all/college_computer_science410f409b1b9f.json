A := B + C\n2. B := A - B\n3. C := A * E\n4. D := A/F\n5. E := B - C\n6. F := A + B\n\nWe can see that some operations depend on the outcome of others, but we can still parallelize some of them:\n\n- **Parallelizable Operations**: \n   - Assignments (1 and 6 can be done simultaneously because they don't depend on each other.\n   - Assignments 2 and 5 can also be done simultaneously for the same reason.\n   - Assignment 3 depends on both A and E, so it must wait until both are are computed.\n   - Assignments 4 and E (which is part of 5) have dependencies that prevent them from being done in parallel.\n\n- **Ordering**:\n   - The critical dependency is between C (:= A * E and E := B - C, where E depends on C, which depends on A and B.\n   - A and B can be computed independently first.\n   - Once A and B are computed, C can be computed.\n   - With A, B, and C known, E can be computed.\n   - After computing E, F can be computed.\n   - Finally, D depends only on A and F, which can be computed after all other assignments.\n\nGiven this, the minimum sequence would look something like this:\n1. Compute A and B in parallel.\n2. Compute C using the results of A and B.\n3. Compute E using the result of C.\n4. Compute F using the results of A and B.\n5. Compute D using the results of A and F.\n\nThis process involves three distinct steps: computing A and B, computing C and E, and computing D and F. Since each step can involve multiple processors working on different parts simultaneously, the bottleneck is the sequential nature of these steps rather than the execution of individual operations within each step.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of time units needed to execute these operations, given the constraints, is **3**, considering the sequential dependency of E and F on previous computations and the ability to parallelize the initial computation of A and B, and then C, followed by D and F. \n\nThe correct answer is **C. 3**."
