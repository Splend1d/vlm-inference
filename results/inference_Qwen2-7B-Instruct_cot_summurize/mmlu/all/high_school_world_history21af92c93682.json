The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.\nIndonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955\nThe \"revolutions\" spoken of by Sukarno in the passage above most likely relate to which of the following causes?\n\nA.

Decolonization\n\nThe reference to \"revolutions\" in Sukarno's speech is most likely connected to the decolonization efforts of many Asian and African nations during the mid-20th century. Sukarno was addressing the Bandung Conference, where leaders from newly independent nations gathered to discuss common concerns and challenges after gaining independence from colonial powers. The context of his speech, as well as the time period, suggests that he was referring to the broader movement towards independence and the establishment of nation-states in regionsally diverse settings."
