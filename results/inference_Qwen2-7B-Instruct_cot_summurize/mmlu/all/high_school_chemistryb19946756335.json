Let's identify the correct conjugate acid-base pairs from your options:\n\nA. H3O+ and OH-: Here, H3O+ can donate a proton to form OH-, making H3O+ the acid and OH- the base. However, OH- can also accept a proton to form H3O+, making it the base and H3O+ the acid. This pair demonstrates both acid-base behaviors.\n\nB. H3PO4 and H3PO3: H3PO4 can donate a proton to form H3PO3, making H3PO4 the acid and H3PO3 the base.\n\nC. HC2H3O2 and C2H3O2-: HC2H3O2 can donate a proton to form C2H3O2-, making HC2H3O2 the acid and C2H3O2- the base.\n\nD. SO32- and SO22-: SO32- can donate a proton to form SO22-, making SO32- the acid and SO22- the base.\n\nSo, based on these definitions, option B (H3PO4 and H3PO3, is the correct conjugate acid-base pair where H3PO4 acts as the acid by donating a proton to form H3PO3, which then acts as the base."
