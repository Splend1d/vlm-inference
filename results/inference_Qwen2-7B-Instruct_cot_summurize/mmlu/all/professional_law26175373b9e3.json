In the United States, these types of statements can be admitted under state laws or rules of evidence, often found in the Uniform Rules of Evidence or specific state versions thereof. Typically, for such a statement to be admitted, there must be sufficient evidence (often presented by a judge at an in limine hearing) that the declarant actually believed their death was imminent at the time they made the statement.\n\nIn this case, the statement was made late at night when the victim was found dead the next day, so it seems likely that a judge might find that the victim reasonably believed she would die soon after making the statement, especially considering the context of a plea for mercy from the defendant.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be B, where the judge would determine the admissibility based on the preponderance of the evidence suggesting the victim's belief in the imminence of death. However, it's important to note that the exact legal standards may vary by jurisdiction, and the decision would ultimately depend on the specifics of the case law in the relevant jurisdiction."
