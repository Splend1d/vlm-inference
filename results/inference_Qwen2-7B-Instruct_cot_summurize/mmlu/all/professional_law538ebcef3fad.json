The prosecutor has called the friend's mother to testify to a conversation she had with her son the day before he left the country. She implored him not to go, but he said, \"Mom, I have to go. I was involved in a robbery at [the bank], and I don't want them to catch me.\" The prosecutor has other evidence indicating that the defendant and the friend were together on the morning of the robbery. Is the statement by the friend to his mother admissible?\n\nA. No, because inculpatory statements against penal interest do not satisfy the confrontation clause.\nB. No, because the friend's statement to his mother was not corroborated.\nC. Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\nD. Yes, as a statement of the friend's state of mind that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n"

Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n\nThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution applies to testimonial statements made in the course of a police interrogation or other formal law enforcement context. However, it does not apply to out-of-court statements that are not testimonial in nature, such as those made in the course of normal family interactions or in the context of self-incrimination. \n\nIn this case, the friend's statement to his mother is clearly an admission implicating himself in a crime (it is against his penal interest to confess to participating in a robbery. Since the statement was made outside of any formal legal proceeding and in the context of a familial relationship, it would likely be considered non-testimonial and thus admissible under current interpretations of the Confrontation Clause."
