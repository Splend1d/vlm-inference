A 90% confidence interval estimate for the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is reported to be -0.197 \u00b1 0.081. Which is a proper conclusion?\n\nA. The interval is invalid because probabilities cannot be negative.\nB. The interval is invalid because it does not contain zero.\nC. Subaru owners are approximately 19.7% more satisfied with their drive systems than are Toyota owners.\nD. We are 90% confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278 and -0.116.\n"

We are 90% confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278 and -0.116.\n\nExplanation:\n\nGiven the 90% confidence interval estimate for the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is reported to be -0.197 \u00b1 0.081, we can understand this as follows:\n\n- The midpoint of the interval (-0.197) represents the estimated difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru owners who are satisfied with their respective drive systems. Since the midpoint is negative, it suggests that, on average, Toyota owners are less likely to be satisfied with their front-wheel drive compared to Subaru owners being satisfied with their four-wheel drive.\n\n- The range of the confidence interval (-0.197 \u00b1 0.081) indicates that we are 90% confident that the true difference in satisfaction levels between Toyota and Subaru owners lies somewhere between -0.278 ( and -0.116. This means the interval covers negative values, which is statistically valid because differences in proportions can indeed be negative if the proportion of one group is lower than the other.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the confidence interval can include negative values, and it can also exclude zero, which would indicate that there is no significant difference between the two groups. Option C misinterprets the information by suggesting an increase in satisfaction levels rather than a difference in proportions."
