In this case, Alto Co. performed a 5-for-1 stock split. This means that for every share held before the split, shareholders receive 5 new shares.\n\nThe question states that the fair value of the stock after the split is $100 per share. The fair value of the stock doesn't directly impact the par value, which is a nominal value assigned by the company for accounting purposes and does not necessarily reflect the market price or fair value of the stock.\n\nBefore the split, Alto Co. had 10,000 shares of $10 par value common stock issued and outstanding. After the split, the number of shares increased, but the total par value of the stock remains the same because the total amount of capital contributed by shareholders has not changed.\n\nTo calculate the new number of shares after the split:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Shares} = \\text{Old Shares} \\times \\text{Split Ratio} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{New Shares} = 10,000 \\times 5 = 50,000 \\]\n\nSince the total par value (\\[ (\\text{Par Value} \\times \\text{Number of Shares}) \\] remains constant, we can find the new par value as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Par Value Before Split} = \\text{Par Value} \\times \\text{Number of Shares Before Split} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Par Value Before Split} = \\$10 \\times 10,000 = \\$100,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Par Value After Split} = \\text{Total Par Value Before Split} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Par Value After Split} = \\$100,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{New Par Value} = \\frac{\\text{Total Par Value After Split}}{\\text{New Number of Shares}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Par Value} = \\frac{\\$100,000}{50,000} = \\$2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Was reduced to $2**."
