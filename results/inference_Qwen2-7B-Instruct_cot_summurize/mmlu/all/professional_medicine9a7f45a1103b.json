She is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a 4 x 3-cm, tender, fluctuant mass medial to the left labium majus compromising the introital opening. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Administration of intravenous metronidazole\nB. Administration of intravenous penicillin G\nC. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the mass\nD. Incision and drainage\n"

Incision and drainage\n\nThis is typically the initial treatment for a fluctuant mass (such as what is described in the question) that is causing significant pain and compromising the introital opening. The incision allows for the release of pus and reduction of pressure, providing immediate relief of symptoms. \n\nHowever, before proceeding with this treatment, it's important to ensure the patient is properly identified, informed consent obtained, and that any necessary laboratory tests (like a blood culture or a swab from the lesion) are performed to guide antibiotic therapy and monitor for potential complications.\n\nAntibiotics may be needed post-procedure if there is evidence of infection or if the patient develops fever or other signs of systemic infection. The choice of antibiotics will depend on the results of these tests and the patient's overall health status. For instance, if the patient is allergic to penicillin, metronidazole might be considered if it's determined that the infection is not caused by anaerobic bacteria. However, without additional information about the patient's specific circumstances, including any allergy history, it's difficult to definitively recommend one antibiotic over another.\n\nIn ultrasound-guided needle aspiration, this could potentially be used as a diagnostic tool to confirm the presence of pus or other fluid before deciding on incision and drainage. However, given the size and description of the mass, along with its clinical presentation, incision and drainage seems like the more immediate and appropriate intervention."
