When an authority figure is present, people are more likely to obey orders than to question the wisdom of the orders.\n\nMilgram's experiments demonstrated that ordinary people, in the right circumstances, can be persuaded to perform seemingly extreme actions, including ones that go against their own moral judgments, when an authority figure commands them to do so. The presence and authority of the experimenter significantly influenced participants' willingness to administer painful shocks to other participants, even when they personally believed the shocks were harmful."
