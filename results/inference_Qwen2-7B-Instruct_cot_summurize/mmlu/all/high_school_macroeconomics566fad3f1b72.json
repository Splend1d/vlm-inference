This increased demand for loanable funds (loans that banks or investors can make available) drives up the price of those loans, which in economic terms means it raises the real interest rate. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation, and its rise makes borrowing more expensive.\n\nHigher interest rates typically discourage investment spending because borrowing costs are higher, making investments less profitable. So, the real interest rate increases, and investment spending decreases. In summary, an increase in the federal deficit leads to:\n\n- An increase in the demand for loanable funds,\n- An increase in the real interest rate, and\n- A decrease in investment spending."
