Now, Congress, under intense lobbying pressure from the press, proposes to enact legislation forbidding any state from requiring journalists to reveal the sources of their news articles in civil suits. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument in support of this proposed law?\n\nA. Congress has the authority under the commerce clause to regulate the flow of news.\nB. Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land and take precedence over any conflicting state laws.\nC. Congress is essentially reaffirming the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nD. Under Article I, Section 8, Congress has the authority to secure to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\n"

Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land and take precedence over any conflicting state laws.\n\nThis argument is based on the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, which states that \"this Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" \n\nBy enacting a federal law that preempts state laws requiring journalists to disclose their sources, Congress would assert its authority to legislate on matters that affect the national interest, including freedom of the press and the dissemination of information. This is particularly relevant given the nature of journalism, which often crosses state lines and can have significant impacts beyond a single jurisdiction."
