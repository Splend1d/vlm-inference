Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, while it might be seen as a joke or harmless mischief, deliberately adding extra salt to someone's food without their knowledge could be considered disrespectful and potentially harmful if the person has health issues related to salt intake. This action can be seen as manipulative and lacks consideration for others' well-being, hence it leans towards being morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, selling baby brother's old toys to the Germans during wartime implies aiding the enemy, which is a clear violation of moral and legal norms. It supports an aggressor nation, which is ethically and legally wrong, especially considering historical contexts where selling items to the enemy could lead to significant harm or loss of life.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the first scenario is not morally wrong, while the second scenario is morally wrong."
