A contractor who was unaware of the fee requirement agreed to perform home repairs for a city resident. After the contractor completed the work, the resident discovered that the contractor had not paid the licensing fee, and she refused to pay for the repairs, which were otherwise satisfactory. If the contractor sues the resident for breach of contract, how is the court likely to rule?\n\nA. Although the contract violates the law and is void, the court will require the homeowner to pay the contractor the reasonable value of the work accepted.\nB. Although the contract violates the law, the court will find that public policy does not bar enforcement of the contract, because the purpose of the fee is merely to raise revenue.\nC. Because the contract violates the law and is void, the court will not enforce it.\nD.

Because the contract violates the law and is void, the court will not enforce it.\n\nIn this scenario, the contract between the contractor and the homeowner is void due to the illegal nature of the agreement (the requirement for the contractor to pay a licensing fee to the city agency as a prerequisite to performing work). Since the contract is void, it cannot be enforced by either party in a court of law. Therefore, the court is unlikely to require the homeowner to pay for the repairs, even if they were satisfactory and the work was completed as agreed upon."
