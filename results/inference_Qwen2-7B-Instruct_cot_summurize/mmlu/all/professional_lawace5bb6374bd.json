Under a written contract, the doctor agreed to surgically remove the growth for $750. As agreed, the surgery was performed on an outpatient basis at the doctor's office. He applied a localized anesthesia that enabled the patient to remain conscious during surgery. While the operation was being performed, the doctor noticed a brown mole on the patient's back. As the doctor subsequently recalled, he informed the patient about the mole and asked whether she wanted it removed as well. According to the doctor's account, the patient orally agreed to have the mole removed for an additional $150. The patient has no recollection of any such oral agreement. The doctor erformed both removal procedures satisfactorily. Following the surgery, the patient paid the doctor $750, but refused to pay any additional money for the mole removal. After unsuccessfully attempting to collect the $150, the doctor brought suit against the patient to recover the additional fee. At trial, the patient objected to the introduction of testimony concerning any oral agreement made during surgery. Which of the following considerations is most important to a judicial ruling on the patient's objection?\n\nA. The doctor's removal of the mole conferred a clear benefit on the patient.\nB. The proffered oral agreement regarding payment of the additional $150 occurred after the written agreement had been signed.\nC. The written agreement was for services rather than the sale of goods.\nD. The proffered oral agreement regarding payment of the additional $150 concerned a new medical procedure that was unrelated to the subject matter of the prior written contract.\n"

The doctor's removal of the mole conferred a clear benefit on the patient.\n\nThis consideration is most important to a judicial ruling on the patient's objection because it addresses the central issue of whether there was a valid agreement for the additional service provided (\u2014 the removal of the mole. If the court finds that the removal of the mole provided a benefit to the patient, it could imply that there was an implied or implied-in-fact contract for the additional service, which could support the doctor's claim for payment. The other options may influence the decision but do not directly address the core question of whether the patient received a benefit from the additional service."
