At trial, the widow offered the testimony of a coworker of the husband. The coworker testified that he had seen the rail car on which the husband was riding slow down and the cars behind it gain speed. The coworker also stated that he later heard a loud crash, but did not turn around to look because loud noises were common in the yard. Three other railroad employees testified that no collision had occurred. At the close of the evidence, the railroad moved for judgment as a matter of law, which was denied, and the case was submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the widow. The railroad has made a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. What standard should the court apply to determine how to rule on the motion?\n\nA. Whether the evidence revealed a genuine dispute of material fact supporting the widow's claim.\nB. Whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.\nC. Whether the widow presented a scintilla of evidence to support the verdict.\nD. Whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the verdict, resolving all disputed issues in the widow's favor.\n"

Whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the verdict, resolving all disputed issues in the widow's favor.\n\nThis is because a motion for judgment as a matter of law seeks to determine if the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find in favor of the plaintiff. Under this standard, the court does not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses; rather, it only considers whether there is enough evidence from which a jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff. If the court finds substantial evidence supports the verdict, it will deny the motion, allowing the jury's decision to stand."
