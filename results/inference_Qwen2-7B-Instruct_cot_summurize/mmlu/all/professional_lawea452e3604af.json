                    "text": "A husband and wife divorced after 17 years of marriage. They had one son, aged 10. As part of the divorce decree, the wife was given custody of the son, while the husband was entitled to weekend visitation. Thereafter, the husband accepted a new job in a neighboring state. Before relocating, the husband met with an attorney to seek his advice about how he could gain full custody of his son. The attorney told the husband that his new state did not give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings in his former state of residence. As a consequence, the attorney advised the husband that he could take the son to live with him and not be in violation of the law. This was erroneous legal advice, and his new state, in fact, did honor and give full faith and credit to other states' divorce decrees. When his next scheduled visitation took place, the husband picked up his son at his ex-wife's home. Instead of returning his son, he took him to live with him in his new state. After refusing to return his son to his ex-wife, the husband was subsequently arrested and charged with kidnapping. The applicable statute is defined as \"knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location. \"Should the husband be found guilty of kidnapping?\n\nA. Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree.\nB. Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.\nC. No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.\nD. No, because he received erroneous legal advice.\n"

No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.\n\nIn criminal law, for a defendant to be found guilty of a crime such as kidnapping, they must have acted with the requisite intent or state of mind. In this case, the husband took his son without intending to violate the court order, believing that his actions were lawful based on the advice of his attorney. However, the attorney provided erroneous legal advice, which the husband relied upon in good faith.\n\nMistake of law is generally not a valid defense in criminal cases. However, there are exceptions to this rule, particularly when the mistake is honest and reasonable. In this scenario, the husband's belief that he could move his son without violating the divorce decree due to the attorney's advice could potentially be considered an honest and reasonable mistake. \n\nTherefore, if the court determines that the husband genuinely believed his actions were lawful and acted in reliance on the attorney's advice, it might find that he lacked the necessary intent to commit the crime of kidnapping. It would then likely find him not guilty. The key factor here would be the intention behind the husband's actions and whether his belief in the legality of those actions was reasonable under the circumstances."
