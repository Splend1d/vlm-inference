This leads to overproduction (or consumption, depending on the externality, compared to what is socially optimal. To correct this and achieve the socially optimal quantity, one approach is to place limits on the quantity that can be produced. This could be done through regulations, taxes, or permits, which help internalize the external costs, thus guiding the market towards a more efficient outcome."
