It occurs during the synthesis phase and does not involve adding more amino acids via peptide bonds, as that would require the addition of new mRNA or tRNA molecules carrying those amino acids, which is not part of the translation process itself. Instead, post-translational modifications such as lipidation, glycosylation, and phosphorylation can occur after the protein has been synthesized, altering its structure and function."
