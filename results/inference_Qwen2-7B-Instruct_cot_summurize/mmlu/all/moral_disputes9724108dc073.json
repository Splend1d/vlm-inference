He posits that the long-term effects on individuals and society as a whole could be unpredictable and potentially harmful. The safety of these interventions is crucial, and without thorough understanding and rigorous testing, there's a risk that unintended consequences could arise.\n\n2. **Fairness and Unfair Advantage** Another key concern is fairness. Sandel highlights that genetic enhancements could lead to an uneven playing field, where those who can afford such enhancements have a significant advantage over those who cannot. This could exacerbate existing inequalities in healthcare and access to resources, creating a divide between those who benefit from genetic enhancements and those who do not. It challenges the principles of equality and justice within society.\n\nThese two concerns\u2014safety and fairness\u2014highlight the complex ethical dilemmas surrounding genetic enhancement, making Sandel's stance against its widespread use in certain contexts quite compelling."
