Dish soap is specifically formulated to break down grease and grime effectively. Using shampoo instead could potentially leave residue on the dishes and may not clean them thoroughly, leading to health issues if consumed. This action can be considered wasteful and potentially harmful, hence morally wrong under ordinary US standards.\n\nOn the other hand, turning on the ballgame when sitting down to watch TV with one's hard-working husband is a personal choice that respects his preferences and interests. It is a thoughtful act that shows consideration for his enjoyment and relaxation after work. There is no harm intended or inflicted by this action, making it not morally wrong."
