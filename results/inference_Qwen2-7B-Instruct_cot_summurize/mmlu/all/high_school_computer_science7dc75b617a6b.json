An e-mail indicates that you have won a large sum of money and asks you to enter your bank account number so that the money can be transferred to you\n\nThis option (D is the least likely to indicate a phishing attack because winning a large sum of money typically doesn't involve providing personal information like your bank account number. Phishing scams often try to trick people into giving away sensitive information by creating a sense of urgency or excitement. In this case, asking for a bank account number before verifying the win would be unusual and suspicious.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that phishing attempts can vary widely in their tactics and may attempt to make legitimate requests seem more convincing. Always be cautious with unsolicited requests for personal information, especially financial details."
