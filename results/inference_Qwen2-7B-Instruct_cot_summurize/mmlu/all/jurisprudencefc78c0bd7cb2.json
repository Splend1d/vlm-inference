Its principal concern is with moral or political values.\n\nNormative legal theory primarily focuses on the values, principles, and standards that should guide the creation, interpretation, and application of laws. This approach emphasizes the ethical and moral dimensions of law, often questioning its fairness, justice, and the extent to which it alignss with societal values. \n\nOption B describes a specific school of thought within legal positivism rather than normative legal theory as a whole. Option C simplifies the complex nature of normative legal theory, which involves more than just the expression of norms. Option D misrepresents the focus of normative legal theory, which is not so much about the application of legislation to moral issues but rather the inherent moral aspects of law itself."
