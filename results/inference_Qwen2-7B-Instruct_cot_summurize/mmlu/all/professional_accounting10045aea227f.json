Information in the form of financial statements that is the representation of management.\n\nStatements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS) are issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ( (AICPA). They provide guidance for accountants performing accounting and review services. These standards do not limit themselves to presenting any specific type of accounting data, nor do they restrict to a special purpose framework other than Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( (GAAP), or require only supplementary financial information subjected to inquiry and analytical procedures.\n\nIn SSARS, an accountant is required to prepare financial statements that are the representation of management. This means the accountant is presenting the financial information as provided by the entity's management, subject to certain standards and procedures that ensure the information is compiled in a manner consistent with the SSARS. \n\nIt's important to note that while these statements may not undergo the same level of scrutiny as audited financial statements, they still must adhere to certain requirements and procedures outlined by SSARS to ensure reliability and comparability."
