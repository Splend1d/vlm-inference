Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital.\n\nThis concept is based on the principle of equi-marginal utility or the principle of equi-marginal rate of substitution in economics, which states that a consumer allocates their budget among different goods so as to maximize their satisfaction when the marginal utility per dollar spent is equalized across all goods. In the context of a firm, this translates to allocating resources (capital and labor - so as to maximize profit when the marginal revenue product (the additional revenue generated by an additional unit of input) per dollar spent is equalized across all inputs.\n\nIn mathematical terms, for a firm to hire the least-cost combination of labor and capital, it should hire up to the point where:\n\n\\[ \\frac{MPL}{w} = \\frac{MPK}{r} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( MPL \\) is the marginal product of labor,\n- \\( MPK \\) is the marginal product of capital,\n- \\( w \\) is the wage rate ( (price of labor),\n- \\( r \\) is the rental rate of capital.\n\nHence, option C correctly represents this condition."
