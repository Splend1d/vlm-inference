Half of the tract is swampland totally unfit for cultivation, though it is heavily covered with valuable hardwood timber. The other half is also covered with valuable timber, but it is land that would be fit for the raising of crops if it were cleared of the timber. The latter section of land is more valuable for cultivation than it is for the growing of timber. The grantor conveyed his tract to his brother for life. At the time of the conveyance, the swampland had never been used for the production of timber. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. In addition, the brother cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, thus becoming the first person to exploit this area. The brother's cutting of the timber on the section of tract suitable for cultivation would be an example of\n\nA. permissive waste.\nB. ameliorative waste.\nC. equitable waste.\nD. unreasonable exploitation.\n"

In this case, the brother cleared 40 acres of timber from the section of the land that was suitable for cultivation, likely to prepare the land for farming. This action, aimed at improving the land's usability for its primary purpose (cultivation, could be considered an instance of ameliorative waste. It is important to note that while this action might have been beneficial in terms of land use, it still involved the removal of a resource (timber), hence the term \"waste.\""
