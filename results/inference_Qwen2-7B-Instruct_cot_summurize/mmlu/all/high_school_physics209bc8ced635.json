                    "text": "The correct answer is D. I & III only.\n\nExplanation:\nI. At the highest point, the ball momentarily stops its upward motion because the force of gravity (combined with air resistance acting in the opposite direction to the motion\u2014will equalize the upward velocity, causing it to be zero. This is a correct statement.\n\nII. However, acceleration is not zero at the highest point. Gravity continues to pull the ball downward, providing a constant acceleration, even though the velocity might be zero. Air resistance also contributes to this acceleration by opposing the motion. So, the statement that acceleration is zero at the highest point is incorrect.\n\nIII. It's generally true that a projectile or an object moving under the influence of gravity will take longer to ascend to its peak than it does to descend back to its starting point due to the deceleration caused by gravity during ascent and the acceleration caused by gravity during descent. Air resistance can slightly alter this balance but does not negate the basic physics principle that descent typically takes less time than ascent. Thus, this statement is also correct.\n\nTherefore, statements I and III are true, making option D the correct choice."
