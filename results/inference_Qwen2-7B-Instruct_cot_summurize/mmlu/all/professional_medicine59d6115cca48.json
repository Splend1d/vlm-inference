                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Increased hydrostatic pressure.\n\nIn the context of renal glomerular filtration, Starling's law explains the balance between hydrostatic pressure (P, oncotic pressure O, and the filtration coefficient Kf to determine the rate of filtration F:\n\n\\[F = \\frac{(P - O)}{K_f}\\]\n\nWhen the efferent arteriole is constricted, the resistance to blood flow increases. This leads to an increase in the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus because blood tends to flow from areas of higher pressure to lower pressure. As a result, the hydrostatic pressure P increases, while the oncotic pressure O remains relatively unchanged in this scenario. Since the filtration coefficient \\(K_f\\) is also assumed to remain constant under normal physiological conditions, an increase in hydrostatic pressure would lead to an increased filtration rate if not counteracted by other factors such as changes in tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms or adjustments in the glomerular capillary bed. However, in the context of the question, focusing on the immediate effect on Starling forces, the increase in hydrostatic pressure is the direct consequence of constriction of the efferent arteriole."
