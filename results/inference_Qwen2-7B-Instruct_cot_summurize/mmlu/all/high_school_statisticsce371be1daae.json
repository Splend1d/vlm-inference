Controlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies.\n\nWhile it's true that controlled experiments are often used to establish cause-and-effect relationships ( (they can isolate variables and control for confounding factors), option C correctly identifies that these experiments might follow initial findings from observational studies. Observational studies can identify correlations or associations but cannot prove causation due to potential biases and confounding variables. However, they can provide hypotheses or guide further research, including the design of experiments aimed at proving causality.\n\nLet's briefly address the other options:\n\nA. While a complete census can provide comprehensive data on a population, it does not necessarily establish cause-and-effect relationships as it merely describes the characteristics of the entire population without experimental manipulation.\n\nB. Observational studies, even if properly designed, cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships as effectively as controlled experiments because they cannot control for all possible confounding variables.\n\nD. Increasing the sample size in an observational study can help reduce random error and improve the reliability of estimates, but it does not eliminate biases inherent in the observational design. Bias requires different methods to mitigate, such as matching, stratification, or statistical adjustments."
