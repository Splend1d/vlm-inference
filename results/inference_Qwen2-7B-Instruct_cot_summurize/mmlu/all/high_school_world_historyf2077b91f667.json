The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

                    "text": "The practices described in the excerpt from Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya's \"The First New Chronicle and Good Government\" portray a system of exploitation and oppression of indigenous people in the Spanish colonies, particularly in the context of silver mining. The conditions described involve forced labor, lack of payment, physical abuse, and systematic attempts to reduce the indigenous population's wealth and freedom.\n\nComparing these practices to those in England during the same period ( when colonization was also happening in the Americas, the treatment of indigenous peoples in England was significantly different:\n\nA. **Viewed the natives as true equals**: This is not accurate. While there were attempts at integration and even some early alliances, such as with the Wampanoag tribe in Massachusetts, the overall colonial policy was one of subjugation and displacement, not equality. The colonists often saw indigenous peoples as inferior and sought to assimilate them into European culture or remove them from land they deemed valuable.\n\nB. **Were confused by the natives\u2019 lack of a notion of land ownership**: This statement conflates the colonial experience with the indigenous cultures they encountered. While some European colonizers might have been initially puzzled by indigenous land customs (which were communal rather than individualistic), the confusion does not reflect a widespread colonial policy. Instead, the confusion was more related to understanding the complex social structures and land rights systems that existed among various indigenous groups.\n\nC. **Widely did not condone intermingling with the natives**: While there were certainly instances of intermarriage between Europeans and indigenous peoples, especially among the upper classes, the overall colonial policy was to maintain racial purity lines. Laws such as the Spanish Law of Indias in 1542 and the English Prohibitions against Mischlinging in the 17th century aimed to prevent intermarriage to preserve the purity of the European race. However, these laws were often selectively enforced and ignored in practice, especially in regions where the indigenous population was abundant and labor needs were pressing.\n\nD. **Used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton**: This description aligns more closely with the economic motivations behind the slave trade in the Americas, which included the cultivation of cash crops like tobacco, cotton, and sugar. While indigenous peoples were often involved in labor in various capacities, including on plantations, the primary focus was on exploiting their labor rather than using them exclusively for cash crop harvesting. The introduction of slavery after the failure of the indigenous labor system in certain regions was a significant shift towards using enslaved Africans for the intensive labor required for cash crops.\n\nIn summary, compared to the practices described in the excerpt from Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya, the English treatment of the natives in the New World generally involved more direct forms of labor exploitation, less emphasis on forced labor in specific contexts like mining, and more complex interactions regarding land rights and intermarriage policies. The economic focus was on cash crops later on, but, rather than being the primary motivation from the start as in the case described for the Spanish colonies."
