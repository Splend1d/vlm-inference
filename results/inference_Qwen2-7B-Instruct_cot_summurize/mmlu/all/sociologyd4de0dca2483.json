This period was marked by significant demographic changes in cities like Chicago. While many migrants from various ethnic backgrounds did integrate into mainstream society over time, African Americans often faced systemic barriers and discrimination that limited their ability to fully assimilate or escape segregated living conditions.\n\nIntegration into mainstream society was not uniform across different ethnic groups. Some groups were able to achieve economic success and social mobility, while others continued to experience marginalization and racial disparities. For African Americans, despite some gains in employment and political participation, they often remained concentrated in specific neighborhoods, known as \"ghettos,\" due to housing segregation and discriminatory policies such as redlining. This segregation was enforced by both private landlords and government practices, which restricted where people of color could live and work.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately reflects the complex and nuanced process of integration and segregation that occurred during and after the Great Migration. It highlights that while integration took place for some groups, particularly African Americans, the legacy of systemic racism and segregation persisted, leading to continued challenges and disparities."
