The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed. The husband is 188 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm are seen on semen analysis. Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility?\n\nA. Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes\nB. Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations\nC. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations\nD. Serum prolactin concentration\n"

Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes\n\nThis test would help identify any chromosomal abnormalities that could be contributing to the absence of sperm. Chromosomal abnormalities, such as Klinefelter syndrome (where there is an extra X chromosome), are a common cause of azoospermia (the absence of sperm in the semen).\n\nWhile the other options can provide information about hormonal imbalances which can also contribute to infertility, they do not specifically address the cause of the observed sperm absence. Estrogens and Testosterone levels (B, Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH levels (C, and Prolactin levels D can indicate problems related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, but they do not directly assess for chromosomal or genetic causes of infertility."
