Generally, polar liquids mix with each other, while non-polar liquids mix with each other.\n\nA. H2O (water is a polar molecule, and CH3OH (methanol) is also polar due to the presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH). These two polar molecules would likely mix together.\n\nB. C6H6 (hexane is a non-polar molecule, and C5H12 (pentane is also non-polar. These two non-polar molecules would likely mix together.\n\nC. C10H22 (decane is a non-polar molecule, and CH2CH2CH2OH (propyl alcohol is a polar molecule due to the hydroxyl group (-OH). These two polar/non-polar pairs are typically immiscible, meaning they do not mix well or at all.\n\nD. CH3CH2NH2 (dimethylamine is a polar molecule, and CH3CH2CH2OH (butanol) is also polar due to the hydroxyl group (-OH). These two polar molecules would likely mix together.\n\nSo, the pair that is most likely to be immiscible is C. C10H22 (decane and CH2CH2CH2OH propyl alcohol."
