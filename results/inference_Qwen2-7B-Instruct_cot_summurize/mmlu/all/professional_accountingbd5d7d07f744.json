As a $180,000 debit to insurance expense, a $120,000 credit to prepaid asset, and a $60,000 credit to retained earnings.\n\nWhen Bailey Co. changed its accounting method from the cash basis to the accrual basis for insurance expense, it means that the company will now recognize expenses when they are are incurred rather than when they are are paid. The initial $240,000 was payment for the four-year insurance policy was was was was made in January of the prior year.\n\nIn the current year, since one year has passed (00, Bailey Co. would recognize 1/4 of the total cost of the insurance policy as an expense, because the insurance coverage applies evenly over the four years. \n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\$240,000 = \\$60,000 \\]\n\nThis $60,000 represents the portion of the insurance expense that should be recognized in the current year. Therefore, Bailey Co. would:\n\n- Debit Insurance Expense by $60,000, recognizing this as an expense for the current year.\n- Credit Prepaid Insurance by $120,000, which is the remaining unexpired portion of the insurance policy ($240,000 - $60,000).\n- Credit Retained Earnings by $60,000, reflecting the change in accounting principle and the adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings due to the change in accounting estimate.\n\nThis approach ensures that Bailey Co.'s financial statements accurately reflect the expenses incurred during the period and the assets available to cover future periods of insurance coverage."
