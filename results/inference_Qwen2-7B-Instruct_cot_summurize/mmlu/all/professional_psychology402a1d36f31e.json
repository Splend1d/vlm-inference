However, it's important to note that the legal and psychiatric understanding of insanity can differ significantly from its everyday usage. In a legal context, insanity can be a defense against criminal responsibility, and the criteria for what constitutes insanity can vary by jurisdiction. Psychiatically, the term might be replaced with specific diagnoses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other psychotic disorders."
