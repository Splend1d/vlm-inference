It separates the stroma ( (the fluid-filled space inside the chloroplast) from the thylakoid space.\n\n- **Thylakoid Membrane**: This is part of the inner membrane but specifically refers to the membrane that forms the thylakoids, which are the flattened sacs where light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur.\n\n- **Outer Membrane**: This is the outermost membrane of the chloroplast. It separates the chloroplast from the cytoplasm and allows for the exchange of materials between the chloroplast and the rest of the cell.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. Thylakoid membrane, inner membrane, outer membrane**."
