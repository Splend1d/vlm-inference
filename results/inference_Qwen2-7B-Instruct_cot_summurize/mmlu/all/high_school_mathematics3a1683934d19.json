The aspect ratio tells us that for every 5 units of length, there are 3 units of height.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(L\\) as the length ( (horizontal length)\n- \\(H\\) as the height\n- \\(D\\) as the diagonal length\n\nGiven:\n- \\(L:H = 5:3\\)\n- \\(D = 48\\) inches\n\nFrom the aspect ratio, we can say:\n\\[L = 5x\\]\n\\[H = 3x\\]\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle formed by the length, height, and diagonal:\n\\[L^2 + H^2 = D^2\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(L\\) and \\(H\\) with their expressions in terms of \\(x\\):\n\\[(5x)^2 + ( (3x)^2 = 48^2\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[25x^2 + 9x^2 = 2304\\]\n\\[34x^2 = 2304\\]\n\\[x^2 = \\frac{2304}{34}\\]\n\\[x^2 = 67.71\\] (approximately\n\\[x = \\sqrt{67.71}\\]\n\\[x \u2248 8.23\\]\n\nNow, find \\(L\\) and \\(H\\):\n\\[L = 5x = 5 * 8.23 \u2248 41.15\\] inches\n\\[H = 3x = 3 * 8.23 \u2248 24.69\\] inches\n\nThe difference between the horizontal length (\\(L\\)) and the diagonal measurement (\\(D\\)) when considering the diagonal as the \"length\" for comparison would be:\n\\[Difference = D - L\\]\n\\[Difference = 48 - 41.15\\]\n\\[Difference \u2248 6.85\\] inches\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the difference is approximately 7 inches.\n\nSo, the answer is **B. 7**."
