In accordance with the bylaws of the league's charter, the commissioner was required to obtain the approval of at least half the owners before raising his expense allocation. At trial, the commissioner seeks to testify that his predecessor told him that he had authority under the league's charter to raise his expense allocation. The commissioner's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.\nB. admissible as evidence of the routine practice of an organization.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the league's charter is the best evidence.\n"

Hearsay is a statement made out of court that is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. For example, if the commissioner testifies that his predecessor told him he had authority to raise his expense allocation, this is a statement made by someone else (the predecessor) and is being being offered to prove that the commissioner indeed had that authority. \n\nHearsay is generally inadmissible in court because it does not allow for cross-examination of the person who originally made the statement, which can be crucial for assessing its reliability and relevance. There are exceptions to the hearsay rule, but none of them seem to apply here:\n\n- The statement may not fall under any recognized exception such as present sense impression, business records, statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment, etc., since these typically involve spontaneous or formal statements made under certain circumstances that do not apply to a conversation between two individuals about a past event.\n- The statement is not a prior inconsistent statement that might be used to impeach the witness's credibility.\n- The statement is not a statement against interest that the declarant would not otherwise make, which is another hearsay exception.\n- The statement is not a statement made under the belief of impending death, which is also an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nTherefore, without more context or specific rules that would allow this type of statement to be admitted, the commissioner's testimony about his predecessor's statement would likely be considered inadmissible hearsay."
