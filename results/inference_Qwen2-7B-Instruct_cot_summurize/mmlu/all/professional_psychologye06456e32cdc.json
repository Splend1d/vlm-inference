This technique involves connecting new information to existing knowledge, creating analogies, or providing examples to deepen understanding and aid in retention. It's not about simple repetition (option B), over-practice beyond necessary proficiency (option C), or verbalizing thoughts out loud (option D), though those can sometimes be part of elaborative rehearsal if they help in forming connections between new and existing concepts."
