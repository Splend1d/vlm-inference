The parent(s) provide(s) written consent and the child assents verbally to participate in therapy.\n\nThis option ensures that both the legal guardian (the parent(s) - who can legally give consent on behalf of the child due to their age - and the child themselves, who may have the capacity to understand and agree to the therapy, are both involved in the decision-making process. It adheres to ethical principles related to informed consent, which require that all participants (or their legal representatives when applicable) fully understand the nature of the therapy and agree to it voluntarily. Verbal assent from the child adds an additional layer of protection and ensures that the child's wishes are considered."
