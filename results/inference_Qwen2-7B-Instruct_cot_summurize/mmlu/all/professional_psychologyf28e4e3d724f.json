Factors such as health status, cognitive abilities, life experiences, social support networks, and cultural backgrounds can greatly influence how an elderly person perceives and copes with various challenges. Therefore, therapists who work with older adults need to be sensitive to these individual differences and tailor their approaches accordingly. This might involve using different therapeutic techniques or adapting the pace of sessions to accommodate varying levels of physical and cognitive ability."
