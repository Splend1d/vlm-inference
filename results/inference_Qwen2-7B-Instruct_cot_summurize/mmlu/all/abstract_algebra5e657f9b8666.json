                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement individually:\n\n**Statement 1**: \"Every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.\"\n\nThis statement is generally true. The definition of a quotient ring \\(R/I\\) ( for an ideal \\(I\\) in a ring \\(R\\) involves the equivalence classes of elements in \\(R\\) where two elements are considered equivalent if their difference lies in \\(I\\). If \\(R\\) is commutative, then this property is preserved in the quotient ring because addition and multiplication in \\(R\\) are both commutative operations. Hence, if \\(a + I = b + I\\) and \\(c + I = d + I\\) in \\(R/I\\), it follows that \\((a + c) + I = ( (b + d) + I\\) due to the commutativity in \\(R\\), thus preserving commutativity in \\(R/I\\).\n\n**Statement 2**: \"An ideal \\(N\\) in a ring \\(R\\) with unity \\(1\\) is all of \\(R\\) if and only if \\(1\\) is in \\(N\\).\"\n\nThis statement is false. While it's tempting to think that if \\(1 \\in N\\), then \\(N\\) cannot be all of \\(R\\), the correct interpretation is nuanced. It's not just about whether \\(1\\) is in \\(N\\), but also how \\(N\\) interacts with \\(1\\). For instance, consider the ring of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and the ideal \\(N = 2\\mathbb{Z}\\) ( (the set of even integers). Even though \\(1 \\notin N\\), \\(N\\) does contain elements that can be used to generate the entire ring through multiplication by other elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Thus, an ideal containing \\(1\\) is indeed \\(R\\) itself ( because any element of \\(R\\) can be reached by multiplying \\(1\\) by that element. However, an ideal not containing \\(1\\) (like \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) ) is not necessarily all of \\(R\\), as it excludes at least one element (\\(1\\)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. False, True** for the statements, respectively."
