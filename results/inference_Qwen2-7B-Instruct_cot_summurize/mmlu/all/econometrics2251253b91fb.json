An entity fixed effects model\n\nThis is because the equation includes a term $\\mu_i$, which represents an individual-specific effect (also known as a fixed effect or intercept for each entity $i$. This term allows for unobserved heterogeneity that is constant over time but varies across entities, which is a characteristic of fixed effects models. There is no explicit time fixed effect or a term that would suggest a pure time series model or a random effects model."
