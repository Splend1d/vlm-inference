We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find these values.\n\nFor the 10th percentile, the z-score is approximately -1.28.\nFor the 90th percentile, the z-score is approximately 1.28.\n\nNow, we will use the z-score formula to solve for \\( X \\) for both the lower and upper bounds of our desired interval:\n\nFor the lower bound:\n\\[ -1.28 = \\frac{(X_{lower} - 167)}{76} \\]\nSolving for \\( X_{lower} \\):\n\\[ X_{lower} = -1.28 \\times 76 + 167 \\]\n\\[ X_{lower} = -96.28 + 167 \\]\n\\[ X_{lower} \\approx 70.72 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest minute, \\( X_{lower} \\approx 71 \\) minutes.\n\nFor the upper bound:\n\\[ 1.28 = \\frac{(X_{upper} - 167)}{76} \\]\nSolving for \\( X_{upper} \\):\n\\[ X_{upper} = 1.28 \\times 76 + 167 \\]\n\\[ X_{upper} = 96.28 + 167 \\]\n\\[ X_{upper} \\approx 263.28 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest minute, \\( X_{upper} \\approx 264 \\) minutes.\n\nTherefore, the interval that contains the middle 80% of durations is approximately 71 minutes to 264 minutes.\n\nThe correct answer is **C. 70 minutes to 264 minutes**."
