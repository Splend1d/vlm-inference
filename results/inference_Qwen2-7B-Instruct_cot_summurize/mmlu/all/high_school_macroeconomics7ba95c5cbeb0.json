                    "text": "The correct answer is D. In the short run, there is typically a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment, as indicated by the downward-sloping Phillips curve. This means that when unemployment is low, inflation tends to be high, and vice versa. However, in the long run, the Phillips curve is considered to be vertical at the natural rate of unemployment. This implies that there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the long run; policies cannot permanently reduce unemployment below its natural rate without causing inflation to rise."
