There is no violation of property rights or harm inflicted on others in this scenario.\n\nScenario 2: Smelling fruit at a grocery store is a common practice for assessing ripeness and quality. It is not considered intrusive or disrespectful to the store or other customers. This action is part of making an informed decision about purchasing food items."
