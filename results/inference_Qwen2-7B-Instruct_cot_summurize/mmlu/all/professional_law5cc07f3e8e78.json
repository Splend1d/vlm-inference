The current lessee of the premises, who had made substantial improvements to the property, wanted to buy at the full list price but needed extra time. He paid $10,000 for an option to be added to the lease, giving him an option to buy on or before Sept. 1. The option stated that all notices required under it \"shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the party to receive the Notice\" That notice was required by Sept. 1. Buyer called Seller on Aug. 25 and told her that he was exercising the option, but Seller did not remember the words used. The Buyer sent written intent to exercise it by first class mail on Aug. 29 but the Seller later testified that she did not receive it until September 3. On September 10 she notified Buyer that the option expired and the deal was off. Buyer filed a specific performance action to compel the transaction. Is it likely that the Equity Court will grant the request for specific performance?\n\nA. Yes, the exercise of an option is not considered to be a situation where \"time is of the essence\" of the agreement, and options are liberally enforced so that the benefit of the bargain is not unreasonably lost.\nB. Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.\nC. No, because the Seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date.\nD. No, because option contracts are strictly enforced and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed due to the need to have commercial predictability in such transactions.\n"

Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.\n\nSpecific performance is an equitable remedy that courts may order when monetary damages are not sufficient to compensate the injured party. In this case, the lessee wants to purchase the property and has exercised his option to do so. The question is whether the court will grant specific performance despite the delay in sending the notice.\n\nGiven that the delay was minimal ( four days from the deadline, and considering that the lessee would suffer hardship if the option were not honored, the court might be inclined to enforce the contract. Additionally, the notice requirement was not absolutely tied to any of the specified methods ( personal delivery, commercial delivery service, or certified mail with a return receipt, suggesting flexibility in how the notice could be provided.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that specific performance can still be denied if the party seeking it would be substantially prejudiced by enforcing the contract, or if there are other compelling reasons against granting the remedy. In this case, the potential prejudice to the seller by having to sell after the original expiration date could also be considered. Thus, the decision would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, including any additional arguments made by either party.\n\nIn summary, while the lessee might have a strong case for specific performance based on the minor delay, minimal harm caused, and flexibility in notice methods, the final decision would ultimately rest with the court, taking into account all relevant factors."
