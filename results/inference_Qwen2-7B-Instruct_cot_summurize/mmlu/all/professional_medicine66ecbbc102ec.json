On the second day after admission he developed a pneumothorax on the right side that required tube thoracostomy. An air leak is noted for the next 24 hours, which now has stopped. However, the patient has become restless and combative. Breath sounds are diminished in the right side of the chest and the patient now has tachycardia. Blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. After ordering a STAT portable x-ray of the chest, which of the following is the most appropriate step?\n\nA. Administer \u03b2-blocking medications\nB. Administer alprazolam\nC. Remove the patient from the ventilator and ventilate him with a bag-valve mask\nD. Reposition the chest tube\n"

Reposition the chest tube.\n\nThe patient's symptoms (restlessness, combative behavior, diminished breath sounds on the right side, tachycardia, and possible worsening of the pneumothorax ( indicate that the current management might not be effective. The patient may need reassessment of the placement or function of the chest tube to ensure it is properly placed and functioning correctly. This could involve repositioning the chest tube or adjusting its size or location if necessary.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not directly address the underlying issue of the worsening pneumothorax and potential re-expansion of the lung. Administering \u03b2-blocking medications or alprazolam may help manage symptoms but do not directly address the mechanical ventilation or pneumothorax situation. Removing the patient from the ventilator (option C) would require careful consideration as it could potentially worsen respiratory status if not done under strict clinical supervision and monitoring."
