The suffering of the puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas the suffering of animals on factory farms is simply a by-product of the conditions dictated by economic considerations.\nC.

If this specific moral differentiation was not discussed by Norcross in the context of comparing Fred's actions with those of consumers of factory-raised meat, then option B is the correct answer."
