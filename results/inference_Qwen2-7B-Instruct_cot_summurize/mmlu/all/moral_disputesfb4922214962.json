She argues that the distinction between actively causing death (killing, and allowing someone to die without taking active steps to prevent it (letting die, has significant moral implications. This is because the former involves an intervention, while the latter does not.\n\nFoot appeals to:\n\nA. Rights of noninterference: In her view, there is a right not to be interfered with in one's life, which includes a right not to have one's death hastened through active intervention. Thus, actively causing death might violate this right, whereas letting someone die without such an intervention might be seen as respecting it.\n\nB. Rights to goods and services: While this option is not directly addressed by Foot in the context of the killing/letting die distinction, her focus on actions and their moral weight implies considerations about what actions respect or violate the entitlements of individuals. The distinction between killing and letting die can be seen as a question of respecting someone's right to live, which could be framed in terms of rights to goods and services related to health care and survival.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. both A and B\n\nFoot's analysis involves both the concept of noninterference rights and the rights to goods and services, as these ideas help frame the moral significance of the distinction she draws between killing and letting die."
