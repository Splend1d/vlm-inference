While it's true that the mean of a t-distribution is 0, the standard deviation (often referred to as the variance) is not necessarily 1. The standard deviation (or variance) of a t-distribution depends on its degrees of freedom (df). Specifically, the variance of a t-distribution is df/(df-2) for df > 2. So, the standard deviation will be the square root of this value, which means it can vary depending on the degrees of freedom."
