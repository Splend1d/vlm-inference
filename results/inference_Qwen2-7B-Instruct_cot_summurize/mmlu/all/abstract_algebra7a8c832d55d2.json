This can be constructed by taking the direct sum of \\(n\\) copies of the integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nStatement 2 is false. A finitely generated abelian group being free abelian does not solely depend on its Betti number equaling the number of elements in some generating set. For instance, consider the infinite cyclic group \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), which is freely generated by a single element and has a Betti number of 1 ( since it can be thought of as having one independent generator. However, this group is not free abelian in the sense that it is not the direct sum of infinitely many copies of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) ( because it is generated by a single element. Therefore, the statement that a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian just because its Betti number matches the number of elements in some generating set is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is C. True, False."
