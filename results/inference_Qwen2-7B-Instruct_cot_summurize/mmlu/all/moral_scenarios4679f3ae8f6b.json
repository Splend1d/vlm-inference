Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, removing a red sock from your roommate's white laundry might be considered an oversight or a mistake rather than a deliberate wrongdoing, especially if there was no malicious intent involved. It could be seen as not respecting someone else's belongings, but it's not typically viewed as a morally wrong act unless it leads to significant harm or inconvenience.\n\nIn Scenario 2, ignoring someone else's work and taking credit for it by getting a good grade is clearly morally wrong. This action involves dishonesty and theft of intellectual credit, which goes against principles of fairness, honesty, and respect for others' achievements. It's a violation of academic integrity and ethical standards."
