The center weighed 170 pounds and was stocky in build. The quarterback was lanky and weighed about 145 pounds. The center and the quarterback often engaged in friendly tests of strength, such as arm wrestling and weight lifting contests, to see who was stronger. One afternoon, both youngsters were in the school gymnasium getting ready for football practice. As they were putting on their football uniforms, the center turned to the quarterback and said, \"Hey, weakling, why don't you punch me in the chest with your best shot?\" The quarterback replied, \"No, I'm afraid I might hurt you. \" The center then said, \"Are you kidding? You can't hurt me. C'mon, give me your best shot. \" The center stood up, stuck out his muscular chest, and prepared to have the quarterback hit him. The quarterback proceeded to cock his fist and then punched the center in the chest as hard as he could. Immediately thereafter, the center slumped to the floor, gasping for air. Realizing that the center was seriously hurt, the quarterback tried to render assistance but to no avail. Seconds later the center stopped breathing and died. Unknown to either the center or the quarterback, the center had a defective heart and suffered a heart attack as a result of the blow to the chest. In a wrongful death action, the quarterback will likely\n\nA. be held responsible, because he committed a battery by hitting the center in the chest.\nB. be held responsible, because the center's consent was ineffective.\nC. not be held responsible, because the center's consent was effective.\nD. not be held responsible, because the quarterback delivered the punch with greater strength than the center anticipated.\n"

                    "text": "In this scenario, the quarterback's actions led directly to the death of the center due to the center's pre-existing medical condition, which was unknown to the quarterback. In legal terms, the concept of \"assumption of risk\" does not apply here since the risk was not foreseeable. Additionally, the idea of \"consent\" is not applicable when discussing battery, as it pertains to one party intentionally causing harmful or offensive contact with another.\n\nThe key legal principle here is whether the quarterback's actions were a direct cause of the fatal injury. Given that the center died immediately after being struck in the chest, and considering the medical condition involved, the quarterback's punch was the proximate cause of the death. \n\nIn tort law, particularly in cases involving wrongful death, the duty of care owed by the defendant (in this case, the quarterback) must be considered. The standard of care includes avoiding acts that are, under the circumstances, are likely to cause harm. Here, the quarterback, despite intending a harmless gesture, did not foresee the serious health risks posed to the center.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is:\n\nC. not be held responsible, because the center's consent was effective.\n\nThis conclusion assumes that consent to engage in physical activities, like football practice, is generally valid and considered effective, even if the participant has a pre-existing condition that is not disclosed. However, it's important to note that legal outcomes can vary significantly based on jurisdiction and specific details of the case. Factors such as the age of consent laws, the level of awareness of potential risks, and any contributory negligence on the part of the center could influence the final judgment."
