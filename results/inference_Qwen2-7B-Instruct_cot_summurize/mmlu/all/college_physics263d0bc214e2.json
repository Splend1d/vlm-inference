According to this theorem, each degree of freedom in the system contributes \\(\\frac{1}{2}kT\\) to the total energy, where \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nSince a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator has three degrees of freedom ( (translational motion in each of the x, y, and z directions), the total energy \\( E \\) would be:\n\n\\[ E = 3 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2}kT \\right) = \\frac{3}{2}kT \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( \\frac{3}{2}kT \\)"
