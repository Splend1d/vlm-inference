The state's highest court has construed the code as imposing strict and vicarious liability to the extent allowed by the federal Constitution. The evidence at trial established that the owner's company had sold contaminated meat that had sickened hundreds of consumers. It further showed, however, that the owner had been out of the country when the meat was sold and had had no reason to know that any of the meat was contaminated. The jury convicted the owner, and the court sentenced him to a large fine and probation. On appeal, the owner has challenged the sufficiency of the trial evidence. Should the appellate court uphold the conviction?\n\nA. No, because there was insufficient proof of the owner's actus reus.\nB. No, because there was insufficient proof of the owner's mens rea.\nC. Yes, because an appellate court cannot second-guess a jury's verdict.\nD. Yes, because the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n"

An appellate court generally will not overturn a jury's decision unless it can clearly see that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. This is often referred to as the \"clearly erroneous\" standard or the \"substantial evidence\" test.\n\nGiven the description of the case:\n\n- The state's highest court has construed the code as imposing strict and vicarious liability, which suggests that the law may allow for liability even if the owner did not directly commit the act (but instead is held responsible due to their position in the company.\n- The evidence established that the company sold contaminated meat, which sickened hundreds of consumers.\n- It also showed that the owner was out of the country at the time the meat was sold and had no reason to know that the meat was contaminated.\n\nIf the jury convicted the owner based on the evidence presented, and assuming this evidence met the legal standards for establishing the elements of the crime under the state's laws, including the application of strict liability where applicable, then the conviction should be upheld on appeal. The fact that the owner was unaware of the contamination and was not physically present during the sale might be relevant to proving intent or knowledge ( (mens rea), but depending on the specifics of the law and the evidence, it could still be sufficient to establish liability under a strict liability standard. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate choice."
