In 1990, Albert drafted a document for a client's estate plan that unfortunately violated the rule against perpetuities. Upon the testator's death in 2004, the mistake was discovered. Because of the error, the estate plan was not admitted to probate so the assets were distributed under the state intestacy statute. Gordon Greedy was named as a substantial taker under the estate plan, but did not take under the intestate statute since he was not a relative. The state statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years. If Gordon sues Albert for professional malpractice in 2005, the best defense Albert can assert is\n\nA. The statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.\nB. The legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid.\nC. The rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in the locality of Littletown to understand.\nD. Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan.\n"

The statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.\n\nThe best defense Albert can assert here is option A: the statute of limitations has run on Gordon's potential claim. Since the error in the estate plan was discovered in 2004 and the state statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years, any suit would need to be filed by 2007. Since Gordon sues Albert in 2005, it falls within this time frame. However, if Gordon waited until 2008 or later to file, his claim would likely be barred by the statute of limitations. \n\nOptions B, C, and D do not provide a valid defense against a malpractice claim based on the facts provided:\n\nB. The legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid. Payment of fees does not affect the validity or outcome of a professional malpractice claim, which focuses on the quality of services rendered.\n\nC. The rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in the locality of Littletown to understand. This is not a valid defense because complexity of the law does not excuse a lawyer from providing competent service.\n\nD. Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan. This argument is irrelevant because the issue pertains to the attorney's performance, not the beneficiary's eligibility according to the will."
