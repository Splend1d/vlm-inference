Increase irritability.\n\nSleep deprivation can have several negative effects on your body and mind, including:\n\n- **Disrupting Attention**: When you don't get enough sleep, it can affect your ability to focus, pay attention, and make decisions. This can lead to decreased productivity and efficiency in tasks that require concentration.\n\n- **Increasing Irritability**: Sleep deprivation often makes people more sensitive and prone to frustration or anger. It can affect your mood, making you more likely to react negatively to minor annoyances or stressors.\n\nIt's important to note that these effects can also include A. Increasing weight, as lack of sleep can disrupt hormones that regulate appetite, potentially leading to overeating and weight gain. However, this is not a direct effect of \"a small amount\" of sleep deprivation but rather a cumulative effect over time with chronic sleep loss. B. Improving sleep quality is generally not a result of sleep deprivation; instead, it's the opposite - sleep quality typically decreases when you do not get enough sleep."
