By definition, a ring homomorphism \\(f: R \\to S\\) is a function that preserves the operations of addition and multiplication in rings. The kernel of \\(f\\), denoted as \\(\\ker(f)\\), is the set of elements in \\(R\\) that map to the zero element of \\(S\\). If \\(f\\) is one-to-one (i.e., injective), then each element in \\(R\\) maps to a unique element in \\(S\\), and no two different elements in \\(R\\) can map to the same element in \\(S\\). This means that the only element in \\(R\\) that can map to the zero element in \\(S\\) under \\(f\\) is the zero element itself, so \\(\\ker(f) = \\{0\\}\\). Conversely, if \\(\\ker(f) = \\{0\\}\\), any two elements \\(a, b \\in R\\) that map to the same element in \\(S\\) must satisfy \\(f(a) = f(b)\\), implying \\(f(a-b) = 0\\). Since \\(a - b \\in \\ker(f)\\), it follows that \\(a - b = 0\\), hence \\(a = b\\), showing \\(f\\) is one-to-one.\n\n**Statement 2**: \"Q is an ideal in R\".\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true without additional context or clarification about what \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) represent. In abstract algebra, an ideal \\(I\\) of a ring \\(R\\) is a subset of \\(R\\) that is closed under addition and has the property that, for every element \\(r\\) in \\(R\\) and every element \\(i\\) in \\(I\\), both \\(ri\\) and \\(ir\\) are are in \\(I\\). Without specifying what \\(Q\\) is in relation to \\(R\\), we cannot definitively say whether \\(Q\\) is an ideal in \\(R\\).\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- **Statement 1** is **True**.\n- **Statement 2** depends on the context and cannot be universally determined as **True** or **False** without more information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choice is:\n\n**C. True, False**"
