No, there are no ciphers with perfect secrecy\n\nPerfect secrecy means that the ciphertext provides absolutely no information about the plaintext without knowledge of the key. The one-time pad (which uses a truly random key that is as long as the message and is used only once, is the only known encryption scheme that can provide perfect secrecy under certain conditions. However, it requires that the key be kept secret, never reused, and be truly random.\n\nStream ciphers, while very efficient for encrypting data streams, do not inherently guarantee perfect secrecy. Their security depends on various factors including the strength of their pseudorandom number generator (PRG), the key management practices, and other cryptographic assumptions. If the PRng is not secure, or if the key is not managed properly, then the stream cipher may not provide the level of security needed for perfect secrecy.\n\nTherefore, while a stream cipher can potentially be made secure through the use of a secure PRng and proper key management, it cannot inherently guarantee perfect secrecy like the one-time pad does."
