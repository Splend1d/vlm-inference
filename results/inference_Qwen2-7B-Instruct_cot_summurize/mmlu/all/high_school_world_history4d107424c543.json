Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia\n"

The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\n\nThis option supports Walter Rodney's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment because it directly relates to the exploitation of African resources (in this case, human beings) by European powers. The slave trade was a significant part of the colonial economy, driving the growth of cash crops in the Americas and providing a cheap labor force for European industries. This form of exploitation drained African wealth and disrupted local economies, contributing to the underdevelopment of the continent. The other options involve European colonization and trade but do not specifically address the role of capitalist exploitation in causing underdevelopment."
