She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. She does not smoke. There is no history of lung disease. She weighs 54 kg (120 lb) and is 163 cm (64 in) tall. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?\n\nA. Decreased plasma renin activity\nB. Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations\nC. Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations\nD. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\n"

                    "text": "The most likely mechanism of this patient's cough, given her hypertension treated with enalapril, is:\n\nD. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\n\nEnalapril is an ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) inhibitor. It works by blocking the action of the enzyme ACE, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. When ACE is inhibited, angiotensin II levels decrease, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. However, this also leads to an increase in bradykinin, a substance that can cause inflammation and pain. Increased bradykinin levels might contribute to coughing as a side effect of ACE inhibitors. \n\nIt's important to note that cough is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors, affecting up to 20% of patients, and usually resolves over time or with dose adjustment. Other the other options listed:\n\nA. Decreased plasma renin activity - This would be the expected outcome of using an ACE inhibitor like enalapril.\n\nB. Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations - This is actually one of the primary actions of ACE inhibitors, reducing angiotensin II levels.\n\nC. Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations - This is not a direct effect of ACE inhibition; instead, it would occur before the conversion to angiotensin II by ACE."
