And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.\"\nLetter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879\nIncidents such as those described by the author of the letter were used by the British government to do which of the following?\n\nA. Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu\nB. Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them\nC. Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa\nD. Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism\n"

This could include using the damages caused by the Zulu forces as a justification for a casus belli (a reason or pretext for going to war. Additionally, it might also be part of their strategy to assert their responsibility towards their citizens living in South Africa, by highlighting the need for military intervention to protect them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would likely encompass elements of both A ( issuing a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu, and C. severing its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa. However, since these options are not mutually exclusive and could both apply, the closest correct answer would be a combination of these two choices, which is not directly listed among the options provided. The options given do not accurately reflect the complex interplay of motives and actions that might be taken by a government in such a situation, but if forced to choose, option A aligns more closely with the concept of justifying going to war based on the damages caused."
