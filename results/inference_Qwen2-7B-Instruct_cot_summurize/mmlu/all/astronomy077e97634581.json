However, they differ in their atmospheric shear. Jupiter exhibits a high degree of shear between its bands of circulation at different latitudes, which means there is a significant difference in wind speed between higher and lower latitudes. This is less pronounced or not as significant on Saturn. Therefore, the statement about \"significant shear\" being not a similarity between Saturn and Jupiter's atmospheres is accurate."
