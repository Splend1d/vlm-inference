We often feel a sense of validation and positive reinforcement when we encounter someone who agrees with our views or beliefs. This can make us feel understood and appreciated, which is a strong motivator for attraction.\n\nB. The agreement of the other person can indeed bolster our sense of rightness or correctness. When someone else affirms our opinions, it can increase our confidence in those views and make us feel more secure in expressing them.\n\nC. Anticipating positive interactions with someone who shares our attitudes can also contribute to attraction. Similarity often leads to smoother communication and shared experiences, which can foster feelings of connection and liking.\n\nThus, all three options (A, B, and C\u2014can contribute to why we might be attracted to someone who is similar to us in attitudes."
