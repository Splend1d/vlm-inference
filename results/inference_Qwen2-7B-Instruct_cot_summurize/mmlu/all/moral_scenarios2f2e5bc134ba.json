Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn scenario 1, the act of \"shoppinglifted the Porsche\" involves taking property that doesn't belong to you without permission, which is clearly morally wrong and illegal. \n\nIn scenario 2, guarding your best friend's dark secrets, unless those secrets cause harm to others or prevent someone from receiving necessary help, is generally not considered morally wrong. It can be seen as a demonstration of loyalty and trustworthiness, although it might have implications depending on the context and the nature of the secrets."
