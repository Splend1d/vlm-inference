Illicit cash flow to tax havens from rich countries exceeds aid to the world's poor: This suggests that money intended for development and poverty alleviation is being siphoned off by elites in rich countries, reducing the resources available to those who need it most.\n\nB. The implementation of neoliberal economic policy has had mixed and at worst adverse impacts on the economic and social rights of the world's poor: Neoliberal policies often prioritize free market principles over social welfare, which can lead to increased inequality, reduced access to essential services, and economic instability for vulnerable populations.\n\nC. Wealthy nations press their political and economic advantages to secure unfair trade agreements with poor countries: This indicates that powerful nations may exploit weaker economies through trade agreements that disproportionately benefit the former at the expense of the latter, undermining economic sovereignty and exacerbating poverty in poorer nations.\n\nThus, Ashford might argue that these interconnected issues collectively demonstrate how global social institutions fail to protect and uphold the rights of the world's poor."
