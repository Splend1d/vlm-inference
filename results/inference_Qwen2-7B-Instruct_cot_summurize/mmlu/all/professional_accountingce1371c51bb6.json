According to the Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), the auditor is required to obtain an understanding of the entity's internal control, including the accounting policies used by the entity. If the entity uses a different basis for preparing its financial statements than what is prescribed under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS), the auditor should note this in the auditor's report. However, the specific dollar amount of the effects of the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP does not need to be quantified and included in either the notes to the financial statements or the auditor's report. Instead, the auditor should disclose in the auditor's report that the financial statements have been prepared using a different basis of accounting than GAAP.\n\nTherefore, options A, C, and D are incorrect because they suggest that the dollar amount needs to be included either only in the auditor's report, both in the notes to the financial statements and the auditor's report, or that it need not be quantified at all."
