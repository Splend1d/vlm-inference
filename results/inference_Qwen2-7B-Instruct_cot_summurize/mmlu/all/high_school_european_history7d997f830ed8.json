And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him.

                    "text": "The encomienda system, a system of forced labor implemented during the colonization of the Americas, was influenced by several factors over time. Let's analyze each option given:\n\nA. The protests of the Catholic missionaries against abuses of forced labor: This option suggests that the system was ended due to moral or ethical reasons raised by religious figures. Historically, while missionaries did indeed protest against the harsh conditions and abuses inflicted upon indigenous peoples, they were often part of the colonial effort themselves and thus their impact on ending the system might have been limited. More significant actions were likely taken by the Spanish crown or other secular authorities.\n\nB. The lack of new land to assign to well-connected Spaniards and conquistadores: This option implies that the end of the encomienda system was due to a lack of resources, specifically land, to continue distributing among the colonists. While the exhaustion of new territories might have played a role in the decline of the system, the direct cause for its termination would likely involve policy changes or legal actions taken by the Spanish crown rather than a natural resource limitation.\n\nC. The Spanish royal crown's desire to control the estates more directly: This option alignes closely with historical records. The Spanish crown indeed sought greater control over the colonies, including the means by which indigenous peoples were subjected to labor. This led to reforms and eventually the abolition of the encomienda system as a way to manage indigenous labor more directly through the establishment of the repartimiento system, which aimed to limit the amount of labor that could be demanded and to introduce some level of protection for the indigenous people.\n\nD. An increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas: This option suggests that the rise of a mixed-race population created a legal barrier that led to the abolition of the encomienda system. The prohibition of mestizos from working on encomiendas was indeed an aspect of the gradual shift away from the encomienda system, as it reflected a broader legal framework that sought to redefine the social and labor structures within the colonies.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is **B. The lack of new land to assign to well-connected Spaniards and conquistadores**, because it does not accurately reflect a primary reason for the end of the encomienda system based on historical context. The other options\u2014protests by Catholic missionaries, the Spanish crown's desire for direct control, and the legal restrictions on mestizos\u2014do provide plausible explanations for the eventual abolition of the encomienda system."
