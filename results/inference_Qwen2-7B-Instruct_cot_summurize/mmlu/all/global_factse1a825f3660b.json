At that time, about 35% of Southerners approved of school desegregation, compared to about 80% of non-Southerners. This means that the difference was approximately 45 percentage points, closer to option B ( 40%, than any other choice provided.\n\nIt's important to note that these numbers reflect the deep divisions of the era and the ongoing struggle for civil rights in the United States. The differences in approval rates were influenced by various factors including political ideology, social norms, and personal experiences related to segregation and discrimination."
