The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, published by the American Psychological Association (APA, serves as a comprehensive guide for professionals in the fields of education and psychology. It outlines ethical guidelines, standards for test development, administration, scoring, interpretation, and reporting. These standards provide criteria by which tests and manuals should be judged, and they outline what tests should strive to meet in terms of quality, fairness, and utility. They do not provide minimum training requirements for administering or interpreting tests (which would typically be covered by specific certification or licensing bodies), nor do they derail legal requirements for test use (which are are governed by laws and regulations at various levels of government). Similarly, they do not simply list approved tests and manuals; rather, they offer guidance on how to evaluate and select such materials."
