Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal State is permitted to prevent and punish infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws. \n\nThis zone extends up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured, but it can be wider if necessary to effectively enforce these laws. It's designed to allow the coastal state to maintain control over its borders and to protect its economic interests within its maritime jurisdiction."
