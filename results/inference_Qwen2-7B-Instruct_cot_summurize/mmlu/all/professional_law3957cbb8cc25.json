However, the state in which they were married prohibits a couple from obtaining a divorce until they have resided in the state for at least 12 months. In an action by the couple challenging the constitutionality of the residency requirement of the state divorce law, the court will most likely declare the provision\n\nA. constitutional, because the requirement promotes a compelling state interest.\nB. constitutional, because it is within the area of state action.\nC. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\n"

In this context, the residency requirement could be seen as a barrier to exercising the right to seek a divorce that is not available to residents of other states, potentially infringing upon this constitutional right. Therefore, the court might find the provision unconstitutional under the privileges and immunities clause."
