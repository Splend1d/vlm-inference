Move the slits closer together.\n\nIn a double-slit interference experiment, the width of the fringes is determined by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x = \\frac{L \\lambda}{d} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta x \\) is the fringe width,\n- \\( L \\) is the distance from the slits to the screen,\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the light, and\n- \\( d \\) is the distance between the two slits.\n\nFrom this formula, it's clear that if you move the slits closer together (decreasing \\( d \\), the fringe width \\( \\Delta x \\) will increase. \n\nA. Using light of a shorter wavelength would decrease the fringe width because \\( \\lambda \\) is in the numerator.\nB. Moving the screen closer to the slits would decrease the fringe width because \\( L \\) is in the numerator.\nD. Using light with a lower wave speed does not directly affect the fringe width in this context since wave speed does not appear in the formula for fringe width in a double-slit experiment."
