It estimates the likelihood, or probability, of a toxic effect on exposed humans by analyzing the potential hazards (like toxicity data) and the exposure levels. This helps in understanding how likely it is that someone might experience adverse health effects due to exposure to a substance.\n\nB. In the context of food substances, risk assessment plays a crucial role in supporting decisions about safety. It helps regulatory bodies determine whether the consumption of certain foods or food additives poses an unacceptable risk to public health. \n\nC. Derived from the results of risk assessments, allowable daily intakes ( also known as tolerable upper intake levels or reference doses, provide guidance on the maximum amount of a substance that can be consumed over a lifetime without causing adverse health effects. These values are critical for setting safety standards for food, drugs, and other substances. \n\nTherefore, all the options provided are correct in the context of applying risk assessment to data on toxicity and human exposure."
