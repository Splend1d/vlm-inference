(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nLet's break down why each of these statements is true for a white noise process:\n\n(i) **A zero mean** - This means that the expected value of the process at any point in time is zero. In other words, if you were to average out all the values over a large number of observations, the result would be zero.\n\n(ii) **A constant variance** - White noise processes have a constant variance regardless of when you measure it. This property ensures that the spread or dispersion of the data points around the mean remains the same across different segments of the process.\n\n(iii) **Autocovariances that are constant** - For a white noise process, the autocovariance between two points in time depends only on whether the points are separated by a certain lag, not on the actual time at which they occur. Specifically, the autocovariance is non-zero only when the two points are exactly one time unit apart (for discrete-time processes, or at the same time for continuous-time processes, in which case it equals the variance of the process. For all other lags, the autocovariance is zero.\n\n(iv) **Autocovariances that are zero except at lag zero** - This statement is essentially a restatement of (iii). It means that the autocovariance function of the white noise process is non-zero only when the two time points are the same (lag 0), reflecting the fact that there is no correlation between different points in time for a white noise process, and this property holds for both discrete and continuous time settings.\n\nTherefore, all four statements accurately describe the characteristics of a white noise process."
