This growth often leads to higher spending and transactions within the economy. As consumers and businesses engage in more economic activities, they need more money to facilitate these transactions. This increased demand for money can lead to higher interest rates if the supply of money remains constant or increases at a slower rate than the demand. The higher interest rates reflect the higher cost of borrowing due to the greater demand for funds."
