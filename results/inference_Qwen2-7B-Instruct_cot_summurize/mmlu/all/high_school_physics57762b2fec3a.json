                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the rotational version of the work-energy theorem. The theorem states that the work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy. In this case, the work done is due to the friction force, and the change in kinetic energy corresponds to the sphere coming to rest.\n\nThe work done by the friction force \\(W\\) is equal to the force times the distance over which it acts:\n\\[ W = F \\cdot d \\]\nwhere \\(F = 2.0 \\, \\text{N}\\) is the friction force and \\(d = 0.30 \\, \\text{m}\\) is the distance from the sphere's center where the force acts.\n\nThe torque \\(\\tau\\) produced by the friction force is equal to the force times the radius \\(r\\), where \\(r\\) is the distance from the center to the point of application of the force:\n\\[ \\tau = F \\cdot r \\]\n\nSince the moment of inertia \\(I\\) of a solid sphere about its center is given by:\n\\[ I = \\frac{2}{5} m^2 \\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the sphere and \\(o\\) is its radius, but for this problem, we're interested in the moment of inertia about the point of application of the force, which is \\(I_{outer} = I + md^2\\), because the force is applied off-center. However, since we're only interested in the angular acceleration and not the exact moment of inertia, we can directly relate the torque to the angular acceleration \\(\\alpha\\) using Newton's second law for rotation:\n\\[ \\tau = I \\alpha \\]\n\nGiven that the sphere starts spinning at an angular speed \\(\\omega_0 = 20 \\, \\text{rad/s}\\) and comes to rest (\\(\\omega_f = 0\\)), we can find the angular acceleration \\(\\alpha\\) by considering the final and initial conditions. The angular displacement \\(\\theta\\) during the process can be found by integrating the angular velocity over time, but since we're looking for time, we can instead use the kinematic equation for rotational motion:\n\\[ \\omega_f = \\omega_0 + \\alpha t \\]\n\\[ 0 = 20 \\, \\text{rad/s} + \\alpha t \\]\n\nWe also know that the work done by the friction force is equal to the negative change in kinetic energy:\n\\[ W = -\\Delta KE \\]\n\\[ W = -\\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_f^2 + \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for work and simplifying:\n\\[ F \\cdot d = -\\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_f^2 + \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2 \\]\n\nSince \\(\\omega_f = 0\\), the equation simplifies further to:\n\\[ F \\cdot d = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2 \\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( \\tau = F \\cdot r \\)\n2. \\( W = F \\cdot d = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2 \\)\n\nWe need to find \\(t\\), so let's express \\(I\\) in terms of \\(m\\) and \\(o \\):\n\\[ I = \\frac{2}{5} mo^2 \\]\n\nBut we're more interested in finding \\(t\\) without explicitly calculating \\(I\\). From the first equation, we can express \\(r\\) as:\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\tau}{F} = \\frac{F \\cdot d}{F} = d \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(F \\cdot d\\) with \\(\\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2\\) from the second equation and rearrange to solve for \\(t\\):\n\\[ F \\cdot d = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2 = F \\cdot d \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{5} mo^2 \\right) \\omega_0^2 = F \\cdot d \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{5} mo^2 \\omega_0^2 = 2 \\cdot F \\cdot d \\]\n\\[ \\omega_0^2 = \\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot d}{ \\frac{1}{5} mo^2} \\]\n\\[ \\omega_0^2 = \\frac{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot F \\cdot d}{ \\frac{2}{5} mo^2} \\]\n\\[ \\omega_0^2 = \\frac{5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot F \\cdot d}{ mo^2} \\]\n\nFrom \\(\\omega_f"
