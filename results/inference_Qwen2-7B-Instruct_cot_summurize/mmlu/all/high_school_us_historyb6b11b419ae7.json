Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865\nWhich of the following specific developments contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15?\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\nB. Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\nD. Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n"

                    "text": "The statement provided by Colonel Samuel Thomas in his Congressional testimony from 1865 discusses the racial attitudes and treatment of African Americans during and after the Civil War, particularly in the southern United States. It highlights the deep-seated belief among some whites that African Americans ( referred to as \"Negroes\" at the time - were their property by \"natural right,\" and thus, the treatment of African Americans could be seen as acceptable under certain circumstances.\n\nFederalist #15, written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, is a series of essays originally published in New York newspapers between 1787 and 1788, advocating for the ratification of the United States Constitution. These essays are collectively known as the Federalist Papers. However, none of the Federalist Papers specifically address the racial attitudes and policies issues that are the focus of Colonel Thomas' testimony.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question of which development from the given options contributed to the sentiment expressed in Colonel Thomas' testimony would be none of the above, because the Federalist Papers themselves do not contain content that aligns with the historical context and sentiments described in the testimony related to race relations post-Civil War."
