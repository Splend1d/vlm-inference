A mixture where the potential energy of the mixture is the same as that of the individual solvents.\n\nIn an ideal solution, the assumption is made that there is no interaction between the solute and solvent molecules, or between the solvent molecules themselves, leading to no change in potential energy when they mix. This simplifies calculations for properties such as vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and freezing point depression compared to real solutions where intermolecular forces would cause deviations from ideal behavior.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that an \"ideal solution\" does not necessarily mean that the solution has the same physical properties as the individual solvents ( (option B), is colorless ( (option D), or that the solvents can be dissolved in all ratios ( (option A). These statements may hold true in some cases for certain ideal solutions, but they are not defining characteristics of an ideal solution in general."
