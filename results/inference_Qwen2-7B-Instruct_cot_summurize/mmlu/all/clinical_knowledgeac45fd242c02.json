A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features\n\nHaematemesis, or vomiting of blood, can be a sign of significant gastrointestinal bleeding. Symptoms such as low blood pressure (hypotension) and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia) indicate that the body is experiencing a severe response to the loss of blood, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, these symptoms would indeed be considered worrying in a patient with haematemesis. \n\nB. A pulse rate of 80/min in a patient taking Bisoprolol is reassuring: Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease. A normal resting heart rate for an adult is typically between 60-100 beats per minute, so a rate of 80/min might be considered reassuring for this patient. However, the pulse rate itself does not directly address the cause or severity of haematemesis.\n\nC. Abdominal pain is always present: While abdominal pain can sometimes accompany haematemesis, it is not always present. Other the cause of the bleeding may not involve the stomach, in which case there might be no associated abdominal pain.\n\nD. An alcohol history is not essential: An alcohol history is not necessarily essential to consider when assessing a patient with haematemesis. The cause could be due to various factors including but not limited to ulcers, varices, or other gastrointestinal conditions, and not just related to alcohol consumption."
