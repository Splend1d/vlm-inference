While it is a flexible tool for empirical analysis, its use often does not stem directly from theoretical economic relationships. \n\nVAR models are indeed useful for time-series forecasting (ii), which is one of their main advantages. They can handle multiple interrelated time series and provide forecasts for all variables simultaneously.\n\nOLS (Ordinary Least Squares) can be applied to each equation in a VAR model's reduced form, making it easier to estimate and interpret each individual relationship  (iv).\n\nHowever, VAR models are not typically highly parsimonious (iii). In fact, they can be quite complex due to the number of parameters that need to be estimated, especially when dealing with a large number of variables. This complexity contrasts with the notion of being \"typically highly parsimonious,\" which would suggest simplicity or few parameters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. ii) and (iv) only."
