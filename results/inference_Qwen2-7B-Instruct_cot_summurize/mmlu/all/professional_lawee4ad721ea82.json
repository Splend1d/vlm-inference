The informant gave the police explicit details about the extortion scheme: the defendant would be calling the victim from a public phone booth on a particular street corner on a certain date and time to make the extortionist demand. Without notif'ing the telephone company or seeking a warrant, the police installed an eavesdropping device on the public phone. At the time on the date specified by the informant, the defendant phoned the victim from the telephone booth and said, \"You better pay me $5,000 by next week or I'll kill you and your family. \" The defendant provided additional details about how and where to make the payoff. Based on the taped conversation, the police arrested the defendant and charged him with extortion. Prior to trial, the defendant's attorney moves to exclude the taped conversation from evidence. The defense motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.\nB. granted, because the police did not obtain prior approval of the telephone company before installing the eavesdropping device.\nC. denied, because the defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy.\nD. denied, because the police had probable cause based on the information supplied by the informant.\n"

However, the defendant does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a public phone booth. Public spaces, such as street corners and public phone booths, are generally considered areas where individuals have no expectation of privacy. Therefore, any surveillance or recording conducted in these public places does not violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThe fact that the police did not notify the telephone company or seek a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device is not relevant to the question of whether the defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in this context. The key consideration here is whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the public phone booth, and the answer is no. Thus, the court should deny the defense motion to exclude the taped conversation from evidence."
