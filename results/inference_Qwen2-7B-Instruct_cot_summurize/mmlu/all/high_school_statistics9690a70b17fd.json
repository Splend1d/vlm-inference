Expected frequencies should be whole numbers. \n\nIn a chi-square test for independence using a contingency table, the expected frequencies are calculated based on the null hypothesis and do not necessarily have to be whole numbers. They represent the expected counts under the assumption that there is no association between the variables. These values can be fractions or decimals. However, it's important that the expected frequency in each cell is not too small (typically at least 5 is recommended to meet the assumptions of the chi-square test, but this doesn't mean they need to be whole numbers."
