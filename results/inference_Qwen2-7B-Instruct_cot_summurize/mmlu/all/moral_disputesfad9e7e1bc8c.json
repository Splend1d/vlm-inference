This could include disturbing neighbors or affecting the peace and quiet of the surrounding community. It does not necessarily relate to the rights of the club to exclude outsiders (A), the equivalence of individual and group freedoms C), or all of the above D). Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement based on the given example."
