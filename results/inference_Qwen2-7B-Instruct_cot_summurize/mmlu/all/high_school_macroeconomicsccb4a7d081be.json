Conversely, a decrease in the money supply leads to higher interest rates, which can discourage borrowing and spending, reducing aggregate demand. This reduction in spending could lead to lower prices (deflation) and lower output in the economy. However, it's important to note that actual outcomes can be influenced by many factors and may not always follow these predictions exactly."
