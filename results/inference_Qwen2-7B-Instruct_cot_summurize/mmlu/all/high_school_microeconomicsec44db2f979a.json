A negative cross-price elasticity\n\nWhen two goods have a negative cross-price elasticity, it means that an increase in the price of one good leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the other good. This indicates that the two goods are complements, as they are often used together. For example, gasoline and cars are typically considered complements because if the price of gasoline increases, people tend to drive less, which reduces their need for gasoline and also potentially decreases car sales."
