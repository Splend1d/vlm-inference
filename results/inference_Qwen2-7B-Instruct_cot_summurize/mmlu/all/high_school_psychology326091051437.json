The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is traditionally calculated as the mental age (as determined by standardized tests) divided by the chronological age, multiplied by 100. \n\nThis formula was developed by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon in the early 20th century to assess intelligence. It's worth noting that modern IQ testing and interpretations have evolved since then, with different tests being used and different ways of interpreting scores."
