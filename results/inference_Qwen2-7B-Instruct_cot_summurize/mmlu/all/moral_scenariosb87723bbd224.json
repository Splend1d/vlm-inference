It is generally seen as a responsible and honest action, reflecting diligence and effort.\n- In Scenario 2, leaving your sister's jersey in her closet after she asked you not to wear it is also not considered morally wrong. This action respects her request and personal property. However, if there was a misunderstanding or miscommunication leading to this situation, better communication might be needed to avoid such an outcome. But under the given scenario, the action itself does not involve any wrongdoing."
