This is because these values - justice, fairness, and respect for others - often underpin the establishment and understanding of rights and the concept of \"desert\" or deservingness in ethical and moral contexts. They provide a framework for how we should treat each other and make decisions about entitlements and responsibilities.\n\n- Justice involves the fair and impartial administration of laws and principles to ensure everyone receives what they are entitled to.\n- Fairness refers to treating people equitably and not giving preferential treatment based on irrelevant factors.\n- Respect for other persons involves acknowledging their autonomy, dignity, and worth, which can influence how rights are perceived and upheld.\n\nIn a philosophical or ethical context, these values might be considered foundational because they can serve as guiding principles before one even considers what rights or deserts exist. They help define what rights should look like and who deserves what based on moral considerations rather than just legal or empirical criteria."
