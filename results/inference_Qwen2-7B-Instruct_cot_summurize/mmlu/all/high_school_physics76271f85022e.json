According to the conservation of energy and the principles of mechanics, the amplitude of oscillations in a spring-block system is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the block. This relationship can be described by the equation for the angular frequency of a mass-spring system:\n\n\\[ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\omega \\) is the angular frequency, \\( k \\) is the spring constant, and \\( m \\) is the mass of the block. As the mass increases, the angular frequency decreases, leading to smaller oscillations and thus a decreased amplitude. \n\nTherefore, adding mass to the oscillating system results in a decrease in the amplitude of the oscillations."
