Expectations: These refer to an individual's anticipation of outcomes or consequences associated with different actions.\n\nB. Choice opportunities: This refers to the alternatives available for action and the potential paths one can take in a given situation.\n\nC. Problems: This stream involves the identification and understanding of the issues or challenges that need to be addressed through decision-making.\n\nD. Solutions: This is the set of possible courses of action or strategies that can address the problems identified.\n\nOut of these options, all A, B, C, and D typically form part of the key streams identified by March in 1988. However, if we have to pick one that could potentially be considered as not always forming an explicit part of the decision-making process in every context, it might be \"Solutions.\" While solutions are form part of the decision-making process, their existence and identification may not always be straightforward, especially in highly ambiguous environments where the very nature of problems might not be clearly defined. The other three options (Expectations, Choice Opportunities, and Problems\u2014are more directly linked to the decision-making process."
