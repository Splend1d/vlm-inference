Increased peripheral vascular resistance\n\nIncreased peripheral vascular resistance is the mechanism that is most likely to increase this patient's blood pressure further. The blood pressure is calculated as the product of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (BP = CO x SVR). If the cardiac output remains constant and normal (80/min, and if the systemic vascular resistance increases, then the blood pressure will increase. In this case, the systolic blood pressure is high (165 mmHg, indicating increased resistance in the periphery of the circulatory system. \n\nThe other options are not likely to increase blood pressure in this scenario:\n\nA. Decreased cardiac output: This would decrease blood pressure.\n\nB. Decreased pulse: Pulse refers to the heart rate, which is already normal at 80/min. Decreasing it further would not increase blood pressure.\n\nC. Decreased stroke volume: Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out by the heart with each beat. Decreasing it would decrease cardiac output and thus decrease blood pressure."
