Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n\\[ I \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2} \\]\n\nWhere \\(I\\) is the intensity and \\(r\\) is the distance from the source. If we consider two different epochs, say \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\), with temperatures \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) respectively, and assume that the expansion rate of the universe has been consistent ( meaning the scale factor \\(a\\) between these two epochs scales with the temperature as \\(a \\propto T^{-1/2}\\), then the distances at these epochs would be related as follows:\n\nIf \\(T_1 = 12K\\) and \\(T_2 = 3K\\), then \\(T_1/T_2 = 4\\). Given that the scale factor \\(a\\) scales inversely proportional to the square root of the temperature, the ratio of the distances \\(d_1/d_2\\) would be the square root of the inverse of \\(T_1/T_2\\), which is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d_1}{d_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_2}{T_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{12}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the distances at the higher temperature epoch (when the universe's temperature was 12K, would be half those at the current temperature epoch when the universe's temperature is about 3K."
