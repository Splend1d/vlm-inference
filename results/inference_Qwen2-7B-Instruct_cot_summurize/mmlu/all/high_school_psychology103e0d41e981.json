Among the options provided, the question that best frames this controversy is:\n\nD. To what degree do inborn biological processes versus environmental events determine human behavior?\n\nThis question directly addresses the central tension between genetic predispositions and environmental influences on behavior. It seeks to understand how much of our behavior and characteristics are predetermined by our biology and how much is shaped by the experiences and environment we encounter."
