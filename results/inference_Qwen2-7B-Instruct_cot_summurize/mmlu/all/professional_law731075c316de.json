The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: \"Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. \"After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?\n\nA. A tenancy at will was created.\nB. A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.\nC. A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.\nD. The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.\n"

Since there is no mention of the lease automatically renewing after the initial three years, the tenancy would be considered periodic from year-to-year. This means that at the end of each year, unless one party (either the landlord or the tenant) provides notice to terminate the lease, it continues for another year. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created."
