This is because the President of the United States nominates Supreme Court Justices, and their nominations typically reflect the political ideology of the president who made them. Senators then vote on whether to confirm these nominees. If confirmed, the Justices serve for life, which often means they remain on the court long after the president who appointed them leaves office."
