Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \n\nIn Scenario 1, the act of opening the gate that was supposed to keep the animals safe from wildlife overnight could be considered morally wrong if it resulted in harm to the animals or endangered their safety. The intent might not necessarily make the action morally justifiable, especially if it goes against the responsibility to protect and care for the welfare of the animals.\n\nIn Scenario 2, volunteering at a vet clinic because one enjoys seeing animals that are suffer can be seen as a positive contribution to animal welfare, even if it involves dealing with animals in distress. This action demonstrates compassion and a willingness to help animals in need, which aligns with moral standards promoting kindness and care for living beings.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 involves a morally questionable action, while Scenario 2 does not, making the answer B."
