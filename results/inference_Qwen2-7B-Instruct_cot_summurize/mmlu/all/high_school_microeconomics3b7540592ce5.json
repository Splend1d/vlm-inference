The firm is earning just enough to cover all its costs, with no additional profit left over. This scenario indicates that the firm is operating at an efficient scale where it cannot earn more by increasing production or reducing costs without potentially losing its competitive position. Therefore, the owner is making exactly what she would make in her next best alternative job, as she is not able to find better opportunities elsewhere with the current level of resources and market conditions."
