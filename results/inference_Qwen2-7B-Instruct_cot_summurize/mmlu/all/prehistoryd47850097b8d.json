The mismatch you mentioned could indicate that the genetic lineages carried by the first migrants did not directly contribute to the genetic makeup of present-day Native American populations, possibly due to subsequent migrations, population bottlenecks, or other genetic drift events. However, it's important to note that while this mismatch might suggest that modern Native Americans are not directly descended from the earliest migrants based on cranial characteristics, it doesn't negate the possibility of admixture or other complex evolutionary histories. Genetic studies continue to refine our understanding of human migrations and the relationships between ancient and contemporary populations."
