Vested remainders subject to open, D. Reversions seem to directly apply to the intent to commit a felony. However, I'll explain each term briefly:\n\nA. **Contingent Remainders**: These are future interests that will take effect only if certain conditions occur or do not occur. They're contingent upon the happening or non-happening of some future event.\n\nB. **Executory Interests**: These are rights that are are in existence but have not yet vested. In other words, they are the right to receive property at some future time, but the future interest has not yet become possessory or absolute.\n\nC. **Vested Remainders Subject to Open**: This refers to a situation where a remainder interest in property is established and has become vested ( i.e., it has come into being, but it's subject to an open condition that could cause it to be lost or changed.\n\nD. **Reversions**: These are future interests that revert back to a specific person or entity if certain conditions are not met. The reversionist has the right to receive the property if the grantee does not fulfill their duties under the deed.\n\nRegarding the intent to commit a felony, these terms generally pertain to the legal ownership and transfer of property and do not directly address criminal intentions or actions. If there's a connection between these legal concepts and a felony, it would likely involve issues such as whether someone with a future interest in property was legally capable of committing a crime (e.g., if they were a minor), or if their actions (like committing a crime on the property) might affect their rights to the property."
