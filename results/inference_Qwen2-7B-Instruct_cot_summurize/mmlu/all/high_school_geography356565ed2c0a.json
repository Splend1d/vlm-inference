Irredentism** might be considered. Irredentism refers to the desire of a group to reclaim territory that was historically part of their nation but is now under another country's sovereignty. In the context of the U.S.-Mexico border, historical disputes over territories, such as the Gadsan and Chihuahuan Deserts, have been points of contention due to irredentist sentiments.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the complexities of the border issues also involve:\n\n- **A. Ownership of fertile ground**: The distribution of resources and fertile land across the border has economic implications and can lead to disputes.\n- **B. Land use**: Differences in how land is used (agriculture, urban development, conservation, etc., can lead to conflicts.\n- **D. Immigration**: Cross-border migration, including both legal and illegal immigration, is a significant issue affecting border management and policy.\n\nThus, while irredentism can be a factor, the full spectrum of boundary problems includes these and other related factors."
