The difference between each term is \\(7\\), which means this is an arithmetic sequence where the common difference (\\(d\\)) is \\(7\\).\n\nThe general formula for the \\(n\\)th term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\\[a_n = a_1 + ( (n - 1)d\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a_n\\) is the \\(n\\)th term,\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term,\n- \\(d\\) is the common difference,\n- \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(a_1 = -36\\),\n- \\(d = 7\\),\n- \\(a_n = 48\\),\n\nWe can substitute these values into the formula to solve for \\(n\\):\n\\[48 = -36 + ( (n - 1)7\\]\n\nFirst, simplify and solve for \\(n\\):\n\\[48 = -36 + 7n - 7\\]\n\\[48 = -43 + 7n\\]\n\\[48 + 43 = 7n\\]\n\\[91 = 7n\\]\n\\[n = 13\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 13 numbers in the list, making the correct answer:\n\nC. 13"
