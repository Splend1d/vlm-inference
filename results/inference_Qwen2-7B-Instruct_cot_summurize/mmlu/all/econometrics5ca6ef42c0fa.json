It will be consistent and unbiased but not efficient\n\nIn the presence of multicollinearity, the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimators will still be unbiased and consistent. This means that as the sample size increases, the estimators will converge to the true parameter values (and on average they will be correct).\n\nHowever, multicollinearity does affect the efficiency of the estimators. Efficiency here refers to the precision of the estimates: less efficient estimators have larger variances. In the case of multicollinearity, the variance of the OLS estimators will increase, meaning that they become more sensitive to random errors or noise in the data. Thus, even though the estimators remain unbiased and consistent, they are no longer the most precise (or efficient) among linear unbiased estimators, which is why we would say the OLS estimators under multicollinearity are \"not efficient\"."
