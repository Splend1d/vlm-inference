Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. either federal privilege law or the privilege law of the forum state as determined by the court.\n\nIn most cases, federal courts will apply federal rules regarding privileges, such as the attorney-client privilege, unless there is a clear conflict between federal and state law or when the matter is specifically addressed in the federal rules. However, the specifics can vary based on the jurisdiction and any applicable federal or state statutes or case law."
