He uses the word \"mad\" in two different ways, which can lead to confusion or misinterpretation. In this context, \"mad\" refers to madness or insanity, whereas Polonius could also be implying that Hamlet is simply acting in an unconventional or inappropriate manner. By using the same term in two different senses, Polonius is being playing with words, which is characteristic of equivocation."
