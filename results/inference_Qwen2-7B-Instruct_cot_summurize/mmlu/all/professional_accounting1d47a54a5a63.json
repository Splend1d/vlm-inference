Accruals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments while deferrals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments. \n\nIn accrual accounting, revenues are recognized when they are earned, regardless of when the cash is received, and expenses are recognized when they are incurred, regardless of when the cash is paid. This means that accruals deal with transactions that have already occurred but whose cash flow has not yet been settled.\n\nDeferrals, on the other hand, deal with transactions where the cash has already been exchanged, but the revenue or expense recognition will occur at a later date. For example, prepaid expenses (like rent paid in advance, or deferred revenues like subscription fees received before the service is provided, would be examples of deferrals."
