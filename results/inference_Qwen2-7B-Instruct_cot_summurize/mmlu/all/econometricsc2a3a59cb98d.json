Thus, the optimal one-step ahead forecast for the change in \\(y\\) would be:\n\nA. The current value of \\(y\\)\n\nThis is because in a random walk model, the best prediction for the next value (or change) is based on the assumption that the underlying process has no memory - it's purely random from one period to the next. Hence, the expected change in \\(y\\) at any given time is just the current value of \\(y\\) itself, assuming the drift component remains constant.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
