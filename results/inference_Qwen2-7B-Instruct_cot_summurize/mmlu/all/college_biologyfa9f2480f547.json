This action increases the arterial pressure significantly because the arterial walls are much less compliant than the veins. The volume of blood pumped out during each heartbeat (the stroke volume) increases the arterial pressure, especially as the blood moves through the smaller arterioles where resistance is higher.\n\nConversely, when the heart relaxes or diastole, blood flows back into the heart from the veins. Since veins have a much greater compliance (meaning they can expand easily to accommodate the returning blood - there is minimal increase in the venous pressure. The pressure in the veins rises slightly due to the flow of blood, but this rise is much less pronounced compared to the arterial pressure increase because veins have larger cross-sectional areas and are more elastic.\n\nTherefore, the transfer of blood from the more compliant venous side to the less compliant arterial side results in little effect on venous pressure and a large increase in arterial pressure."
