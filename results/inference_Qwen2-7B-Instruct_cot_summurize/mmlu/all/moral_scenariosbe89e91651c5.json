Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, allowing your children to engage in play that simulates violence is generally not considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards. While some might argue that it could desensitize children to real violence, this is not universally agreed upon and is often viewed as a parent's right to decide what activities their children can participate in.\n\nIn Scenario 2, planting weeds in someone else's garden without permission is considered morally wrong. This action invades the property rights of another person and causes damage or harm to their belongings, which is against the law and widely considered unethical."
