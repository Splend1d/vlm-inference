Some exons in protein-coding genes do not consist of noncoding DNA; they are part of the coding sequence that is spliced together to form mature mRNA.\n- B. This statement is generally true. The first exon typically contains the start codon (ATG, which codes for methionine and signals the start of translation.\n- C. This statement is not necessarily true. While the last exon may contain the stop codon (like UAA, UAG, or UGA, it does not have to be the last exon. The stop codon can occur in any exon or even within an intron, depending on the structure of the gene.\n- D. This statement is false. A coding exon can be translated in all three possible reading frames (forward, reverse, and the second reading frame in the reverse direction, not just in one of them."
