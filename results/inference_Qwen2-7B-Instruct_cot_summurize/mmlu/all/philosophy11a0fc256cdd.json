Prima facie duties are essentially those that seem right or obligatory at first glance but may conflict with other duties in certain circumstances. The idea is akin to natural laws in that they are seen as inherent and necessary principles that guide moral decision-making. They are not always absolute or universally applicable, but they provide a foundational framework for ethical reasoning."
