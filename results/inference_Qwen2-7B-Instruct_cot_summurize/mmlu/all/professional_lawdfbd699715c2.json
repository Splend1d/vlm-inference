Wishing to avoid difficulties with the judge, the woman's attorney promptly removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal-question jurisdiction. The employer's attorney has timely moved to remand. How is the federal court likely to proceed?\n\nA. Remand the entire case.\nB. Remand the state claims but keep the federal claims.\nC. Retain the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in having it proceed before a judge who has shown clear hostility toward the woman's attorney.\nD. Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.\n"

Remand the entire case.\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), if it appears that the removal was abusive ( such as where the case was removed to federal court without a basis in federal question jurisdiction, the federal court must remand the case to the state court from which it was removed. In this scenario, since the woman's attorney sought removal to federal court based on federal-question jurisdiction, but there is no indication that federal question jurisdiction actually exists (given that the claims are primarily for state-law discrimination, and not arising under federal law), the court would likely find the removal to be improper and abusive. Therefore, it would remand the entire case back to the state court. \n\nOptions B and C suggest different scenarios than presented here. Option C suggests retaining the case due to potential bias concerns, but there is no evidence of actual bias or impropriety by the judge against the attorney. Option D incorrectly assumes that the case should be retained simply because it was timely removed and federal claims were alleged; it does not consider whether those federal claims actually exist."
