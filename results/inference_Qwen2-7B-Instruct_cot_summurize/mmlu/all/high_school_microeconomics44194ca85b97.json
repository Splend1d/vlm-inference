This includes land, factories, equipment, and other resources used in the production of goods and services. Private ownership allows for the pursuit of profit, which incentivizes innovation and efficiency in the marketplace. \n\nGovernment intervention is typically limited to maintaining a stable environment, enforcing contracts, protecting property rights, and providing public goods such as infrastructure and defense. Price controls and centralized decision-making, as seen in command economies, are not typical features of capitalist market economies."
