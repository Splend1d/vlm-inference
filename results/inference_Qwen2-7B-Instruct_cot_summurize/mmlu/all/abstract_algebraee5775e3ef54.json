A permutation is a rearrangement of elements in a set, and by definition, each element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain with no repetitions.\n\nStatement 2 is false: Not every function is a permutation if it is one-to one. While all permutations are one-to-one functions, not all one-to-one functions are permutations. For a function to be a permutation, it must also cover the entire codomain, meaning that for every element in the codomain, there is an element in the domain that maps to it. Not all one-to-one functions meet this criterion; they may not necessarily cover the entire codomain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False."
