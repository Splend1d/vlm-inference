When the dome is uncharged, there is no electric field generated by the dome itself because there are no free charges present to create an electric field. However, once the dome is charged, it will have an electric field around it due to the presence of the charged particles. Inside the dome, in the absence of external influences, the electric field would be considered effectively zero because the charges are arranged symmetrically and thus cancel out any internal field that might be created."
