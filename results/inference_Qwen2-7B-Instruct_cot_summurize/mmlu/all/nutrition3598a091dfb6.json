Iron deficiency\n\nIron deficiency, while it can lead to anemia and other health issues, is not typically considered a direct cause of the edema associated with kwashiorkor. The condition is primarily caused by severe protein malnutrition, which affects the body's ability to maintain fluid balance. The other options listed ( altered composition of intestinal bacteria, low intake of antioxidant nutrients, and sudden weaning from the breast, have all been associated with factors that contribute to kwashiorkor or its symptoms."
