This hands-on learning experience allows students to explore different aspects of agriculture and gain practical experience in a specific field of interest. It also helps them develop leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills, among others. While earning proficiency awards, learning financial management skills, and qualifying for FFA degrees may be byproducts of participating in an SAE program, these are not the primary purposes. The main goal is to facilitate practical learning and skill development in agriculture."
