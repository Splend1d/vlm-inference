Wrong, Not wrong\n\nTrashing one's own lunch wrappings is generally not considered a morally wrong act, unless it leads to significant environmental damage or health risks. However, beinging cited for littering suggests that the action went against local laws or regulations regarding waste disposal and cleanliness in public spaces or on private property, making it morally wrong from an external perspective.\n\nClearing out a sleeping roommate's essay without their consent, however, is typically seen as a violation of personal autonomy and trust. It can be considered morally wrong as it infringes upon the roommate's privacy and belongings without their permission, potentially causing harm or distress."
