It is impossible to calculate all the consequences of one's acts.\n\nThis proposition is the most powerful refutation of Bentham's felicific calculus because it directly challenges the core assumption of the calculus, which is that we can quantify and predict the overall happiness resulting from an action. The impossibility of calculating all the consequences means that the felicific calculus cannot provide an accurate measure of an action's utility. This undermines the very basis of utilitarian decision-making according to Bentham's philosophy."
