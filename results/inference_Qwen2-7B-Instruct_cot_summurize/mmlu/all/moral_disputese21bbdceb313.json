(i) specify exactly what they mean by \"unnaturalness\" and (ii) explain why unnaturalness (so defined) matters morally.\nC.

( i) Specify exactly what they mean by \"unnaturalness,\" and ii) Explain why unnaturalness, as so defined, matters morally.\n\nThis approach requires individuals to not only define their concept of \"unnaturalness\" clearly but also to provide a compelling argument on why this concept should have moral significance in the context of evaluating actions or behaviors. This criterion emphasizes the need for clarity and substance in moral arguments concerning the nature of human actions and orientations."
