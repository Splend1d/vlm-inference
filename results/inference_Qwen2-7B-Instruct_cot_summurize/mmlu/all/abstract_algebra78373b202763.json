For example, consider \\(A = \\{1, 2\\}\\), \\(B = \\{3\\}\\), \\(f(1) = f(2) = 3\\), and \\(g(3) = 1\\). Here, \\(g(f(1)) = g(f(2)) = 1\\), so the condition holds, but \\(g\\) is not injective since \\(g(3) = 1\\).\n\nStatement 2 is true because if \\(g(f(a)) = a\\) for all \\(a \\in A\\), then for any \\(b \\in B\\), there exists an \\(a \\in A\\) such that \\(f(a) = b\\), and thus \\(g(b) = g(f(a)) = a\\). This means that for every element in \\(A\\), there is a corresponding element in \\(B\\) that maps to it under \\(g\\), making \\(g\\) surjective.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
