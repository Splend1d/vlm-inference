Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, dangling a toddler by their arms on a balcony is considered morally wrong because it involves physical abuse and endangerment, both of which are are illegal and unethical actions.\n\nIn Scenario 2, adding alcohol to punch at a party without people knowing can be seen as morally wrong because it involves deception and potentially causing harm or putting others in danger, especially if the guests are not aware of the added alcohol and might consume more than they should. This action can lead to impaired judgment, increased risk of accidents, or even alcohol poisoning, all of which are are morally concerning."
