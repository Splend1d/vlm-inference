When the body is dehydrated, ADH is released, increasing the reabsorption of water in the kidneys, thus conserving water and preventing dehydration from becoming more severe. This mechanism ensures that the body's internal environment remains stable despite external changes, such as loss of fluids through sweating or vomiting."
