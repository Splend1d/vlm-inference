Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.\n\nExplanation: \n\nWrite-through policy involves updating the main memory every time a write operation occurs. This means that each write operation to the cache also triggers a write operation to the main memory. As a result, the hit ratio might be slightly lower because of these additional writes to main memory. On the other hand, write-back policy defers the update to the main memory until the cache line is evicted. This reduces the number of main memory write operations during normal read and write accesses, potentially leading to a higher hit ratio since fewer accesses result in a miss to main memory.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while write-back may have a higher hit ratio under typical conditions, the actual performance can depend on various factors such as the cache coherence protocol being used in multi-processor systems, where additional write operations might be needed to maintain consistency across caches.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, A is the correct statement."
