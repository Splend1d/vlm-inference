This action can be seen as disrespectful and potentially harmful to someone else's belongings, which goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, it would be considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Popping a balloon given to a child and then giving it back might seem like a harmless prank, but it can cause distress or injury if the balloon was intended for play or decoration. It also involves taking an object that was not yours to control in the first place. While this might not always be universally considered morally wrong, depending on the context and the relationship between the individuals involved, it could be seen as inappropriate or even cruel. However, in many cases, especially if no harm was done and the action was done in a playful manner with consent (which is not indicated in your scenario), it might not be considered morally wrong by some standards.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
