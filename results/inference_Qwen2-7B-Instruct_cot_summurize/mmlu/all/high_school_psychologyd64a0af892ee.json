It is often considered the most effective form of motivation because it encourages behaviors that persist over long periods of time without the need for external rewards or pressures. People who are intrinsically motivated are driven by their own interests and the inherent enjoyment they get from the task itself, rather than external factors such as money, grades, or praise.\n\nWhile primary and secondary drives (A & B) can be powerful motivators in certain contexts, they often relate more directly to basic physiological needs or societal expectations, respectively. Achievement motivation (C) focuses on attaining goals or success, which can be motivating but may not always lead to sustained engagement if the pursuit of these achievements becomes an end in itself or if the individual feels pressured to achieve at all costs. \n\nIn contrast, intrinsic motivation tends to foster a deeper connection with the activity being performed, leading to more consistent and long-term engagement."
