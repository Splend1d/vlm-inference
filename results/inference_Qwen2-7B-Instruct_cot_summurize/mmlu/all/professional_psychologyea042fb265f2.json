Partial reinforcement\n\nPartial reinforcement schedules (such as fixed-ratio and variable-ratio schedules) tend to produce responses that are more resistant to extinction than those produced by continuous reinforcement schedules ( (which is option D). This is because under partial reinforcement, the behavior is reinforced after a varying number of responses, making it harder for the organism to predict exactly when the reinforcement will occur. As a result, the behavior tends to persist even when reinforcement is removed, or extinction occurs.\n\nIn contrast, options B and C (large magnitude reinforcement and mild punishment for each failure to respond, do not necessarily make the response more resistant to extinction. Large magnitude reinforcement might lead to quicker learning but does not inherently increase resistance to extinction. Mild punishment could potentially decrease the frequency of the response, but its effect on resistance to extinction would depend on various factors including the context and the animal's tolerance to punishment. \n\nOption D, reinforcement on every trial, would likely result in quick learning but also quick forgetting if reinforcement stops, thus being less resistant to extinction compared to partial reinforcement."
