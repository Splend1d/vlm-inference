As a therapist, maintaining confidentiality and respecting the therapeutic relationship is crucial. Involving the client directly ensures that they are aware of any concerns or discussions that might impact their well-being or treatment plan. This approach also respects Leticia's autonomy and allows her to participate actively in her own care, which is an essential part of effective therapy."
