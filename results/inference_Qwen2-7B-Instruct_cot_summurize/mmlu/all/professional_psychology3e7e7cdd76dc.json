It's influenced by the individual's personal values, beliefs, and past experiences related to the behavior.\n\n2. **Subjective Norms**: These are the perceived social pressure to perform ( or not to perform a behavior. They are based on the individual's perception of what others think they should do, which can be influenced by family, friends, peers, or society at large.\n\n3. **Perceived Behavioral Control**: This component reflects how easy or difficult an individual perceives it to perform the behavior. It takes into account the barriers and resources available for carrying out the behavior.\n\nThese three components together determine a person's behavioral intention, which is the individual's stated decision to engage in a particular behavior. The intention then predicts actual behavior, according to Ajzen's theory."
