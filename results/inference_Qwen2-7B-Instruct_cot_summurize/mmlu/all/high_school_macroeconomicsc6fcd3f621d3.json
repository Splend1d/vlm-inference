Among the options provided:\n\nA. A decline in labor productivity would likely lead to lower output for a given amount of inputs, but if productivity is falling, one might expect prices to also fall (due to lower costs of production. However, it does not necessarily explain a simultaneous decrease in GDP.\n\nB. A technological advance usually leads to higher productivity, more efficient production processes, and potentially lower prices due to cost savings. This would generally boost economic growth rather than decrease it.\n\nC. A decline in investment can lead to less capital formation, which reduces future productive capacity. This directly impacts current GDP levels as it decreases the volume of goods and services produced. Lower investment also tends to dampen consumer spending through reduced employment and income, further depressing GDP. Additionally, lower investment may lead to lower demand, which could result in lower prices without necessarily causing a decrease in real GDP.\n\nD. An uptick in net exports would typically stimulate economic growth by increasing the value of goods and services sold abroad, which would increase GDP. This contradicts the scenario described, where both GDP and the price level are decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation for a decrease in both real GDP and price level would be C. a decline in investment."
