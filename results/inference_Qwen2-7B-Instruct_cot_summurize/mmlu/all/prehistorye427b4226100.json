The Lapita culture, which is characterized by its distinctive pottery style, developed in the Pacific Ocean around 2500-800 BCE and spread across many islands, including parts of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. This pottery style became so distinctive that it came to represent the entire cultural complex that these peoples shared, including their art, technology, and possibly language."
