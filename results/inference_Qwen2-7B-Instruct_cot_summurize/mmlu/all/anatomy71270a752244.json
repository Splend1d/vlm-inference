                    "text": "The correct answer is B. cricothyroid muscle is still functional but the interarytenoids are weak.\n\nIn a healthy vocal mechanism, the vocal cords (vocal folds) move towards each other during phonation (adduction) to vibrate and produce sound. The cricothyroid muscle plays a crucial role in adjusting the tension of the vocal cords by moving the arytenoid cartilage. It is innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is often at risk during certain neck surgeries.\n\nWhen there is damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, it can lead to paralysis of the cricoothyroid muscle. However, if this nerve damage affects only one side, the muscle on that side remains non-functional while the opposing muscle (interarytenoids) might be relatively weak or underactive due to disuse. As a result, the vocal cord on the affected side tends to remain in a position of intermediate adduction and abduction when compared to the uninjured side. This is because the interarytenoid muscles are not able to maintain the full adduction required for normal speech production, leading to a less tense and more open position of the vocal fold."
