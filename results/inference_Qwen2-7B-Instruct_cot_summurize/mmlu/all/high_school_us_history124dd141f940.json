During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nWhich of the following in later years would be most likely to see themselves in Logan's position?\n\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s\nB. An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s\nD. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s\n"

                    "text": "The character of Logan, an Indian leader who delivered a powerful address in 1774, expresses deep personal loss and a call for revenge after being wronged by colonists. His actions and words reflect a strong sense of personal honor, justice, and a desire for vengeance.\n\nGiven this context, the individual most likely to find themselves in Logan's position in later years would be someone who similarly values personal honor, justice, and takes strong action when deeply wronged. Among the options provided:\n\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s - This person might feel a strong sense of justice and honor, potentially leading them to take direct action against what they perceive as unjust policies or practices, similar to Logan's decision to seek revenge.\n\nB. An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s - This individual's focus is more on societal trends and consumption rather than personal revenge or honor, making them less likely to resonate with Logan's situation.\n\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s - Liberalism often emphasizes social justice, equality, and peaceful means to effect change. While these values may align with a sense of justice, they do not necessarily imply a desire for personal vengeance or action driven by a sense of honor.\n\nD. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s - Feminism advocates for gender equality and rights, focusing on systemic issues rather than personal revenge or honor-based actions.\n\nGiven the criteria, **A. An opponent of big government in the 1930s** would be the most likely choice to see themselves in Logan's position due to their emphasis on personal honor and taking direct action when justice is perceived as lacking."
