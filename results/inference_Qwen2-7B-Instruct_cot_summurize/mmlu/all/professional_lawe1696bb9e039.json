On September 15, a worldwide shortage of widgets caused a steep increase in the market price for widgets, so the seller decided not to deliver the widgets to the buyer. The seller sent a letter to the buyer, stating that the widgets would not be delivered. The buyer received the seller's letter on September 20. On October 15, the buyer filed suit against the seller for breach of contract. In determining the damages to which the buyer is entitled, which of the following would be taken as the market price of widgets?\n\nA. The market price on September 1.\nB. The market price on September 15.\nC. The market price on September 20.\nD. The market price on September 30.\n"

The market price on September 15.\n\nIn cases of breach of contract, particularly when dealing with specific performance or damages related to the value of goods, courts typically consider the market price at the time the breach occurred. However, if the breach occurs after the time for performance has passed and the seller has failed to deliver, the court may look at the market price at the time the breach was discovered by the aggrieved party, assuming it reflects a more accurate market condition at that point in time.\n\nIn this scenario, the seller breached the contract by not delivering the widgets by September 30, but the buyer only became aware of the breach on September 20. Thus, the court would likely consider the market price of widgets on September 15, when the seller decided not to deliver, as an appropriate benchmark to determine damages. This reflects the situation as it stood at the time the breach was actually discovered by the buyer."
