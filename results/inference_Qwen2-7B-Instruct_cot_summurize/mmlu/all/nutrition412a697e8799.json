These episodes involve consuming significantly more food in a short period than most people would eat under similar circumstances, accompanied by feelings of lack of control over eating during the episode. The binge eating episodes are not associated with regular compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting or excessive exercise.\n\nWhile feelings of chaos (option A), the consumption of sweets between meals (option B), and difficulty in choosing food types despite quantity control (option D) may be associated with disordered eating patterns, they do not specifically define a binge eating episode as per the diagnostic criteria for Binge Eating Disorder. Therefore, option C is the most accurate characterization of a binge eating episode."
