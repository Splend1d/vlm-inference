However, this doesn't directly tell us about the convergence or divergence of \u2211 a_i. The fact that \u2211 a_i = 2 suggests that the series converges to 2, which is a finite value. \n\nRearranging the terms of a conditionally convergent series (i.e., a series that converges but not absolutely (since here \u2211|a_i| diverges), can indeed change its sum. This is due to Riemann's Rearrangement Theorem, which states that if an infinite series is conditionally convergent, then its terms can be arranged in a permutation so that the new series converges to any given value or diverges. Therefore, it is possible to find a rearrangement of the terms a_i such that their sum becomes 4.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 1:** **True**\n\n### Statement 2:\nThere exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT \u201cclosed and bounded\u201d.\n\n**Analysis:**\nIn standard topology, particularly in the context of complete metric spaces (like the real numbers with the usual metric, a continuous image of a closed and bounded set (which is compact by the Heine-Borel theorem) must also be closed and bounded. However, the question is asking for a scenario where this property does not hold.\n\nThis can happen in incomplete metric spaces or non-standard topologies. For instance, consider X as a closed and bounded subset of a space that is not complete (such as the rational numbers with the usual metric). Let Y be a larger space that contains X as a proper subset, and let f be the identity function on X. Then, f(X) = X, which is closed and bounded in X but not necessarily closed and bounded in Y since Y could have additional points not in X.\n\nHowever, the question seems to imply a scenario where f(X) is not closed and bounded even within X, which is a bit misleading because in typical topological settings, if X is closed and bounded, then f(X) should retain those properties under a continuous function. A more accurate interpretation might be looking for a situation where X is closed and bounded in one space but not when considered as a subset of another space, especially if Y has a different topology or structure that affects the properties of f(X).\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 2:** **False**\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer would be **C. False, True**."
