Nuclear binding energies have about the same magnitude as chemical bond energies.\n\nNuclear binding energies are significantly higher compared to chemical bond energies. While chemical bonds typically involve energies on the order of hundreds of kilojoules per mole, nuclear binding energies can be several orders of magnitude greater, often measured in millions of electronvolts (MeV or gigaelectronvolts GeV, per nucleon. This difference is due to the much stronger force at play within atomic nuclei, which is the strong nuclear force, compared to the electromagnetic forces involved in chemical bonding."
