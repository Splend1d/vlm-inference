If independent samples are taken repeatedly from the same population, and a confidence interval calculated for each sample, then a certain percentage (the confidence level \u2013 of the intervals will include the unknown population parameter. Confidence intervals constructed using a particular confidence level can be said to capture the population parameter \"with that probability\", or \"with confidence\". For example, a 95% confidence interval does not mean that for a given set of data the true unknown population parameter has a 95% chance of being falling within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the true value of the parameter."
