An educated workforce is better equipped to innovate, improve processes, and adopt new technologies, all of which contribute to higher productivity and potentially faster economic growth. \n\nWhile tariffs and quotas ( (option B) might protect domestic industries in the short term, they often lead to higher prices for consumers, reduced competition, and may not necessarily stimulate long-term economic growth or productivity improvements.\n\nRemoving penalties for firms that pollute natural resources ( (option C) could lead to environmental degradation, which has negative long-term effects on economic productivity and growth due to resource depletion and potential health costs.\n\nIgnoring societal barriers such as discrimination ( (option D) is crucial for economic growth as it ensures a fair and inclusive environment where everyone's talents can be utilized effectively, contributing to a more productive workforce. Discrimination can limit opportunities and discourage certain groups from participating fully in the economy, thereby reducing overall productivity."
