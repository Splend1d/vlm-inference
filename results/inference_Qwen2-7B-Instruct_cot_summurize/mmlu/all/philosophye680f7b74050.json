He argued that while humans might pursue various goals, these goals should align with serving others and contributing positively to society. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D directly capture Aquinas's view. However, if we interpret the question within the context of his philosophy, option C ( \"those who contemplate the truth\" comes closest to his ideal of human action, as contemplation of truth and virtue often leads to actions that benefit others and contribute to the common good."
