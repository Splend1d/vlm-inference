These actions violated the kidnapping laws of both states, which are identical. A jury convicted the man in a State A court, but the trial judge gave what prosecutors in State B deemed an unduly lenient sentence. The state prosecutor in State B then commenced a kidnapping case against the man for violating State B's kidnapping statute. The man's lawyer has filed a motion in State B to dismiss the charge based on the double jeopardy protection against a second prosecution for the man's single act of kidnapping. Should the court grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. No, because the double jeopardy protection only prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense.\nB. No, because the man's conduct violated the laws of two different states, and each has the right to enforce its laws. right to enforce its laws.\nC. Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following a conviction for the same offense.\nD. Yes, because the government is collaterally estopped under the double jeopardy protection from prosecuting a defendant a second time for the same conduct that led to an earlier conviction.\n"

Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following a conviction for the same offense.\n\nThe double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from being tried twice for the same offense. This protection applies not just when an individual is acquitted, but also when they are convicted. Therefore, if the man was already convicted in State A for the same act of kidnapping that is now being prosecuted in State B, the court should grant the motion to dismiss the charge in State B based on double jeopardy. The fact that the act violated the laws of two different states does not change the application of this constitutional protection."
