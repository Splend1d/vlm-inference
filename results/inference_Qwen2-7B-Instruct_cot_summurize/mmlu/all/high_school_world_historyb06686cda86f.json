A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920\nMoreland's description of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire is best seen as evidence for which of the following generalizations?\n\nA. Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire.\nB. Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.\nC. Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.\nD. The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.\n"

Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.\n\nMoreland's description highlights how geographical factors, such as location within the Mughal Empire, could impact whether a group was subject to revenue collection. For example, a zamindar (a landholder who collected rent from peasants and paid revenue to the emperor - in Northern India, was likely dependent on the Mughal authority and would face consequences for refusing or omitting to pay revenue. However, the situation in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur appears to be more complex, with various chiefdoms and tribes potentially enjoying some degree of autonomy due to the Mughal authorities' reluctance to enforce their authority actively. This suggests that geographical differences could influence the dynamics of tax collection and the exercise of imperial power."
