The US promoted the marketization of the Russian economy\n\nDuring the Clinton Administration (1993-2001), there was a significant push towards economic liberalization in Russia. This included efforts to privatize state-owned enterprises, encourage foreign investment, and establish a more market-oriented economic system. The U.S. government provided substantial economic aid to Russia under programs like the \"Nunn-Lugar\" Cooperative Threat Reduction initiative, which aimed at stabilizing the Russian economy and reducing the threat of nuclear proliferation.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the US did support market reforms, the relationship was not without its complexities and challenges. There were disagreements over how to balance economic reform with social stability, and concerns about corruption and the concentration of wealth. Additionally, the US also had strategic interests that sometimes diverged from economic policy goals."
