This phenomenon is due to gravitational perturbations from Jupiter that make it energetically unfavorable for asteroids to occupy these specific orbital positions. \n\nSo, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. A and B\n\nThis is because asteroids can only orbit with periods that are a simple fraction of Jupiter's period without being gravitationally disrupted. The most famous Kirkwood gaps occur at 2:1, 3:1, 5:2, 7:3, 10:3, and so on, ratios between the orbital periods of asteroids and Jupiter. These gaps correspond to points where the orbital period of an asteroid would be half or twice ( (or other simple fractions) of Jupiter's orbital period."
