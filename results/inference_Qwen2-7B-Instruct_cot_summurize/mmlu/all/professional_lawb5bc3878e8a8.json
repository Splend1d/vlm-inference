The farmer's tract was located next to an adjacent 300-acre ranch to the east. Immediately to the west of the farmer's parcel was a 100-acre tract. The farmer subdivided his property into two 10-acre parcels:Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the major boulevard; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river to the south. In March 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel ito a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Then in September 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. In 1965, the farmer constructed a driveway from what is now Parcel 2, extending over Parcel 1, where it connected with the major boulevard. This driveway lies across what is now Parcel 1 and was used continuously by the farmer until 1997 when he conveyed his property in parcels to the man and the woman. When the woman took possession of Parcel 2, she immediately began to use the drive way across Parcel 1. Thereafter, the man requested that the woman cease to use the driveway over Parcel 1. After the woman refused, the man brought an appropriate action to enjoin the woman from using the driveway. In this action, the man will\n\nA. win, because his deed antedated the woman's deed.\nB. win, because no encumbrances were mentioned in his deed.\nC. lose, because the woman has an easement by necessity.\nD. lose, because the woman has an express easement.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. lose, because the woman has an express easement.\n\nIn this scenario, the driveway that crosses Parcel 1 was constructed by the farmer, who was the owner of both Parcel 1 and Parcel 2 at the time of construction. This indicates that there was an intention to create a connection between the two parcels, which would suggest the existence of an express easement. An express easement is one that is explicitly stated in a written agreement or deed. Since the farmer built the driveway specifically to connect Parcel 1 and Parcel 2, and this action facilitated access for the farmer to the major boulevard, it can be inferred that the farmer intended for this driveway to remain accessible after the division of the land.\n\nWhen the farmer conveyed Parcel 2 to the woman, he did not include any restrictions on the use of the driveway in the deed. The woman, upon receiving her deed, promptly began using the driveway as she had been doing since the farmer built it. This usage by the woman, without interference from the farmer, established a right to use the driveway that the man could not prevent without clear evidence of an intent to revoke the easement at the time of the original construction.\n\nTherefore, the man's request for the woman to stop using the driveway would likely fail in court because the woman has an express easement over Parcel 1, which was established through the farmer's actions and the subsequent use by the woman. The man's deed antedating the woman's deed does not automatically grant him the right to revoke an existing easement that was created by the farmer's actions and has been continuously used by the woman."
