It relies on the rapid breakdown of phosphocreatine ( (PC) to regenerate ATP, which can then be used immediately by muscle fibers for energy. This system provides a quick burst of energy but does not last long because phosphocreatine stores are limited and replenishment occurs through the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways."
