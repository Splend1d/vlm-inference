Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is giving a false identity to the police officer, which is considered deceitful and dishonest, and potentially illegal depending on the context and the reason for the roadblock. This action can be seen as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, assuming that the main character is a dentist or a dental professional who has the necessary qualifications and permissions to perform dental procedures, pulling a patient's teeth with novocaine (assuming the patient needs the procedure and consents to it, and it is performed safely and ethically - this would generally be considered within the bounds of professional ethics and medical practice. It would not typically be viewed as morally wrong. However, if the scenario implies actions outside the scope of medical practice, such as performing a procedure without proper training or consent, then it could also be morally questionable. But based on the information given, the scenario seems to describe a typical dental procedure."
