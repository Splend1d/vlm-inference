This is because fat oxidation takes longer to occur compared to carbohydrate oxidation, leading to slower energy availability during intense exercise. \n\nA. is incorrect because a low carbohydrate diet can affect performance in short-duration, high-intensity exercises that last less than 10 minutes. The body's ability to rapidly convert carbohydrates into energy is crucial for these types of activities.\n\nB. Resting muscle pH is not directly influenced by carbohydrate intake; rather, it's primarily regulated by the balance between acid production (from metabolic processes like anaerobic glycolysis) and the body's buffering systems.\n\nD. While it's true that a low carbohydrate diet might result in greater reliance on muscle glycogen, this is only part of the story. The overall impact on exercise performance depends on many factors, including the individual's adaptation to carbohydrate restriction, their capacity for fat oxidation, and the type and duration of the exercise."
