Six months later, the friend lost his job and was unable to repay the loan to the creditor. After learning of his friend's situation, the creditor sent his friend the following letter on June 1:\"I promise to discharge the $15,000 debt which you owe me upon delivery of your autographed baseball bat if you promise to deliver the bat to me by August 1 . \"After receiving this letter, the friend telephoned the creditor and accepted the offer. The friend's verbal acceptance of the creditor's offer most likely effectuated\n\nA. a bilateral executory accord.\nB. an accord and satisfaction.\nC. a substituted compromise agreement.\nD. a novation.\n"

The friend agrees to deliver an autographed baseball bat instead of paying the $15,000 in cash, and the creditor agrees to accept the bat in full settlement of the debt. This new agreement is called an accord. Additionally, the friend accepts this new agreement, effectively discharging the original obligation, which is known as satisfaction. Therefore, the combination of these two elements forms an accord and satisfaction."
