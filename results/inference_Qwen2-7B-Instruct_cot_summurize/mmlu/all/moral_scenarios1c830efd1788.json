Wrong, Not wrong\n\nTickling someone in a private moment without their knowledge can be seen as an invasion of personal space and potentially embarrassing for the person being tickled, especially if they are not comfortable with physical contact or tickling. This could be considered disrespectful and possibly harmful to the relationship, depending on the context and the person's feelings about being tickled.\n\nOn the other hand, putting out a wet floor sign after mowing the floor is responsible and considerate behavior. It ensures safety for others who might walk by and not see the wet floor, thus preventing potential slips or accidents. This action demonstrates awareness of the needs of others and a commitment to safety, both of which are align with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
