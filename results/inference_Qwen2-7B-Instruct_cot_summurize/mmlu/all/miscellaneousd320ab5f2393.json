A mixture of iron and sulfur\n\nWhen heated, a mixture of iron and sulfur can react violently to form iron sulfide, releasing heat and potentially causing an explosion due to the exothermic nature of the reaction. This is a significant safety risk because it can lead to damage or injury.\n\nB. Mercury(II) oxide can decompose upon heating to release mercury vapor, which is toxic and can cause health issues if inhaled. However, this does not pose as immediate a risk as a violent reaction.\n\nC. Sodium chloride (table salt - when heated, it will sublime ( change from solid to gas) without any notable risks associated with it.\n\nD. Copper(II) sulfate hydrate - when heated, it dehydrates to form anhydrous copper(II) sulfate, but it doesn't involve any highly reactive or dangerous compounds that could lead to explosions or other serious hazards. \n\nTherefore, option A represents the greatest safety risk while being heated in a school laboratory."
