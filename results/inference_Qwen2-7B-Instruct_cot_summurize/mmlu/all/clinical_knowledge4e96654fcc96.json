Fracture of the radius and ulna at the wrist.\n\nA Colles' fracture is a specific type of break that occurs in the wrist, specifically when the distal radius (one of the bones in the forearm) fractures and the broken bone turns or twists. The typical result is a wrist that appears to be bent downward and backward. This type of fracture is often caused by a fall onto an outstretched hand."
