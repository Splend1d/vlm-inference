Each section is to be made of good quality split redwood poles and is to be 7 feet long and 6 feet high; 1,000 sections are to be delivered by seller on or before June 1, and 1,000 sections by the first day in each of the following six months. Payment for the sections to be made within 10 days of delivery. \"The first shipment of 1,000 sections arrived on May 27, and the fence company sent its payment on June5. The second shipment arrived on July 1, and the fence company made payment on July 5. The August shipment arrived on the afternoon of August 1. After the initial inspection, the redwood poles were found to be 7 feet long and 6. 25 feet high. The manager of the fence company then called the president of the lumber supplier. During their conversation, the president told the manager that the lumber supplier could not replace the August shipment but would allow a price adjustment. The manager refused the president's offer. The next day, the manager sent the president a fax stating that he was hereby canceling all future deliveries and returning the last shipment because of nonconformity. If the lumber supplier sues the fence company for breach of contract, the court will most likely hold that the lumber company will\n\nA. succeed, because all deliveries to date have been timely.\nB. succeed, because the president offered to adjust the price for the August shipment.\nC. not succeed, because the president refused to replace the nonconforming poles.\nD. not succeed, because the deviation impaired the value of the entire contract.\n"

                    "text": "D. not succeed, because the deviation impaired the value of the entire contract.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the nonconformity of the August shipment (being taller than specified (impairs the value of the entire contract. The fact that the supplier offered a price adjustment does not negate the nonconformity of the goods. Instead, it suggests that the supplier recognized the issue and attempted to mitigate the impact. However, since the manager refused the offer and decided to cancel future deliveries, it indicates that the nonconformity was significant enough to affect the value of the contract as a whole.\n\nUnder legal principles concerning contracts and specific performance, if goods delivered do not conform to the specifications agreed upon, the buyer may have grounds to reject the goods, especially if the deviation significantly impairs the value or use of the product. In this case, since the height of the poles exceeds the specified limit, it could potentially affect the structural integrity or usability of the fences, depending on how critical the height specification is for the fence's function. If the deviation is substantial enough, it might lead a court to rule that the contract has been breached due to the impairment of the goods' value.\n\nTherefore, the lumber supplier is likely to not succeed in their lawsuit for breach of contract based on the information provided, as the nonconformity of the goods appears to have impaired the value of the entire contract."
