The defendant is compelled to stand trial in street clothing.\n\nThis is because the choice of attire for the defendant is typically a matter of personal preference and does not affect the fairness of the trial. However, it should be noted that defendants have a right to be dressed in a manner that does not disrupt the proceedings or pose a security risk.\n\nHere's why the other options would generally be considered violations of due process:\n\nA. If jurors cannot give evidence reasonable consideration, this means they are being influenced by factors outside the evidence presented in court, which is a clear violation of their duty to base their decision solely on the evidence and testimony presented during the trial.\n\nC. Forcibly shackling a defendant can be seen as prejudicial and may influence the jury's perception, even if the reason is ostensibly for security. This could potentially impact the fairness of the trial.\n\nD. Jurors being exposed to influence favorable to the prosecution could result in a biased verdict, as jurors should only consider evidence and arguments presented in court, not external influences."
