This increased loudness is perceived as an increase in the volume of the sound. When sound reaches your ear, it causes the eardrum to vibrate. These vibrations are then transmitted through the middle ear to the cochlea in your inner ear. In the cochlea, the vibrations cause tiny hair cells to move. As these hair cells move, they stimulate neurons in the auditory nerve, which then send signals to your brain about the sound you're hearing.\n\nWhen the sound becomes louder, more of these hair cells are stimulated simultaneously, and this leads to more neurons firing in response to the increased intensity of the sound wave. The brain interprets this as an increase in the perceived loudness of the sound. Therefore, the primary reason for the increase in perceived sound is not directly related to neurons firing more intensely ((A), increased secretions by the pituitary gland ( (B), or changing frequency of sound waves ( (C). Instead, it's primarily due to more neurons firing more frequently in response to the louder sound wave."
