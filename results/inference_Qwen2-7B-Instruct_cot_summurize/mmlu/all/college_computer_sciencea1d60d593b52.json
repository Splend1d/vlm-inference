This method involves creating a matrix where rows represent subjects (such as users or processes), columns represent objects (such as files or resources), and cells contain access rights or permissions.\n\nAmong the options provided, the difficulty with the access matrix approach is primarily:\n\nA. the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage - This is because the size of the access matrix grows exponentially with the number of subjects and objects, potentially leading to a very large and complex structure that becomes difficult to maintain and update efficiently.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, while it might be challenging to express some complex protection requirements using a simple matrix, with proper design and extension of the model, it can still accommodate many complex scenarios. For example, additional attributes or rules can be added to the matrix to handle more intricate access control policies requirements.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, theoretically, determining whether a process has access to a resource based on the access matrix is decidable. The matrix provides a clear set of rules that can be systematically checked against the subject and object being compared.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it is possible to define mechanisms within an access matrix system to express who has rights to modify or update the access matrix. Typically, this would involve defining administrative roles or privileges within the system.\n\nIn summary, the main difficulty with the access matrix approach lies in managing the sheer size of the matrix when dealing with a large number of subjects and objects, making it cumbersome to maintain and update effectively."
