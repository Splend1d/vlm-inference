Job enrichment involves giving workers more responsibility, autonomy, and opportunities for skill development, often by adding quasi-managerial tasks to their role. This approach aims to increase job satisfaction and motivation.\n\nTo clarify the other options:\nA. Job enrichment does not necessarily provide management with tighter control; instead, it may empower employees to make decisions, reducing the need for close supervision.\nB. While job enrichment can appeal to workers in various types of jobs, it's not limited to those in mass-production settings. It can be applied across different industries and job roles.\nD. Job enlargement typically refers to increasing the scope of an employee's duties without necessarily enhancing their skills or responsibilities, which could potentially lengthen the work cycle but does not specifically aim to do so as its primary goal."
