Viruses can manipulate the host cell's machinery and initiate programmed cell death, known as apoptosis, to eliminate the infected cell before it can produce more viral particles. This mechanism helps the virus to prevent the spread of its genetic material to other cells. Caspases are a family of proteolytic enzymes that play a crucial role in the execution phase of apoptosis."
