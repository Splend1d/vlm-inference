Assuming you're referring to the well-known meta-analysis by Smith, Glass, and Miller published in 1980, they found that psychotherapy can produce substantial benefits for individuals suffering from mental health issues.\n\nAccording to their findings, psychotherapy can lead to outcomes that are superior to those of about 75% of people who could benefit from treatment but do not receive it. This statistic is often cited as highlighting the effectiveness of psychotherapy compared to no treatment.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 45  \nB. 55  \nC. 80  \nD. 95  \n\nNone of these directly match the 75% figure from Smith, Glass, and Miller's work. However, since this information isn't directly provided here, the closest option would likely be C. 80, though this is an approximation and not an exact match based on the specific result from the study. The precise percentage is important for accuracy, so ideally, the correct answer should reflect the 75% finding from the Smith, Glass, and Miller meta-analysis."
