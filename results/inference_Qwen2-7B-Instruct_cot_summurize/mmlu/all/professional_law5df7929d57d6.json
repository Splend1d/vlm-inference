The aunt, the owner in the middle of the three lots, was an amateur scientist. She began experimentation with electricity, using a lightning rod to conduct her experiments. Frequently, the electrical storms apparently originated in and over the area within which the brother's land is located. Because of this, the aunt would often angle her rod over the fence between her property and the brother's property to maximize her chances of success. After one entire rainy and windy season of experiments, the brother had grown tired of the aunt's lightning-rod intrusions because they interfered with his ham radio operations in his garage. The brother brought suit to enjoin such lightning-rod experiments. At trial, it was found that the aunt had been conducting her activities in the airspace directly above the brother's land. The court should\n\nA. enjoin the aunt's experiments because they constitute an unreasonable interference with the space above the brother's land.\nB. enjoin the aunt's experiments because one does not have the right to engage in such scientific experiment without permission.\nC. not enjoin the aunt's lightning rod experiments if they were necessary to protect her property from the electrical storms.\nD. not enjoin the aunt's experiments because the brother does not own the space above his land.\n"

In this case, since the aunt's lightning rod experiments appear to be causing interference with the brother's use and enjoyment of his land (\u2014 specifically, by disrupting his ham radio operations \u2014 the court might reasonably find that these actions constitute an unreasonable interference. Thus, it may enjoin the aunt's experiments to prevent further disturbance to the brother's property and enjoyment of his land."
