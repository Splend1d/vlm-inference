Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn scenario 1, leaving a thank-you note on a parked police car might be seen as an act of kindness and appreciation for the police officer's work. It could be considered a positive gesture that could boost morale or show gratitude, depending on the context. This action would likely not be viewed as morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, failing to push an old woman to the ground when she walks by you is the correct action to take, as it prevents potential harm to the old woman. This action aligns with the moral standard of avoiding causing harm or injury to others, which is generally accepted as right.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, leaving a thank-you note on a police car is not morally wrong, while not pushing an old woman to prevent her from falling is the morally correct action."
