By distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.\n\nMax Weber, a prominent sociologist, did not specifically address what is referred to as the \"England problem.\" However, he did extensively analyze the relationship between the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism in his work \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.\" In this work, Weber explored how certain cultural and religious values, particularly those found among Protestants, contributed to the rise of capitalism. \n\nWeber's approach involved identifying specific characteristics of the English legal system and other institutions that enabled the growth of capitalist practices. He focused on aspects such as the role of law in facilitating property rights, contracts, and entrepreneurship, which were crucial for the development of a market economy. By examining these institutional features, Weber aimed to explain why certain societies, like England, were more conducive to capitalist development compared to others."
