This model emphasizes that audiences do not merely passively absorb information but rather selectively interpret and construct meanings from the media content they encounter. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. audiences selectively interpret what they want to hear\n\nThis alignss with the concept of active interpretation, where individuals engage with media content in a way that resonates with their personal perspectives and understanding, potentially reinforcing or challenging their existing beliefs."
