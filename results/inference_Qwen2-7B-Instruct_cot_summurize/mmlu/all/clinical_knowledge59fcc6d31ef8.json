It works by increasing the amount of creatine stored in your muscles, which can enhance their ability to produce energy during short bursts of intense activity, such as weightlifting. This can lead to gains in muscle mass and strength over time. However, it's important to note that these effects are typically accompanied by an increase in overall body mass, including non-muscle components like water weight due to increased muscle metabolism and hydration. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that while creatine is generally safe for healthy individuals when taken in recommended doses, some people may experience side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort ( especially when starting the supplement. Also, it's crucial to maintain proper hydration levels when taking creatine, as dehydration can exacerbate any potential side effects. Additionally, creatine can affect electrolyte balance, so it's important to consume enough sodium and other electrolytes to avoid imbalances."
