Since \\(f\\) is a homomorphism, we have:\n\n\\[f(n) = f(1 + 1 + \\ldots + 1 = f(1) + f(1) + \\ldots + f(1) = nx\\]\n\nfor any integer \\(n\\). This means that the value of \\(f(n)\\) depends only on the value of \\(f(1)\\).\n\nNow, in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\), the elements are just \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) since it is the integers modulo 2. Thus, \\(x\\) can only be \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) in order for \\(f(n)\\) to always result in an element of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\).\n\n- If \\(f(1) = 0\\), then \\(f(n) = 0\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- If \\(f(1) = 1\\), then \\(f(n) = n \\mod 2\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nTherefore, there are exactly **two** homomorphisms from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) into \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\), which makes the answer **B. 2**."
