In the original ResNet (Residual Networks) paper by Kaiming He et al., they do introduce layer normalization as one of the key innovations that help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and improve the training of very deep residual networks. Batch normalization was introduced earlier by Ioffe and Szegedy in their 2015 paper \"Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift,\" which focuses on batch normalization.\n\nStatement 2 is false. DCGANs ( or Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, do not specifically use self-attention mechanisms to stabilize training. Self-attention mechanisms became prominent later, particularly in the context of transformer models in natural language processing, but they were not part of the original DCGAN architecture. DCGANs instead rely on convolutional layers and the adversarial training setup between a generator and a discriminator network for generating images."
