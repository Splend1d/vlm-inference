Mouth: Salivary glands secrete saliva, which contains amylase, an enzyme that starts the breakdown of carbohydrates.\n\nB. Stomach: The stomach secretes gastric juices, which contain pepsin, an enzyme that begins the protein digestion process.\n\nD. Small intestine: The pancreas and liver secrete enzymes into the small intestine to aid in the complete digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.\n\nThe gall bladder does not secrete digestive enzymes; instead, it stores and releases bile produced by the liver. Bile helps in the emulsification of fats, making them easier for lipase (an enzyme also secreted by the pancreas) to digest."
