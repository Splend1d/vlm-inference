He argued that we can perceive the rightness or wrongness of specific actions directly, without needing to deduce these principles from other facts. For example, one might intuitively grasp that lying is morally wrong in some cases, and that harming others without justification is also morally wrong. These specific intuitions about the rightness or wrongness of actions can then inform us about more general moral principles.\n\nSo, according to Ross, we first see the prima facie rightness or wrongness of particular acts, and then generalize these intuitions into broader moral principles. This contrasts with views that suggest moral knowledge comes from deduction (from more general principles to specific instances), philosophical proof, or explicit moral instruction received during childhood."
