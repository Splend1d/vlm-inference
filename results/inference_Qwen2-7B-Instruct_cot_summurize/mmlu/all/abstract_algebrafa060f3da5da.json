                    "text": "Statement 1 is false. Not any set of two vectors in R^2 is linearly independent. For instance, consider the set of vectors \\(\\{[1, 0], [0, 1]\\}\\). These are clearly linearly independent because there are no non-zero scalars \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a[1, 0] + b[0, 1] = [0, 0]\\), except for \\(a = b = 0\\).\n\nHowever, take another set of vectors \\(\\{[1, 0], [2, 0]\\}\\). These vectors are not linearly independent since one can be expressed as a scalar multiple of the other (\\(2[1, 0] = [2, 0]\\)). So, it's possible to find a set of two vectors in R^2 that are linearly dependent.\n\nStatement 2 is true. The dimension of a vector space \\(V\\), denoted by \\(\\dim(V)\\), is defined as the number of vectors in any basis for \\(V\\). A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span \\(V\\). If \\(V = \\text{span}(v_1, \\ldots, v_k)\\) and \\(\\{v_1, \\ldots, v_k\\}\\) are linearly independent, then this set itself forms a basis for \\(V\\), because they span \\(V\\) and are linearly independent. Hence, the dimension of \\(V\\) is indeed \\(k\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. False, True**."
