Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, styling one's hair to \"show up\" a stepmom who is undergoing chemotherapy due to treatment side effects can be seen as disrespectful and cruel. It takes advantage of a vulnerable situation for the purpose of causing emotional harm, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, keeping a friend's private confession about having a crush to oneself doesn't inherently cause any harm. Unless the person with the crush has explicitly asked to keep it a secret or there's a specific reason why this information should be shared immediately, not sharing the information is typically not considered morally wrong. It could be seen as a lack of loyalty or respect for the friend's feelings, but it's not universally regarded as a moral transgression.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 involves an action that is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not involve a morally wrong action."
