There were two farms situated on the property, one farm on the eastern half and one farm on the western half of the property. The farmer recorded a general warranty deed conveying the property to his son. Two years later, the son obtained a mortgage, secured by the farm property, in favor of his friend. The friend promptly recorded the mortgage. Twenty years later, the son sold the property to an investor by a general warranty deed, with the investor assuming the friend's mortgage. The following year, the investor subdivided the property and sold the western farm to a developer, while retaining the eastern farm. There was no mention of the mortgage in the general warranty deed between the investor and developer. The developer was unable to rezone the property to build houses as he had planned, so the developer sold the western farm to a florist. The conveyance to the florist made no mention of the friend's mortgage. Three years later, the florist entered into a contract with a rancher, pursuant to which the rancher would purchase the western farm for $75,000. The closing date for the deal was set for January 15. Assuming that on January 10, the rancher conducted a title search that revealed the friend's mortgage on the property, which of the following is correct?\n\nA. The rancher would be entitled to rescind the real estate contract with the florist immediately.\nB. The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\nC. The mortgage would only encumber the eastern farm, not the western farm, because the investor's partition of the property created a joint tenancy.\nD. The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15.\n"

                    "text": "B. The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\n\nIn a state with a notice recording statute, if a mortgage or lien is properly recorded, it becomes a public record and serves as constructive notice to any subsequent buyer of the property. This means that once the mortgage is recorded, anyone who buys the property after the recording has notice of the existing lien or encumbrance. \n\nIn this scenario, when the investor assumed the friend's mortgage upon purchasing the property from the son, the investor took on the responsibility of the existing mortgage, which was properly recorded. When the investor then sold the western farm to the developer without mentioning the mortgage in the deed, the developer became aware of the mortgage only after conducting a title search. \n\nAs a result, the developer did not have actual knowledge of the mortgage when acquiring the western farm. However, since the mortgage was properly recorded and the developer should have been aware of it through due diligence ( such as conducting a title search before purchasing, the mortgage does indeed render the title to the western farm unmarketable. \n\nIf the rancher discovers the mortgage after purchasing the property, the situation depends on whether they can rescind the contract or claim compensation. In many jurisdictions, the ability to rescind a contract due to a discovered encumbrance is governed by specific laws and potentially by the terms of the contract itself. However, without the option to rescind the contract immediately (as stated in option A), or without the mortgage affecting only the eastern farm ( as stated in option c), the most accurate statement based on the information provided is:\n\nB. The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\n\nThis implies that the rancher may face difficulties selling the property in the future due to the existing mortgage, but it does not necessarily mean they can immediately rescind the contract with the florist or that the mortgage only affects the eastern farm."
