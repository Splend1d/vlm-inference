This action violates basic human rights and respect for individuals, and it is not only morally reprehensible but also illegal in most societies.\n\nIn Scenario 2, screaming at a sleeping baby is generally considered morally wrong because it can cause harm or distress to the baby, and it disregards the baby's right to a peaceful environment. It may also be seen as a neglectful behavior if done repeatedly or in a way that endangers the baby's well-being. However, context can sometimes change this judgment, such as in emergencies where a loud noise is necessary to alert others."
