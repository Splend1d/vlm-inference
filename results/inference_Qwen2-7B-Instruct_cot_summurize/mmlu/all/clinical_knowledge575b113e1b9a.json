The conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate yields a net gain of two ATP molecules and two NADH molecules. However, only three ATP molecules are actually formed during glycolysis - two from the oxidation of glucose itself and one from the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate."
