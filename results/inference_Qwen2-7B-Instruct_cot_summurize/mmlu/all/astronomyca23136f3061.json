Specifically, he observed that at noon on the summer solstice in the city of Syene ( (modern-day Aswan, Egypt), the Sun was directly overhead and cast no shadow. In contrast, in Alexandria, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of Syene, he observed that the Sun cast a slight shadow, indicating that it was not directly overhead. He used the angle of this shadow to calculate the angular difference between the two cities, which he then converted into a proportion of Earth's circumference. This method allowed him to make a remarkably accurate estimation of the Earth's size. \n\nSo, the correct answer is **C**. By comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day."
