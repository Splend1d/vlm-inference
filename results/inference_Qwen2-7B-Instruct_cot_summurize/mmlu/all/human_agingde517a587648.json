Research in psychology suggests that while there may be some changes in personality traits over the lifespan, these changes are generally small and not consistent across all individuals. Some studies indicate that openness to experience might decrease with age, while conscientiousness might increase. However, these findings are not universal and can vary based on individual differences, life experiences, and cultural factors. Therefore, the question of whether personality changes with age remains an important area of inquiry in geropsychology."
