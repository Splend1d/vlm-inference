Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\n\\[ \\Phi_E = \\frac{Q_{\\text{enclosed}}}{\\varepsilon_0} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\Phi_E \\) is the total electric flux through the surface,\n- \\( Q_{\\text{enclosed}} \\) is the total charge enclosed within the surface,\n- \\( \\varepsilon_0 \\) is the permittivity of free space.\n\nIf there are no charges outside the surface, then the total electric flux through the surface is indeed directly proportional to the enclosed charge. However, if there are charges outside the surface, the electric field will be influenced by those external charges, and the relationship between the flux and the enclosed charge becomes more complex."
