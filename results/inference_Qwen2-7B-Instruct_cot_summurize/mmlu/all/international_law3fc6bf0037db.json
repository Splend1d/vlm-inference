This ensures that states are given the opportunity to address alleged human rights violations within their jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Restricting Petitions**: It helps manage the workload of international human rights bodies by ensuring that they only deal with cases where all domestic avenues have been exhausted without providing adequate remedy. This prevents overburdening these international bodies with numerous complaints that could be resolved through national processes.\n\n3. **Preventing Abuse of the System**: The rule acts as a deterrent against frivolous or abusive filings. Applicants must have genuinely pursued all available remedies within their home state before seeking recourse at an international level, thus promoting the integrity and efficiency of international human rights mechanisms.\n\n4. **Encouraging Domestic Solutions**: It promotes the use of domestic legal systems as the primary means for addressing human rights issues, which can lead to more culturally sensitive and context-specific solutions.\n\n5. **Consistency and Uniformity**: By adhering to this principle, international human rights law seeks to achieve consistency in the treatment of similar cases across different jurisdictions, contributing to a uniform application of international standards.\n\nIn summary, the exhaustion of local remedies is a cornerstone of international human rights law designed to balance the need for global oversight with the imperative of supporting and strengthening national legal systems."
