The nurse, consultant, and GP.\n\nAccording to the Department of Health's guidelines from 2004, the discharge checklist should be completed by the healthcare professionals involved in the patient's care, which typically includes the nurse responsible for the patient's care, the consulting physician who has been overseeing the patient's treatment, and the General Practitioner (GP) who will continue the patient's care post-discharge. This collaborative effort ensures that all necessary information is accurately recorded and communicated for the patient's safe transition from hospital to home or another care setting."
