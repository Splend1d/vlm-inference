Because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck.\n\nRonald Dworkin, a prominent legal philosopher, supports liberal egalitarianism because he believes in giving people control over their lives and making fair adjustments for things that are out of their control (individual luck). He argues that society should compensate for disadvantages not caused by an individual's actions to ensure a fair distribution of resources and opportunities. This alignss with the principle of \"fair equality of opportunity,\" which is a key component of liberal egalitarianism as proposed by philosophers like John Rawls."
