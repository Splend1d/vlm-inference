Mr. Em's class is more homogeneous than Mr. Bee's.\n\nStandard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.\n\nIn this context, Mr. Bee's class having a standard deviation of 11.2 suggests that there was a higher degree of variability in their test scores compared to Mr. Em's class, which had a standard deviation of 5.6. This means that the scores in Mr. Em's class were more tightly clustered around the average score, indicating greater homogeneity in performance. Conversely, Mr. Bee's class showed a wider spread of scores, suggesting more heterogeneity in performance."
