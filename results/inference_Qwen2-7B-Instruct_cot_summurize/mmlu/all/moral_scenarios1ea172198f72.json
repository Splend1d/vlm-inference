This action is helpful and supportive.\n\nIn scenario 2, pushing someone on a swing without their knowledge could be seen as manipulative or potentially harmful, depending on the context. If Jeff was unable to control his movements and it caused him injury, or if it was done in a way that made him feel uncomfortable or violated, this action would be morally wrong. It's important to respect personal boundaries and consent when interacting with others."
