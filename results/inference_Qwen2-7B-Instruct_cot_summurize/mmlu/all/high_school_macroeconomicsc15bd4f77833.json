These initial estimates are based on incomplete data and are subject to revision as more complete information becomes available. The revisions usually occur when more detailed information is collected and analyzed over time. Therefore, option A correctly states that these estimates are subject to revision. Option C is incorrect because GDP estimates are not necessarily available after a thirty-day lag; they can vary depending on the specific release schedule of the statistical agency."
