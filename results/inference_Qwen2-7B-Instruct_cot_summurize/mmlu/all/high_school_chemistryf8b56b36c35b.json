                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the molar mass of the metal based on the information provided and then find out how much metal reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid (HCl.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of moles of hydrogen produced:\n\nAt STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure (0\u00b0C and 1 atm), the volume of one mole of any ideal gas is 22.4 liters or 22400 mL. So, if 0.0623 grams of metal produces 28.3 mL of hydrogen, we can find the molar mass of hydrogen produced by this reaction:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of hydrogen} = \\frac{\\text{Volume of hydrogen}}{\\text{Volume of 1 mole of hydrogen at STP}} = \\frac{28.3\\ mL}{22400\\ mL/mol} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of hydrogen} = \\frac{28.3}{22400} \\approx 0.001268 \\, mol \\]\n\nSince hydrogen has an atomic mass of approximately 1 g/mol, the mass of hydrogen produced is nearly equal to its moles. However, we're actually interested in the molar mass of the metal. We can use the mass of the metal and the moles of hydrogen to find the molar mass of the metal:\n\n\\[ \\text{Molar mass of metal} = \\frac{\\text{Mass of metal}}{\\text{Moles of hydrogen}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Molar mass of metal} = \\frac{0.0623\\ g}{0.001228\\ mol} \\approx 50.96\\ g/mol \\]\n\nThis calculated molar mass of the metal doesn't exactly match any of the options given, but it seems there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting the question's intent. The question asks for the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid. Given the information provided, we're focusing on the metal's reactivity with HCl rather than directly calculating the mass of metal per mole of HCl due to the complexity of the reaction stoichiometry not being explicitly given.\n\nHowever, assuming the question seeks the metal's molar mass based on the provided calculation, the closest answer to our calculated molar mass (50.96 g/mol among the choices would be:\n\nB. 493 g\n\nThis choice doesn't directly correspond to the calculated m-value, suggesting a potential misinterpretation or error in the question's phrasing or the available answer choices. In a typical scenario, if we were looking for the metal's molar mass, our calculation suggests it should be closer to 51 g/mol, which isn't listed among the provided options. \n\nGiven the context and the answer choices provided, the correct interpretation likely involves understanding that the question is asking for the metal's molar mass based on the reaction with HCl, which aligns with the calculated value being closest to option B. However, it's important to note that the precise calculation suggests an answer not listed in the options, indicating a discrepancy in the question's formulation or answer choices."
