Marcus Garvey's statement reflects a sentiment of pride in one's ethnic or racial identity and a desire for self-determination and empowerment, which aligns with themes of separatism. This is particularly evident in his call for \"the cry of Africa for the Africans,\" suggesting a movement towards independence and self-governance for people of African descent. This perspective contrasts with integrationist ideas that advocate for full participation and equality within the broader society, without the need for ethnic or racial communities to form distinct or separate entities."
