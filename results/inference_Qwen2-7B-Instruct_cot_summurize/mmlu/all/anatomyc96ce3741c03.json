Instead, they are lined with smooth muscle and have a layer of respiratory epithelium which includes ciliated cells, secretory cells, and basal cells. The smooth muscle layer allows for the bronchioles to dilate or constrict in response to various stimuli, influencing airflow into and out of the lungs."
