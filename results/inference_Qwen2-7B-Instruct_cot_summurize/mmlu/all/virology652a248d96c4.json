The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo**\n\nThis option refers to the method of production for modern rabies vaccines, which involves growing the virus in cell cultures derived from human tissue. This process allows for the safe and efficient production of the vaccine, ensuring it can be administered without risk to the patient or any ethical concerns related to animal-derived materials.\n\nOptions A, B, and C either describe historical facts about the development of the vaccine or outdated practices that have been replaced by more contemporary methods. For example, while L. Pasteur did develop early versions of the vaccine, modern vaccines do change over time as technology and safety standards evolve. Similarly, the use of air-dried spinal cord from infected rabbits was a method used in the past but is not how current rabies vaccines are produced. And, the requirement for 16 doses given into the peritoneal cavity is also not reflective of current vaccination protocols, which typically consist of a series of injections into the muscle."
