This can be found using the Z-score formula:\n\n\\[Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nWhere \\(Z\\) is the Z-score corresponding to the 10th percentile. For the 10th percentile, \\(Z \\approx -1.282\\) ( (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[-1.282 = \\frac{x - 6}{1.6}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x = -1.282 \\times 1.6 + 6\\]\n\\[x = -1.5384 + 6\\]\n\\[x = 4.4616\\]\n\nSince we're looking for the highest amount of rainfall that still places it among the driiest 10 percent, we round down to the nearest option given:\n\n- A. 8.05 inches ( is too high.\n- B. 7.6 inches is also too high.\n- C. 3.95 inches is within the calculated range.\n- D. 3.37 inches is also within the calculated range but lower than option C.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. 3.95 inches**."
