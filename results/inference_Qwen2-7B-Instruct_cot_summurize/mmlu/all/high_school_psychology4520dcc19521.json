To test this, one would typically use a correlational method to see if there is an association between these behaviors. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While a correlation may indicate that these behaviors tend to occur together, it does not prove that one causes the other. Further research, possibly including experimental designs, would be needed to explore causality or mechanisms behind any observed correlations."
