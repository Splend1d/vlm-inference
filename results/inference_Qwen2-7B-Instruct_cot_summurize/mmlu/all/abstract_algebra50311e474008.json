With \\(p=2\\):\n- Leading coefficient (1 is not divisible by 2.\n- 2 divides the other coefficient (-12).\n- However, \\(2^2 = 4\\) also divides the constant term (-12).\n\nSince condition 3 is not satisfied (because \\(p^2\\) does divide the constant term, not just \\(p\\), the Eisenstein criterion does not apply here.\n\nB. With \\(p=3\\):\n- Leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3.\n- 3 divides the other coefficient (-12).\n- And, \\(3^2 = 9\\) does not divide the constant term (-12).\n\nAll conditions of the Eisenstein criterion are satisfied with \\(p=3\\), so this polynomial would be considered irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) under this criterion.\n\nC. With \\(p=5\\):\n- Leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 5.\n- 5 divides the other coefficient (-12).\n- And, \\(5^2 = 25\\) does not divide the constant term (-12).\n\nAll conditions of the Eisenstein criterion are satisfied with \\(p=5\\), so this polynomial would also be considered irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) under this criterion.\n\nD. No:\nThis option suggests that none of the Eisenstein criteria can be applied to the given polynomial, which we have seen is not entirely true based on the analysis for options B and C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are among A, B, and C, as the polynomial \\(x^2 - 12\\) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion with both \\(p=3\\) and \\(p=5\\)."
