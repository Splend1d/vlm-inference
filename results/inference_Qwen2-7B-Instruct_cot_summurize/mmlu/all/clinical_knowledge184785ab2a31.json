They play an essential role in the functioning of many enzymes, particularly those involved in oxidation-reduction reactions. Examples include heme (found in cytochrome enzymes), biotin, and cobalamin ((vitamin B12). \n\nOptions A, B, and C describe different characteristics or functions related to enzymes but do not specifically define prosthetic groups as they are described. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
