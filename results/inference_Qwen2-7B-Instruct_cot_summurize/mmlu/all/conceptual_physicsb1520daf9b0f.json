The color does not come from the object absorbing specific colors but rather reflecting certain colors back to our eyes.\n\nIn the case of a red rose, its petals absorb most of the visible spectrum of light except for red wavelengths, which they reflect. Our eyes then perceive this reflected red light as the color red.\n\nTherefore, when you look at the red petals of a rose, the color light you're seeing is:\n\nA. red."
