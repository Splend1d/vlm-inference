Implementing self-control procedures at an early stage can help prevent the development of habits or behaviors that may lead to issues like alcohol abuse. This approach allows for proactive management rather than reactive treatment.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the effectiveness of self-control procedures can depend on various factors including individual differences, the specific behavior being targeted, and the context in which the behavior occurs. Therefore, while early intervention might be beneficial, other strategies mentioned (like managing strong drive levels, minimizing competing behaviors, or aligning with reinforcements - can also be crucial depending on the situation."
