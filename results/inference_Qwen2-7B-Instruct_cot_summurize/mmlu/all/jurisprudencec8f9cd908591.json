Fails to address the actual capabilities people have to benefit from his theory of justice.\n\nSen's capability approach focuses on the actual freedoms and opportunities that individuals have to lead lives they value, rather than on distributive justice in terms of income or wealth ( which is the main focus of Rawls' theory. Rawls' theory is concerned with the distribution of resources and goods in society to ensure fair equality of opportunity and to protect basic liberties. In contrast, the capability approach emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and agency, aiming to ensure that everyone has the means to achieve a decent standard of living and to participate in society. \n\nSen argues that focusing solely on outcomes (as Rawls does) does not necessarily lead to an understanding of how those outcomes affect people's lives in meaningful ways. The capability approach seeks to capture this by looking at what people can do and be, rather than just what they own or consume. This aligns more closely with Rawls' emphasis on individual rights and liberties, but differs significantly in its focus on capabilities and functionings rather than just economic outcomes."
