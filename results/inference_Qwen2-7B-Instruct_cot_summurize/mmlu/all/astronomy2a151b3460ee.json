                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The greenhouse effect works through the action of certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases (which include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and others. These gases allow sunlight (in the form of visible light) to pass through the atmosphere and reach the Earth's surface where it is absorbed and re-emitted as heat (in the form of infrared radiation. The key point here is that these greenhouse gases also absorb some of this infrared radiation. \n\nWhen infrared radiation is emitted from the Earth's surface, some of it is absorbed by the greenhouse gases. This absorption traps the heat close to the Earth's surface, preventing it from escaping into space. As a result, the Earth's temperature is raised, creating a warming effect that is essential for supporting life on Earth. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth would be much colder and less hospitable.\n\nOptions A, C, and D either describe incorrect mechanisms or misidentify the primary role of greenhouse gases. Option A incorrectly suggests that ozone is responsible for the greenhouse effect, when in fact, it is ozone that helps protect the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays. Option C suggests that greenhouse gases absorb sunlight directly, when in reality they absorb infrared radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. And option D incorrectly states that greenhouse gases absorb X-rays and ultraviolet light, which do not play a significant role in the greenhouse effect."
