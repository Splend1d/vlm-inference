So, \\(100 \\times 0.8 = 80\\) workers remain after the first year.\n\n**Second Year:**\n\n- For the workers placed in the first year, 5% leave during the second year. Thus, 95% remain. So, \\(80 \\times 0.95 = 76\\) workers from the first year's placements remain.\n- Additionally, for the 100 workers hired in the second year, we need to calculate how many will leave and how many will stay. Since 20% of all placements leave within the first year, this means 80% remain for the second year. So, \\(100 \\times 0.8 = 80\\) workers from the second year's placements remain after the first year.\n- Out of these 80, 5% will leave during the second year, so \\(80 \\times 0.95 = 76\\) workers from the second year's placements will remain by the end of the second year.\n\n**Total Workers Expected to Be on the Job at the End of the Second Year:**\n\nAdding the remaining workers from both years gives us:\n\n\\[76 + 76 = 152\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 152**."
