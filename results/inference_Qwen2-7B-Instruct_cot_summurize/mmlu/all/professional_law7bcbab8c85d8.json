When the boyfriend forged the student's signature on the deed conveying the property to the co-worker, this act of forgery nullifies any rights the student had as a joint tenant with the right of survivorship. Once the forged deed was recorded, it created a new title to the property in favor of the co-worker. Since the student did not sign the deed voluntarily or with her consent, she is not bound by it. Therefore, the original joint tenancy agreement no longer exists for the portion of the property conveyed through the forged deed. \n\nAs a result, the property in question is now owned solely by the co-worker in fee simple, as he legally obtained title through the fraudulent transaction. The student retains ownership of any portion of the undeveloped parcel that was not part of the transaction, assuming there was more than one parcel originally involved."
