This is because surface area calculations involve multiplying dimensions together ( for example, for a cube, the surface area formula is \\(6s^2\\) where \\(s\\) is the length of a side. When you triple the size, it becomes \\(6(3s)^2 = 6 \\times 9s^2 = 9 \\times\\) original surface area.\n\nFor volume, which is a three-dimensional measurement, the increase is by a factor of \\(3^3 = 27\\). This is because volume calculations involve multiplying all three dimensions together. For a cube, the volume formula is \\(s^3\\). When you triple the size, it becomes \\((3s)^3 = 27s^3 = 27 \\times\\) original volume.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 9 and the volume by 27."
