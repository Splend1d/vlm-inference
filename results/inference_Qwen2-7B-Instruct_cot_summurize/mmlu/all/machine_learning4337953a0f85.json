Highway Networks, proposed by Gao Huang et al., are a type of neural network that allows for the modeling of complex dependencies between layers by using gates similar to those found in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs. The key innovation was the use of 'gate units' which control the flow of information from one layer to the next. As for the part about \"eschewing max pooling in favor of convolutions,\" this is not accurate. Highway Networks do indeed use convolutional layers, but they also use gates to regulate the flow of information, which is quite different from simply replacing max pooling with convolutions. However, the core statement that Highway Networks came after ResNets is correct.\n\nStatement 2: DenseNets, which stand for Dense Convolutional Networks, typically require more memory than ResNets. This is because DenseNets have a dense connectivity pattern where each layer is directly connected to every other layer in previous stages. This design facilitates feature reuse across layers and stages, which can be beneficial for learning hierarchical features. However, this dense structure leads to higher computational and memory costs compared to architectures like ResNets, which have a less connected structure. So, the statement is true."
