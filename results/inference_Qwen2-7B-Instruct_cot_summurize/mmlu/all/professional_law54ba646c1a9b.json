                    "text": "An aluminum can manufacturer entered into negotiations with an aluminum sheeting supplier to supply the manufacturer's requirements of aluminum sheeting. After extensive discussions, the parties signed the following agreement on June 1:\"The supplier agrees to supply all of the manufacturer's requirements of aluminum sheeting for a period of two years beginning on August 1, at a price of $3. 00 per unit. \"On June 16, the manufacturer notified the supplier that it would need a delivery of 2,000 units by August 1 to accommodate its needs. The supplier informed the manufacturer that it did not contemplate such high requirements, since its plant's capacity was only 2,800 per month. Moreover, the supplier pointed out that in order to meet the manufacturer's order of 2,000 units, it would probably lose two long-time customers, whose outstanding orders would have to be canceled. After a week of negotiations, on June 23 the supplier orally agreed to deliver 2,000 units of sheeting to the manufacturer by August 1. The parties then signed the following contract:\"The supplier agrees to supply all of the manufacturer's requirements of aluminum sheeting for a period of two years beginning August 1, at a price of $3. 50 per unit. The manufacturer agrees that it will require a minimum of 800 units in every month of the agreement. \"On June 25 the supplier notified its two longtime customers that it was canceling their August orders (of 800 units) because of other contract commitments. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the written agreement between the parties on June 23?\n\nA. The agreement constituted a valid modification of their June 1 contract.\nB. The agreement was unenforceable, since the supplier was under a pre-existing duty to supply the manufacturer with the sheeting under their June 1 contract.\nC. The agreement constituted an enforceable reformation of their June 1 contract.\nD. The agreement was unenforceable, since there was no new consideration.\n"

The agreement constituted a valid modification of their June 1 contract.\n\nExplanation:\n- A modification occurs when both parties agree to change the terms of an existing contract. In this case, both the supplier and the manufacturer agreed to change the price per unit from $3.00 to $3.50 and to include a minimum monthly requirement of 800 units from the manufacturer.\n- This modification is valid as long as both parties consent to the changes, which they did through the June 23 contract.\n- The fact that the supplier had an obligation to supply the manufacturer under their June 1 contract does not make the modification unenforceable; instead, it is part of the context within which the modification occurred.\n- There is new consideration in the form of the changed price and the minimum monthly requirement, which the manufacturer agreed to in exchange for the supplier's commitment to deliver 2,000 units by August 1.\n\nTherefore, option A accurately describes the nature of the June 23 agreement in relation to the June 1 contract."
