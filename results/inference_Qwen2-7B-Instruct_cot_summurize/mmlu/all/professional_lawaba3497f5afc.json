While the woman was away on a vacation, there was a burglary at her home, and her favorite painting was stolen. Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him. After the woman refused to make the payment, the detective sued the woman for breach of contract. Who is most likely to prevail?\n\nA. The woman, because her promise was gratuitous.\nB. The woman, because the insurance company owed her a pre-existing duty to find the painting.\nC. The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer.\nD. The detective, because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, so there was sufficient consideration to support the woman's promise.\n"

The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer.\n\nIn contract law, an offer must be accepted through clear and unequivocal action or communication. In this scenario, the woman's promise to pay an additional $50,000 in exchange for the recovery of the stolen painting can be considered an offer. The detective's actions in investigating the theft and recovering the painting can be seen as an acceptance of that offer, as he performed the act necessary to fulfill the terms of the agreement.\n\nThe fact that the painting was insured for less than its market value does not affect the legal sufficiency of the consideration provided by the woman's promise. Consideration refers to something of value exchanged between parties, and in this case, the detective's effort to recover the painting constitutes adequate consideration.\n\nTherefore, the detective is more likely to prevail in the lawsuit for breach of contract, based on the principle that he fulfilled the terms of the woman's offer by successfully recovering the stolen artwork."
