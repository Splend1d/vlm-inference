Huemer is critical of the utilitarian and consequentialist justifications often used to support such prohibitions, arguing that they do not adequately account for individual rights and the importance of personal autonomy.\n\nIn the context of drug use, Huemer might argue that:\n\nB. The harm to individual drug users does not justify state prohibition of drug use.\n\nThis alignss with his broader philosophical stance on respecting individual autonomy and the moral significance of personal choices. Huemer would likely contend that if individuals are voluntarily engaging in drug use and suffer no significant harm to others (a key criterion in justifying prohibitive measures), then the state's intervention to prohibit such use should be questioned from a moral standpoint. His views would suggest that personal freedom and the right to make decisions about one's own body and mind outweigh the potential harms associated with drug use, especially when those harms are are contained within the user and do not extend to society at large."
