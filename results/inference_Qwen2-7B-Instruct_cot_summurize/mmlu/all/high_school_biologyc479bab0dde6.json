Therefore, option B, \"The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism,\" would be one that Darwin would have rejected.\n\nDarwin believed in the concept of populations evolving over generations rather than individual organisms. While individuals within a population can indeed develop new characteristics (as suggested in option C), it is the traits of the entire population that are subject to evolutionary change, not the individual organisms themselves. These changes are then passed down to offspring, potentially affecting the future generation's traits and thus the evolution of the species.\n\nOptions A and D align with Darwinian principles:\n- A. Environmental change plays a role in evolution: This statement acknowledges the importance of environmental factors in driving evolutionary changes, which is central to Darwin's theory.\n- D. Inherited variation in a population is a necessary precondition for natural selection to operate: This statement correctly identifies that genetic variation within a population is essential for natural selection to act upon, selecting for traits that enhance survival and reproduction in a particular environment.\n\nThus, option B is the statement that Darwin would have rejected."
