                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. **f is one-to-one and onto.** This cannot be true. For a function to be onto (or surjective), every element in the codomain must be the image of at least one element in the domain. However, since the codomain is \\((0, 1]\\) and the domain is \\((0, 1)\\), there's no way for \\(f\\) to map to the value 1 in the codomain because the domain does not include 1. Therefore, \\(f\\) cannot be onto. Hence, statement I is false.\n\nII. **The image of \\(f\\) is compact.** A set is compact if it is both closed and bounded. Since the codomain \\((0, 1]\\) includes an endpoint (1), any function that maps into this set will have its image be a subset of \\((0, 1]\\). Even though this might seem like it could potentially be compact depending on how \\(f\\) behaves, remember that compactness also requires the set to be closed. The interval \\((0, 1]\\) is not closed as it does not contain all its limit points (specifically, it does not contain 0, which is a limit point. Thus, the image of \\(f\\) being \\((0, 1]\\) is not compact because \\((0, 1]\\) itself is not a closed set. So, statement II is false.\n\nIII. **\\(f\\) is continuous, one-to-one, and onto.** This statement can be true under certain conditions. For \\(f\\) to be one-to-one and onto from \\((0, 1)\\) to \\((0, 1]\\), it would need to map every element in the open interval \\((0, 1)\\) uniquely to an element in \\((0, 1]\\) without missing any values in the codomain. This is possible if we consider \\(f(x) = x\\) for \\(x\\) in \\((0, 1)\\) and somehow \"attains\" the value 1 in the codomain, which is tricky given the nature of the domain and codomain. However, considering the standard definition and behavior of functions, achieving \"onto\" with these intervals is challenging due to the missing endpoint in the domain. But theoretically, if \\(f\\) were defined cleverly, such as approaching but never reaching 1 as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from below, it could satisfy these properties. Therefore, while it might not be straightforward or commonly done, under specific constructions, statement III could indeed be true.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement I is false.\n- Statement II is false.\n- Statement III could be true under specific, non-standard definitions or constructions of \\(f\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is **D. I and III only**, acknowledging that while I is technically false based on the standard definition of onto, III could potentially be true under very specific circumstances, which might not be immediately obvious or widely accepted without further clarification or context."
