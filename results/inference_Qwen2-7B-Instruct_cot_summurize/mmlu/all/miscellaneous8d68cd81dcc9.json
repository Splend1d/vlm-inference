Studies of the speeds and travel paths of seismic waves passing through Earth\n\nSeismic waves generated by earthquakes travel through the Earth at different speeds depending on the materials they pass through. By studying these wave speeds, scientists can infer the composition and structure of Earth's interior layers. The data obtained from seismology helps us understand the structure of the core, mantle, and lower crust in detail."
