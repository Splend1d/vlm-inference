The act of cutting or dividing a human being, especially a child, goes against basic principles of human rights and welfare.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 1 - As I packed to leave the hotel, my suitcase was overflowing with souvenirs - while it might be seen as excessive by some, it's not necessarily morally wrong. It could be viewed as wasteful or inconsiderate regarding space and resources, but it doesn't involve any harm or violation of rights.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
