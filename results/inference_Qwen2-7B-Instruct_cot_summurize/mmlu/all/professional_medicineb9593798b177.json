Medical history is remarkable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . ECG obtained in the emergency department showed atrial fibrillation with narrow QRS complex. Pulse was 146/min. Physical examination was remarkable for rapid heart rate. The patient was given oxygen via nasal cannula and intravenous metoprolol 5 mg every 5 minutes for a total of 15 mg. His pulse slowed to 90/min. Two hours after admission, he is pain free but his pulse is now 160/min. Blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg. In order to decrease the patient's pulse, which of the following should be administered intravenously?\n\nA. Digoxin\nB. Enalapril\nC. Lidocaine\nD. Metoprolol\n"

Metoprolol is a beta-blocker, which works by blocking the effects of adrenaline on the heart. This can help slow down the heart rate and reduce the workload on the heart. Therefore, another dose of metoprolol might be effective in reducing the patient's pulse.\n\nOptions A (Digoxinin, B Enalapril, and C Lidocaine are not typically used as first-line agents to decrease heart rate. \n\n- Digoxinin is used to control heart rhythm, but it does not significantly affect heart rate.\n- Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, not primarily for decreasing heart rate.\n- Lidocaine is used for arrhythmias, particularly to stabilize heart rhythms rather than to reduce heart rate. \n\nTherefore, in this situation, the best choice would likely be option D, Metoprolol, although repeated dosing or a higher dose may be necessary based on the patient's response."
