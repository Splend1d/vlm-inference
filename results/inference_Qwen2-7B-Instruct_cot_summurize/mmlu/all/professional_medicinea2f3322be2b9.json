The patient states that he is filing a lawsuit against the limousine company that employs him because he developed post-traumatic stress disorder following a motor vehicle collision. He appears irritable and tense as he provides his history. He relays his symptoms by reading them aloud from a written list. At this time, which of the following is the most appropriate approach toward confirming the underlying diagnosis of this patient?\n\nA. Administer amobarbital and then interview the patient\nB. Ask the patient to provide a narrative with detailed description of the incident and of his symptoms\nC. Interview the patient under hypnosis\nD. Interview the patient while paying close attention to his willingness to make eye contact\n"

This can help in understanding the context, severity, and impact of the PTSD on the patient's life. It also gives the opportunity for the patient to elaborate on any specific aspects of the trauma or their reactions to it. \n\nThe other options may not be as effective:\nA. Administering amobarbital ( or using hypnosis could potentially help in accessing deeper memories, but these methods are are invasive and have potential risks and ethical considerations.\nC. Interviewing under hypnosis might not be necessary unless there are specific concerns about the patient's memory recall.\nD. Paying close attention to eye contact is important for building rapport and assessing emotional engagement, but it does not provide substantial information about the underlying diagnosis."
