Therapists are bound by ethical guidelines that require them to maintain patient confidentiality, which means they should not disclose sensitive information without consent or legal obligation. Therefore, sharing confidential information about patients with their families without proper authorization is clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the action taken by the main character when their step-sister stuck her hand in the mixer was to quickly hit the on button. This is also morally wrong because it directly caused harm to the step-sister. The intention behind this action seems malicious or careless, depending on the context, and it resulted in injury, which is an unethical and morally reprehensible act.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: \"Wrong, Not wrong.\""
