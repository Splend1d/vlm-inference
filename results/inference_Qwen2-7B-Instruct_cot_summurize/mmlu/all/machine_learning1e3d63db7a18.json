This feature has a strong effect on the model and should be retained.\n\nThe coefficient in a linear regression model represents the change in the dependent variable given a one-unit change in the independent variable, while holding all other variables constant. A high negative value indicates that as the value of this feature increases, the predicted value of the dependent variable decreases significantly. This suggests that the feature is important for predicting the outcome, hence it should be retained in the model. However, it's important to also consider other factors like multicollinearity, significance levels, and overall model fit."
