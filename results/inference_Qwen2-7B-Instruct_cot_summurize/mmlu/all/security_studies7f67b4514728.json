Natural-science methodology is the best way to study social science, interpretive methodologies lack the coherence required for in-depth analysis.\n\nCritical Security Studies (CSS) emphasizes the importance of understanding security from a social, political, and cultural perspective rather than solely from a military or state-centric viewpoint. It critiques traditional security studies for relying heavily on natural-science methodologies, which are seen as inappropriate for studying complex social phenomena. CSS advocates for interpretive methodologies that allow for a deeper understanding of the social world, recognizing that knowledge of the social world is not objective and that there is no clear divide between the social world and knowledge of that world. Additionally, CSS focuses on the purpose of theory being contextual understanding and practical knowledge, rather than generalizable causal claims."
