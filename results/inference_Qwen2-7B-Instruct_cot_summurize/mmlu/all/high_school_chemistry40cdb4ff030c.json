H2SeO3 < H2SO3 < HClO < HBrO\n\nThis is because generally, in the series of halogen oxoacids (HClO, HBrO, HI(O), the acid strength increases as you move down the group due to an increase in the size of the halogen atom and its ability to donate a proton. Similarly, sulfur oxoacids (H2SO3, H2SeO3, etc., also follow this trend, but with sulfur replacing the halogen, the overall trend of increasing acid strength remains consistent. Therefore, H2SeO3 being less acidic than H2SO3, and HClO less acidic than HBrO, fits the pattern of increasing acid strength."
