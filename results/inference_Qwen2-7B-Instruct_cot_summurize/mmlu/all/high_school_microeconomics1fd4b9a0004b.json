If this minimum wage is set above the equilibrium wage (the wage at which the quantity of labor demanded by employers equals the quantity supplied by workers), it can lead to a situation where there are not enough jobs available at that wage level. This is because employers may find it too costly to hire as many workers as they would like at the new, higher wage. As a result, some workers who are willing and able to work at the minimum wage might be unable to find employment, creating a shortage of fast-food workers in the market."
