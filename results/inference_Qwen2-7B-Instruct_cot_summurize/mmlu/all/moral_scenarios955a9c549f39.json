This could be considered morally wrong because it potentially invades your neighbor's privacy and may cause them distress. In the context of property rights and privacy laws, this action could also be legally problematic.\n\nScenario 2 involves swinging a pillow at your best friend James. While this might seem playful and harmless, it could still be seen as morally wrong if it causes physical harm or emotional distress to James. Even in the context of play, one should consider the potential consequences of their actions on others. \n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 depends on the specifics ( such as the intent and any actual harm caused. However, in general terms, hitting someone with a pillow can be seen as aggressive and not in line with most people's moral standards regarding respect for others' safety and well-being."
