The size of datagrams sent by a node does not need to match the size of the smallest MTU of all the links on a path to the destination. Instead, datagrams can be larger than any link's MTU, and they will be fragmented before being sent across that link. \n\nII. This statement is true. During routing, if a datagram's size exceeds the MTU of a particular link, it will be fragmented into smaller packets to fit through that link.\n\nIII. This statement is also true. Datagrams are typically reassembled at the destination. The receiving host or application expects the original datagram, so it must be able to reassemble any fragmented packets correctly."
