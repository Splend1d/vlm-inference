Establishing a special bond between a female therapist and a female client. \n\nFeminist therapy does not specifically target or require a special bond between therapists and clients based on gender. It focuses more on creating an egalitarian relationship where power dynamics are explored and dismantled, and it encourages the client to view their issues within a broader sociopolitical context. The therapy also promotes respect and support for women's experiences and rights, but this is not gender-specific."
