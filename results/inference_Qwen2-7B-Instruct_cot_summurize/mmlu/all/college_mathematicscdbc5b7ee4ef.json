If \\( A \\) is open, then \\( A = \\mathbb{R} \\).**\n\nThis statement is false. While it might seem tempting to think that if \\( A \\) is open and contains all rationals, it would have to cover the entire real line due to the density of rationals in reals, an open set does not necessarily contain its boundary points. For instance, the set of all rationals less than 2 ( \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\cap (-\\infty, 2) \\) is open because every point in this set has a neighborhood around it that is entirely contained within the set. This set clearly does not equal \\( \\mathbb{R} \\), showing that being \\( A \\) being open does not imply \\( A = \\mathbb{R} \\).\n\n**B. If \\( A \\) is closed, then \\( A = \\mathbb{R} \\).**\n\nThis statement is also false for a similar reason. A closed set includes its boundary points. However, there can be many subsets of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) that are closed and contain all rationals without beinging the entire real line. For example, the set of all rationals greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\cap (0, 1] \\), is closed but clearly not equal to \\( \\mathbb{R} \\).\n\n**C. If \\( A \\) is uncountable, then \\( A = \\mathbb{R} \\).**\n\nThis statement is false as well. Uncountability does not necessarily mean that the set equals \\( \\mathbb{R} \\). For instance, the Cantor set is uncountable, yet it is a subset of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) and has measure zero. It is possible for an uncountable set to exclude certain elements of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) while still beinging uncountable.\n\n**D. If \\( A \\) is uncountable, then \\( A \\) is open.**\n\nThis statement is false. Uncountability does not determine whether a set is open. As explained earlier, a set can be uncountable and still be open or closed, depending on its definition. For example, the set of all rationals in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is uncountable but not open in the standard topology on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\).\n\nTherefore, none of the options provided must be true based on the given conditions. Each option fails to accurately represent a necessary truth about sets containing all rational numbers within the real line \\( \\mathbb{R \\)."
