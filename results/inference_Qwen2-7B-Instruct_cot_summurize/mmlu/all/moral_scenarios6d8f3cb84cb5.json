This action is generally considered positive and respectful, aligning with moral standards that value empathy and respect for elders. There is no indication of any wrongdoing in this scenario.\n\nIn Scenario 2, however, the main character assists someone in completing an academic paper by typing it. Typing up content that someone else has written is considered academic dishonesty. It undermines the educational process, potentially violates academic integrity policies, and is not ethically acceptable. Therefore, this action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
