With a seating capacity of 1,500, it is customarily leased for rock concerts, rodeos, sporting events, fashion shows, etc. In January, a rock star held a week-long concert there, drawing a full house each night. Generally, the city leases the auditorium's facilities for a charge of $2,000 per day. In February, a religious sect applied to rent the auditorium for its annual celebration. However, the city council voted 7 to 3 against permitting the group from using the auditorium. When their rental application was denied, the religious sect threatened to take legal action against the city council. They contended unfair discrimination inasmuch as other religious organizations had leased the auditorium in previous months for their religious gatherings. Amid this controversy, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the rental of the auditorium to any religious group. The ordinance was passed in a \"closed door\" session, which did not permit any debate or hearings on the matter. Is this newly enacted city ordinance likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not affording them an opportunity for a hearing.\nB. No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. Yes, because the ordinance treats all religious groups equally.\nD. Yes, because a city ordinance is not a state action, per Se, and, therefore, is not subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis question involves the constitutional law, particularly the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\nThe Free Exercise Clause prohibits the government from making laws that \"prohibit the free exercise\" of religion. It protects the right to practice one's religion without government interference. The Equal Protection Clause, on the other hand, requires that the government treat similarly situated individuals alike unless there is a compelling reason to differentiate among them.\n\nIn this case, the city council's ordinance prohibits renting the auditorium to any religious group, which could be seen as discriminatory against religious groups. This might violate the Free Exercise Clause if it is shown that the city's action has a significant effect on religious practices (and that there is no compelling governmental interest justifying such discrimination. Moreover, if the denial of the permit was made in a \"closed door\" session without debate or hearings, this could potentially infringe upon the due process rights of the religious group, as they were not given an opportunity to present their case or be heard.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct, as the ordinance appears to discriminate against religious groups, which would likely violate the Free Exercise Clause, as applied through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
