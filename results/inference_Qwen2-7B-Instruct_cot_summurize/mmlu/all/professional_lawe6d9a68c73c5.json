No, the ordinance is void on its face.\n\nIn the United States, there is a strong tradition of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution. This right includes the freedom to express oneself in public spaces like parks. While governments do have some authority to regulate speech in public forums, such as parks, these regulations must be content-neutral, narrowly tailored, serve a significant governmental interest, and leave open ample alternative channels for communication.\n\nAn ordinance that grants the mayor discretionary power to decide who may speak in the city park could be considered overly broad and potentially unconstitutional if it is not subject to reasonable restrictions or guidelines. Without specific criteria or limitations, the mayor's discretion could potentially be used to suppress certain viewpoints or speakers based on content or viewpoint, which would violate the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.\n\nTherefore, if someone was arrested and convicted for giving a political speech in the park without a permit under such an ordinance, it might be argued that the ordinance is void on its face as it does not provide sufficient guidance or limitations to ensure that any restrictions on speech are justified and do not amount to an impermissible content-based restriction on free speech."
