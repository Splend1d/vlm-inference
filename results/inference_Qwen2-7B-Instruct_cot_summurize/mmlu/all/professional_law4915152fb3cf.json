U.S. Constitution, treaties and federal statutes, executive agreements, state law\n\nThis order reflects the precedence of legal authority in the United States. The Constitution is the foundational document that sets up the government and outlines the rights of citizens. Treaties and federal statutes follow as they are made under the authority granted by the Constitution. Executive agreements, which are essentially informal agreements between the President and a foreign government, rank below treaties but above state laws. State law takes precedence over federal law only within the states' own jurisdiction, unless the federal law preempts it or there is a constitutional issue at play."
