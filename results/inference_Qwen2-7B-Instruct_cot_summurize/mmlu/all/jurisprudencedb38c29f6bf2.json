Lyotard critiques the modern belief in grand, all-encompassing narratives that promise truth and coherence, arguing that these meta-narratives often fail to account for the complexity and diversity of human experiences. In the postmodern era, according to Lyotard, such narratives are seen as suspect or incapable of providing the comprehensive explanations they claim to offer, thus leading to an \"incredulity toward meta-narratives.\" This does not directly imply that individual stories are suspect ( (A), the law is static ( (B), or that literature reproduces repression  (D), though these might be secondary effects or aspects of his broader critique."
