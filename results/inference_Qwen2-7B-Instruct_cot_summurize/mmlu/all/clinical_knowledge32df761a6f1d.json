Anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, usually presents with symptoms such as hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and low blood pressure. However, depending on the individual and the severity of the reaction, some people might experience bradycardia as part of the overall systemic response to anaphylaxis. The other options listed ( stridor ( (a high-pitched whistling sound during breathing), severe wheezing, and rash - are more commonly associated with anaphylaxis."
