The challenge here is that different researchers might define what constitutes social class (and its components (\u2014such as income, education, occupation, and sometimes residential location\u2014in different ways. This variability in definitions can lead to inconsistent findings when comparing results across studies or over time, making it difficult to establish clear, consistent patterns or trends in social class dynamics. It's crucial to have clear operational definitions to ensure comparability and reliability in research findings related to social class."
