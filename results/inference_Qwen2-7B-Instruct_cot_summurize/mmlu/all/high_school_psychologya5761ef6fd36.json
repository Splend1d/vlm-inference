Their adrenal glands continue to secrete epinephrine even after the crisis is over.\n\nDuring a crisis, the body activates the sympathetic nervous system and the release of stress hormones like epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and cortisol. These hormones prepare the body for \"fight or flight\" response, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy levels. While the immediate physiological effects of the crisis may subside once the danger passes, the brain may take time to fully return to its baseline state, partly due to the lingering effects of these stress hormones. The adrenal glands may not cease secretion immediately, contributing to the continued state of heightened arousal."
