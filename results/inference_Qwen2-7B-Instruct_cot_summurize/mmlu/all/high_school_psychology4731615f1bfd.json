DeVised a prototypical normative assessment for infants and young children.\n\nArnold Gesell was a prominent psychologist who made significant contributions to the field of child development, particularly in the study of infants and young children. He developed a comprehensive approach to assessing the development of children, which included observations of behavior, timing of development milestones, and the creation of normative data based on his extensive research. This work was foundational in establishing the field of developmental psychology and influenced the way psychologists assess and understand the development of children across various domains including cognitive, motor, and socio-emotional development. His work paved the way for more standardized and objective methods of evaluating child development, which are are crucial for both scientific research and clinical practice."
