They were skilled seafarers and had extensive trading networks across the Mediterranean, which included the exchange of goods such as pottery, luxury items, and raw materials. The collapse of this trade network could have significantly impacted their economy due to the disruptions caused by natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, or changes in sea routes.\n\nWhile agriculture would also be important for any civilization, the Minoans' reliance on maritime trade was a key factor in their economic structure and vulnerability to natural catastrophes that affected sea routes and shipping."
