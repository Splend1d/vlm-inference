                    "text": "The Transtheoretical Model of Change, also known as the Stages of Change model, outlines five stages that individuals typically pass through when making a behavioral change. Here's a correct definition for each stage:\n\n1. **Precontemplation**: At this stage, an individual has no intention of changing their behavior in the foreseeable future (i.e., within the next 6 months.\n\n2. **Contemplation**: This is when an individual is considering the possibility of changing their behavior but has not yet made up their mind about it. They may be uncertain or ambivalent about taking action.\n\n3. **Preparation**: The individual has decided to take action soon, usually within the next month or two. They might have developed some strategies or plans for change.\n\n4. **Action**: During this stage, the individual has taken steps to modify their behavior and has been successful in doing so for at least one month. They are actively engaged in changing their behavior.\n\n5. **Maintenance**: This stage follows the initial change. The individual continues to maintain their new behavior, with the goal being lasting for at least six months. It involves preventing relapse and sustaining the changes over time.\n\nSo, the correct answer based on the definitions provided would be:\n- **PRECONTEMPLATION**: Intent to take action in next 6 months - This does not accurately reflect the definition; the correct term is \"Precontemplation\" where there is no intention to change within the foreseeable future.\n- **PREPARATION**: Consider change in next 2 months - This correctly defines the Preparation stage.\n- **ACTION**: Time and effort into modifying behavior - This correctly defines the Action stage.\n- **MAINTENANCE**: Behavior change lasted at least 8 months - This incorrectly defines Maintenance as lasting at least 8 months, whereas the correct definition is maintaining the change for at least 6 months."
