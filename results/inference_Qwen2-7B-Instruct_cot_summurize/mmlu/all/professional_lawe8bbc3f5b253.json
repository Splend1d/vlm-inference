The businessman had slightly grazed against the drunk man's body. \"Man, are you trying to kill me or something?'' said the very drunk man. The businessman did not think anything of it, since he had barely grazed the drunkard. The drunk continued to bully the businessman, calling him made-up names, and saying things that were nonsensical to the businessman and to others at the bar who were listening to the drunk's boisterous and irrational rants. The drunk then took a gun out of his pocket and shot the businessman, killing him. At trial, the defense argued that the man could not form the specific intent to premeditate for first degree murder. Which of the following crimes is the defendant most likely guilty of under these facts?\n\nA. Voluntary Manslaughter\nB. First Degree Murder\nC. Second Degree Murder\nD. Involuntary Manslaughter\n"

Given that the defense argues the defendant could not form the specific intent to premeditate (a requirement for first-degree murder), and considering the defendant's irrational behavior, the defendant might be found guilty of:\n\nC. Second Degree Murder\n\nThis charge typically involves a killing that occurs in the \"heat of passion\" following adequate provocation but without premeditation. The defendant's actions were clearly intentional ( as evidenced by the use of a gun - but there appears to have been no premeditation or planning involved.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a hypothetical interpretation based on the given information, and actual legal proceedings would involve a thorough examination of all evidence and testimonies by legal professionals."
