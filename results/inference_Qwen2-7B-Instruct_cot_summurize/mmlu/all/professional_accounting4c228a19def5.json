Since the total assets also include total debt, the ratio of total debt to total assets ( (Total Debt / Total Assets) will increase because both the numerator and denominator increased but the numerator increased at a faster rate.\n\nWorking capital is calculated as Current Assets - Current Liabilities. Issuing additional capital stock does not directly impact current assets or current liabilities. Therefore, the working capital remains unchanged unless there are other transactions that affect current assets or current liabilities. However, since the question doesn't provide specifics about any changes in current assets or current liabilities, we can assume that working capital remains unchanged. So, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Increase ( (for total debt to total assets ratio) and\nIncrease ( for working capital ( assuming no other changes)."
