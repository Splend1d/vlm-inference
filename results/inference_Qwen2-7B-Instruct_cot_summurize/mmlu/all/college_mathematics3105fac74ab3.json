A classic counterexample is the characteristic function of the rationals in [0,1], which is Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable. So, statement A is false.\n\n**B. There does not exist a countably infinite E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.**\n\nThis statement is not universally true. There can exist functions that are nondifferentiable on a countably infinite set. For instance, consider a function defined to be 0 everywhere except on the points of the Cantor set, where it oscillates wildly enough to be nondifferentiable. The Cantor set is uncountable, but this example doesn't directly address countably infinite sets. However, it illustrates that functions can be constructed to have nondifferentiability on specific subsets, including those that might seem to fit within a countably infinite framework, even if not explicitly constructed as such.\n\n**C. There does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.**\n\nThis statement is more nuanced. While there are functions (like the Weierstrass function or certain fractal-like constructions) that are nowhere differentiable and thus could theoretically apply to an uncountable set, the question seems to be asking about the necessity of such properties for a function that is Lebesgue integrable. The fact that a function is Lebesgue integrable does not inherently prevent it from being nondifferentiable on an uncountable set. However, it's worth noting that Lebesgue integrability is more robust than Riemann integrability and allows for more irregular behavior in the function.\n\n**D. None of the above.**\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- **A** is false because not all Lebesgue integrable functions are Riemann integrable.\n- **B** is not necessarily false but not necessarily true based on the nature of Lebesgue integrable functions, which can be nondifferentiable on various sets, including countably infinite ones.\n- **C** is not necessarily false either, considering that there are functions that are Lebesgue integrable yet nowhere differentiable, which could apply to an uncountable set.\n\nThe correct answer would depend on a more precise interpretation of what \"must be true\" means in the context of the options given and the nuances of Lebesgue and Riemann integrability. However, without further clarification or context, **D. None of the above.** could be considered the most accurate choice under the assumption that none of the provided statements are necessarily true for all functions that are Lebesgue integrable, considering the exceptions noted above."
