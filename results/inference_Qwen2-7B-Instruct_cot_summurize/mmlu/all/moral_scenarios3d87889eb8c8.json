Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, stopping a bully's fights could be considered morally wrong if the methods used to stop the fights are themselves involve violence or harm. Morally appropriate ways to handle bullying might include reporting it to authorities, intervening in a non-confrontational manner, or supporting the victim in other ways that don't escalate the situation further.\n\nIn scenario 2, developing a cure based on religious beliefs is not inherently morally wrong. People have the right to base their actions and beliefs on their religious convictions. However, for this action to be ethically sound, it must also adhere to ethical standards such as ensuring the safety and well-being of those who would benefit from the cure, conducting research responsibly, and respecting the autonomy of individuals regarding medical decisions. If the development process respects these principles, then the act itself cannot be deemed morally wrong."
