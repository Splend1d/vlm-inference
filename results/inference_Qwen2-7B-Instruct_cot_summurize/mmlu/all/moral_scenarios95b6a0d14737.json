This could be seen as respectful or responsible behavior, depending on the context and the rules themselves.\n\nScenario 2, however, involves deciding to pee in a public or shared space without proper facilities, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action disregards personal hygiene, respect for others' spaces, and societal norms regarding cleanliness and consideration for others."
