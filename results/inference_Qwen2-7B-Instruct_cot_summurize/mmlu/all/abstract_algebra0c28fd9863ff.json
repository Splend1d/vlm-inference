According to Sylow's Theorems:\n\n- The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, denoted \\(n_7\\), must divide \\(6\\) ( (the index of 7 in the prime factorization of 42) and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is \\(n_7 = 1\\), meaning there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 7-subgroup of order 7.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is **True**.\n\n**Statement 2:**\nFor a group \\(G\\) of order 42, the number of Sylow 8-subgroups, \\(n_8\\), must divide \\(6\\) ( (the index of 8 in the prime factorization of 42) and be congruent to 1 modulo 8. Since \\(6\\) is not divisible by \\(8\\), it's impossible for \\(n_8\\) to be 1, meaning there cannot be a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 8-subgroup of order 8 in every group of order 42.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is **False**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. True, False**."
