Pith; primary xylem; secondary xylem; vascular cambium; primary phloem; secondary phloem; cortex\n\nHere's a breakdown of each part:\n\n1. **Pith**: This is the central core of the twig, made up of soft, living tissue, including the primary xylem.\n\n2. **Primary Xylem**: Located inside the pith, this is responsible for transporting water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant.\n\n3. **Secondary Xylem**: As the twig grows, it produces more xylem around the existing primary xylem, increasing the diameter of the twig. This secondary xylem is harder than the primary xylem and is responsible for transporting water and minerals throughout the plant.\n\n4. **Vascular Cambium**: This is the layer of cells between the secondary xylem and the secondary phloem, responsible for producing new xylem on the outer side and new phloem on the inner side during the plant's growth.\n\n5. **Primary Phloem**: This layer is found next to the primary xylem and transports sugars from the leaves to other parts of the plant.\n\n6. **Secondary Phloem**: It surrounds the primary phloem and is involved in the transport of nutrients and sugars in the plant.\n\n7. **Cortex**: This is the outermost layer of the twig, containing cells that perform various functions like photosynthesis, storage, and support. It is made up of both xylem and phloem. \n\nTherefore, following the path from the center (pith) to the outer surface of the twig, the larvae would encounter these layers in the order described in option A."
