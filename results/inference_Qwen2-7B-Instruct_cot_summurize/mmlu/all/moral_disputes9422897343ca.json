This narrow perspective could potentially overlook instances where individuals might not intend to disrespect someone's humanity, but their actions still lead to such outcomes. For example, in some cultural contexts, certain practices might be considered as respectful forms of admiration or appreciation, which might not align with the Western notion of objectification. Therefore, a broader view is necessary to encompass all nuances and contexts surrounding the topic."
