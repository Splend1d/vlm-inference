Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, eating human liver is clearly morally wrong and illegal in the United States, as human tissue is not meant for consumption and doing so violates both ethical and legal norms regarding respect for human life and bodily integrity.\n\nIn Scenario 2, eating the yogurt marked with a coworker's name might be seen as a misunderstanding or an oversight rather than a deliberate wrongdoing. While it could potentially inconvenience the coworker, it doesn't necessarily involve harm to another person or a violation of someone else's rights. The action might be considered impolite or careless, but it doesn't cross into the realm of moral wrongness in the same way that eating human liver would."
