The demand curve faced by each individual firm is perfectly elastic and horizontal at the market price. Thus, the marginal revenue curve coincides with the price line ( (MR = P = demand on horizontal function for perfect competition.\n\nIn contrast, under monopoly or imperfect competition, the price is typically greater than the marginal revenue. This occurs because the monopolist or imperfect competitor has some degree of market power, allowing it to set prices above marginal cost. As a result, the demand curve faced by the firm is downward sloping, leading to a marginal revenue curve that lies below the demand curve and is also below the price. Hence, P > MR as downward sloping functions for imperfect competition. \n\nThe statement \"Demand and Price are represented as a vertical function for imperfect competition\" does not accurately describe the relationship between price and demand in imperfect competition. In fact, in imperfect competition, both price and demand are represented by downward sloping curves."
