Both defensive realism and offensive realism regard power and competition as a means by which security can be achieved for the state.\n\nWhile it is true that both defensive and offensive realists consider power to be crucial for state security, their views on how this power should be pursued differ significantly. \n\nOffensive Realism suggests that states should actively seek to increase their power, often through expansionist policies, in order to ensure their security. This includes the pursuit of hegemony where possible.\n\nDefensive Realism, on the other hand, posits that states should prioritize their own survival over power maximization. It argues that states are inherently suspicious of others and that the international system is anarchic, making cooperation difficult. Therefore, defensive realism advocates for building up one's own capabilities and maintaining a credible deterrence posture rather than aggressively seeking to expand power or influence.\n\nSo, while both theories acknowledge the role of power in securing states, they fundamentally disagree on the strategies and motivations behind acquiring and maintaining that power."
