Children often adopt the political beliefs and attitudes they observe in their families, through discussions, values, and experiences shared within the household. This familial environment provides a foundation for understanding and interpreting the world, including political aspects.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the influence of other factors, such as education, media, and social interactions, can also play significant roles in the development of a child's political views as they grow older and become more independent."
