This means that according to moral absolutism, there are situations where we have an absolute duty to prevent harm or to avoid causing harm, without any exceptions.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. prevent murder at all costs\n\nThis aligns with the idea that under moral absolutism, one has an unqualified duty to prevent murder because it is intrinsically wrong, and this duty cannot be overridden by other considerations such as potential benefits or the intentions behind one's actions."
