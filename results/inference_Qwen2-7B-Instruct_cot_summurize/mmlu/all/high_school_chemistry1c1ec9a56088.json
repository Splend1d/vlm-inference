The actual oxidation state of iron in this compound is +3, so it should be iron(III) nitrate. However, the common name for this compound is iron nitrate, and people often use this common name without specifying the oxidation state, which can lead to confusion with other iron nitrates.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name should be iron(II) nitrate, but the common usage does not distinguish between iron(II) and iron(III) nitrates by naming convention. So, while technically incorrect from an IUPAC perspective, Fe(NO3)3 is widely recognized as iron nitrate."
