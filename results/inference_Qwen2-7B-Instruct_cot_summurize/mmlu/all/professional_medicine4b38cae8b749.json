She has a family history of early coronary artery disease (CAD) and her father died suddenly at age 46 years of myocardial infarction. She tells you that she has never had chest pain. She is not currently sexually active and has no children. She claims that her high-stress lifestyle makes it impossible for her to eat regular meals or to follow a special diet, and she usually eats fast food. She exercises two or three times a week for about 20 minutes on a treadmill. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Her only medication is acetaminophen for tension headaches. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 76 kg (167 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs today are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities except for mild obesity. Institution of which of the following is the most essential step in the prevention of CAD in this patient?\n\nA. Biofeedback-based stress reduction program\nB. More rigorous and consistent exercise program\nC. Smoking cessation program\nD. Strict low-calorie diet\n"

                    "text": "The most essential step in the prevention of CAD in this patient would be C. Smoking cessation program.\n\nSmoking significantly increases the risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD due to its harmful effects on the blood vessels and heart. It causes inflammation, narrows the arteries, and damages the lining of the blood vessels, all of which contribute to the development of CAD. Additionally, smoking can also increase blood pressure and heart rate, leading to an increased workload on the heart.\n\nThe other options may also be beneficial, but they address different aspects of the patient's health:\n\nA. A biofeedback-based stress reduction program can help manage stress, which is known to be a risk factor for CAD. However, it does not directly address the major risk factors such as smoking and high cholesterol levels.\n\nB. A more rigorous and consistent exercise program can improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of CAD. Regular physical activity helps strengthen the heart muscle, improves circulation, and reduces the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.\n\nD. A strict low-calorie diet might help with weight loss if the patient is overweight or obese, which is a risk factor for CAD. However, focusing solely on calorie restriction without considering overall nutrition could lead to deficiencies.\n\nIn this scenario, given the patient's smoking habit, which is the most significant modifiable risk factor for CAD, the immediate and most essential step would be to institute a smoking cessation program. This should be prioritized over the other options provided."
