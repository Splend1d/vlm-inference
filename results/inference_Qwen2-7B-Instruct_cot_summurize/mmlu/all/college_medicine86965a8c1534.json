                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.\n\nDuring intense physical activities such as multiple sprints, the body experiences a high demand for energy. This leads to an increased production of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) which is the primary energy currency of cells. The breakdown of ATP to release energy results in the production of ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) as a byproduct. \n\nADP can be further degraded into other substances:\n\n1. **Uric Acid**: This is produced from the breakdown of purines, a group of compounds that includes adenine and guanine. Uric acid is a waste product that needs to be excreted from the body through urine.\n\n2. **Hypoxanthine**: This is another intermediate product formed during the catabolism of adenine nucleotides pools, including ADP. It is also involved in the synthesis of other nitrogenous bases and can be converted to uric acid.\n\n3. **Ammonia (**: Produced from the deamination of amino acids, ammonia can be toxic at high levels. It's often converted to less toxic compounds like urea for excretion.\n\nThus, during intense physical activities, the concentration of these substances might increase in the blood as they are produced as part of the metabolic processes."
