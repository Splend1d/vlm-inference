He landed the plane safely in a large yard behind a home located in a relatively remote area. Unfortunately, when he disembarked from the plane, he was attacked and injured by two large dogs kept by the homeowner to discourage trespassers. The homeowner, who had seen the plane land, had ordered the dogs to attack. Several months earlier, the homeowner had posted large signs around the perimeter of the yard warning of the dogs. Does the pilot have a viable claim against the homeowner for battery?\n\nA. No, because the homeowner had provided adequate warning.\nB. No, because the pilot was a trespasser.\nC. Yes, because the pilot can invoke the privilege of necessity.\nD. Yes, because the pilot could not reasonably have been expected to see the warning signs posted by the homeowner.\n"

Yes, because the pilot could not reasonably have been expected to see the warning signs posted by the homeowner.\n\nIn this scenario, the pilot was faced with a situation where he had to make an emergency landing due to engine trouble. Given the circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that the pilot's focus would be on safely landing the plane rather than looking for signs in the surrounding area. Therefore, the pilot cannot be held responsible for not seeing the warning signs that the homeowner had placed.\n\nAdditionally, the homeowner's decision to order the dogs to attack upon seeing the plane land raises the issue of foreseeability and intent. By intentionally ordering the dogs to attack, the homeowner created a foreseeable risk of harm to any person who might land their plane in the yard. This action could be considered an intentional act of harm, which would likely fall under the legal definition of battery.\n\nTherefore, the pilot has a viable claim against the homeowner for battery based on the fact that the pilot could not reasonably have been expected to see the warning signs, and the homeowner's actions created a situation where harm was intentionally inflicted upon the pilot."
