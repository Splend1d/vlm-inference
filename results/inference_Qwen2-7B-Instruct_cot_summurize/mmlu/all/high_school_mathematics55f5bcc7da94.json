This means:\n- The length of the rectangle is \\(3\\) units.\n- The height of the rectangle is \\(2\\) units.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Region Where \\(x < y\\)\n\nWe're interested in the region where \\(x < y\\). This condition is satisfied by points lying below the line \\(y = x\\).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Intersection Points\n\nThe line \\(y = x\\) intersects the rectangle at two points:\n- When \\(x = 0\\), \\(y = 0\\), so one intersection point is \\((0,0)\\).\n- When \\(x = 2\\), \\(y = 2\\), so another intersection point is \\((2,2)\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Area of Interest\n\nThe region where \\(x < y\\) forms a right triangle with the base along the line segment from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((2,2)\\) and the height along the line segment from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((0,2)\\). Thus, the base of the triangle is \\(2\\) units and the height is also \\(2\\) units.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). Therefore, the area of the triangle (where \\(x < y\\) within the rectangle) is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Area of the Rectangle\n\nThe total area of the rectangle is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Probability\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen point \\((x, y)\\) from inside the rectangle satisfies \\(x < y\\) is the ratio of the area where \\(x < y\\) to the total area of the rectangle:\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Area of interest}}{\\text{Total area}} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is **D. \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)**."
