The vertices of this diamond are at \\((1,0)\\), \\((-1,0)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((0,-1)\\). This is because when \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) is positive, the other variable can vary from \\(-1\\) to \\(0\\) ( and vice versa for the negative side.\n\nNext, we need to find where \\(2(x+y) > 1\\), which simplifies to \\(x+y > \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nLet's visualize this:\n\n1. **Plotting \\(x+y = \\frac{1}{2}\\)**: This line will divide the diamond into two regions. Points above this line satisfy \\(x+y > \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Identifying the region of interest**: We are interested in the area of the diamond that lies above \\(x+y = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nGiven the symmetry of the problem, we can focus on one quadrant and then multiply our result by 4. The line \\(x+y = \\frac{1}{2}\\) intersects the diamond at points \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right)\\) and \\((0, \\frac{1}{2})\\). \n\nThe area of the entire diamond is \\(\\frac{1}{2} * 1 * 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\) ( because the length of the sides is 1 ( and it's a square rotated by 45 degrees.\n\nThe area of interest (the region above \\(x+y = \\frac{1}{2}\\) but still within the diamond) is a right-angled triangle with legs of length \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) each. The area of this triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\nSince this region of interest is symmetrical across all four quadrants, the total area of interest within the diamond is \\(4 * \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nGiven that the probability is proportional to the area in this case ( due to the uniform distribution, the probability that a randomly chosen point in the diamond satisfies \\(2(x+y) > 1\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nHowever, none of the provided options (A. 0, B. 1/4, C. sqrt(2)/4, D. 1/sqrt(2) match \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the calculation process. Given the standard approach to these types of problems and the typical setup, the correct answer based on the description would indeed be closer to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), suggesting a potential error in the provided options or the question's phrasing."
