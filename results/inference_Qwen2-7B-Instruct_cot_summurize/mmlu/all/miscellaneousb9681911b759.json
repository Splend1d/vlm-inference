When dissolved in water, it can help to draw out toxins and provide relaxation.\n\nA. Powering a car would require a much different type of energy source, and MgSO4\u00b77H2O does not have sufficient energy density for that purpose.\n  \nB. Blowing up a building is highly unlikely and dangerous. Explosives require specific chemical compositions and conditions to detonate, which are not present in MgSO4\u00b77H2O.\n\nD. Fertilizing a lawn could potentially be an application, but it's not the primary use. Epsom salt is used as a fertilizer because it contains magnesium and sulfur, both of which are beneficial nutrients for plants. However, it's not as common as other fertilizers specifically designed for lawn care."
