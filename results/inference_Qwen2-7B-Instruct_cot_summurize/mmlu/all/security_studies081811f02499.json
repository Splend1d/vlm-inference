However, if we are to select one option that broadly represents the focus of cyber-security efforts, \"B. Critical Information Infrastructures\" might be considered the most encompassing. This is because critical information infrastructures (such as power grids, financial systems, healthcare services, and telecommunications networks, among others, are integral to the functioning of modern societies. Protecting these infrastructures from cyber threats is crucial to maintaining national security, economic stability, and public safety.\n\nThat said, it's important to note that cyber-security also involves protecting A. Digitalized sensitive information, C. Government IT systems, and D. Telecommunication networks, among other elements. The field aims to secure all these components to prevent data breaches, ensure privacy, and safeguard against various cyber threats."
