                    "text": "To evaluate these statements, let's consider each one individually:\n\n**Statement 1: Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite.**\n\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero ( (i.e., it has no zero divisors). The characteristic of an integral domain is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n \\cdot a = 0\\) for all \\(a\\) in the domain, where \\(n \\cdot a\\) represents the sum of \\(a\\) with itself \\(n\\) times. If no such \\(n\\) exists, the characteristic is said to be 0.\n\nIf an integral domain has characteristic 0, this means there is no finite set of elements that can sum to zero. Therefore, to avoid having a finite set of elements summing to zero ( (which would imply a characteristic that divides some finite number), the domain must be infinite. This statement is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.**\n\nGiven an integral domain with prime characteristic \\(p\\), it means that adding the multiplicative identity \\(1\\) to itself \\(p\\) times results in the additive identity \\(0\\). That is, \\(p \\cdot 1 = 0\\).\n\nIn an integral domain, if you have a characteristic that is a prime number, you can construct a finite field (also known as a Galois field) if the domain is also a field ( (which is a stronger condition than being an integral domain). However, even without assuming the domain is a field, the existence of a prime characteristic implies that there is a finite set of elements that can generate the entire domain through addition and multiplication. Specifically, if you take the element \\(1\\) and repeatedly add it to itself, you get a sequence of elements until you reach \\(p \\cdot 1 = 0\\). These elements along with their sums and products form a finite set, implying the domain itself is finite.\n\nTherefore, both statements are actually true, making the correct answer:\n\nA.
