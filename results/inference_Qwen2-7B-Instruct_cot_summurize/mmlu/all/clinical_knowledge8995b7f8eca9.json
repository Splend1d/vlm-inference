These patients are more likely to get urinary tract infections if their blood sugar is unstable.\n\nPeople with diabetes are at an increased risk for urinary tract infections (UTIs, especially when their blood sugar levels are not well controlled. This is because high blood sugar can lead to changes in the body that make it easier for bacteria to grow and cause an infection. UTIs are common complications of diabetes, particularly in women, and they can lead to serious health issues if left untreated. It's crucial for diabetic patients to maintain good blood sugar control to reduce their risk of UTIs and other complications."
