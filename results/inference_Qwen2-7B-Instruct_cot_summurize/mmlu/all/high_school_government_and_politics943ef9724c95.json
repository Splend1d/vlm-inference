I, III, and IV only.\n\n- America's increased prominence in international affairs ( (I) has indeed contributed to the growing power and prestige of the presidency. As the United States became more influential on the global stage, the President's role as the leader of the country also became more significant in setting foreign policy and representing the nation abroad.\n  \n- The New Deal and other programs that have expanded federal responsibility ( (III) have also enhanced the presidency's power. These initiatives expanded the scope and reach of the federal government, increasing the President's role in economic regulation, social welfare, and governance, which in turn bolstered their authority and influence.\n  \n- The president's increased visibility, due to the development of mass media ( (IV) has played a crucial role in shaping public perception and enhancing the President's prestige. With the advent of television and the expansion of radio, the President can directly communicate with the American people, influencing public opinion and maintaining high levels of popularity, which are in turn can increase their political power within the government.\n\nContinually improved public confidence in the federal government ( (II) might be a contributing factor, but it does not specifically account for the growth of the presidency's power post-1932. Confidence in the government as a whole could be influenced by many factors beyond the direct actions or visibility of the President."
