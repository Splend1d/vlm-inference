The purpose of blocking is to reduce variability within the treatment groups and increase the precision of the experiment's results. In this case, since exercise intensity is known to affect cholesterol levels, it makes sense to block on this variable to ensure that its effects are not confounding the results between the two groups receiving the fish oil capsules and garlic capsules.\n\nSleep length, on the other hand, is not associated with cholesterol levels in past studies, so it would not be necessary to block on this variable. Cholesterol levels would not be used as a blocking factor because the goal of the experiment is to compare the effects of the two types of capsules, not to control for cholesterol levels themselves. And while capsule type is relevant to the experiment's objective, it does not need to be blocked upon; instead, it should be the variable being manipulated between the groups."
