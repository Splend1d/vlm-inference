The obligation arises independently of the precise legal provisions involved - unless there are grounds to justify a specific exception.\n\nThis choice acknowledges that while there is a general duty to obey the law, there may be circumstances where this duty can be overridden due to compelling reasons (such as overriding moral imperatives, necessity, or justifiable disobedience in cases of unjust laws."
