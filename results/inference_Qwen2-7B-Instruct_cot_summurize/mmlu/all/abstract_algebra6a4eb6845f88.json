                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement individually:\n\n**Statement 1**: This statement claims that if \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are polynomials in the ring \\(R[x]\\), then the degree of their sum \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) is equal to the maximum of the degrees of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). This statement is **False**. The degree of the sum of two polynomials does not necessarily equal the maximum of their degrees. For example, consider \\(f(x) = x^3\\) and \\(g(x) = 5\\). Both have degree 3 and 0 respectively, but \\(f(x) + g(x) = x^3 + 5\\) also has degree 3. However, if we take \\(f(x) = x\\) and \\(g(x) = 2\\), both of degree 1, their sum \\(f(x) + g(x) = x + 2\\) still has degree 1. The key point is that adding a polynomial with a lower degree than another doesn't increase the degree of their sum beyond the highest existing degree. Thus, it's not guaranteed to be the maximum of the original degrees.\n\n**Statement 2**: This statement claims that if \\(F \\) is a field, then every ideal of \\( F[x] \\) is principal. This statement is **True**. In the context of a polynomial ring over a field, every ideal is indeed principal. A principal ideal is an ideal generated by a single element. In \\( F[x] \\), where \\( F \\) is a field, any ideal can be shown to be generated by a single polynomial, which means it's principal. This is a fundamental result in ring theory and abstract algebra.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. False, True**."
