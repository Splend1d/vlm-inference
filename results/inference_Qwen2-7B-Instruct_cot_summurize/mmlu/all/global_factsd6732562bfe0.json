However, it's widely known that awareness of the Holocaust was much lower during World War II than it is today. Estimates vary greatly depending on sources and the definition of \"awareness.\" It's safe to say that not all Americans were aware of the scale of the Holocaust by 1943. The exact percentage is not easily quantifiable due to the nature of historical research and the complexity of defining \"awareness.\"\n\nFor educational purposes, it might be more useful to discuss how awareness increased over time, with factors such as the Nuremberg Trials, the release of documents and testimonies, and the publication of books like \"Night\" by Elie Wiesel contributing to greater public understanding of the Holocaust in later decades."
