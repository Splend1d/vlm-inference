State law provided that if he tried to leave against medical advice, the hospital could hold him for 72 hours while trying to convince him to stay. During the stay, he told his medical providers that he was intensely angry at his wife, who was living with another man, and he wanted to harm her. Despite that knowledge, the hospital issued him an unrestricted weekend pass. When he got out he shot and killed his wife. The man's children sued the hospital for negligence. The hospital filed a motion to dismiss mainly because there was no privity with the decedent and no duty owed to her. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. No, because the hospital is strictly liable for releasing patients who it knows or should know represent an unreasonable danger to third persons.\nB. No, because the special relationship and the control between doctor and an in-patient mandates due care by the doctor to prevent a foreseeable danger to others.\nC. Yes, because there is no duty to control the conduct of another person to prevent that person from harming others.\nD. Yes, because the intervening acts of third parties are unforeseeable and cannot give rise to liability.\n"

Yes, because there is no duty to control the conduct of another person to prevent that person from harming others.\n\nThe hospital's duty to its patient is generally limited to providing care and treatment for the patient's condition, not to protect third parties from potential actions of the patient. In this scenario, the hospital would have no legal obligation to prevent the patient from harming someone else outside of the hospital, especially after issuing an unrestricted weekend pass. Therefore, the court would likely grant the motion to dismiss based on the lack of duty owed to the decedent."
