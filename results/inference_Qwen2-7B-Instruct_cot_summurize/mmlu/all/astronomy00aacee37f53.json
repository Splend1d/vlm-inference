                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Without a strong magnetic field, Mars lost a significant portion of its atmosphere to the solar wind, which led to a dramatic decrease in the greenhouse effect and cooling of the planet.\n\nMars once had a stronger magnetic field, similar to Earth's, which protected its atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind. The solar wind consists of charged particles (primarily protons and electrons) emanating from the Sun. These particles can interact with planetary atmospheres, especially those with weaker magnetic fields or no magnetic field at all, causing atmospheric loss through a process known as sputtering and stripping.\n\nWhen Mars lost its strong magnetic field, the solar wind began to erode its atmosphere more effectively. This atmospheric loss reduced the amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor present in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat near the surface of the planet, so their reduction significantly weakened the greenhouse effect, leading to a cooling of Mars.\n\nAdditionally, the loss of atmosphere also meant that Mars would have less insulating capability against the cold temperatures of space, further contributing to its cooling. Over time, this combination of factors likely led to Mars transforming from a potentially habitable environment to the cold, dry world we see today."
