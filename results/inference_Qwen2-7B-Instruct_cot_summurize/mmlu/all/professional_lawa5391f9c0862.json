                    "text": "The correct answer is D. unconstitutional, because the federal law preempts any conflicting state legislation regarding the sale and shipment of the pies.\n\nUnder the United States Constitution, particularly the Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2), federal laws take precedence over state laws when there is a conflict. This principle of preemption applies when Congress legislates on a subject that is traditionally regulated by the states but where Congress has acted to occupy the field. In this case, Congress has prohibited the shipment and sale of pies containing potentially harmful levels of nuts across state lines. Therefore, any state statute that conflicts with this federal legislation would likely be considered unconstitutional, as it attempts to regulate the same activity that Congress has already preemptively addressed.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The state statute cannot be justified under the state's police power because the issue at hand involves regulation of interstate commerce, which is primarily under the purview of Congress.\n\nB. The argument that Congress may not regulate an economic activity where both buyer and seller reside in the same state does not apply here. The issue is that the product can potentially be shipped across state lines, which Congress has regulated through its legislation.\n\nC. The state statute affecting interstate commerce would not necessarily be unconstitutional if it did not conflict with the federal prohibition on the shipment and sale of the pies. Since it does conflict, it is likely preempted and therefore unconstitutional."
