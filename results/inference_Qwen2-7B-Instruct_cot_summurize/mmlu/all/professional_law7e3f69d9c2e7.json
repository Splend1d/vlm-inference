The buyer then executed a second note, secured by a mortgage to executed a second note, secured by a mortgage to the bank, applying the bank loan proceeds to the purchase price of the property. The bank had actual knowledge of the prior note to the seller. The bank promptly recorded its mortgage. The buyer is now in default on both notes. There is no applicable statute. Which party has priority?\n\nA. The bank, because its loan satisfied the financing contingency in the contract of sale.\nB. The bank, because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.\nC. The seller, because the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note.\nD. The seller, because he retained a vendor's lien that was first in time.\n"

The seller, because he retained a vendor's lien that was first in time.\n\nThe key points here are that the buyer initially obtained financing through a note to the seller, and then used those funds to secure a bank loan, which was then used to satisfy the purchase price of the property. The bank promptly recorded its mortgage. However, since the buyer executed a separate note to the seller that was not secured by a mortgage, the seller's interest in the property takes precedence over the bank's interest due to the principle of \"first in time, first in right.\"\n\nUnder common law principles, if there is a conflict between a vendor's lien (retained by the seller) and a subsequent mortgage (taken out by the buyer), the vendor's lien will generally have priority. This is because the vendor's lien arises at the time of the sale and is an equitable interest in the property, whereas the bank's mortgage comes later as a result of the buyer's actions.\n\nTherefore, when both parties are in default, the seller's unsecured note would take priority over the bank's mortgage."
