On a hunch, she went to her boyfriend's apartment one afternoon and, using her key, she entered the apartment. Once inside, she found her boyfriend and his new girlfriend in bed together. In a rage, the defendant retrieved the gun from the nightstand and killed her boyfriend and his new girlfriend. After the shooting, the defendant left on a two-day trip to the mountains to get the week's events off her mind. She called her teenage neighbor to take care of her apartment while she was gone and to look after her 4-year-old daughter. That night, after the defendant left, the police came to the apartment. They asked the neighbor if they could search the apartment, and the neighbor gave them permission. The police found in the defendant's bedroom the gun used to kill her boyfriend. At a motion to suppress the gun prior to trial, which of the following facts would the defendant's attorney be LEAST likely to attempt to prove?\n\nA. The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.\nB. The police did not have a search warrant.\nC. The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone.\nD. The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.\n"

                    "text": "The defendant's attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove fact D: \"The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.\" This is because, under the principles of search and seizure law, particularly the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, consent given by a third party (in this case, the defendant's neighbor, for a search can be valid even if the person whose property is being searched (the defendant) did not give direct consent. However, the validity of the consent depends on whether the third party had authority over the premises and was aware of the nature of the items to be searched.\n\nIn this scenario, assuming the neighbor had the authority to grant access to the apartment ( such as being a trusted caretaker or friend who had been given permission to enter in an emergency or when the owner is unavailable), their consent might be deemed sufficient. Additionally, the threat of legal consequences for refusing consent (as stated in option D) would not typically be a factor in determining the voluntariness of consent under the law. Voluntariness is usually determined based on whether the consent was given freely and without coercion, intimidation, or deception. \n\nTherefore, proving that the police threatened the neighbor with arrest if she refused permission to search would not be relevant to the admissibility of the gun in court, as the focus is on the legality of the neighbor's consent rather than the methods used by the police to obtain it."
