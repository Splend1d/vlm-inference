This can help to decrease variance, as the model becomes better at capturing the specific patterns in the training set. However, it may increase bias if the model becomes too complex and starts to overfit the training data, which means it is modeling the noise in the data along with the underlying pattern. Therefore, while increasing basis functions can potentially decrease variance, it might not always decrease bias or estimation bias, and could increase both depending on how much complexity is added. The impact on bias depends on whether the added complexity helps the model generalize better to unseen data (or not."
