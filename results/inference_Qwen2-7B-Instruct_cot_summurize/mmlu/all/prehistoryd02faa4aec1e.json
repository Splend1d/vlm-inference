By analyzing the remains, scientists can often determine what type of animal was hunted and consumed by ancient peoples. This can give insights into the diet, hunting techniques, and social behaviors of those communities. However, it's important to note that this is a complex process requiring expertise in both archaeology and forensic science. The preservation of organic materials on stone tools is rare, which makes such findings particularly significant."
