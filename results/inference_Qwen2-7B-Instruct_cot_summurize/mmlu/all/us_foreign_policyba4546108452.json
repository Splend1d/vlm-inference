This would be an 'empire of liberty'\n\nAfter the American Revolution and the establishment of the United States in 1776, Americans believed they could found a different kind of empire because they wanted to create a nation grounded in principles of liberty, democracy, and individual rights. Unlike many other empires that were characterized by centralized power, colonial exploitation, and often suppression of local cultures and traditions, the United States sought to establish a new form of governance that emphasized freedom for its citizens.\n\nThe Founding Fathers drew inspiration from Enlightenment ideas about natural rights, limited government, and popular sovereignty. They wanted to create a society where individuals could live freely without the oppressive conditions of traditional empires, which often involved exploitation, lack of representation, and suppression of dissent. The United States aimed to be an \"empire of liberty,\" where laws were made by consent of the governed, and where individual liberties were protected."
