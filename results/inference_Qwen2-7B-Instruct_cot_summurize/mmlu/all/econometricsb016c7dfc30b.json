This condition ensures that the process does not exhibit explosive behavior over time, which is a key characteristic of stationarity. \n\nStationarity implies that the statistical properties of the process (such as mean and variance) do not change over time. When the roots of the characteristic equation are within the unit circle, it guarantees that any shocks or changes in the system will dissipate over time rather than growing, thus maintaining the stability and stationarity of the process."
