The fires remove dead and decaying plant matter, reducing the risk of more intense and destructive fires. \n\nPeriodic natural wildfires help maintain the health and balance of certain forest ecosystems by clearing out underbrush and dead trees, which reduces fuel for future fires and prevents them from becoming larger and more destructive. This also allows sunlight to reach the forest floor, promoting the growth of new vegetation. Additionally, wildfires often enrich the soil with nutrients from the ashes, aiding in the regeneration of plant life."
