This means that a state can exist and have sovereignty without being recognized by other states.\n\nSo, out of your options:\n\nA. Recognition is determinative for the existence of statehood: This is incorrect according to the declaratory theory. The theory does not suggest that recognition is necessary for a state to exist.\n\nB. Recognition is simply declaratory of statehood but not determinative: This is correct. According to the declaratory theory, recognition is a statement or declaration of a state's existence and sovereignty, but it is not required for the state to be considered legitimate or sovereign.\n\nC. Recognition is merely a declaration of interest: This is partially correct but doesn't fully capture the declaratory theory. While recognition can be seen as an expression of interest, it also involves acknowledging the legal personality of a state.\n\nD. Recognition requires a declaration by the newly-created State: This is incorrect because the declaratory theory posits that recognition is not a requirement for statehood; it's a subsequent act by existing states acknowledging the existence of the new state.\n\nSo, the best answer according to the declaratory theory of recognition is B."
