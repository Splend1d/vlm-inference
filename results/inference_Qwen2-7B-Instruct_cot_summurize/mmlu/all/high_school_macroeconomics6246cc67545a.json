An increase in the size of the labor force.\n\nAn increase in the size of the labor force typically results in higher output and economic growth, assuming that there is sufficient demand for the goods and services produced by the additional workers. This can happen through natural population growth or through immigration, which can expand the labor force without affecting the total population.\n\nOption A, a decrease in the unemployment rate, might suggest economic growth as it indicates that more people are employed, but it doesn't necessarily mean an increase in the labor force or productivity. It could just mean that more people have found jobs, possibly at lower skill levels than their qualifications, or with reduced hours.\n\nOption B, an increase in the unemployment rate, would likely lead to a decrease in economic activity as fewer people are participating in the workforce.\n\nOption D, a decrease in the population, would generally not be expected to result in economic growth, as it reduces the number of potential workers available to produce goods and services. However, if this reduction occurs because of increased birth rates or immigration, it could potentially contribute to economic growth."
