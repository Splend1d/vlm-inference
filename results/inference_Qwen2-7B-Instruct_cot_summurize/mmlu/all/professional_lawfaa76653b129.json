Hearsay refers to an out-of-court statement made for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted. The statement would not fall under any recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, which includes things like declarations against interest, excited utterances, or statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment, among others. Therefore, the court would likely rule the statement inadmissible. \n\nAdditionally, even if the statement were to qualify as an exception to the hearsay rule ( for example, if the statement was made while the declarant was in a state of excitement right after the events occurred - it might still be excluded from evidence if it unduly prejudices the jury or is more prejudicial than probative. This is known as the 'prejudicial effect' rule. \n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most accurate answer based on these considerations."
