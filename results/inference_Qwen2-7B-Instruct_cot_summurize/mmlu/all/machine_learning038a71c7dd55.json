                    "text": "Statement 1 is True. In kernel density estimation (KDE), the kernel function is indeed used to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. When applied to a dataset, KDE essentially places a kernel (which can be thought of as a small, smooth \"bump\" of height \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) at each data point \\( X_i \\) in the dataset, where \\( n \\) is the total number of data points. This approach allows for a smooth estimate of the underlying density of the data.\n\nStatement 2 is False. The depth of a decision tree refers to the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. It is theoretically possible for a decision tree to have a depth that exceeds the number of training examples if the data has complex, overlapping patterns and the tree is grown to a very deep level without sufficient regularization or pruning. However, this is not a common scenario because it implies overfitting, where the model learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern. Typically, the depth of a tree is less than or equal to the number of unique samples, especially when using techniques like pruning to prevent overfitting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False."
