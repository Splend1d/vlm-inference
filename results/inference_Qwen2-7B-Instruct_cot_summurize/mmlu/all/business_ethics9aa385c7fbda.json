This can sometimes justify actions as a necessary part of maintaining a moral balance.\n3. **Appeal to higher loyalties** - In this strategy, actors argue that their norm violation was justified because it served a higher moral purpose or loyalty, such as protecting a friend or adhering to a personal or group value system, even if it went against explicit norms or laws."
