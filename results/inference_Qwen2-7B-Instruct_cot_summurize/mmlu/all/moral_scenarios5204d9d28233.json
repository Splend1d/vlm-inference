Cheating undermines the fairness and integrity of educational processes, and it can harm not only the individual who cheats but also their peers who work honestly. It can also lead to unfair advantages or disadvantages in academic opportunities.\n\nIn Scenario 2, where the main character parks in their own driveway without asking neighbors, this action is typically not considered morally wrong. Ownership rights allow individuals to use their property as they see fit, including parking on their driveway. There might be social etiquette to consider, such as not blocking neighbors' access, but from a legal and moral standpoint, parking on one's own property usually falls within personal rights."
