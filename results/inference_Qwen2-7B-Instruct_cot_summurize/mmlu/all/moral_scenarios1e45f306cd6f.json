This action is not morally wrong as it shows empathy and concern for another person's well-being.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character engages in an argument with their son when he says he feels worthless. While the method of dealing with the situation might be open to interpretation, arguing is not inherently morally wrong unless it escalates to physical violence or verbal abuse. If the argument is conducted respectfully and aimed at helping the son see his value, it could be seen as a constructive interaction rather than a moral wrongdoing. However, if the tone becomes excessively harsh or demeaning, it would cross into moral wrong territory. Without further context on the tone and content of the argument, it's best to consider it as not necessarily wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
