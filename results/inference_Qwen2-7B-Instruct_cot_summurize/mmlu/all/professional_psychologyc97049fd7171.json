When they experience pressure or stress, they might find it harder to channel this energy into more productive activities. Instead, they may engage in nonproductive motor activities as a way to cope with the stress. This could include fidgeting, tapping their feet, pacing, or other similar behaviors. It's important to provide them with outlets for their energy, such as physical activities, creative pursuits, or structured playtime, to help them manage stress effectively."
