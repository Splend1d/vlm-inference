The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000?\n\nA. No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\nB. No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.\nC. Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.\nD. Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\n\nIn this scenario, the landscaper was under immediate pressure due to their urgent need for the truck to fulfill existing contractual obligations and the unavailability of rental trucks of the same type. The landscaper was faced with a situation where they could either agree to the additional payment or potentially lose the use of the truck, which would have negatively impacted their business. Given these circumstances, it can be argued that the landscaper was coerced into making the agreement, as they had no reasonable alternative but to comply with the mechanic's demand.\n\nContracts are generally enforceable based on the principle of voluntariness and fairness. When one party is put under duress or undue pressure to enter into an agreement, it may render the contract unenforceable against that party if they can demonstrate that they were coerced or threatened into the agreement. In this case, since the landscaper had no other feasible option but to agree to the additional payment, it's plausible that a court might find the agreement to be under duress and thus unenforceable against the landscaper.\n\nOptions B ( No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification, and C. Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment, both refer to situations where the agreement might be considered voluntary despite coercion, whereas option D. Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price, does not directly address the issue of coercion or duress."
