Let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality. This is not a lossless transformation because compression algorithms often discard some data to reduce file size, which can result in a loss of detail.\n\nB. Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. This process can be considered lossless if the averaging operation does not involve any rounding errors or truncation, but it fundamentally changes the image representation from color to grayscale. While it does not introduce new errors, it fundamentally alters the image content.\n\nC. Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed. This transformation is lossless because it merely inverts the color values without altering the underlying data, preserving all the original pixel values.\n\nD. Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture. This operation could potentially be lossless depending on how it's implemented, as long as no data is lost or modified during the copying process. However, it depends on the specifics of how the pixels are moved or copied.\n\nGiven these explanations, **option C** ( \"Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255\" **best describes a lossless transformation of the digital image**, assuming no additional operations like rounding or truncation are introduced during the process."
