However, let's clarify each option:\n\nA. \"are the result of applying arbitrarily stringent standards.\" - This statement might be referring to Karl Popper's philosophy, which indeed criticized certain forms of skepticism by suggesting they use overly strict criteria for falsifiability, making it hard for any theory to be scientifically tested or disproven.\n\nB. \"are based on linguistic confusions.\" - This could refer to the idea that some skeptical arguments might misunderstand or misinterpret language, leading to flawed reasoning.\n\nC. \"are logically self-refuting.\" - This is a common criticism of certain skeptical positions, suggesting that the arguments against belief in the external world, for example, lead to a conclusion that undermines their own validity.\n\nD. \"grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards.\" - This might imply that some skeptical arguments fail because they apply everyday standards too rigorously in contexts where such standards do not apply or are not relevant.\n\nGiven the options, none directly matches a claim made by Thomas Nagel specifically regarding skeptical arguments. However, if we had to choose one that might align with a general stance Nagel has taken ( (Nagel is known for his critical views on some forms of skepticism and his defense of the existence of objective facts and knowledge, particularly in his work \"The View from Nowhere\" and other writings:\n\nD. \"grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards.\" - This could reflect Nagel's critique of those who might overemphasize the limitations of ordinary standards of evidence and argumentation when evaluating knowledge claims about the external world. He might argue that such a consistent application of ordinary standards can lead to overly skeptical conclusions.\n\nIt's important to note that Nagel's views are nuanced and complex, and his criticisms of skepticism are not straightforwardly captured by these options. The best choice among the provided options would likely depend on a more detailed understanding of specific arguments or passages by Nagel."
