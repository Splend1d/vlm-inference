The daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food\n\nTo evaluate the safety of a food substance, researchers use a combination of different types of data, including toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies, as well as data on human exposure. This exposure data typically includes information about the daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food. By comparing this intake level to the dose at which adverse effects were observed in animal studies, regulators can estimate a safe intake level for humans.\n\nWhile other factors like the rates of consumption of the food ( to which the substance is added ( (A), the concentration of the substance in food ( (B), and the total amount of the substance a person will consume over a lifetime ( (D) might be relevant for understanding overall exposure or consumption patterns, they are not the primary focus when assessing the safety of a food substance based on animal study data."
