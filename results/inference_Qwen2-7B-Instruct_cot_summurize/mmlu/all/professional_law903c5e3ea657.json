Denied, because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile.\n\nUnder the \"automobile exception\" to the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, police officers can search a vehicle incident to a lawful arrest without needing a warrant. This exception includes the trunk of the vehicle. The rationale behind this exception is that vehicles are more susceptible to quick escape than other types of property, and thus, any items in the vehicle could pose a danger to the arresting officer or evidence could be destroyed or removed.\n\nStan's arrest was lawful since he was seen committing suspicious activity (running from a liquor store at 3 a.m., which could suggest involvement in a crime such as theft or vandalism. As the officer pursued Stan and made a lawful arrest, the search of the trunk of the vehicle where they found cash and a baseball bat was also lawful under the automobile exception.\n\nIt's important to note that if there were any other issues with the legality of the arrest (such as lack of probable cause or violation of Stan's rights during the arrest\u2014the search might not have been justified under the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine. However, based on the information provided, the search appears to have been lawful."
