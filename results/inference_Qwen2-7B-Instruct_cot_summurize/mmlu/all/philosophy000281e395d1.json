The complexity of the rules (A) can make them harder to follow and understand, potentially leading to more violations. The likelihood of people violating the code (B) is also relevant; if a code is too restrictive or unrealistic, it might not be adhered to as expected. Lastly, the costs of the restrictions, in terms of the guilt they induce (C), can affect how feasible and acceptable the code is to individuals and societies. High guilt might lead to resistance or avoidance of the moral code. Therefore, all these factors play a role in determining the idealness of a moral code according to Brandt's view."
