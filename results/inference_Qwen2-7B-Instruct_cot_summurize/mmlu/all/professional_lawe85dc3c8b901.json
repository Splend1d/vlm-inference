The neighbor's plan conformed to all local building ordinances and land use regulations. The owner had been in the house for 10 years and the neighbor recently bought the adjoining lot. The owner showed that a different placement of the house would not interfere with her use and enjoyment of her residence. The trial judge ruled in favor of the defendant on the basis that the defendant had a right to build his house anywhere as long as he followed the building/zoning laws. The owner appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the trial court's decision?\n\nA. Yes, because blocking a neighbor's sunlight is a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process.\nB. Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\nC. No, because the trial court was correct in ruling that there had to be some violation of building regulations before the construction could be enjoined.\nD. No, because a comparative evaluation of the benefits and detriments of each position favor the neighbor's position.\n"

Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\n\nThe case described appears to involve a conflict over a neighbor's right to build on their property versus the homeowner's right to receive adequate sunlight. This scenario can be analyzed under the concept of \"sunlight rights\" or \"daylighting rights,\" which are not explicitly recognized in many jurisdictions but are often protected under the general principles of nuisance law. A private nuisance occurs when a person's actions unreasonably interfere with another's use and enjoyment of their property. In this situation, if the proposed house placement significantly interferes with the sunlight access of the homeowner without a reasonable accommodation (such as through a different placement of the house), it may be considered a private nuisance.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court might consider whether the lower court correctly applied the law regarding nuisances and the rights of neighboring properties. If the court determined that the neighbor's plans constitute an unreasonable interference with the homeowner's property rights, it might reverse the trial court's decision and rule in favor of the homeowner. However, the specific outcome would depend on the legal precedent and statutes in the jurisdiction where the case takes place."
