Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, throwing a bowling ball as hard as you can at the pin setter is considered a violation of safety rules and could potentially cause damage or harm to property or people, which is generally considered morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, criticizing someone for using incorrect grammar is not necessarily morally wrong. It's a matter of personal opinion whether one believes it's necessary or appropriate to correct grammar mistakes, especially when done in a respectful and constructive manner. However, if this criticism is done in an overly harsh or demeaning way, it could cross into being morally wrong. Without context about how it was delivered, we assume it's not wrong simply because it involves criticism."
