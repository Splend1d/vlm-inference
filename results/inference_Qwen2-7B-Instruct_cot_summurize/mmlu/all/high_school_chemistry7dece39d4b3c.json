                    "text": "Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. Generally, reactions that lead to an increase in the number of gas molecules or increase in the disorder of the system will result in an increase in entropy. Conversely, reactions that lead to a decrease in the number of gas molecules or a decrease in the disorder of the system will result in a decrease in entropy.\n\nLet's analyze each reaction:\n\nA. \\( C(s) + CO2(g) \\rightarrow 2 CO(g) \\): This reaction results in one carbon molecule reacting with one carbon dioxide molecule to produce two carbon monoxide molecules. The number of gas molecules increases, which typically leads to an increase in entropy.\n\nB. \\( 2 Na(s) + O2(g) \\rightarrow Na2O2(s) \\): This reaction involves solid sodium reacting with oxygen gas to form a solid compound. The number of gas molecules decreases (from one oxygen molecule to none), and there is an increase in order due to the formation of a solid product. Thus, this reaction likely results in a decrease in entropy.\n\nC. \\( CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \\rightarrow CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g) \\): This is the combustion of methane, where one methane molecule reacts with two oxygen molecules to produce one carbon dioxide molecule and two water molecules. The total number of gas molecules increases, which would generally lead to an increase in entropy.\n\nD. \\( 2 NI3(s) \\rightarrow 3 I2(s) + N2(g) \\): This reaction involves two solid molecules of nitrogen triiodide decomposing into three solid iodine molecules and one nitrogen gas molecule. The number of gas molecules increases, which would generally lead to an increase in entropy.\n\nOut of these options, Reaction B (\\( 2 Na(s) + O2(g) \\rightarrow Na2O2(s) \\)) is expected to have the greatest decrease in entropy because it involves a decrease in the number of gas molecules and a significant increase in order due to the formation of a solid product from gases."
