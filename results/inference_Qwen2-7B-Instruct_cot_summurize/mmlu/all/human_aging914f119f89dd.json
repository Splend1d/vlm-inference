This can indeed make correct diagnoses difficult because healthcare providers have to consider multiple factors and potential interactions between different conditions. As people age, they often face a higher risk of developing various chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment planning."
