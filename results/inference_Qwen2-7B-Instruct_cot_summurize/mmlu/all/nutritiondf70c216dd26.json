Wealthy countries' subsidies and trade barriers can indeed make it difficult for developing countries to benefit from globalisation in terms of advancing food security. These policies can distort global markets, making it harder for smaller producers to compete.\n\nB. The World Trade Organization (WTO does have rules that cover agriculture, though they are complex and subject to interpretation. The Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations aimed to address issues in agriculture, including concerns about market access and domestic support, which could impact food security. However, these negotiations were not successful and have been ongoing.\n\nC. While supermarkets are a significant part of how food and agriculture experience globalisation, they are not the only way. Globalisation affects food systems through various channels such as international trade, investment, technology transfer, and consumer preferences, which influence food availability, affordability, and accessibility in different parts of the world.\n\nD. Creating publicly-owned food reserves can be one strategy for developing countries to enhance food security, especially during times of crisis or when facing challenges like climate change or economic instability. Such reserves can help ensure food availability and stability by providing a buffer against price volatility and supply disruptions. However, this is just one of many strategies, and effective implementation would require careful planning and consideration of local contexts and resources.\n\nIn summary, globalisation has complex effects on food security, involving both opportunities and challenges that require nuanced policy responses and cooperation among nations."
