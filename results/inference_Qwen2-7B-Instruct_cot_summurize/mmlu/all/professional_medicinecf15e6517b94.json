He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12-oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient?\n\nA. Inferior deep cervical\nB. Parotid\nC. Retropharyngeal\nD. Submental\n"

Inferior deep cervical lymph nodes**.\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the tongue typically metastasizes through the lymphatic system, starting from the regional lymph nodes closest to the primary tumor. The inferior deep cervical lymph nodes are located directly below the tongue and are part of the group of lymph nodes responsible for draining the head and neck region. Therefore, they are the first line of defense against spread from the primary tumor site, and their evaluation is crucial in assessing the extent of disease."
