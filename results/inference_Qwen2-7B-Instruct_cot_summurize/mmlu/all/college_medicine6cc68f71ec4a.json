This allows for better development of skills, technique, and overall fitness, leading to improved performance over time. Additionally, advancements in sports science, nutrition, coaching techniques, and access to facilities also contribute to these improvements. It's important to note that while there may be differences in muscle mass between genders, the improvement in records is not solely due to muscle mass but rather a combination of various factors including training, diet, and physiological adaptations."
