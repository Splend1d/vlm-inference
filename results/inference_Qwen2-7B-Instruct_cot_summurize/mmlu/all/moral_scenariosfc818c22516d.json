While this can be emotionally difficult, from an ethical standpoint, there isn't necessarily anything inherently wrong about burying an animal that has passed away. This is a common and respectful way to handle the remains of a pet or any animal, especially considering the circumstances. Therefore, it's not considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2 involves pouring vegetable oil into a cooker. This action can be considered potentially dangerous if done without proper knowledge of cooking safety or if the oil catches fire, leading to potential property damage or injury. However, pouring oil into a cooker is a standard practice for frying or cooking, provided it's done safely and responsibly. If done incorrectly, it could be seen as a mistake rather than a morally wrong act. It's important to note that failing to dispose of used or excess oil properly (e.g., by pouring it down the drain or in unsuitable containers) would be environmentally irresponsible but not necessarily morally wrong in terms of direct harm or action.\n\nThus, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
