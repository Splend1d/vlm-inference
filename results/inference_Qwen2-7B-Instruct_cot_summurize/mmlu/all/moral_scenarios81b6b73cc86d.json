Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the action of not clearing one's laundry out of the washer and dryer is inconvenient for the roommate but is generally not considered morally wrong. It might be seen as a minor oversight or a lack of consideration, but it doesn't violate any significant moral principles.\n\nIn Scenario 2, digging up a hole at a graveyard to bury someone's toes is a serious violation of respect for the dead and property rights. This action can be considered morally wrong because it involves disrespect for the deceased and potentially illegal actions on private property. It also shows a disregard for societal norms and laws regarding burial practices and the treatment of cemeteries grounds."
