She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week, but she was able to finish the game. She has no history of rash or joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Nuclear scan of the right knee\nB. MRI of the right knee\nC. Antibiotic therapy\nD. Arthrocentesis\n"

Arthrocentesis**. \n\nArthrocentesis, or joint aspiration, involves removing fluid from the joint under sterile conditions for examination. This procedure can help diagnose the cause of the knee swelling, pain, and warmth, especially if it suggests a possible joint infection (septic arthritis or a septic joint effusion) or a possible crystal-induced arthritis like gout. The sample obtained can be analyzed for bacteria, crystals, and inflammatory markers which can provide clues about the underlying cause.\n\nBefore proceeding with arthrocentesis, it would also be prudent to initiate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (option C, pending results, as the patient might have a bacterial infection. An MRI (option B) could be useful after initial management to assess the extent of any structural damage or inflammation within the joint, but it is typically not the first-line test for diagnosing an acute inflammatory joint condition.\n\nA nuclear scan (option A) is less common for diagnosing acute knee problems and typically used for other purposes such as assessing bone health or joint infections when other tests are inconclusive."
