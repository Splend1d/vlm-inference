This action could be considered morally wrong if it poses a safety risk to the performers (for example, if the water was not properly cleaned up and someone slipped and got injured. However, if the water was minor and did not pose an immediate danger, and it was done in preparation for the performance, it might not be seen as morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves giving one's child food once a week. This scenario is generally not considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020, as providing basic necessities like food is a fundamental responsibility of caregivers. However, the frequency and adequacy of food provided can vary widely based on societal norms and legal standards. If the frequency was due to extreme poverty or neglect, it could be seen as morally wrong, but under typical circumstances, it would not be.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
