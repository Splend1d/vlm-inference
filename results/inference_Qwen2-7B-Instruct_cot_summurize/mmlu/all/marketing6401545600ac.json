They offer an extensive range of products within that category, often at lower prices than their competitors due to their ability to purchase in bulk and operate with lower overhead costs. They also frequently provide fewer customer service amenities, aiming to keep operational costs down and prices competitive. The goal is to become the dominant player in that specific category, hence the term 'category-killer'."
