A decline in investment. \n\nEconomic growth is often driven by factors such as capital accumulation, which includes investments in infrastructure, technology, and human capital. A decline in investment can lead to a decrease in productive capacity, lower productivity, and ultimately slower economic growth. \n\nOn the other hand, an increase in immigration ( (option B) can contribute to economic growth by providing a larger workforce, increasing consumer demand, and bringing in new skills and entrepreneurship. Technological advances ( (option C) and an increase in the labor force  (option D) can also stimulate economic growth by enhancing productivity and creating new opportunities for production and consumption."
