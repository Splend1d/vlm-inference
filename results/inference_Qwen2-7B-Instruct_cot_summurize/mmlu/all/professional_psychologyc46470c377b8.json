While affective commitment can influence other factors like job satisfaction, productivity, and job motivation, it might not be as predictive of turnover as other factors such as organizational policies, job fit, or personal circumstances outside the workplace. Organizations with high levels of affective commitment may still experience turnover if, for example, employees seek better opportunities elsewhere, face personal issues, or find that their career paths do not align with those offered by the organization."
