Intimacy - This refers to the emotional connection between two people. It involves sharing thoughts, feelings, and experiences with each other.\n\nB. Commitment - This is the decision to remain in the relationship despite the challenges and difficulties that may arise. It involves a sense of loyalty and responsibility towards one another.\n\nC. Passion - This component involves the physical attraction and sexual desire between the partners.\n\nThese three elements can vary in intensity within a relationship, but for a long-lasting relationship, they typically exist in some form. Sternberg also suggests that when all three elements are present, a relationship has a high potential for longevity."
