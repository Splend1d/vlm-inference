The level of the spinal cord at which the injury occurred: Erectile function is controlled by the nervous system, particularly the pelvic nerves that originate from the sacral spinal segments (S2-S4. If the injury is at or above this level, it can disrupt the pathways necessary for achieving and maintaining an erection. For example, injuries at the T10-L1 levels often preserve some erectile function due to the proximity of the injury to the lower spinal segments responsible for erectile control.\n\nB. Whether the spinal cord was partially or completely severed: A complete severance of the spinal cord generally results in more severe loss of function compared to a partial severance. In cases of a complete severance, there may be no pathway for signals to reach the genital area, leading to potential loss of erectile function. However, in cases of a partial severance, some neural pathways may still exist, potentially allowing for some degree of erectile function to be preserved.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other factors such as age, overall health, and specific conditions like diabetes can influence erectile function in individuals with spinal cord injuries, but these are not the primary determinants."
