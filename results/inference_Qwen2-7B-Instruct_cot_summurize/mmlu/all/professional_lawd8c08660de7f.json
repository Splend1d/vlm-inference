The owners of the complex told the fumigation company that the common wall separating the infested building from the uninfested building was an impenetrable fire wall. The fumigation company did its own thorough inspection and determined that the buildings were indeed completely separated by the wall. Residents of the condominium units in the building that was to be sprayed were told to evacuate, but the residents of the uninfested building were told that they could remain while the other building was treated. During and shortly after the fumigation, in which a highly toxic chemical was used, many residents of the uninfested building became sick. It was determined that their illnesses were caused by the fumigation chemical. In fact, there was a hole in the fire wall separating the two buildings, but because it could only be observed from a specific position in the crawl space underneath the floor of the uninfested building, it had not been discovered by either the fumigation company or any previous building inspector. Are the residents of the uninfested building likely to prevail in a tort action against the fumigation company?\n\nA. No, because the condominium complex owners were responsible for accurately conveying the condition of their buildings.\nB. No, because the fumigation company exercised a high level of care.\nC. Yes, because the fumigation company can be held strictly liable for its activity.\nD. Yes, because the fumigation company put a dangerous product into the stream of commerce.\n"

Yes, because the fumigation company can be held strictly liable for its activity.\n\nIn this scenario, the fumigation company is likely to be held strictly liable for its actions due to the concept of \"strict liability\" in tort law. Strict liability applies when a defendant is liable for harm caused by their conduct regardless of fault or negligence. In cases involving hazardous activities such as the use of chemicals, if the defendant (in this case, the fumigation company - causes harm, they can be held strictly liable even if they followed all safety protocols and exercised reasonable care.\n\nThe fact that there was a hole in the fire wall that allowed the toxic fumigation chemical to enter the uninfested building suggests that the fumigation company's actions may have been a direct cause of the residents' illness. The presence of the hole indicates that there was a breach in the expected barrier between the buildings, which was not the fault of the residents of the uninfested building. Therefore, they might argue that the fumigation company's actions led to an unforeseen and harmful consequence despite their intentions being presumably good.\n\nMoreover, the residents would likely contend that the fumigation company was aware of the potential risks associated with the use of toxic chemicals and should have taken additional precautions to prevent such an incident, especially given the lack of knowledge about the compromised fire wall. This situation might also be considered a case of \"attractive nuisance,\" where the company's actions drew a potentially dangerous situation onto the uninfested building.\n\nTherefore, under the principles of strict liability, the residents of the uninfested building are likely to prevail in a tort action against the fumigation company."
