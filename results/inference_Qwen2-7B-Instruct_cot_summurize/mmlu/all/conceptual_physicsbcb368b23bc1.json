Gravity acts downward, so the net force on the ball at any height is always -mg (negative because it acts opposite to the direction of motion (upward).\n\nGiven that the question asks for the net force at the halfway point (10m above the ground, this does not change the nature of the force. The ball is still subject to a constant downward force of mg due to gravity.\n\nSo, regardless of its height, the net force on the ball is:\n\n- mg ( (for the negative sign indicating the direction of force being downward)"
