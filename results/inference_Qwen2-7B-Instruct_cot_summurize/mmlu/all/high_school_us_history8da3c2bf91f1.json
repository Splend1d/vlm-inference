Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and \"The Palace\" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they \"lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied.\"\n\u2014Henry Adams, History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, 1889\nAs the great-grandson of President John Adams, the historian Henry Adams might have been expected to be which of the following?\n\nA. Critical of the policies of Thomas Jefferson\nB. Supportive of the policies of Thomas Jefferson\nC. Critical of the Constitutional Convention\nD. More interested in the French and Indian War\n"

Supportive of the policy of Thomas Jefferson\n\nThis is because Henry Adams' description of Jefferson's influence and importance to American history suggests a level of admiration or support for his actions and policies. The passage emphasizes Jefferson's role in shaping American history, likening him to figures like Pitt and Bonaparte, and notes that his personality had a significant impact on the nation, indicating a positive view of his administration."
