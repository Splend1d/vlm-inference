Power-driven machinery replaced manual labor, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. Workers were concentrated in large-scale workplaces or factories, often in urban areas, which allowed for mass production and specialization of labor. This period also saw the growth of the industrial working class and the emergence of new management techniques that helped coordinate large numbers of workers.\n\nOptions A, B, and C describe aspects of the industrial era but are not as central to its defining characteristics as the development of power-driven machinery and large-scale workplace organization. While women did enter the workforce in larger numbers during this time, particularly in textile mills, this was not a feature exclusive to the 19th century's industrial production. Cottage industries and homeworkers were prevalent before the Industrial Revolution and were gradually replaced by factory-based production. The \"managerial revolution\" refers to changes in organizational structures and management practices, but it is the mechanization and factory system that most directly defines the industrial production of the 19th century."
