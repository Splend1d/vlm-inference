Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, letting a drunk friend drive could be considered morally wrong because it involves potentially endangering not only your friend but also other people on the road due to the risk of impaired driving. This action violates the moral duty to prevent harm to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, playing fetch with your dog at a nuclear power plant is clearly morally wrong. Nuclear facilities contain significant hazards and risks to human safety, and engaging in activities that could lead to accidents or unauthorized access to sensitive areas is against the law and ethical guidelines. This action disregards the responsibility to respect the safety protocols and security measures in place for such critical infrastructure.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is not morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards, while the second scenario is morally wrong."
