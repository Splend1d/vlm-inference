This law states that the intensity (I) of light from a point source decreases with the square of the distance (d) from the source.\n\nThe formula for this is:\n\n\\[ I \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- The current solar flux at Earth's distance (1 AU) = 1380 W/m\u00b2.\n- Europa's orbital distance = 5 AU.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( I_{Earth} \\) = Solar flux at Earth (1380 W/m\u00b2\n- \\( I_{Europa} \\) = Solar flux required at Europa's distance (unknown\n- \\( d_{Earth} \\) = Distance of Earth from the Sun = 1 AU\n- \\( d_{Europa} \\) = Distance of Europa from the Sun = 5 AU\n\nUsing the inverse square law:\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_{Earth}}{I_{Europa}} = \\left(\\frac{d_{Europa}}{d_{Earth}}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nSubstitute known values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1380}{I_{Europa}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{1}\\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1380}{I_{Europa}} = 25 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( I_{Europa} \\):\n\n\\[ I_{Europa} = \\frac{1380}{25} \\]\n\\[ I_{Europa} = 55.2 \\, \\text{W/m}^2 \\]\n\nNow, to find out how much brighter the Sun needs to be for Europa to receive 1380 W/m\u00b2 ( (the same as Earth), we compare the new flux to the original flux:\n\n\\[ \\text{Brightness factor} = \\frac{1380}{55.2} \\approx 25 \\]\n\nTherefore, the Sun would have to be approximately 25 times brighter for Europa to receive the same solar flux as Earth currently receives. \n\nCorrect answer: B. 25 times brighter."
