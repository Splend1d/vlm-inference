The action turned on the scope of the work covered by the contract. The contractor and the homeowner were the only witnesses at the bench trial, and they strongly disagreed about the scope of the work. At the end of the trial, the judge stated findings of fact on the record but never issued a written opinion. Neither party objected to the findings. The judge found in favor of the homeowner, and the contractor appealed. Is the appellate court likely to overturn the findings?\n\nA. No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.\nB. No, because the contractor failed to object to the findings when the judge stated them in open court.\nC. Yes, because a judge must set forth findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum of decision.\nD. Yes, because there were disputed issues of fact at trial.\n"

No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.\n\nExplanation: When a case goes to appeal, the appellate court generally defers to the trial judge's assessment of witness credibility, as the judge has the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses testify live. In this scenario, since the judge made findings of fact on the record without issuing a written opinion, and both parties did not object to these findings, it is unlikely that the appellate court would overturn the findings based on the mere absence of a written opinion. The key consideration here is the credibility determination made by the trial judge, which the appellate court will uphold unless it is clearly erroneous."
