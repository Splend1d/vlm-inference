The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases. \n\nWhen a major earthquake destroys much of the plant and equipment, it leads to a reduction in productive capacity, shifting the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS curve to the left. Given that the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, this shift results in a higher price level for a lower quantity of output. This is because producers are willing to supply less output at each price level due to the reduced capacity. Therefore, both the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output will change, with the price level increasing and the quantity decreasing."
