Children deprived of an early, secure attachment to their mother are prone to suffer physically, intellectually, and socially in later life\n\nJohn Bowlby's maternal deprivation thesis, also known as attachment theory, primarily focuses on the importance of early, secure attachments with caregivers for child development. Bowlby argued that a lack of such attachments can lead to difficulties in various areas of development, including emotional, cognitive, and social functioning. This does not specifically address poverty, socially constructed activities, or hereditary factors related to deprivation."
