The price of apple peelers/corers rises.\n\nIf the price of apple peelers/corers rises, it could potentially increase the cost of production for your aunt's apple pies. To maintain profitability, she might need to hire more labor to compensate for the higher costs. This increased demand for labor would be an attempt to keep up with production levels despite the increased cost of materials.\n\nB. Your aunt\u2019s friends gossip all day, slowing their dough-making process.\n\nThis situation would decrease efficiency and productivity, which could lead to a lower demand for labor as your aunt might find that fewer workers can achieve the same output.\n\nC. There is a sale on ovens.\n\nWhile this might seem like an attractive opportunity for your aunt, it doesn't necessarily increase the demand for labor directly. Buying new equipment could improve efficiency if the oven is outdated or faulty, but it doesn't necessarily require hiring more staff unless the capacity of the existing workforce is exceeded.\n\nD. A new study reveals that apples increase your risk of cancer.\n\nThis information could potentially reduce consumer demand for apple pies, thereby decreasing the overall demand for labor in your aunt's firm, as fewer pies would need to be made."
