The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\nA. Atrial fibrillation\nB. Cor pulmonale\nC. Systemic hypertension\nD. Tricuspid valve regurgitation\n"

                    "text": "The patient described has several risk factors that suggest the possibility of congenital heart disease, specifically based on the findings of a systolic murmur, left ventricular prominence on chest x-ray, left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG, and weak femoral and strong brachial pulses with a radiofemoral delay. These findings are consistent with conditions such as Hypoplastic left heart syndrome or other forms of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\n\nGiven these findings, the patient is at greatest risk for developing:\n\nC. Systemic hypertension - This is because the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood through a narrowed outflow tract, leading to increased left ventricular pressure and eventually hypertension.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that without further diagnostic testing such as echocardiography or cardiac catheterization, this diagnosis cannot be confirmed definitively. The patient should be referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation and management. \n\nA. Atrial fibrillation - Although possible, it is less likely to be the immediate greatest risk given the patient's age and the findings.\nB. Cor pulmonale - While it can occur in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, the primary concern here seems to be related to the left side of the heart rather than the right.\nD. Tricuspid valve regurgitation - This condition is more typically associated with right-sided heart failure, which is not the primary concern based on the information provided."
