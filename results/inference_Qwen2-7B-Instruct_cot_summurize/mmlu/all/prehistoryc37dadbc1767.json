                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Between 1% and 4% of the genome of modern humans with European and Asian ancestry originated from Neandertal populations, most likely through interbreeding.\n\nThis conclusion comes from extensive genetic studies comparing the DNA of modern humans with that of Neanderthals ( an extinct species of humans who lived in Europe and Western Asia from about 400,000 to 30,000 years ago. These studies have shown that some segments of DNA in non-African populations are more similar to Neanderthal DNA than to the DNA of other modern humans. This suggests that these segments were inherited from ancestors who m had interbred with Neanderthals.\n\nThe percentage of Neanderthal ancestry varies among different populations:\n- Europeans generally have about 2% Neanderthal ancestry.\n- Asians can have slightly higher percentages, up to around 4%.\n\nIn contrast, the genetic relationship between Neanderthals and Denisovans ( another ancient human species discovered in 2010, is more complex, and there is less consensus on the exact percentages of Denisovan ancestry in different populations.\n\nIt's important to note that this interbreeding occurred tens of thousands of years ago, and the amount of Neanderthal DNA in modern humans is not significant enough to affect physical traits or health significantly. The interbreeding events are thought to have occurred during times when small groups of early humans migrated out of Africa and encountered Neanderthals in Eurasia."
