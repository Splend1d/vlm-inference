One day, the man set out driving his truck, heavily loaded with lumber, down a mountain road. Sitting next to the man in the passenger seat was a 19-year-old helper. During the course of the trip, when the truck was going down a long hill, the brakes failed. The man shouted to the helper to jump, but the teenager refused to do so and shouted back to the man that he should try to steer the truck down the hill. The man then opened the door on the passenger's side of the truck and negligently pushed the helper out. The helper, who suffered a broken leg, was rushed to the hospital where he was treated for his injury. As the helper was recuperating, a nurse inadvertently mixed up his chart with that of the female patient in the next room. The nurse gave the helper a fertility pill that made him sterile. If the helper brings suit against the man to recover damages for his sterility, the man will\n\nA. recover, because it is foreseeable that a hospital can be negligent in its care of patients.\nB. recover, because the man was negligent in pushing the helper out of the truck.\nC. not recover, because the nurse's act was a supervening superseding cause.\nD. not recover, because it is not foreseeable that a patient would be injured in such a manner.\n"

However, the subsequent injury of sterility occurred due to the nurse's mistake, which was an unforeseeable event after the initial harm. The nurse's action of giving the fertility pill was an intervening cause that broke the chain of causation between the man's negligence and the final injury. Since this intervening cause was unforeseeable and independent, it can be considered a supervening superseding cause, relieving the original wrongdoer (in this case, the man\u2014from liability for the later injuries sustained by the helper."
