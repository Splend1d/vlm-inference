Generally, there are differences in life expectancy based on factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status, but these can vary significantly depending on the country or region.\n\nIn the United States, for example, studies have shown that life expectancy is generally higher for non-Hispanic white individuals compared to non-Hispanic Black individuals. However, these trends can change when comparing men and women within the same racial group due to different factors such as health behaviors, access to healthcare, and lifestyle choices.\n\nIn terms of gender, life expectancy is typically higher for women than for men across many countries, including the United States. This difference is partly due to biological factors and partly due to societal factors like differences in health behaviors and access to healthcare.\n\nGiven the complexities and variations in data sources and populations, it's important to consider the context and specifics of each group when discussing life expectancy. Therefore, without specifying the exact population or country, it's not accurate to definitively state which of the options (A, B, C, or D is likely to live the longest based solely on race and gender. \n\nFor the most accurate information, one would need to consult the latest demographic statistics from relevant sources such as national statistical agencies or reputable health organizations."
