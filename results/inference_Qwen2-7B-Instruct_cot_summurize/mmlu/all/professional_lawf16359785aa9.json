When the husband saw the gun, he jumped on the man and angrily twisted his neck, breaking it and killing him. The husband is guilty for which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Murder.\nB. Voluntary manslaughter.\nC. Involuntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

He killed the man with the intention of stopping what he perceived as an immediate threat to himself. This fits the legal definition of murder. It doesn't matter whether the husband thought he was acting in self-defense; if he intended to kill or cause serious bodily harm, and death resulted, it would typically be classified as murder under criminal law. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, a person who commits murder while acting in self-defense may be able to argue for a lesser charge, such as justifiable homicide or self-defense, but this does not change the fact that they have committed a crime resulting in someone's death. The specifics can vary based on the laws of different regions or country, including the circumstances of the case, the level of force used, and the intent behind the action."
