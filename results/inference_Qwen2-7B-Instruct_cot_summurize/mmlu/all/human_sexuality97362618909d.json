Symptoms of gonorrhea can include pain or burning during urination, an increased need to urinate, and a yellow or greenish pus-like discharge from the penis. However, it's important to note that these symptoms could also be caused by other conditions.\n\nFor accurate diagnosis and treatment, you should consult with a healthcare provider who can conduct appropriate tests and provide the necessary treatment based on the results. It's crucial to address any concerns about sexual health promptly, especially when symptoms are present."
