By citing Lincoln, he implies that because Lincoln was a great president and a key figure in preserving the Union, his perspective on these issues carries significant weight and should be considered as a reliable source of truth or justification. This rhetorical device appeals to the authority or expertise of the person making the claim rather than the logical strength of the argument itself."
