An amendment to that act extends coverage to the states as employers. The federal district court allowed an injunction to prevent further discrimination but refused to allow money damages and legal fees against the state on the basis of 11th Amendment sovereign immunity. The plaintiffs appealed. What should the Court of Appeals decide based on the established jurisprudence regarding sovereign immunity?\n\nA. There is no sovereign immunity due to the First Amendment rights of the women to protest against discrimination.\nB. There is sovereign immunity that protects a state from any lawsuit by private citizens that the state does not authorize.\nC. There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\nD. There is sovereign immunity under the Supremacy Clause and it would take a new constitutional amendment to abrogate the immunity granted to the states.\n"

There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted to enforce the equal employment provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Act specifically states that \"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer...to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" ( \n\nThe 11th Amendment of the US Constitution grants sovereign immunity to states, generally preventing lawsuits by private citizens against a state without its consent. However, Congress can override this immunity when it enacts legislation that \"applies the Fourteenth Amendment to the States and thereby invokes the enforcement power of the Federal Government.\"\n\nIn this case, since Title VII was designed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment's application to states, the federal courts have jurisdiction to hear claims under Title VII against state actors, including claims for injunctive relief and money damages, even if the state has not consented to the lawsuit. Therefore, the Court of Appeals should rule that there is no 11th Amendment sovereign immunity in this context, allowing the plaintiffs to pursue their case for money damages and legal fees against the state."
