When you look at a steamed-up mirror, the reflection you see is actually a distorted version of your actual image due to the fogging on the surface of the mirror. However, for the purpose of wiping the mirror to see your reflection clearly, the size of the patch you need to wipe is related to the size of your face in proportion to the mirror's dimensions.\n\nAssuming that the mirror is large enough to accommodate your entire face, the height of your face would correspond to half the height of the mirror ( if viewed from directly above. This is because when you look at your reflection, the top and bottom of your face align roughly with the top and bottom of the mirror frame, making it appear as if your face takes up approximately half the height of the mirror.\n\nTherefore, to effectively wipe away the steam and see your reflection clearly, you'd need to wipe an area on the mirror that corresponds to about half its height, which would also be the height of your face."
