There is little evidence to substantiate the claim that there is a real and increasing threat posed by the scale and scope of transnational crime in the 1980s to 1990s beyond the consensus that concern over the levels of crime were generated by the military re-conceiving its role in light of the dissolution of the Cold War.\nB. Whereas illegal markets were territorially bounded and isolated in the past, the contemporary form illicit markets tend to be interrelated and mutually supporting and more embedded in the legal economy.\nC. TNC is a response by the dispossessed in response to the asymmetric economic development of nation states and the inequity of global market capitalism married with environmental constraints on development.\nD. Transnational crime is no longer the exclusive domain of certain geographic areas or ethnic groups becoming globalized in operation, increasing the number of groups and countries affected and increasing the size of the illegal market ratio to licit trade.\n"

                    "text": "The concept of \"Transnational Crime\" (TNC) isn't necessarily a new phenomenon; rather, it has evolved over time. The nature and extent of TNC have indeed increased due to globalization, technological advancements, and the erosion of traditional barriers between nations. This evolution has made TNC more complex and harder to control, as criminals now operate across borders and leverage sophisticated technologies for their activities.\n\nLet's analyze the statements provided:\n\nA. This statement acknowledges that there was a shift in the perception of crime post-Cold War, where the military redefined its role. However, it does not specifically address whether TNC is a new phenomenon but rather discusses how concerns over crime levels were influenced by this shift. While it doesn't directly refute the notion of TNC being new, it does suggest that the scale and impact of crime were recognized differently after the Cold War, which could imply an increase in awareness rather than the emergence of the phenomenon itself.\n\nB. This statement highlights a change in the structure and interconnectivity of illegal markets, suggesting that they are more integrated into the global economy and interconnected across different regions. This points towards a trend of TNC evolving from localized to global scales, reinforcing the idea that while not new, TNC has significantly expanded in complexity and reach.\n\nC. This statement posits that TNC is a response to broader societal issues, including economic disparities and environmental constraints. It suggests that TNC is symptomatic of larger systemic problems within nation-states and global capitalism. This perspective supports the notion that TNC is not inherently new but rather a manifestation of existing global dynamics.\n\nD. This statement emphasizes the globalization of criminal activities, indicating that TNC is no longer confined to specific regions or ethnic groups. It underscores the increase in the number of affected groups and countries, and the growth of illegal markets relative to licit trade. This directly addresses the question of whether TNC is a new phenomenon by highlighting its expansion and integration into the global context.\n\nIn conclusion, while TNC may not be a new concept, the scale, scope, and complexity of these crimes have certainly evolved and grown with globalization. The statements provided reflect various aspects of this evolution, emphasizing that TNC is not only an ongoing issue but one that has become more pronounced and interconnected across national boundaries."
