With an increasing number of repeated sprints, the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because, as the intensity and frequency of high-intensity exercise or repeated sprints increase, the rate of lactate production in muscles generally increases rather than decreases. This is due to the higher metabolic demands placed on the muscles during such activities, which leads to greater anaerobic metabolism and lactate production."
