Leads to generalized pigmentation.\n\nAddison's disease, also known as adrenal insufficiency, is not due to a deficiency of prolactin hormone (eliminating option A. Instead, it results from damage or destruction of the adrenal glands, leading to insufficient production of cortisol and aldosterone hormones. This condition can indeed lead to generalized pigmentation of the skin, hair, and mucous membranes (option B. While Addison's disease itself is not directly associated with hypertension (eliminating option C), it can be a contributing factor in some cases, especially if left untreated. Additionally, diabetes mellitus can be a complication of Addison's disease, so option D is also true but not the primary focus of the question. Therefore, among the provided options, recognizing that Addison's disease leads to generalized pigmentation is the most accurate statement."
