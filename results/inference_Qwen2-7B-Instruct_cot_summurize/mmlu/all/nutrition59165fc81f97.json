Recurrent severe infections - Infants with SCID often experience frequent and severe infections due to the inability of their immune system to fight off pathogens. These infections can affect any part of the body, including the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and central nervous system.\n\nB. Family history of unexplained death in infancy - There is an increased risk for siblings of an infant diagnosed with SCID to also have SCID or to die from an infection during infancy, particularly if the cause of death was unexplained. This is because some forms of SCID are inherited and can run in families.\n\nC. Generalised spread of the Tuberculosis strain BCG after vaccination - The BCG vaccine is used to prevent tuberculosis, but in individuals with SCID, it can lead to a systemic infection rather than the localized response that is typically expected. This is because the immune system is not able to contain the vaccine strain effectively.\n\nTherefore, all these options can be indicative of severe combined immunodeficiency in infants."
