When Curtis stares at the yellow star, his eye adapts to the brightness and color of the star. This adaptation causes certain types of cells in the retina to become less sensitive to yellow light.\n\nWhen he looks away to the white paper, these cells, now less sensitive to yellow, respond more strongly to the opposite end of the color spectrum. Since yellow is located between green and red on the visible light spectrum, the cells that were adapted to yellow will be most sensitive to green light, which is the complementary color of yellow. Therefore, he might perceive a green afterimage."
