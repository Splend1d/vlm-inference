It is an input cost variance and affects the cost of production. Allocating this variance to work in process, finished goods, or cost of goods sold will increase the cost of the inventory items affected. This will decrease the value of inventory, potentially increasing the current ratio if other assets remain constant, because current liabilities do not change, but current assets (inventory) decrease. However, it also decreases net income as the cost of goods sold increases, which reduces profit margins.\n\n2. **Labor Efficiency Variance:** This variance happens when the actual hours worked differ from the standard hours allowed for the output produced. It is also an input cost variance. Similar to the labor rate variance, allocating this variance will increase the cost of production, which can increase the current ratio due to reduced inventory valuation and decrease net income by increasing the cost of goods sold.\n\n**Effects on Current Ratio and Net Income:**\n\n- **Current Ratio:** The current ratio might increase because inventory (a current asset - is written down to reflect the higher cost of goods sold, making current assets relatively larger compared to current liabilities.\n  \n- **Net Income:** Net income will decrease because the cost of goods sold increases, reducing gross profit margins and overall profitability.\n\n**Answer: D. Decreases Decreases**"
