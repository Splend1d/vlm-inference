Consumption is falling but household wealth is rising.\n\nDuring a recession phase of the business cycle, consumption tends to fall as people become less confident in the economy and save more. At the same time, if household wealth is rising, it might be due to factors like an increase in stock market values or appreciation of property values, which can happen even during a recession if certain sectors perform well. However, this statement doesn't necessarily align with typical economic behavior during a downturn, as typically both consumption and wealth would decline. The key point here is that consumption is falling, not that wealth is rising.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe a typical contraction of the business cycle:\nB. Consumption is increasing - This is usually not the case during a recession.\nC. Private investment is rising - Businesses tend to cut back on investment during recessions.\nD. Employment and inflation are low - While unemployment typically rises during a recession, inflation may also rise due to supply shocks or decrease if there's a general slowdown in economic activity."
