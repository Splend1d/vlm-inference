However, since this option is not available in your list, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the formulation of the question or the options provided. Given the typical outcomes of such experiments, the closest correct answer based on common results from similar studies would be:\n\nD. 60\n\nThis is an approximation, as exact percentages can vary depending on specific experimental conditions and interpretations. It's important to note that in these experiments, the percentage of participants who continued to administer shocks up to the highest level varied significantly across different studies and could be influenced by various factors including the instructions given, the presence of authority figures, and the social context."
