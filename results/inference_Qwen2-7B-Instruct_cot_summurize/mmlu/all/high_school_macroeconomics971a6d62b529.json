                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) measures the proportion of additional income that is spent on consumption. When the MPC is larger, a given increase in government spending leads to a larger increase in aggregate demand and, consequently, a greater increase in real output. This is because a larger portion of the extra funds provided by the government gets spent in the economy, stimulating further rounds of spending and production.\n\nTo clarify why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. The marginal propensity to consume being lower would mean that people save more of any additional income they receive, resulting in less immediate spending and a smaller impact on real output.\n\nB. The velocity of money refers to how quickly money changes hands in an economy. It does not directly influence the impact of government spending on real output, especially in the short run, as the focus is on changes in aggregate demand due to spending rather than the speed at which money circulates.\n\nC. If the velocity of money were higher, it could potentially lead to faster economic growth in the long term, but in the context of a short-run impact of government spending, the primary driver is the MPC, which determines how much of the increased government spending translates into increased consumption and thus output."
