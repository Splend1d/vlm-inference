Blackbody radiation curves\n\nPlanck's quantum theory was primarily developed to explain the ultraviolet catastrophe, which was an inconsistency in the predictions of classical physics regarding blackbody radiation. The theory proposed that energy is emitted and absorbed in discrete packets called quanta, leading to the correct description of the blackbody radiation spectrum. This explanation fits with option A.\n\nThe other options ( B, C, and D, involve phenomena that were explained by other theories or developments after Planck's work:\n\nB. Emission spectra of diatomic molecules - This was explained by the quantum mechanical model of the atom, which came later than Planck's work on blackbody radiation.\n\nC. Electron diffraction patterns - This was explained by de Broglie's hypothesis of wave-particle duality and the subsequent development of quantum mechanics, not by Planck's early quantum theory.\n\nD. Temperature dependence of reaction rates - This phenomenon is typically explained through kinetic theory, which deals with the motion of particles in a substance and how temperature affects their kinetic energy and, consequently, the rate of reactions. This theory predates Planck's work on quantum mechanics."
