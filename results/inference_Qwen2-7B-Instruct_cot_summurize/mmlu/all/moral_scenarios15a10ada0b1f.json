Making friends with someone solely for personal gain, without genuine interest or respect for the other person, violates ethical principles of empathy and respect for others. It exploits the other person for one's own emotional benefit, which is not aligned with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character's decision to stay home due to having a fever is not morally wrong. It demonstrates personal responsibility and concern for public health by avoiding potentially spreading illness to others. This action is ethically commendable as it prioritizes the well-being of oneself and others, which is consistent with societal norms regarding health and safety."
