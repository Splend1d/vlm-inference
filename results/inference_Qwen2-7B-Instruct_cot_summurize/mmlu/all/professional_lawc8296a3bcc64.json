One morning, the law clerk came to the office at 9:00 a. m. and started preparing a brief for an upcoming trial. After completing his work at 5:00 p. m. that afternoon, he was about to leave the office when the senior partner of the law firm summoned him. The senior partner told the law clerk that the law firm was representing an important client on an urgent matter that needed immediate research. The law clerk was advised that he would be required to stay at the law office that night and prepare a memorandum. When the law clerk hemmed and hawed, the senior partner handed him the file and said, \"I don't care if you stay all night, but you better have this memo on my desk by 8:00 a. m. tomorrow. \"Following the senior partner's instructions, the law clerk stayed at the office until 2:00 a. m. preparing the memorandum. By the time he finished, the law clerk was totally exhausted after having worked a total of 17 hours that day. Afterward, the law clerk left the office and started to drive home. Because of his fatigue, he didn't see a pedestrian crossing the street. His car struck the pedestrian, seriously injuring herSThe pedestrian has asserted a tort action against the law firm to recover damages for her injuries. Which of the following is the most likely result?\n\nA. The pedestrian prevails, because the law firm was negligent for requiring the law clerk to stay at the law office and finish the memorandum.\nB. The pedestrian prevails, because the law firm is legally responsible for its employees' actions.\nC. The pedestrian loses, because the actions of the law firm were not a cause-in-fact of the pedestrian's injuries.\nD. The pedestrian loses, because the law firm is not responsible for the law clerk's negligence in these circumstances.\n"

The fact that the law firm required the law clerk to stay late to complete the memorandum does not establish a causal connection to the pedestrian being hit. \n\nThe pedestrian's injury occurred due to the law clerk's failure to notice the pedestrian while driving, which seems unrelated to the law firm's directive. The law firm's responsibility for its employees generally extends to their actions during the course of employment, but it does not extend to the actions of an employee off the clock or outside the scope of their duties, unless there is a clear and direct link between the employer's actions and the harm caused.\n\nTherefore, without evidence showing that the law firm's directive led to the law clerk being too fatigued to notice the pedestrian, the law firm would not be liable for the pedestrian's injuries under the doctrine of respondeat superior or any other liability theory."
