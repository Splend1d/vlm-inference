This is because natural selection acts on the genetic variation within populations, and it does so at the level of genes which are grouped together in an individual's genome. The frequencies of genes or genotypes within a population may change over time due to natural selection, but the fundamental unit upon which selection acts is the individual organism's genetic material."
