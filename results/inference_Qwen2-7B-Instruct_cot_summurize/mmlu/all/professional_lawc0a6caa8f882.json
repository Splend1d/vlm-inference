She didn't tell him that she was pregnant, and decided to get an abortion without telling him. Her state had a law requiring her to sign a statement verifying that she had told her husband of her intended abortion. She refused to sign and sued the state to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Is the law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the law did not intrude on the wife's right to privacy because the husband had an equal right to be protected.\nB. No, the law presented only a minimum intrusion and it would not be difficult for married women to obtain their husband's consent.\nC. Yes, it is unconstitutional because a woman has an unqualified right to an abortion on demand.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n"

Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n\nThe undue burden standard comes from the Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992. Under this standard, laws that place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus becomes viable may be unconstitutional if they do not serve compelling state interests and are not narrowly tailored to achieve those interests. The law in question here appears to place an undue burden on the woman's right to choose an abortion by requiring her to involve her husband in the decision-making process, even when she does not wish to do so. This is particularly relevant in cases where there are are escalating marital problems, as it could force the woman to make decisions against her will or delay her ability to access an abortion."
