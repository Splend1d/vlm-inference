Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .\nYou must know that I am not content with the Courtier unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .\nI wish our Courtier to guard against getting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who do not deserve it.\n\u2014From Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, 1528\nWhich of the following skills that Castiglione recommends for a courtier would be valued LEAST by a European gentleman at the end of the twentieth century?\n\nA.

Being strong and attractive\n\nWhile physical prowess and appearance were highly valued in the context of Castiglione's time, societal norms and values had shifted significantly by the late 20th century. The emphasis on physical strength and attractiveness might still hold some relevance in certain contexts ( such as sports or entertainment industries, but they would not be considered paramount criteria for an individual's worth or status in broader society.\n\nIn contrast, the other options listed\u2014expertise with multiple languages, expertise with many kinds of weapons, and ability to write poetry and prose\u2014are still generally seen as valuable skills across various fields in the late 20th century, including diplomacy, literature, education, and cultural appreciation. Moreover, the ability to play musical instruments was also considered important in Castiglione's time and remained relevant into the modern era, although its specific form or emphasis might vary.\n\nTherefore, option B best fits the description of a skill that would be valued least by a European gentleman at the end of the twentieth century, based on the criteria provided by Castiglione."
