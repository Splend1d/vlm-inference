The conqueror might not understand the values, culture, and dynamics of the community they've conquered. This lack of understanding can lead to policies and actions that don't resonate with the local population, potentially causing resentment and resistance over time.\n\nB. Without a deep understanding of the community, the conqueror might not identify the key individuals or resources that are essential to the functioning and cohesion of the community. Failing to recognize these elements could lead to decisions that disrupt the social fabric and undermine the conqueror's own interests.\n\nC. Conversely, the conqueror might not identify the elements or individuals that are not valuable or necessary to the community's stability or prosperity. Removing or disrupting these aspects without considering their impact on the whole can create unintended consequences that weaken the community's support for the conqueror.\n\nIn summary, the self-defeating nature of the conqueror role often stems from a combination of these factors\u2014lack of understanding, misidentification of critical components, and misjudgment of the community's structure and needs."
