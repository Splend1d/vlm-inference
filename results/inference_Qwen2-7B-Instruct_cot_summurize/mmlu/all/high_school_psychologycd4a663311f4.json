However, the use of animals in research can sometimes be necessary for scientific advancements and understanding, even when computers are available for certain types of simulations or data analysis. This does not necessarily mean that institutions should avoid using animals at all costs; rather, it means that they should weigh the necessity of using animals against alternative methods like computer simulations or in vitro testing, and only proceed with animal use when absolutely necessary and ethically justified.\n\nTherefore, while it's important to consider the alternatives before using animals, it may not always be possible or feasible to avoid their use entirely. This is why option C might not be an exception for all public institutions subscribing to ethical guidelines."
