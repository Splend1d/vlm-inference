It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.\nB. Five percent of the students refused to participate in the poll.\nC.

It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.\n\nWhen a poll or survey reports a margin of error, it gives an indication of the potential variability of the results due to sampling. In this case, with a margin of error of 5%, we can infer that if the same poll were conducted multiple times on different samples of the population, 95% of the time the true value would fall within the range of the reported percentage plus or minus the margin of error. For the given poll, that translates to a range from 38% to 48%. Therefore, it's likely that the actual proportion of high school students who fear going to school lies somewhere between these two percentages.\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not accurately describe what a margin of error means:\n\n- Option B incorrectly suggests that 5% of the students refused to participate in the poll, which is not related to the margin of error.\n- Option C misinterprets the margin of error as applying only to the respondents who said they were afraid to go to school, rather than to the entire population.\n- Option D conflates the margin of error with a probability statement about whether the result is in error, when in fact the margin of error reflects uncertainty around the estimate based on sample data."
