Exceptionalism often implies that the United States has unique responsibilities or a special role in the world, which can lead to interventions and policies decisions based on moral principles or global leadership aspirations rather than a strict assessment of the country's own security needs, capabilities, and interests.\n\nThis approach can sometimes result in overcommitment to global issues or conflicts that may not be in the most direct self-interest of the U.S., potentially at the expense of addressing more pressing domestic or regional security concerns. Realists argue that states should act in ways that maximize their own security and power, and exceptionalist policies might distract from this core principle by focusing on broader ideological goals."
