The Federal Open Market Committee (is part of the Federal Reserve System. \n\nThe FOMC, which typically meets eight times a year, plays a crucial role in setting monetary policy by influencing the supply of money and credit within an economy. This is done primarily through adjusting the federal funds rate and conducting open market operations, such as buying or selling government securities.\n\nA. It does not advise the President of the United States on monetary policy; rather, it operates independently under the guidance of the Federal Reserve Board. However, its decisions can influence the broader economic policies landscape.\n\nC. The Federal Open Market Committee does not have exactly seven members; it consists of 12 members: seven members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and five of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents, with the president of the New York Fed always being a permanent member.\n\nD. Promoting free trade is not within the purview of the Federal Open Market Committee. Its focus is on monetary policy and its impact on the economy, including inflation, employment, and economic growth."
