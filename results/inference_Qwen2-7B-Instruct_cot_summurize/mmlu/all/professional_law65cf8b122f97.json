Although the agreement worked well at 1,000 watches per month, the manufacturer expanded its plant capacity and produced 2500 watches per month. The wholesaler could no longer pay for that volume of watches. The manufacturer sued the wholesaler to compel it to buy its full output each month as required by the contract. will the court likely grant the manufacturer's request?\n\nA. No, because the expansion is a disproportionate increase in product that exceeds contractual estimates and cannot be handled by the buyer.\nB. Yes, because doubling the size of the output contract is not unreasonable and is only 500 more the top estimated limit.\nC. Yes, a doubling of the output contract in these circumstances meets a good faith standard and is reasonable.\nD. No, because a change of more than 10% is considered to be unreasonable and the basis for a breach of contract.\n"

No, because the expansion is a disproportionate increase in product that exceeds contractual estimates and cannot be handled by the buyer.\n\nThe court would likely consider the original agreement where the wholesaler was contracted to purchase between 1000 to 1500 watches per month. The manufacturer significantly increased production to 2500 watches per month without renegotiating the contract terms with the wholesaler. This expansion exceeds the contractual limits and may not be feasible or manageable for the wholesaler, especially if they had relied on their purchasing capacity based on the original agreement. The sudden and substantial increase in production volume can be seen as a breach of the good faith and fair dealing expected under contract law, leading the court to deny the manufacturer's request to compel the wholesaler to purchase the full output."
