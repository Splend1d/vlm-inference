The estimated strength of the association between an exposure and the outcome: This involves statistical measures such as relative risk or odds ratio to quantify how much more likely an outcome is to occur in individuals exposed to a certain factor compared to those not exposed.\n\nB. Evidence that the exposure of interest has appeared before the outcome: This temporal precedence is one of the criteria for causality known as the \"temporality principle.\" It suggests that for an exposure to be a cause of an outcome, the exposure must precede the outcome in time.\n\nC. Evidence showing that reductions in the exposure level will reverse the risk of the outcome: This is often referred to as the \"specificity\" criterion for causality. It indicates that if the risk of the outcome decreases when the exposure is reduced, it provides additional support for the causal relationship.\n\nTherefore, all these options are considered by epidemiologists when assessing the evidence for possible causes of a health outcome."
