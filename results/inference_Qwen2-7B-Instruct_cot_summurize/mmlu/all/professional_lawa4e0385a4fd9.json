These statements are generally considered reliable because they are made spontaneously and without time for deliberate fabrication. However, this exception has limitations. If the statement appears to have been the result of reflection or deliberation rather than immediate emotional response, it may not qualify as an excited utterance.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff's statement about remembering his son running into the house and screaming about shattered car windows could potentially be seen as an excited utterance. However, the fact that the son is also available to testify at the trial suggests that the statement might not have been made spontaneously but rather after some reflection or recounting of events. Therefore, the trial judge should likely rule the plaintiff's testimony inadmissible under the excited utterance exception, given the availability of the son as a witness who could provide the same information directly."
