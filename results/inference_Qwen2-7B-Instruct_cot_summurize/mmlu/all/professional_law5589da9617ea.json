When she went into Computer Retailer Inc., the salesperson also sold her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200 for a total price of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for\n\nA. Connie, under the common law because the predominate purpose for which the parties contracted was the sale of goods.\nB. Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.\nC. Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.\nD. Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.\n"

Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.\n\nIn contract law, the intention of the parties at the time of the agreement often dictates whether a contract is primarily for the goods or services provided. In this case, even though the service agreement has a higher monetary value, the court might determine that the primary purpose of the contract was for the laptop itself, especially since the service agreement failed to provide any benefit. Thus, the service agreement might be considered incidental to the main transaction, which would be the sale of the laptop. This would favor the defense of Computer Retailer, unless there were other evidence indicating otherwise."
