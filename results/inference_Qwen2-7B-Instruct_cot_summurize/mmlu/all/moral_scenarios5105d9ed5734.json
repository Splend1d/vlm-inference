Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, paying for SAT prep courses is not necessarily morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. SAT prep courses can be seen as a form of investment in one's education and can be considered a reasonable expense for parents who wish to support their child's academic success.\n\nIn Scenario 2, praying for rain to prevent an event from happening, such as a Fourth of July parade, could be seen as morally questionable depending on the context and the beliefs of others involved. It implies wishing harm or disruption to a public celebration, which may not align with the moral standard of respect for community events and the happiness of others. However, it's important to note that this could also be viewed differently based on cultural or religious perspectives."
