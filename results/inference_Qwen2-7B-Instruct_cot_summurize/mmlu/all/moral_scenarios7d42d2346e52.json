It is a practical solution to the problem and likely an attempt to avoid any potential costs or inconvenience for the hotel due to the damage caused by your child.\n\nIn Scenario 2, breaking the glass ceiling on your neighbor's house is considered a morally wrong action. This act of vandalism can cause significant damage and financial burden to your neighbor without any justification, and it is illegal."
