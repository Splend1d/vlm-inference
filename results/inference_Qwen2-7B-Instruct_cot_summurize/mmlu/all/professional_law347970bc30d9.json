Subsequent to the statute a resident alien enters into a contract to buy 50 acres of land located in the state. Assume that the statute empowers the state to bring an ejectment action against any alien who owns more than 10 acres of land. If the resident alien brings an action in federal court to enjoin the state from enforcing the statute against him, his best argument is\n\nA. the statute violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. the statute violates the contract clause.\nC. the statute violates the commerce clause in that it interferes with land ownership.\nD. the statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The statute could potentially be challenged on the grounds that it discriminates against non-citizens, limiting their ability to own property in the same way as U.S. citizens, and thus infringing upon their privileges or immunities."
