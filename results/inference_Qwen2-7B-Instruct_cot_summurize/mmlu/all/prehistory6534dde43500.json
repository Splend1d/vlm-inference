One of the most common practices they engaged in was animal sacrifice. However, there is no specific historical evidence suggesting that they sacrificed adults or children, as these practices were more commonly associated with other ancient civilizations, such as the Aztecs or the Phoenicians.\n\nInstead, archaeological findings and depictions in art suggest that the Minoans performed animal sacrifices, particularly those involving bulls, which were considered sacred animals. They would also engage in rituals such as libations ( (pouring liquids like wine onto the ground as an offering), votive offerings ( (items given to a deity in exchange for a favor or protection), and possibly even human sacrifices less frequently, but not necessarily involving adults or children exclusively.\n\nTherefore, among the provided options, none directly corresponds to what is known about Minoan practices. However, if we must choose the closest option, it might be interpreted that the Minoans \"sacrificed\" in a broad sense, which could include animal sacrifices, libations, and other offerings, rather than specifically individuals. The question seems to imply a more direct form of sacrifice, such as human sacrifice, which was not a prominent feature of Minoan religious practices as evidenced by contemporary sources."
