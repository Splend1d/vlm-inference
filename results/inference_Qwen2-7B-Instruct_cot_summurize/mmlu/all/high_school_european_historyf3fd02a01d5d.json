The primary goal of these resolutions was to suppress nationalist and liberal movements that threatened the existing monarchical systems and the political status quo.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Suppress all nationalist revolutions across the continent.\n\nThe Carlsbad Resolutions sought to limit freedom of speech and press, particularly in publications that could potentially incite nationalist sentiments or criticize the governments. The decree stated that no publication should go to press without prior knowledge and approval from state officials, and it held each state responsible for publications under its supervision that might infringe on the honor or security of other states or attack their constitutions or administrations. This was an attempt to prevent the spread of revolutionary ideas and maintain the power and unity of the monarchical states within the German Confederation."
