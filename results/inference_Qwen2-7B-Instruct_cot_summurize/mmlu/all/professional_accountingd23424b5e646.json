Management is responsible for making all financial records and related information available to us.\n\nAn auditor's engagement letter typically outlines the responsibilities of both the auditor and the client (management. It includes statements about what management needs to do to prepare for the audit, such as providing access to necessary financial records and information. Therefore, statement D accurately reflects this responsibility.\n\nExplanation of other options:\n\nA. This statement is not typical for an auditor's engagement letter because it shifts the responsibility of reporting inadequate provisions for safeguarding assets from management to the auditor. The auditor is expected to identify risks and suggest improvements but not to report on management's responsibility regarding asset protection.\n\nB. While the auditor does need to identify internal controls relevant to specific assertions, the engagement letter usually doesn't specify this detail since it depends on the nature and scope of the audit. The letter might mention that the auditor will assess controls and their effectiveness, but it wouldn't typically outline which assertions they are assessing.\n\nC. This statement places too much responsibility on the auditor to correct deficiencies in internal control activities. The auditor identifies issues and provides recommendations, but it is ultimately management's responsibility to implement changes and correct deficiencies in internal controls."
