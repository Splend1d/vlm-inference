This statement is not correct about economies of scale. \n\nEconomies of scale refer to the phenomenon where a company's average total costs decrease as its scale of production increases. This happens because larger-scale operations can spread fixed costs over more units of output, leading to lower average costs. The average total cost curve typically shows a declining trend as output increases, reaching its minimum point, and then starts to rise due to diseconomies of scale. Therefore, economies of scale are associated with the declining or decreasing portions of the ATC curve, not the rising or increasing portions."
