                    "text": "To maintain equilibrium when the mass of object A is halved, we need to ensure that the gravitational force and the electrostatic force remain balanced.\n\nGiven:\n- Objects A and B have equal charge (q and equal mass m.\n- Gravitational force \\(F_g = \\frac{Gm^2}{r^2}\\) where G is the gravitational constant, and r is the distance between the centers of A and B.\n- Electrostatic force \\(F_e = \\frac{kq^2}{r^2}\\) where k is Coulomb's constant.\n\nInitial condition for equilibrium: \\(F_g = F_e\\)\n\nWhen the mass of object A (ma becomes half of its original value, we have:\n\n\\[F_g' = \\frac{G(m/2)^2}{r^2} = \\frac{Gm^2}{4r^2}\\]\n\nFor equilibrium to be maintained after halving the mass of A, the new electrostatic force must match this new gravitational force:\n\n\\[F_e' = \\frac{kq^2}{r^2}\\]\n\nWe want \\(F_g' = F_e'\\), so:\n\n\\[\\frac{Gm^2}{4r^2} = \\frac{kq^2}{r^2}\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[kq^2 = \\frac{Gm^2}{4}\\]\n\nNow, we want to find what needs to happen to the charges or masses of B to maintain equilibrium. Let the new charge on A be q' and on B be qb. The new gravitational force equation considering the mass of A has been halved:\n\n\\[F_g'' = \\frac{G(m/2)^2}{r^2} = \\frac{Gm^2}{4r^2}\\]\n\nFor equilibrium, the new electrostatic force should be:\n\n\\[F_e'' = \\frac{kq'b^2}{r^2}\\]\n\nWe know from our previous calculation that:\n\n\\[kq^2 = \\frac{Gm^2}{4}\\]\n\nSo, to maintain equilibrium with the new gravitational force:\n\n\\[kq'b^2 = \\frac{Gm^2}{4}\\]\n\nSince \\(kq^2 = \\frac{Gm^2}{4}\\), we can replace \\(\\frac{Gm^2}{4}\\) with \\(kq^2\\) in our equation, leading us to:\n\n\\[kq'b^2 = kq^2\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(kq^2\\) gives:\n\n\\[\\frac{q'}{q} = \\frac{b^2}{q^2}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(q'\\):\n\n\\[q' = q \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2}{q^2}} = bq\\]\n\nThis means the charge on object A must be multiplied by the square root of the ratio of the new mass to the original mass. However, since we're comparing the effect on maintaining equilibrium, and knowing the original condition of equal mass and charge, we aim to directly correlate the change in one variable to maintain equilibrium.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Doubling the charge on A would increase the electrostatic force beyond what is required to balance the reduced gravitational force.\nB. Halving the charge on B would decrease the electrostatic force, thus not balancing the reduced gravitational force.\nC. Doubling the charge on B would increase the electrostatic force proportionallyately to the reduction in gravitational force due to halving the mass of A, thus maintaining equilibrium.\nD. Halving the mass of B does not directly impact the electrostatic force in a way that compensates for the reduced gravitational force of A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. the charge on Object B was doubled**."
