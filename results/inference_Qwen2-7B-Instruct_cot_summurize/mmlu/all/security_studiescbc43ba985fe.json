Deployment of troops in the Persian Gulf: This is a manifestation of US efforts to secure its strategic interests in the region, particularly with regard to access to oil resources. The presence of military forces helps to maintain stability and deter potential threats to US oil supply chains.\n\nC. Asserting primacy vis-\u00e0-vis friendly and rival powers: The US seeks to maintain influence over key oil-producing nations and regionsally powerful states to ensure a stable and predictable energy market. This can involve diplomatic, economic, or military means to support friendly governments or to counterbalance rivals that might destabilize the region.\n\nD. Active efforts to stabilize oil-rich friendly political actors: The US often supports regimes or policies changes that align with its strategic and economic interests, such as those that promote stability and predictability in oil production and exports. This can include providing economic aid, defense assistance, or engaging in direct negotiations to secure favorable terms for energy trade.\n\nIn summary, the US strategy for energy security is multifaceted, involving military presence, diplomatic influence, economic incentives, and political support aimed at securing stable and reliable sources of energy, particularly oil, from key regions like the Middle East."
