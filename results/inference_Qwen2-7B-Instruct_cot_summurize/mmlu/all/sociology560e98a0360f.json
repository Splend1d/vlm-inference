This trend can be attributed to several factors, one of which is the increase in the average age of marriage and the delay in childbearing. As societies progress economically and educationally, individuals tend to prioritize their careers, higher education, and personal development before starting a family. This leads to later marriages and delayed childbearing, which in turn affects the fertility rate.\n\nWhile option B ( \"there being fewer women of childbearing age than there were in the first half of the century\" could also contribute to changes in fertility rates due to population dynamics, it does not specifically explain the observed trend between 1964 and 2000.\n\nOption C, \"errors in the measurement of birth rates and production of statistics,\" is not a plausible explanation for the decline in the general fertility rate, as statistical methodologies have generally improved over time.\n\nOption D, \"the risk of diseases caused by poverty, poor housing, and bad sanitation,\" might influence fertility indirectly by affecting overall health and reproductive outcomes, but it does not directly explain the observed decline in the general fertility rate during that specific period.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is A: increases in the age of marriage and the age at which childbearing begins."
