According to the formula for electrical resistance, R = \u03c1L/A, where R is resistance, \u03c1 is resistivity, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area, if the area A changes, the resistance R will also change. However, this does not directly affect the reluctance of the conductor, which is related to the magnetic flux linkage and permeability of the material, not its cross-sectional area. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
