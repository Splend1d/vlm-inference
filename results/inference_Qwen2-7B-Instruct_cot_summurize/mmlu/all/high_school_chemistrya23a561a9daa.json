Electronegativity generally increases across a period from left to right in the periodic table and decreases down a group from top to bottom. Tungsten is located in the 6th period and the 6th group ( or VA, and has a high atomic number (74, which means it has a strong nuclear charge that attracts electrons effectively. Therefore, it tends to pull electrons strongly towards itself when forming bonds."
