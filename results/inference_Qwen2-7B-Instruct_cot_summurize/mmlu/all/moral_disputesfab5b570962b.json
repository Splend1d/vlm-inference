The \"egalitarian\" objection to this position raises the concern that such exclusions might unfairly discriminate against individuals seeking to participate in the economic, social, or cultural life of a particular state, which could be detrimental to their well-being and opportunities for development.\n\nFine likely finds Wellman's response insufficient because it does not adequately address the potential harm caused by exclusionary policies to those who are specifically interested in pursuing opportunities within the state's territory. This harm could manifest in various forms, including economic disadvantages, loss of educational opportunities, and barriers to accessing essential services or resources. By excluding individuals based on factors unrelated to criminality, health risks, or other legitimate grounds for exclusion, states might inadvertently perpetuate inequalities and deny people the chance to improve their lives through engagement with the state's institutions and economy.\n\nTherefore, option C highlights the core issue that Fine might argue: the potential for exclusionary policies to cause real and significant harm to individuals who are seeking to engage with a state's society, contradicting the egalitarian principle of equal opportunity and treatment."
