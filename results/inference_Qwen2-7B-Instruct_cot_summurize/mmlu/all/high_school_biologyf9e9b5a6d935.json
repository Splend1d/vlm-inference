                    "text": "The exception among these statements supporting the endosymbiotic theory is C. \"Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.\" \n\nThe endosymbiotic theory posits that mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are organelles found in eukaryotic cells, were once free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed by a larger cell (a process known as endocytosis. Over time, these engulfed cells evolved into organelles due to a mutualistic relationship with their host cell. A key aspect of this theory is that mitochondria and chloroplasts depend on the host cell for some aspects of their survival, such as being enclosed within a membrane derived from the host's endoplasmic reticulum and requiring the host cell for protein synthesis and transport.\n\nOptions A, B, and D all align with features expected under the endosymbiotic theory:\n\n- A. Mitochondria and chloroplasts dividing independently of the host cell through binary fission implies they have the ability to replicate outside the host's cell cycle, a characteristic of independent organisms.\n- B. The similarity of ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts to those of bacteria suggests a common bacterial origin, as bacterial ribosomes are structurally distinct from those in eukaryotic cells.\n- D. Having a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins is also typical of bacterial cells, indicating a possible bacterial ancestry for these organelles.\n\nIn contrast, option C contradicts the fundamental concept of the endosymbiotic theory, which relies on the interdependence between mitochondria/chloroplasts and their host cell."
