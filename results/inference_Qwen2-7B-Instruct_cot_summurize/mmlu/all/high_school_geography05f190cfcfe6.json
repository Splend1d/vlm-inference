These can include things like better job opportunities, improved living standards, safety, better education, and more favorable climates. \n\nOn the other hand, overcrowding is typically seen as a push factor. It refers to the situation where there is an excessive population density in a particular area, which can lead to problems such as poor housing, limited resources, high crime rates, and strain on public services. People may move away from overcrowded areas in search of better living conditions."
