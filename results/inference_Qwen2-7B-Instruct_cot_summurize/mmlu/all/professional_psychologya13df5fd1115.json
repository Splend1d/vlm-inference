A cross-sequential cohort design\n\nThis type of study involves multiple cohorts, each with different ages at the start of the study, which allows researchers to observe changes over time and across age groups. In this case, the cohorts are based on age (12, 13, and 14-year-olds, and they are also classified based on exposure to parental alcoholism. \n\nThe \"cross-sequential\" part refers to the fact that it combines cross-sectional ( (comparing different age groups at one point in time) and longitudinal ( (tracking the same individuals over time) elements. \n\nOptions A, C, and D refer to different types of research designs:\nA. A true experiment typically involves random assignment to treatment or control groups, which isn't mentioned in your scenario.\nC. A natural experiment would involve naturally occurring variation without intervention by the researcher, which doesn't seem to be the case here since the researcher is actively recruiting participants based on specific criteria.\nD. A cross-sectional cohort design typically involves comparing different age groups at a single point in time, but does not track the same individuals over time, which is not what's happening in this scenario."
