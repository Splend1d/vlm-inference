There is no indication that this action is harmful or neglectful.\n\nScenario 2: Greeting one's spouse with affection, such as a kiss, when they aren't expecting it, is typically viewed as a loving gesture within a relationship. It is not generally considered morally wrong unless it leads to discomfort or distress for the recipient, which is not indicated in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves an action that would be considered clearly morally wrong under the given circumstances."
