Violation of the statute was a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine and up to 30 days in jail. After the statute's enactment, a defendant sold a pack of cigarettes to a girl who was 17 years of age. Before selling the product to the girl, the defendant carefully examined the girl's driver's license, which indicated that she was, in fact, 17 years old. The defendant nevertheless made the sale because he erroneously believed the age of majority to be 17. The defendant is subsequently charged with violation of the statute, and his mistake is honestly held to have been made. Such a mistake should\n\nA. not prevent his conviction, because mistake of the law is no defense.\nB. not prevent his conviction, because the crime imposes absolute criminal liability.\nC. result in his acquittal, because he took reasonable steps to ascertain the girl's age.\nD. result in his acquittal, because he did not possess the requisite mens rea.\n"

In this case, the defendant believed that the age of majority (the legal age at which one can engage in certain activities such as buying cigarettes, alcohol, etc. without parental consent - was 17. However, due to an honest mistake, they were unaware that the actual legal age might be higher. \n\nGiven that the defendant acted in good faith and based on their mistaken belief about the law, they likely did not have the requisite intent to violate the law. Therefore, under the principle of mens rea, they cannot be convicted for a crime they did not intend to commit. It's important to note that this analysis assumes that the mistake was honestly held and reasonable under the circumstances, which is typically necessary for a mistake of law defense to apply. However, this answer assumes that such a defense may be available under the circumstances described, despite the general rule that mistake of law is generally not a defense.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly states that such a mistake should result in acquittal because the defendant lacked the necessary criminal intent."
