Here's how they fit into each of your options:\n\nA. If a patient has semi-formed or liquid output, this generally refers to normal bowel movements. Closed pouches are not specifically designed for these as they would likely use a standard, disposable or reusable collection bag.\n\nB. A colostomy involves creating an opening from the colon to the abdominal wall. The purpose is to divert fecal matter away from the diseased area of the intestine. Closed pouches are indeed used in such cases to manage and collect the waste.\n\nC. In the immediate post-operative period, closed pouches might be used, especially if the patient has undergone surgery involving an ostomy ( such as a colostomy, urostomy, or jejunostomy. During recovery, the closed system helps in managing the flow of bodily waste, reducing risk of infection, and aiding in the healing process.\n\nD. A urostomy involves creating an opening from the bladder to the abdominal wall, allowing urine to bypass the diseased or damaged part of the urinary tract. Closed pouches are commonly used with a urostomy to collect urine effectively and safely.\n\nSo, while all of these options could involve the use of closed pouches, option B ( \"The patient has a colostomy\" is the most direct application scenario provided in your list."
