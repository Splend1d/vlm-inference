Assessing a client's ability to establish effective internal controls.\n\nWhile it is important for CPAs to consider a client's internal controls when performing audits, reviews, or other attest services, the direct assessment of a client's internal controls is more closely related to specific audit procedures rather than being a primary component of a firm's overall quality control system. Quality control systems generally focus on areas such as acceptance and continuance of client relationships, personnel selection and development, monitoring compliance with standards, and ensuring independence and objectivity.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are listed are more directly associated with elements of a CPA firm's quality control system that help ensure the quality and integrity of the services provided to clients."
