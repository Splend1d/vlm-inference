This action is generally considered morally wrong as it involves deception and unauthorized use of someone else's property for personal gain, especially when it affects the well-being of another person.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character did not get an office job because they did not perform well during the interview process. This outcome is not morally wrong as it is a result of the individual's performance relative to other candidates, not any unethical behavior on their part. It is a common occurrence in professional settings where decisions are based on merit and qualifications."
