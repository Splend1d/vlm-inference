Since it's the life of the author plus 50 years, and assuming the author's life is not given but typically considered to be around 70-100 years (:\n\n\\[ \\text{Useful Life} = \\text{Author's Life} + 50 \\]\n\nFor simplicity, let's consider the maximum life span (100 years:\n\\[ \\text{Useful Life} = 100 + 50 = 150 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nHowever, Corbet expects to sell the book for only five years. So, the amortization period based on sales would be more relevant here, not the legal life.\n\nThe amortization expense per year would then be the cost of the copyright divided by the number of years it is expected to be sold:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ammortization Expense per Year} = \\frac{\\$20,000}{5 \\text{ years}} = \\$4,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $4000."
