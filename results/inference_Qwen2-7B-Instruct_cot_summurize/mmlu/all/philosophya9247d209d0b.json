However, unlike Jeremy Bentham's earlier version of utilitarianism which was primarily act-utilitarian ( focusing on the utility of each individual act, Mill developed a more nuanced view.\n\nMill's utilitarianism can be characterized as a form of rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules, making option C the closest match. He introduced the concept of \"higher\" and \"lower\" pleasures, suggesting that some forms of pleasure contribute more to the development of human virtues and intellect than others. This implies that individuals should follow rules that generally promote these higher pleasures over the long term, even if some particular actions might not yield the highest immediate utility.\n\nTherefore, according to Brandt, Mill's view most closely resembles option C: a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules."
