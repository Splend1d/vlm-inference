These factors play a significant role in determining psychological and social differences among individuals. For example, certain personality traits or predispositions towards certain behaviors might be influenced by one's genetics.\n\nNurture, on the other hand, encompasses the environmental, cultural, and experiential factors that shape an individual. This includes upbringing, education, social interactions, and experiences throughout life. These factors tend to have a larger impact on psychological and social differences between individuals. For instance, how someone learns to interact with others, their values, beliefs, and attitudes are largely shaped by their environment and experiences. \n\nTherefore, nature influences more the structural and anatomical aspects of differences ( like physical attributes, while nurture has a greater influence on psychological and social differences such as behavior, personality, and cognitive abilities."
