Let's analyze each premise and option step by step:\n\nPremises:\n1. \\(U \\supset W\\)\n2. \\(W \\supset ( X \\equiv \\sim Y)\\)\n3. \\((X \\equiv \\sim Y) \\supset Z\\)\n\nOptions:\nA. \\(U \\supset Z\\)\nB. \\(U \\vee W\\)\nC. \\(\\sim W\\)\nD. \\(\\sim(X \\equiv \\sim Y)\\)\n\nFirst, let's examine the options using the given premises.\n\nOption A: \\(U \\supset Z\\)\n\nWe can try to derive this directly from the premises. However, without applying any logical equivalences or inference rules, it's not immediately clear how to get from the premises to \\(U \\supset Z\\) with just one step.\n\nOption B: \\(U \\vee W\\)\n\nThis proposition can be derived from the first premise \\(U \\supset W\\) using the logical equivalence known as \"Material Implication\" which states that \\(P \\supset Q\\) is logically equivalent to \\(\\sim P \\vee Q\\). Applying this to the first premise gives us \\(\\sim U \\vee W\\), which is logically equivalent to \\(U \\vee W\\) since disjunction is commutative (\\(A \\vee B = B \\vee A\\)). So, this option is correct based on the first premise alone.\n\nOption C: \\(\\sim W\\)\n\nThis cannot be directly inferred from the given premises because there is no information about \\(\\sim W\\) being directly connected to the other premises.\n\nOption D: \\(\\sim(X \\equiv \\sim Y)\\)\n\nThis is the negation of the third premise, which would imply that if \\(X \\equiv \\sim Y\\) were true, then \\(Z\\) must also be true. The negation of this statement doesn't directly follow from the given premises without additional steps or rules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Option B** (\\(U \\vee W\\)), as it is a direct consequence of the first premise \\(U \\supset W\\) without requiring any additional steps or logical equivalences beyond recognizing the material implication rule."
