This statement is not accurate because AP does not necessarily rise when MP is above it; it can also decrease if MP decreases too quickly, even though it was initially above AP. Similarly, AP does not fall solely because MP is below it; it can continue to rise if MP increases sufficiently.\n\nB. This statement accurately describes the relationship between AP and MP. When MP is at its highest point, it intersects AP. This happens because as long as MP is increasing, AP will be rising (since AP is the total output per unit of labor, which includes the contribution from the last unit of labor (MP. However, once MP starts to decrease, AP will start to fall because the decrease in MP outweighs the contributions from previous units of labor.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect because AP and MP do not have a constant parallel relationship. They intersect at some point, and their slopes (rates of change - differ throughout their entire relationship.\n\nD. This statement is also incorrect. AP and MP do not necessarily move in the same direction at all levels of labor. For example, during the initial stages of production, when MP is rising, AP is also rising. But as MP starts to fall, AP will eventually start to fall as well, even though MP is still positive.\n\nTherefore, the only accurate statement regarding the relationship between AP and MP of labor is that they intersect at the maximum point of MP ( (Option B)."
