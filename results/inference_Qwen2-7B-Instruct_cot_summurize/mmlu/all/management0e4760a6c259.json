Conflict can be resolved easily using face-to-face meetings.\n\nWhile face-to-face meetings can certainly help resolve conflicts more effectively than purely digital communication, the statement implies that virtual teams cannot resolve conflicts as easily, which is not accurate. Virtual teams often use various tools and methods to manage and resolve conflicts effectively, such as video conferencing, collaborative platforms, and structured conflict resolution processes. The main disadvantage of virtual teams in this context is that they might require additional efforts and strategies to maintain open communication and ensure all team members feel heard and understood, especially when it comes to sensitive or complex issues."
