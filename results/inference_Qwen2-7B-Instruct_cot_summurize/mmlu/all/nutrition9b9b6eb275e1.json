Nutrient-dense foods are those that provide vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients without adding many calories. This type of diet can help older adults maintain good health, support their body's functions, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. It includes foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. \n\nWhile it's important for older adults to meet their energy needs, simply consuming a high energy content diet does not guarantee optimal nutrition. It's also generally not recommended to take daily antioxidant supplements without medical advice, as they might interfere with certain medications or have adverse effects on health. The best approach is usually to focus on a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients."
