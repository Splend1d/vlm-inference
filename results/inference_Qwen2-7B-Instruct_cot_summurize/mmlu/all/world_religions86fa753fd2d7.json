All of the above\n\nThe Gospel of John is closely associated with all three theological concepts:\n\nA. **Incarnation**: This concept refers to the belief that Jesus Christ, being God, became human in order to save humanity from sin. The Gospel of John emphasizes this idea through various narratives and teachings, particularly in chapters like 1:1-14, where the Logos ( or Word of God, becomes flesh.\n\nB. **Logos of God**: The term \"Logos\" is central to the Gospel of John, appearing in the opening verses (John 1:1-18). It refers to the divine expression or wisdom of God who was with God at the beginning and through whom all things were made. The Logos, personified as Jesus, becomes flesh and dwells among us, bringing light to those in darkness and revealing God's will and character.\n\nC. **Jesus as Messiah and Saviour**: Throughout the Gospel, John presents Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah (the anointed one) and saviour who fulfills the promises of the Old Testament. He performs miracles, teaches with authority, and ultimately dies on the cross for the sins of humanity, rising from the dead to offer eternal life to those who believe in him.\n\nThus, the Gospel of John is deeply rooted in these theological concepts, providing a rich theological framework for understanding the nature of God, the role of Jesus, and the hope for salvation offered through faith in Christ."
