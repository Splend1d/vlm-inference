                    "text": "The process of allopatric speciation is best summarized by option D: \"geographic isolation \u2192 reproductive isolation \u2192 differential changes in allele frequencies \u2192 reproductive barriers \u2192 new species.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Geographic Isolation**: This refers to the physical separation of a population into distinct groups, often due to geographical features such as mountains, rivers, or oceans. These barriers prevent individuals from interacting and potentially interbreeding.\n\n2. **Reproductive Isolation**: As populations remain geographically isolated, they evolve independently. Over time, genetic differences accumulate between the populations, leading to reproductive isolation. This means that even if the two populations were to come back into contact, individuals from each group would no longer be able to produce fertile offspring.\n\n3. **Differential Changes in Allele Frequencies**: Due to their independent evolution, the genetic makeup (or gene pool) of the separated populations starts to diverge. Certain alleles ( versions of genes - become more common in one population while becoming less common in another.\n\n4. **Reproductive Barriers**: The genetic differences lead to further reproductive isolation, creating strong barriers that prevent any exchange of genetic material between the populations. This could manifest in various ways, such as differences in mating behaviors, habitat preferences, or physiological incompatibilities.\n\n5. **New Species**: Once these barriers are firmly established and the populations have evolved to the point where they can no longer interbreed, they are considered separate species.\n\nSo, the correct sequence that best captures allopatric speciation is: **geographic isolation** leads to **reproductive isolation**, which then results in **differential changes in allele frequencies**, eventually forming **reproductive barriers** that culminate in the formation of **new species**."
