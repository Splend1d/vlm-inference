When the audience is convinced via the speech act or the securitizing actor but fail to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat.\n\nSecuritization is a political process through which a conventional issue is presented as an existential threat and thus requiring emergency powers and extraordinary measures. This process involves three main elements: the issue, the speech act (which is when the issue is framed as an existential threat by the securitizing actor, and the audience's response. If the audience is convinced by the securitizing actor's argumentation but does not grant the necessary special rights for extraordinary measures, the issue might fail to become securitized. This could be due to various reasons such as lack of trust in the securitizing actor, alternative interpretations of the issue, or the audience's belief that normal political procedures are sufficient to handle the issue."
