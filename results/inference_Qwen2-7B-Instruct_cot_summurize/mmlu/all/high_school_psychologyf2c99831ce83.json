                    "text": "When universal screening data indicate that a significant number of students are not meeting school competencies, it is important to address the issue systematically to ensure all students receive the support they need to succeed. Here's a breakdown of each option:\n\nA. **Changes must be made in the delivery of the core program.** This might involve revisiting instructional methods, curriculum content, or pacing to better meet the needs of the students. It could also mean integrating more differentiated instruction strategies to cater to diverse learning styles and paces.\n\nB. **Students who are not meeting competencies must be given strategic or supplemental instruction.** Providing targeted interventions can help students who are struggling to catch up with their peers. This could include small group instruction, tutoring, or additional practice sessions tailored to the specific areas where the student is having difficulty.\n\nC. **Students must be given more time to develop competencies.** Sometimes, students require more time and patience to master skills. This option suggests extending the time frame for achieving competencies, which can be beneficial for those who need extra support or for whom the material is challenging due to various reasons like lack of prior knowledge or difficulties in understanding.\n\nD. **Students who are not meeting competencies must be evaluated for learning disabilities.** This step involves assessing whether the student's difficulties are due to underlying learning disabilities rather than a lack of effort or poor teaching. Early identification and appropriate accommodations or interventions can make a significant difference in supporting these students effectively.\n\n**Best Answer:** The most comprehensive approach would likely involve a combination of options A, B, and D. Making changes to the core program ensures that the system is supportive for all students, providing strategic or supplemental instruction directly addresses the needs of those who are struggling, and evaluating for learning disabilities ensures that any underlying issues are identified and addressed promptly. Each of these steps plays a crucial role in creating an inclusive and effective educational environment."
