In Group I, each rat was raised in isolation with no toys, while in Group II, rats were divided into small groups and given toys to play with. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the probable findings of this study?\n\nA. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh more than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nB. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh less than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nC. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will not be noticeably different from the brains of the rats raised in Group II.\nD. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will consist of more white matter, while the brains of the rats raised in Group II will consist of more gray matter.\n"

The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh less than those of the rats raised in Group II.\n\nThis is because social interaction and environmental stimulation are crucial for proper brain development. Rats raised in isolation (Group I - lack these stimuli, which might lead to underdevelopment or atrophy of certain brain regions like the prefrontal cortex, typically associated with cognitive functions. On the other hand, rats in Group II, being provided with social interactions and toys, may experience enhanced brain growth and development due to the stimulation of various neural pathways. Therefore, it's likely that the forebrains of rats in Group II would weigh more compared to those in Group I."
