His work, \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,\" published in 1936, argued against the classical economic view that the economy would naturally return to full employment over time. Instead, Keynes suggested that government intervention through fiscal policy could stimulate demand and counteract economic downturns. This theory has had a significant impact on modern economic policy."
