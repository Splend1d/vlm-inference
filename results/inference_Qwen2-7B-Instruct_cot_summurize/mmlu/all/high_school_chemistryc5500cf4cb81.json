Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.\n\nIn the formation of a solution, steps 1 and 2 involve the breaking of intermolecular bonds within both the solvent and solute molecules (this requires energy, making these processes endothermic. \n\nStep 3 involves the formation of new intermolecular bonds between the solvent and solute molecules, which releases energy, making this process exothermic. \n\nTherefore, the overall energy change depends on the balance between the energy required for the separation of molecules (steps 1 and 2, and the energy released when they come together in the solution - step 3. This balance determines whether the overall process is exothermic or endothermic. In many cases, especially with strong solvents and solutes, the energy released during step 3 can outweigh the energy absorbed during steps 1 and 2, resulting in an overall exothermic reaction."
