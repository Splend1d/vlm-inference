State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nThe Supreme Court has indeed balanced the Establishment Clause (which prohibits the government from establishing a religion or favoring one religion over another) and the Free Exercise Clause ( which protects the practice of religion from government interference) in several rulings. \n\nOption D reflects this balance: it prohibits official state-sponsored prayer in schools, thus respecting the Establishment Clause's prohibition on government endorsement of religion. However, it allows for voluntary prayer by student groups before school, which respects the Free Exercise Clause by permitting religious practices as long as they are not sponsored or endorsed by the state."
