Amount of fertilizer produced in the country\n\nWhile the amount of fertilizer produced in a country can affect agricultural practices and yields, it is not necessarily an environmental factor that directly influences agriculture. Environmental factors typically refer to natural conditions that impact agriculture, such as climate ( (number of frost-free days per year and availability/reliability of sufficient rainfall), soil quality, and access to water resources. The production of fertilizers is more related to agricultural technology and human infrastructure rather than a direct environmental condition."
