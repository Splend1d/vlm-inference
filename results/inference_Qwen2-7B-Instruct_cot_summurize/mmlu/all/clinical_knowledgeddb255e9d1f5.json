It works to dilate the airways quickly, allowing better deposition of other medications.\n\nShort-acting bronchodilators, typically albuterol or levalbuterol, work rapidly to open up the airways (bronchodilation) and relieve symptoms of asthma and COPD. Taking these medications first ensures that the airways are already relaxed, which can enhance the effectiveness of subsequent inhaled medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids that might also be prescribed for long-term management. This is because the bronchodilation provides an optimal environment for these medications to reach their target sites within the lungs more efficiently."
