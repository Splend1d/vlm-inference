This means it cannot have any roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) and cannot be factored into non-trivial polynomials with coefficients in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\n2. **Degree**: Since we're dealing with a cubic polynomial, if it's irreducible, then the quotient ring will indeed be a field because the degree of the polynomial is equal to the dimension of the quotient space as a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), ensuring that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nLet's check each option for \\(c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\) to see if the polynomial \\(x^3 + x^2 + c\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\n### For \\(c = 0\\):\n\\[x^3 + x^2\\]\n\nThis polynomial can be checked for roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\):\n- \\(x = 0\\) gives \\(0^3 + 0^2 = 0\\), so it's not irreducible since it has a root.\n- \\(x = 1\\) gives \\(1^3 + 1^2 = 2\\), not zero in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n- \\(x = 2\\) gives \\(2^3 + 2^2 = 8 + 4 = 12 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\), so \\(x = 2\\) is also a root.\n\n**Conclusion for \\(c = 0\\):** Not a field.\n\n### For \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[x^3 + x^2 + 1\\]\n\nChecking for roots:\n- \\(x = 0\\) gives \\(0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1\\), not zero.\n- \\(x = 1\\) gives \\(1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\), so \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n- \\(x = 2\\) gives \\(2^3 + 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\), not zero.\n\n**Conclusion for \\(c = 1\\):** Not a field.\n\n### For \\(c = 2\\):\n\\[x^3 + x^2 + 2\\]\n\nChecking for roots:\n- \\(x = 0\\) gives \\(0^3 + 0^2 + 2 = 2\\), not zero.\n- \\(x = 1\\) gives \\(1^3 + 1^2 + 2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\), not zero.\n- \\(x = 2\\) gives \\(2^3 + 2^2 + 2 = 14 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\\), not zero.\n\n**Conclusion for \\(c = 2\\):** No roots, potentially irreducible. We need to verify further that it cannot be factored into lower-degree polynomials over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\). However, given no roots were found and the polynomial's degree, it's plausible this polynomial could be irreducible. To confirm, one would typically use Eisenstein's criterion or attempt polynomial division, but without further tools, we can hypothesize based on the absence of roots.\n\n### For \\(c = 3\\):\n\\[x^3 + x^2 + 3\\]\n\nSince \\(3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\), this simplifies to:\n\\[x^3 + x^2\\]\n\nSimilar to the case for \\(c = 0\\), this polynomial has a root at \\(x = 1\\), making it reducible.\n\n**Conclusion for \\(c = 3\\):** Not a field.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nGiven the analysis, only when \\(c = 2\\) does the polynomial \\(x^3 + x^2 + c\\) potentially meet the criteria for forming a field, assuming it is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z_3\\). Without further proof of irreducibility (which might require more advanced techniques beyond simple root checking), the most justified answer based on the provided options and basic checks is:\n\n**B. 2** \n\nThis is under the assumption that \\(x^3 + x^2 + 2\\) is indeed irreducible over \\(\\mathbb"
