They figured out a plan to fake a holdup and robbery of the man's armored car. After faking the holdup, they planned to purchase a boat with the proceeds and travel to a remote island to deposit the money in a bank account there. The police got wind of the plan before it could be carried out, and the man and the woman were charged with conspiracy. At trial, the prosecution wants to introduce a letter from the man to the woman before the robbery in which the man wrote:\"Dear woman,I hope our plan for the heist works. If it does, we'll have a giant pile of bills to divide between us.

Once the relevance is established, other concerns about the authenticity or admissibility of the letter would be addressed through further legal procedures, such as presenting evidence of the authenticity of the letter or having an expert witness authenticate the signature."
