This periodicity suggests that \\(f\\) has a period of 20.\n\nFor the function \\(y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)\\), we need to find the smallest positive \\(a\\) such that shifting the graph \\(a\\) units to the right results in an identical graph. This means we're looking for the smallest \\(a\\) where:\n\\[f\\left(\\frac{x-a}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)\\]\n\nGiven the periodicity of \\(f(x)\\), let's substitute \\(\\frac{x}{5}\\) with \\(y\\), so our equation becomes:\n\\[f(y - \\frac{a}{5}) = f(y)\\]\n\nSince \\(f(x)\\) repeats every 20 units, and now we're dealing with \\(f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)\\) or \\(f(y)\\), we need to scale our period accordingly. The original period of 20 units needs to be adjusted for the factor of \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) in \\(f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)\\).\n\nThe new period for \\(f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)\\) is \\(20 \\times 5 = 100\\) units because the function repeats its values at intervals that are 5 times longer than before ( due to the \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) scaling.\n\nThus, for \\(f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)\\), the smallest positive \\(a\\) that satisfies the condition that shifting the graph \\(a\\) units to the right results in an identical graph is when \\(a\\) corresponds to one full period of the scaled function, which is 100 units.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 100."
