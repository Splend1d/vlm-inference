Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\u201d speech\n\nWheatley's poem expresses themes of redemption, racial equality, and the capacity for moral and spiritual refinement, regardless of one's current status or background. This message alignss well with the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, where he advocates for racial equality, justice, and the belief that all people, regardless of their race, have the potential for greatness and should be treated equally. \n\nComparatively:\nA. The Declaration of Independence focuses on political freedom and the rights of individuals, not necessarily on racial equality.\nB. Jonathan Edwards's sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\" preaches about salvation through faith, but it does not specifically address racial issues or equality.\nC. The Seneca Falls Declaration of Rights and Sentiments is primarily concerned with women's rights, not racial equality.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most fitting comparison, given the themes of equality, potential, and transcendence of societal barriers present in both Wheatley's poem and King's speech."
