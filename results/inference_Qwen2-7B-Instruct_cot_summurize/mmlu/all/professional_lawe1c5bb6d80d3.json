                    "text": "A write-in candidate is a Mexican-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Mexican voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager, decides to mail to every registered Mexican voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native Mexican people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following, if established, sets forth the strongest constitutional argument supporting the election official's interpretation of the statute?\n\nA. Voter turnout among registered Mexican American voters who lack proficiency in English has been less than 1% of the entire state total in recent elections.\nB. A state statute requires that each voting booth be equipped with an ink pen to facilitate the writing in of votes.\nC. Since large numbers of write-in votes generally increase the time needed to count all votes, it is necessary to cast such votes in a uniform manner.\nD. The potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers.\n"

A state statute requires that each voting booth be equipped with an ink pen to facilitate the writing in of votes.\n\nThis option directly addresses the state statute in question and suggests that the requirement for voters to write in the candidate's name and office on the ballot is in compliance with existing law. If the state has specifically mandated the use of ink pens for writing votes, allowing the use of pre-printed stickers could potentially violate this mandate, leading to inconsistencies in the voting process.\n\nOption A ( Voter turnout among registered Mexican American voters who lack proficiency in English has been less than 1% of the entire state total in recent elections, does not necessarily support the constitutionality of the statute. It may be relevant to issues of access to the ballot and potential discrimination, but it does not address the direct conflict between the proposed method and the state statute.\n\nOption C, Since large numbers of write-in votes generally increase the time needed to count all votes, it is necessary to cast such votes in a uniform manner, might argue for efficiency in the counting process. However, it does not directly address the constitutional validity of the statute or the official's interpretation.\n\nOption D, The potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers, while a valid concern, does not necessarily set forth the strongest constitutional argument regarding the interpretation of the state statute. It could be argued that any voting method carries some risk of fraud, and that the state has a legitimate interest in preventing fraud through its laws. However, this option focuses more on security concerns rather than the direct conflict between the campaign's proposal and the state statute."
