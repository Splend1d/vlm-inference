Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn both scenarios, the actions described can be considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020:\n\n1. **Scenario 1**: Inviting a married coworker to a hot springs with the clear intention of getting intimate implies taking advantage of a personal relationship for sexual purposes. This can be seen as unethical and potentially even as a violation of trust or boundaries, depending on the context and the nature of the relationship between the coworkers. It may also involve legal implications if it crosses into harassment or coercion.\n\n2. **Scenario 2**: Playing the drums loudly in a nursery is generally considered inappropriate because it can disturb children's peace and potentially affect their sleep or well-being. This action disregards the needs and rights of others and can be seen as disrespectful and inconsiderate.\n\nTherefore, both actions are considered morally wrong under the given criteria."
