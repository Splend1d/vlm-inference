Determining the likelihood that the photo was taken at a particular public event\n\nAnalyzing the metadata ( such as the date and geographic location where the photo was taken - would be more appropriate for determining if the photo was taken at a specific public event, since this information directly relates to when and where the photo was captured.\n\nFor the other options:\n\nA. Determining the likelihood that the photo is a picture of the sky: This would require analyzing the data ( the red, green, and blue levels for each pixel, not the metadata.\n\nC. Determining the number of people that appear in the photo: This would also require analyzing the data ( the pixel information, not the metadata.\n\nD. Determining the usability of the photo for projection onto a particular color background: This might involve analyzing the data to understand how colors will translate on a different background, but the metadata could provide context on whether the photo was taken recently or under conditions suitable for good color reproduction."
