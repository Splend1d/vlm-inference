These movements rely solely on external forces such as gravity, manual assistance, or mechanical aids ( like splints or braces to facilitate movement. The correct answer would be:\n\nD. Movement without resistance, stopping at end of range.\n\nThis type of movement is often used in physical therapy to assess joint mobility, improve flexibility, and aid in the recovery process when muscles are not strong enough to perform active movements."
