The foramen ovale, rotundum, and spinosum all pierce the sphenoid bone.\n\n- Foramen Ovale: It is a large opening in the middle cranial fossa that allows passage for the ophthalmic artery and ophthalmic veins.\n- Foramen Rotundum: This is a small opening near the optic canal in the lateral wall of the middle cranial fossa that permits the passage of the maxillary nerve and its branches.\n- Foramen Spinosum: It is located on the posterior surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone, just below the foramen ovale, and is involved in the passage of the anterior division of the trigeminal nerve (V1.\n\nThe Foramen Lacerum, which is an opening at the base of the skull, does not pierce the sphenoid bone but rather the occipital bone and the temporal bone."
