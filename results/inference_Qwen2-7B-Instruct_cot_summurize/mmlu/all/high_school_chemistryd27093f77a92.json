Stronger acids tend to ionize more completely than weaker acids. The order of the given acids based on their typical strength is:\n\n1. HClO4 ( (Perchloric Acid) - This is a very strong acid.\n2. H3PO4 ( (Phosphoric Acid) - This is a weak acid but stronger than sulfurous acid and nitrous acid.\n3. H2S  ( (Sulfurous Acid) - This is a weak acid.\n4. HNO2  ( (Nitrous Acid) - This is also a weak acid.\n\nGiven that all acids are being at the same concentration (one mole per liter), the acid with the highest acid strength (HClO4) would ionize the most completely in water. Therefore, the percentage ionization of HClO4 would be the highest among the given options.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. HClO4."
