When the unemployment rate rises, it means there are more people who want to work but cannot find jobs. This indicates that the economy is not operating at full capacity, which leads to a decrease in potential GDP. \n\nThe other options may affect the actual GDP or other economic indicators but do not directly cause a fall in potential GDP under the assumption that all else remains constant ( (ceteris paribus). \n\nB. Lowering the retirement age does not necessarily reduce potential GDP; it could lead to an increase in the labor supply if more individuals choose to work longer, potentially increasing productivity.\n\nC. Eliminating tariffs protecting domestic jobs might initially boost imports, which could lower prices and increase consumer spending. However, if these measures lead to job losses in protected industries, it could lower potential GDP.\n\nD. Allowing more immigration can increase the labor force and potentially boost productivity, thus possibly increasing potential GDP rather than decreasing it."
