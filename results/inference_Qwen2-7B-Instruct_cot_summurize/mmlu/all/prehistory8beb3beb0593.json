When groups have access to a reliable and abundant food supply, they can support larger populations and more specialized roles, which in turn can lead to the development of complex social structures, such as hierarchies, trade networks, and specialized professions. This surplus food might come from various sources including agriculture, hunting, fishing, or gathering, depending on the local environment and resources. In the case of the northwest coast societies, their reliance on salmon fishing and other marine resources provided them with a significant food surplus that contributed to their complex social organization."
