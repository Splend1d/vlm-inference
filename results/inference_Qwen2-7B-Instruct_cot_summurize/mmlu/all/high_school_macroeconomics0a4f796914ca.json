An increase in government spending\n\nAn increase in government spending is likely to increase real GDP because it directly adds to aggregate demand, which can stimulate economic activity and production. When the government spends more, it creates jobs, boosts consumption indirectly through increased income, and potentially improves infrastructure or public services, all of which contribute to higher output and thus an increase in real GDP.\n\nThe other options typically have the opposite effect:\n\nA. An increase in the real rate of interest can discourage borrowing and investment, potentially reducing aggregate demand and lowering real GDP.\n\nB. An increase in taxes reduces disposable income for households and businesses, leading to lower spending and investment, and therefore decreasing real GDP.\n\nC. A decrease in net exports means that more goods and services are being imported than exported, which decreases the total value of domestic production and thus lowers real GDP."
