The Miocene epoch occurred from about 23 million years ago to 5.3 million years ago, during which time there were significant changes in Earth's climate and geography. These changes could have led to the extinction or significant reduction in populations of various species, including apes.\n\nIt's important to note that while human activity (option A) and asteroids (option B) are significant factors in mass extinctions in Earth's history, they do not directly apply to the extinction of Miocene apes. Human activity would have had a much later impact on the Earth, and the extinction of the dinosaurs was caused by an asteroid impact, not by being eaten by another species (option D).\n\nFor more specific details on the Miocene extinction events, you might want to consult paleontology or evolutionary biology resources."
