For Hobbes, life is essentially a struggle for survival and security, and happiness is achieved by fulfilling one's desires for safety, power, and pleasure. However, since human desires are insatiable, true happiness can never be fully realized because there is always something else to desire. Thus, according to Hobbes, felicity involves a constant pursuit of objects of desire, which leads to a state of flux and dissatisfaction rather than a permanent state of contentment."
