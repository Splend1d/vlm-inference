This means researchers collect data from individuals representing various age groups simultaneously to compare the characteristics or behaviors across these age groups at a single point in time. \n\nIt's important to note that while this design allows for quick comparisons between different age groups, it doesn't provide information on how these characteristics or behaviors change with age over time, which is what a longitudinal or cross-sequential design would offer."
