A solvable group is one that has a subnormal series where all the factor groups ( or quotient groups are cyclic. It's known that every group of prime-power order (i.e., a group whose order is a power of a prime number \\(p^n\\)) is solvable. This follows from the fact that such groups have a composition series with abelian factor groups, which implies they are solvable.\n\nStatement 2, however, is false. While it's true that every group of prime-power order is indeed solvable ( as explained above, the converse is not necessarily true. That is, not every solvable group has a prime-power order. For example, consider the symmetric group \\(S_3\\), which is solvable but not of prime-power order since its order is 6, which is not a prime power."
