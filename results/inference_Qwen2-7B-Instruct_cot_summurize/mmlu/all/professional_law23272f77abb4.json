Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.\nB. Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.\nC. No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.\nD.

Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation**.\n\nIn this scenario, the man's offer was for a specific action (mowing the lawn in exchange for payment. The neighbor accepted the offer by preparing to perform the task (by wheeling the lawn mower to the property and starting the engine), which made the offer irrevocable according to the principles of unilateral contracts. Once the acceptance has been made, the offer cannot be revoked, even if the offeror changes their mind. Therefore, the neighbor can recover the $50 upon completing the lawn mowing as agreed."
