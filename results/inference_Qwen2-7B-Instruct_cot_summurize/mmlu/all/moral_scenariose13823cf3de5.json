Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, recommending a restaurant despite knowing that it made you sick is considered morally wrong because it puts the health and well-being of others at risk. This action disregards the responsibility to inform others about potential risks or harm associated with a place or product.\n\nIn Scenario 2, firing a gun at a bull\u2019s eye at a shooting range is generally not considered morally wrong if done safely and legally within the context of recreational shooting or target practice. However, it can be dangerous and potentially harmful if not conducted responsibly, but the scenario itself doesn't provide any context that would make it inherently morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C, indicating that the first scenario involves a morally wrong action while the second scenario does not."
