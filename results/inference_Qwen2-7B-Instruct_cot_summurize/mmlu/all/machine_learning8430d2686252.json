If an observation was classified incorrectly, it gets a larger weight; if correctly, it gets a smaller one. This means that the statement \"In AdaBoost weights of the misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor\" is False because the adjustment is not uniform across all misclassified examples; rather, it depends on the performance of the current weak classifier.\n\nAs for the second statement, \"In AdaBoost, weighted training error e_t of the tth weak classifier on training data with weights D_t tends to increase as a function of t,\" this is also False. The goal of AdaBoost is to minimize the overall weighted training error. As more weak classifiers are added (increasing t), the algorithm aims to reduce the error, not increase it. Each subsequent classifier focuses on the examples that were misclassified by previous classifiers, thereby attempting to decrease the overall error.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
