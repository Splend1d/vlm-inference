It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question's premise. If you're asking for a holiday without a fixed date across all cultures or regions, then some cultural or religious holidays like Easter (which varies based on the lunar calendar and the vernal equinox) could fit that description. However, given the context of the provided options, they all have set dates."
