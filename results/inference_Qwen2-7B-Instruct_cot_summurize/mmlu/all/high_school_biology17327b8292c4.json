Water moves from the surrounding water into the potato.\n\nWhen a potato, which has a higher concentration of solute (compared to pure water, is immersed in water, it will absorb water due to osmosis. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area of lower solute concentration (pure water in this case - to an area of higher solute concentration until equilibrium is reached. Therefore, water will move from the surrounding water into the potato."
