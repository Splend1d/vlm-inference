                    "text": "The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention are related concepts but they differ in several key aspects. The correct answer to your question is:\n\nC. R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **R2P** is a doctrine that emerged out of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document, which recognized the responsibility of states to protect their populations from four categories of atroocities: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It also acknowledged the international community's responsibility to assist states in fulfilling this duty and, if a state is manifestly failing to do so, to take collective action in a timely and decisive manner through the United Nations Security Council.\n  \n- **Humanitarian Intervention**, on the other hand, refers to the use of military force or other means to prevent or stop human rights abuses and atrocities in another country without necessarily invoking the R2P framework. It can be initiated without the explicit consent of the affected state and may or may not involve the UN Security Council.\n\n- **R2P** requires a call for assistance by the state in distress, as it is premised on the idea that a state should request international assistance before the international community considers taking action under the R2P principle. This is a significant departure from traditional humanitarian intervention, which might occur without such a request.\n\n- **Armed Force**: While humanitarian intervention can involve the use of armed force, R2P itself does not mandate the use of force. Rather, it provides a legal basis and moral justification for the international community to take action when a state is unwilling or unable to protect its population, which could include non-military measures as well as military intervention if deemed necessary.\n\n- **UNSC Input**: Unlike traditional humanitarian intervention, R2P specifically requires the involvement and endorsement of the United Nations Security Council. This makes R2P more formalized and structured within the existing international legal framework compared to more ad hoc humanitarian interventions.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately describes how R2P differs from humanitarian intervention in terms of its procedural requirements and the role of the United Nations."
