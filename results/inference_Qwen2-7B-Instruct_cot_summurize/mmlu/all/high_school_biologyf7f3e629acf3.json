In this case, it seems that a mutation occurred in the new variant, resulting in a distinct phenotype that differs from the original fern phenotype. This mutation could be a genetic alteration that prevents the original phenotype from being expressed when crossed with the new variant, but allows the new variant to be expressed when bred with other instances of itself. \n\nA. Karyotyping refers to the process of examining the chromosomes in a cell, which would not explain the phenotypic change in this scenario.\nB. Balance polymorphism refers to two or more equally common alleles at a locus, which does not directly explain the inability to produce offspring between the original and new variants.\nD. Polyploidy involves an organism having multiple complete sets of chromosomes, which also doesn't directly explain the observed breeding behavior in this scenario."
