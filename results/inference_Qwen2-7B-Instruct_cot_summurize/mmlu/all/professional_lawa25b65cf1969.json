The statute will be applicable to all leasehold contracts hereafter entered into between landlords and tenants involving residential and commercial properties. The new federal statute is intended to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords without curtailing the supply of rental units or depriving landlords of substantial constitutional rights. The new federal statute would be most clearly constitutional as applied to\n\nA. the rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business.\nB. the rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.\nC. the rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant.\nD. the rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord.\n"

The District of Columbia, being it not a state, falls under federal jurisdiction and is subject to federal laws.\n\nChoices A, C, and D involve situations that may have specific complexities related to state ownership, corporate entities, or unique relationships between landlords and cities, which might potentially fall under different legal frameworks or state laws rather than solely federal intervention. However, the constitutionality of such laws would largely depend on how they align with broader constitutional principles such as property rights, contract law, and the balance of power between federal and state governments under the U.S. Constitution. \n\nIn this context, choice B seems the most straightforward application of a federal statute aimed at stabilizing rents and protecting tenants, given its alignment with federal legislative powers over interstate commerce and the general welfare of its citizens."
