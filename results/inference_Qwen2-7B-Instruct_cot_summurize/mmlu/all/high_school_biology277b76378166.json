Shuffling of alleles is responsible for the greatest variation in humans.\n\nExplanation:\n\nGenetic variation within and between populations is crucial for evolution and adaptation. While all options provided involve mechanisms that contribute to this variation, option C specifically refers to \"shuffling of alleles,\" which is a key process in genetics known as genetic recombination or meiotic crossover. During the formation of gametes (sex cells), homologous chromosomes exchange segments of DNA, leading to new combinations of alleles. This shuffling significantly contributes to genetic diversity among offspring and, consequently, among populations over time. \n\nLet's briefly address the other options:\n\nA. Genetic drift is a mechanism by which allele frequencies change due to random sampling effects in small populations. While it can lead to significant genetic differences over long periods, it does not explain the vast majority of genetic variation seen across human populations, which is more due to natural selection and genetic recombination.\n\nB. Changes in the environment do influence the selective pressures on traits, potentially driving evolutionary changes. However, they do not directly cause genetic variation; they can only select for or against existing genetic variations.\n\nD. Mutations are indeed a source of genetic variation, introducing new alleles into a population. Yet, mutations occur randomly and sporadically, and their impact on genetic variation depends on their frequency and whether they confer a survival or reproductive advantage. While mutations are essential for genetic variation, the process of genetic recombination through shuffling of alleles typically leads to more extensive and complex genetic diversity than single mutations alone."
