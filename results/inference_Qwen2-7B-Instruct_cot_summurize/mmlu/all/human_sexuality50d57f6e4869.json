Affective Intimacy: This involves the emotional bond between partners, including feelings of love, affection, empathy, and understanding. It is about sharing emotions, vulnerabilities, and being emotionally available to one another.\n\n2. Cognitive Intimacy: This refers to the intellectual or mental closeness between partners. It involves shared values, beliefs, goals, interests, and discussions about life, future plans, and personal thoughts. Cognitive intimacy is about knowing each other deeply on a mental level.\n\n3. Physical Intimacy: This dimension encompasses the physical connection between partners, including sexual activity as well as non-sexual touch, such as hugging, kissing, and holding hands. Physical intimacy is about feeling comfortable with each other's bodies and engaging in activities that enhance bodily connection.\n\nTogether, these three dimensions contribute to a sense of unity, understanding, and shared experiences in a romantic relationship."
