A higher F value indicates more inbreeding and genetic relatedness among individuals. This leads to an increased chance of homozygosity, meaning more individuals will have identical copies of genes (AA or BB instead of being having different copies (AB). Consequently, there's a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in the population. \n\nB, C, and D options are not directly affected by the increase in the inbreed coefficient F. While higher levels of inbreeding might affect the overall genetic diversity of a population, it doesn't specifically influence the proportion of genes that show linkage, the presence of introns, or the level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells. These aspects are influenced by other factors such as recombination rates and mutational processes."
