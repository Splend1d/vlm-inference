Whoever violates this statute shall be fined not more than $1,500 (one thousand five hundred dollars), or imprisoned not more than 45 days, or both. \"A mother purchased an air rifle, which she gave to her son. The mother, a police officer, who was familiar with firearms, trained her son in the systematic practice of care in the use of the air rifle. One afternoon, the son, who was 15 years of age, was playing with his friends. The three boys took turns firing the air rifle, which discharged small pellets, at various targets in the son's back yard. As one of the friends, who was 16 years old, was using the air rifle, he fired a shot over the other friend's head, intending to frighten him. The pellet missed the other friend, but struck a next-door neighbor in the eye, severely injuring her. The mother is subsequently charged with violating the state statute. As her defense, the mother claims that she erroneously believed the statute prohibited firearms to be given or sold to minors under 15 years of age. If the mother's mistaken belief is honest, it should\n\nA. result in her acquittal, because she didn't have the necessary mental state required for the crime.\nB. result in her acquittal, because the friend is 16 years of age or older.\nC. not prevent her conviction, because mistake of law is no defense.\nD. not prevent her conviction, because mistake of fact is no defense.\n"

This means that if a person is unaware of a legal prohibition, they cannot claim a mistake of law as a defense for committing the prohibited act. Therefore, even if the mother had a good-faith belief that the law did not apply to her actions, this would not absolve her from liability under the principle that ignorance of the law is not a defense.\n\nHowever, the defense might still argue that the mother lacked the requisite intent to violate the statute, since she intended to comply with the law and only gave the air rifle to her son with the purpose of teaching him responsible handling. The defense could argue that the actual transfer to the 12-year-old friend was unintentional and that the injury was accidental, thus arguing for a lesser charge or mitigation of punishment rather than outright acquittal."
