The dogs (subjects) were presented with food (CS) while also being presented with the sights and sounds of the presenter (UCS). After a time, the dogs salivated in response to the sights and sounds of the presenter (UCR).\n\nExplanation: In Pavlov's experiment, the food was the unconditioned stimulus ( (UCS) that naturally elicited a salivation response (unconditioned response (UCR). The bell or the sight of the experimenter was the neutral stimulus (NS) which became the conditioned stimulus (CS) after being repeatedly paired with the UCS. Once this conditioning occurred, the dogs would salivate in response to the CS (sights and sounds of the presenter, which then became a conditioned response (CR)."
