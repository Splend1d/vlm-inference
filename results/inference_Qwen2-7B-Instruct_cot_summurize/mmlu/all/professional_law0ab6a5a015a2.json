The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. The investor's shopping center has grown to include 150 stores. Now, one of the lot owners in phase 1 contracts to sell his property to two physicians who plan to start a suburban medical practice. In an action by the homeowners in phase 1 to prevent such commercial use by the physicians, the court will most likely hold that\n\nA. the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use.\nB. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the offering of personal services (i. e. , medical) would be a conforming use.\nC. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because of the change in the character of the neighborhood.\nD. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the opening of a physician's office in a private home would not be construed as a commercial enterprise.\n"

                    "text": "The court is likely to rule in favor of option A: the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Restrictions in Deed**: The original deed between the farmer and the development company contained a restrictive covenant specifying that any future subdivisions must be limited to minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwellings. This type of restriction is commonly enforced by courts as it aims to preserve the character and intended use of the neighborhood.\n\n2. **Special Warranty Deeds**: The original deed restrictions were included in the special warranty deeds given to the home purchasers in phase 1. This means that these restrictions bound not only the original parties but also all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns, unless they were specifically released or modified.\n\n3. **No Mention of Restrictions in Phase 2**: The restriction about minimum two-acre lots was not mentioned in the deeds to the purchasers of homes in phase 2. However, this does not automatically mean that the restrictions do not apply to them. The enforceability of such covenants depends on whether they can be traced back through the chain of title to the original restrictive agreement.\n\n4. **Zoning Change**: The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. While this change in zoning might suggest that commercial uses are now permissible under local law, it does not necessarily override existing restrictive covenants if those covenants have not been explicitly amended or released.\n\n5. **Intent of Restrictions**: The intent of the restrictions was to maintain the character of the neighborhood as residential. The introduction of a shopping center, which involves multiple retail establishments, goes against this intent and may be considered a significant deviation from the planned residential use.\n\n6. **Enforcement of Restrictive Covenants**: Courts generally uphold restrictive covenants unless they are deemed unreasonable, discriminatory, or unenforceable due to specific circumstances like substantial changes in zoning laws. In this case, the court would likely consider whether the shopping center would significantly alter the character of the neighborhood and whether the restrictions are reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n7. **Commercial Use in Phase 2**: The fact that a commercial use was allowed in phase 2 (the homes) might suggest that the developer believed or was informed that the restrictions did not apply. However, this does not necessarily mean that the restrictions are voided or that they cannot be enforced against other parties.\n\nGiven these points, it is most likely that the court will uphold the restrictive covenants and prevent the commercial use proposed by the physicians in phase 1, thus choosing option A."
