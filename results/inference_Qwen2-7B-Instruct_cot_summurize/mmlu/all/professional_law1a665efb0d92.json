The player subsequently asserted a claim against the manufacturer of the helmet to recover damages for his injury. At trial, the player's attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify that three weeks after the player suffered his injury, the manufacturer devised a new design for its football helmets. The former employee's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.\nC. inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.\nD. inadmissible, because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer.\n"

It implies that if the helmet had been designed differently or improved upon after the accident, it might suggest that the original helmet was lacking in terms of safety, which could support the player's case that the helmet was defective and caused his injury."
