The agent asked the addict to obtain heroin for him, but the addict refused. For several weeks the agent continued to plead with and beg the addict to get him drugs; finally, the addict gave in to the pressure and got the drugs. The police promptly arrested him. At trial, the defendant raised the defense of government entrapment. Will the trial court likely dismiss the case based on that argument?\n\nA. Yes, because this was entrapment in that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government.\nB. No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user.\nC. No, this was not entrapment because the addict went voluntarily to get the drugs; he could have refused.\nD. Yes, this was entrapment because as soon as the agent asked a second time, he had established entrapment under the majority rule.\n"

No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user.\n\nEntrapment occurs when a government agent induces or encourages an individual to commit a crime that the person would not otherwise have committed. For entrapment to be successful, the defendant must be neither predisposed nor induced by the government's actions. In this case, since the addict was already a heroin user and sought treatment, it suggests he might have been predisposed to commit the act of obtaining drugs. Moreover, the agent's actions appear to have merely exploited the addict's pre-existing desire to obtain drugs rather than inducing a criminal intent. Therefore, the trial court is unlikely to dismiss the case based on the argument of government entrapment."
