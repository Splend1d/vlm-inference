This action violates property rights and can lead to legal consequences. \n\nAdding extra sugar to a punch without anyone knowing might seem like a harmless prank, but it also involves deception. If someone consumes too much sugar, it could cause health issues, especially for those with diabetes or other health conditions. This act can be seen as morally wrong because it intentionally puts others at risk and involves deceit."
