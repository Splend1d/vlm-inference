It expresses in words the shared values of a group by expressing their ideals.\n\nFolklore refers to the traditional beliefs, stories, customs, and other cultural expressions that are passed down through generations within a community or society. It does not refer to written traditions (A), nor does it encourage the change of values and customs (B). Rather, folklore helps to preserve and maintain the cultural identity and shared values of a group, as expressed through various forms such as myths, legends, folktales, songs, and rituals. It does not necessarily blend all cultures into one, but rather reflects the unique characteristics of each culture within the context of human experience."
