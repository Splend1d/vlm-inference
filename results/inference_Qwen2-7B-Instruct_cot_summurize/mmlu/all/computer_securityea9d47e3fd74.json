Yes, whenever F is a secure PRF**\n\nThis option is correct. If $F$ is a secure PRf, then for any adversary trying to distinguish between the encryption of two messages under CPA, the probability of success is negligibly different from random guessing. This is because, given a secure PRf, the output of $F(k,r)$ for a random $r \\in R$ looks indistinguishable from a truly random value to an adversary who does not know $k$. Therefore, the encryption $E(k,m) = [r \\gets R, \\text{output } (r, F(k,r) \\oplus m]$ will also look random to such an adversary, and the XOR with the message $m$ does not provide any additional information since it is masked by the seemingly random output of $F(k,r) $. Thus, the scheme is semantically secure under CPA.\n\n**B. No, there is always a CPA attack on this system**\n\nThis option is incorrect because, as explained in the reasoning for option A, if $F $ is a secure PRf, the encryption scheme $E$ is indeed semantically secure under CPA.\n\n**C. Yes, but only if R is large enough so r never repeats w.h.p**\n\nThis option is incorrect. The semantic security of the scheme does not depend on whether $r$ repeats or not. As long as $F $ behaves like a true random function (i.e., its outputs are unpredictable given its inputs and the secret key, the scheme remains semantically secure. The probability of repetition of $r$ in $R$ does not affect the security property that matters for semantic security under CPA.\n\n**D. It depends on what F is used**\n\nThis option is correct but less precise than option A. While the choice of $F$ is crucial, specifically whether it is a secure PRf, the question also implicitly asks about the properties of $R$. However, if we consider the question's intent to focus on the function $F$, then the correct answer would indeed lean towards A, emphasizing that the security of the scheme fundamentally hinges on the security of the PRf, not on the specifics of how $R$ is chosen, assuming $R$ is adequately sized and its elements are uniformly distributed.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete answer is **A. Yes, whenever F is a secure PRf**, considering the nuanced nature of the question and the options provided."
