While education can contribute to economic growth and potentially lead to greater income equality over time, it is not directly focused on reducing income inequality through redistribution mechanisms such as minimum wage legislation, land reform, and progressive taxation. These latter policies aim to redistribute wealth or resources directly from those with more to those with less, or to reduce the concentration of wealth in specific areas (like land)."
