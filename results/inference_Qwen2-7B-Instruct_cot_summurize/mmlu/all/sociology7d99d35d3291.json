They were concerned with understanding how societal structures perpetuate inequality and oppression, and they sought to develop theories that could help challenge these systems. \n\n- A. Social solidarity and cohesion is a concept more closely associated with Emile Durkheim, another sociological theorist.\n- B. The interpretive understanding of action is a concept more aligned with the work of sociologist Hans Georg Gadamer, who emphasized understanding actions within their cultural and historical contexts.\n- C. While feminist scholars like Luce Irigaray and Judith Butler have explored women's experiences and gendered knowledge, this perspective was not specifically highlighted by Dahrendorf or Habermas in their primary theoretical frameworks.\n\nHence, the most accurate answer choice based on the focus of Dahrendorf and Habermas would be D. power, domination, and conflict."
