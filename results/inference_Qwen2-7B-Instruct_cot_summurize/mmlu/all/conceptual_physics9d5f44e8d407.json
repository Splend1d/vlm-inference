Need more information.\n\nThe amount of current flowing through the connecting wires in an LED (or any electrical circuit) depends on several factors including the resistance of the wire, the voltage supplied to the circuit, and the power rating of the LED. Generally, the current through the wire will be less than that through the LED itself because the wire has lower resistance compared to the LED. However, without specific values for these parameters, it's not possible to definitively state whether the current in the connecting wire is less, more, or exactly the same as the current in the LED."
