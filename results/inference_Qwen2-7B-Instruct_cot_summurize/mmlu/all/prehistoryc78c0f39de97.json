This term is used in evolutionary biology and anthropology to describe the idea that the extended life span of females, particularly grandmothers, had a significant impact on the evolution of human societies. The care provided by grandmothers freed up other females to have more children, thus increasing population growth and potentially influencing social structures and kinship systems."
