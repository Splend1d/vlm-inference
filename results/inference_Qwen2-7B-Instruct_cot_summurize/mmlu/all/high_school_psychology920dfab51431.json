The anxiety reaction of a woman who is driving on the highway for the first time after being involved in a major accident on that highway\n\nThis response was most likely acquired through classical conditioning because it involves a learned association between a neutral stimulus (driving on the highway and an unconditioned stimulus (the previous accident, which was initially unrelated to driving but became associated with it). Over time, this association leads to a conditioned response, in this case, anxiety when she drives on the highway."
