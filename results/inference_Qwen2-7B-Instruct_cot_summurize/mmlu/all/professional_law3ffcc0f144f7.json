In the absence of a provision to the contrary in the articles of incorporation, the directors of a corporation elected for a specified term can typically be removed from office at a meeting of the shareholders, with or without cause. This means that shareholders have the power to vote to remove directors at any time, provided they follow the procedures outlined in the corporation's bylaws. These procedures may include giving notice of the removal attempt, holding a meeting where the removal is voted on, and allowing the directors an opportunity to present their case if required by the bylaws."
