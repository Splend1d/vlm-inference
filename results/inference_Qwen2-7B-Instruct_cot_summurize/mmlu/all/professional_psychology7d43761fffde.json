A value of 0.9 suggests a relatively difficult item, which is more likely to separate high-performing examinees who have a higher probability of answering correctly from low-performing examinees who have a lower probability of answering correctly. \n\nOption A (0 represents an item that is too easy to differentiate between high and low performers.\n\nOption B, 0.5, represents a moderate difficulty level, which might not provide as much differentiation as a highly difficult item (like option C.\n\nOption D, 1.5, exceeds the typical range for item difficulty in psychometrics and thus doesn't make sense in this context."
