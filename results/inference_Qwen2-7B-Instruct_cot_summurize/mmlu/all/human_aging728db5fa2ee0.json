Negative ones are stronger\n\nResearch in social psychology has shown that negative age stereotypes, such as the belief that older adults are less competent or slower in cognitive tasks compared to younger adults, tend to be more prevalent and have a stronger influence on societal attitudes and behaviors. These stereotypes can lead to ageism, which is discrimination against individuals based on their age.\n\nPositive age stereotypes, while less common, do exist. For example, older adults might be seen as wise, experienced, or reliable. However, they often receive less attention and may not have the same level of impact on societal perceptions and policies-making.\n\nIt's important to note that the strength and prevalence of these stereotypes can vary across different cultures and societies, and they can change over time. Efforts to combat ageism and promote positive representations of all ages are continue to be important in fostering inclusive and respectful communities."
