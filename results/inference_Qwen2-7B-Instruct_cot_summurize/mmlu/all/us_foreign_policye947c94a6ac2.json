They place greater emphasis on ideology and beliefs\n\nIdeational approaches to US foreign policy during the Cold War focus on how ideas, beliefs, and ideologies shape the actions of states. This perspective argues that policymakers are influenced by shared ideas about morality, justice, democracy, and freedom, which guide their decisions in international relations. For example, the ideological commitment to anti-communism was a driving force behind the US's involvement in the Vietnam War and the support for anti-communist regimes around the world.\n\nOn the other hand, Realist accounts of the Cold War tend to emphasize material interests and power politics. Realists believe that states act in their own self-interest, pursuing power and security above all else. They often view international relations as a zero-sum game where one state's gain is another's loss. Realists might argue that the containment of communism was driven by the need to protect American power and influence, rather than by a moral imperative.\n\nTherefore, while both approaches consider the role of power and the importance of international dynamics, ideational approaches highlight the significance of shared beliefs and values, whereas realist approaches prioritize material capabilities and strategic calculations."
