Strict pollution regulations\n\nExport Processing Zones (EPZs are are special economic zones where manufacturing and other activities are carried out with certain exemptions and incentives. While EPZs typically offer tariff reductions on exports, raw materials imported duty-free, and exemption from customs duties, they often do not have strict pollution regulations. Instead, they may have less stringent environmental regulations to encourage industrial activity, which can sometimes lead to environmental concerns."
