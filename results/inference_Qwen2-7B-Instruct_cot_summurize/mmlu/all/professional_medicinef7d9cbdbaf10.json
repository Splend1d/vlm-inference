The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1 week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have \"caught the same bug.\" Medical history is remarkable for asthma. Medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are temperature 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time?\n\nA. Administer the meningococcal vaccine\nB. Prescribe doxycycline\nC. Prescribe penicillin\nD. Prescribe rifampin\n"

Administer the meningococcal vaccine**.\n\nMeningococcal meningitis is caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. The patient has been exposed to someone with this infection, and she is worried about contracting the same illness. Given her lack of symptoms and the fact that she has not yet developed the disease, the best course of action is to prevent her from getting infected if possible. The meningococcal vaccine can provide prophylactic protection against this specific bacterium.\n\nThe other options listed are antibiotics that could potentially treat bacterial meningitis if the patient were already infected. However, since there is no evidence of current infection, these medications would not be effective prophylactically. \n\n- B. Doxycycline is an antibiotic that could be used to treat meningococcal meningitis if the patient were symptomatic and tested positive for N. meningitidis.\n- C. Penicillin is another antibiotic that might be used to treat meningococcal meningitis, but it is less commonly used than newer antibiotics like ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin.\n- D. Rifampin is also an antibiotic, often used in combination with other drugs regimens to treat tuberculosis, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for meningococcal meningitis.\n\nTherefore, administering the meningococcal vaccine is the most appropriate intervention for this patient given her situation."
