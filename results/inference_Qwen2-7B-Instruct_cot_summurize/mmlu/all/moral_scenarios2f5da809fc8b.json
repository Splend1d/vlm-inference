This could be seen as deceptive and potentially harmful if the patron has health issues related to caffeine, such as high blood pressure or insomnia. It also violates the trust between the server and the customer by not fulfilling the service as requested.\n\nIn Scenario 2, handing a toilet brush to one's brother for cleaning his teeth is not inherently wrong. However, it might be considered unusual or inappropriate in some contexts, especially if there were more suitable items available for oral hygiene, such as a toothbrush. The action itself doesn't violate any moral standards but could be seen as lacking in consideration for personal hygiene practices.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 involves a clear moral wrongdoing, while Scenario 2 is less so, though it might still be viewed as lacking in consideration."
