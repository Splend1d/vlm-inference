A snubber circuit consists of a combination of a resistor and a capacitor connected across the SCR. It helps to limit the rate of change of current and voltage, thus reducing the stress on the SCR and preventing damage due to inductive or capacitive transients. \n\nA. A Circuit Breaker (CB) and fuse are generally used for protection against overcurrent, but they disconnect the entire circuit rather than protecting just the SCR.\n\nB. A heat sink is used to dissipate heat generated by the SCR, not to protect it from overcurrent.\n\nD. A voltage clamping device like a Zener diode or a TVS diode is used to protect against voltage surges, not specifically overcurrent conditions."
