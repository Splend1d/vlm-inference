                    "text": "The correct answer is C. She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\n\nTo understand why, let's look at the concept of marginal utility per dollar ( (MU/P). This ratio represents the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good relative to the price paid for that unit. Maximizing utility involves allocating spending so that MU/P is equal across all goods consumed. \n\nMelanie's marginal utility for apples (MU_apples = 12 and for oranges MU_oranges = 18. The price of an apple is $1, and the price of an orange is $2. Thus, the MU/P for apples is 12/1 = 12 and for oranges is 18/2 = 9. \n\nSince MU_apples > MU_oranges and the prices are fixed, the MU/P is higher for apples than for oranges. This means Melanie is getting more utility per dollar spent on apples compared to oranges. Therefore, to maximize her total utility, she should shift her spending towards oranges, where each dollar buys her less utility but still more than it does with apples, until the MU/P for both goods are equal. \n\nThis process continues until the point where the marginal utility per dollar spent on apples equals the marginal utility per dollar spent on oranges. At this point, every dollar spent provides the same amount of additional satisfaction, ensuring maximum overall utility."
