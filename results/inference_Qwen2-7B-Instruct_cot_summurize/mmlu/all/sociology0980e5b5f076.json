The proportion of people living alone has indeed risen in many societies, not fallen. This can be attributed to various factors such as later marriage, more people choosing to remain single, and an increase in the number of divorced individuals who choose not to remarry immediately.\n\nB. Cohabitation rates have been on the rise, with many couples choosing to live together before or instead of getting married. This trend suggests that marriage is not necessarily seen as the only or preferred way to commit to a relationship.\n\nC. While remarriages do occur and can help stabilize the overall marriage rate by bringing in previously married individuals into new marriages, they do not necessarily reverse the decline in first-time marriages. Remarriages are part of a broader picture that includes changes in family structures and dynamics.\n\nSo, while each of these factors plays a role, none of them fully explains the complex phenomenon of declining marriage rates, which also involves cultural shifts, economic factors, and personal choices among others."
