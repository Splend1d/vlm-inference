This allows the comparison of age-related differences without considering the changes that occur within individuals over time.\n\nLongitudinal studies, on the other hand, follow the same subjects over a long period of time to observe changes within individuals. Stage theory focuses on the various stages of development throughout life, but doesn't necessarily involve comparing different age groups at one time. Developmental research is a broad term that could encompass both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies depending on the context."
