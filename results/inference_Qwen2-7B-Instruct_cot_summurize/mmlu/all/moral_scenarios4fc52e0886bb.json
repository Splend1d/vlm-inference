Motor oil is toxic and not meant for human consumption or use in cooking, potentially causing severe harm if ingested or used in food preparation.\n\nOn the other hand, treating one's daughter to personal training sessions after she experienced humiliation is not considered a morally wrong action. It can be seen as a form of comfort, support, and encouragement, which are generally viewed positively. In this context, the action supports the well-being and dignity of the daughter, which aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
