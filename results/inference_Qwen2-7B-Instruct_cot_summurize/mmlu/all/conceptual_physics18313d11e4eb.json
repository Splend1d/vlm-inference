For a gas, this primarily refers to the translational kinetic energy of its molecules. As the temperature increases, the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules also increases, and vice versa. This relationship holds for other forms of matter as well, although the specific types of kinetic energy (like vibrational or rotational kinetic energy) can play more significant roles at different scales or under different conditions."
