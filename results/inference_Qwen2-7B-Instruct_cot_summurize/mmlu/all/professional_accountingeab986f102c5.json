Long conducted business on the Internet and had little contact with Frost. After Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence. Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?\n\nA. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\nB. Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\nC. No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\nD. No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n"

Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\n\nWhen a principal (in this case, Frost - becomes incompetent, the agency relationship does not automatically terminate unless there is a specific provision in the agency agreement stating otherwise or unless the court determines that the principal is no longer capable of understanding and managing their affairs. Therefore, if Long was acting within the scope of his authority at the time he placed the order with Grant Corp., Frost would still be liable for the contract even after being declared incompetent. The liability would then fall upon Frost's legal representative to manage the contract as per the court's decision or applicable laws."
