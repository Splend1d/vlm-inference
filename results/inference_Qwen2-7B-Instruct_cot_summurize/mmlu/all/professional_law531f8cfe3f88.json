At trial, the plaintiff testified that he was walking across the street inside a crosswalk at the time the defendant's car hit him. This action takes place in a jurisdiction that has a statute in effect requiring all motorists to stop and permit pedestrians to cross streets at designated crosswalks. The defendant contended that the plaintiff ran into the street outside the crosswalk. Furthermore, the defendant testified that he immediately applied his brakes when he saw the plaintiff dart into the street, but couldn't stop his car in time to avoid hitting him. In support of the defendant's testimony, the defendant calls a neighbor to testify that she has observed the plaintiff frequently during the years that she has lived on that street, and that the plaintiff \"always crosses the street outside the crosswalk. \"The neighbor's testimony is likely to be\n\nA. admitted, because it tends to show that the plaintiff was careless.\nB. admitted, because it is probative of the plaintiff's habit of crossing the street outside the crosswalk.\nC. excluded, because the neighbor was not an eyewitness to the accident.\nD. excluded, because her testimony is impermissible evidence of character to show defendant's plaintiff's conduct on a particular occasion.\n"

If the plaintiff typically crosses outside the crosswalk, this could suggest that the incident occurred in a location other than the designated crosswalk where the plaintiff claimed to be, which would support the defendant's contention that the plaintiff ran into the street outside the crosswalk. This type of evidence is admissible to show the plaintiff's usual practice or habit, which may be pertinent to the case under certain circumstances, such as establishing the likelihood of the plaintiff's actions matching their claimed behavior."
