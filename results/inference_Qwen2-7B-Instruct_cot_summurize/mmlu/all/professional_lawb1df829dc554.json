Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\n\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the president\u00d5s conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the president\u00d5s conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\n"

No, because the jury could have found that the president's conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\n\nIn this scenario, the president intentionally delivered a lot of medication that was well below the required strength, which led to the death of a cancer patient. This action can be considered reckless if the president knew or should have known that the medication was significantly weaker than it should have been and still proceeded with its distribution, potentially causing harm or death. Recklessness can amount to criminal liability under certain circumstances, especially when it results in serious harm or death. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs can lead to criminal charges, the specific nature of the crime (in this case, murder - depends on the level of culpability and the direct link between the defendant's actions and the outcome.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, although distribution of a defective lot might be considered a regulatory offense, the question here is whether the defendant's actions constituted murder. Conviction for murder does not hinge solely on whether an offense under regulatory law has been committed.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the cancer itself may have contributed to the patient's death, the defendant's actions of delivering a dangerously weak medication were the proximate cause of the death. The causation requirement for murder is met when the defendant's actions are a substantial factor in bringing about the death, regardless of whether other factors also played a role."
