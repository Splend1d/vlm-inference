A woman, whose mother worked as a secretary to the wealthy man for years, filed a claim against the estate, alleging that she was the wealthy man's daughter. At trial, the woman's attorney called the wealthy man's butler to testify. The butler testified that it was Common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair. The butler also testified that the wealthy man had often confided in him and told him shortly after the woman's birth that the woman was the wealthy man's daughter. Upon objection by the attorney for the executor of the wealthy man's estate, the court will most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection bc butler's testimony would be violative of hearsay rule.\nB. sustain, bc butler's testimony would be violative of Dead man's statute.\nC. overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case.\nD. overrule objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.\n"

Overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case.\n\nThe butler's testimony is relevant to the ultimate issue in the case, which is whether the woman is indeed the wealthy man's daughter. The fact that the wealthy man had an affair with her mother and acknowledged her as his daughter could potentially provide evidence to support her claim. However, the admissibility of this testimony may depend on other factors such as whether the wealthy man's statements are admissible under any exceptions to the hearsay rule, or if there are any other legal issues like the Dead Man's Statute that might apply. Without further context on these points, option C seems to be the most appropriate choice based solely on the information provided."
