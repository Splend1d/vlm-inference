Instead, we use the fact that the increase in excess reserves is related to the reserve ratio as follows:\n\n\\[ \\Delta ER = \\Delta R - DR \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta ER\\) is the change in excess reserves ($700),\n- \\(DR\\) is the change in required reserves.\n\nSince the total change in reserves (\\(\\Delta R\\)) is equal to the sum of the change in required reserves and the change in excess reserves, we can say:\n\n\\[ \\Delta R = DR + \\Delta ER \\]\n\nGiven that the total reserves increase by $700 and assuming no other changes ( (meaning the increase in required reserves equals the increase in total reserves minus the increase in excess reserves):\n\n\\[ \\Delta R = DR + \\Delta ER \\]\n\\[ \\Delta R = \\Delta ER + \\Delta ER \\]\n\\[ \\Delta R = 2 \\times \\Delta ER \\]\n\nSo, if the total reserves increased by $700 due to an increase in excess reserves, the required reserves also increased by $700 ( because the entire increase went into excess reserves (assuming no other factors affecting reserves. This means the increase in total reserves was is entirely due to an increase in excess reserves, implying there was no change in required reserves for this scenario.\n\nNow, we know that the total reserves increase by $700, and this comes from the initial deposit of $1,000 multiplied by the reserve ratio. So,\n\n\\[ 700 = 1000 \\times r \\]\n\nSoving for \\(r\\),\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{700}{1000} = 0.7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the reserve ratio must be **70%**.\n\nCorrect answer: **A. 70%**."
