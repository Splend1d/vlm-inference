Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: \nIn Scenario 1, the act of hanging up on one's mother is generally considered disrespectful and rude, especially if it's done abruptly without giving her a chance to speak. This action can be seen as morally wrong based on societal norms, as it disregards the basic human right to communicate and interact with family members in a civil manner.\n\nIn Scenario 2, participating in a talent show and putting on a good performance is not inherently wrong. It demonstrates confidence, skill, and creativity. While it may involve competition, the act itself is not morally wrong. The outcome (winning or losing) would depend on how the performance was conducted within the rules and sportsmanship of the event."
