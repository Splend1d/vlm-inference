However, generally speaking:\n\nA. Guilty, because his intoxication was voluntary - This argument could potentially be used to argue diminished capacity or a lesser degree of intent, but it is unlikely to completely absolve the defendant of responsibility for the murder.\n\nB. Guilty, because he was under a duty to retreat - This might apply if the defendant could have safely retreated from the confrontation without escalating to lethal force, but this principle is often not applicable in public spaces where there is no reasonable opportunity to escape.\n\nC. Not guilty, because of his intoxication - Some jurisdictions may consider the defendant's intoxication as a mitigating factor in reducing the severity of the charge, but it does not typically provide a complete defense to murder.\n\nD. Not guilty, because there is no duty to retreat in a public place - This argument might be more relevant in contexts where the law explicitly states that a person has no duty to retreat in a public space when faced with a threat. However, this is less common than the duty-to-retreat doctrine in some forms of self-defense.\n\nIn practice, the court would likely consider the defendant's state of mind, the immediacy and severity of the threat, and whether the defendant reasonably believed the use of deadly force was necessary to prevent harm to himself or others. It's also important to note that the presence of a weapon like a razor\u5200 and the fatal outcome significantly impact the severity of the charges. Legal defenses such as self-defense must meet strict criteria and may be subject to rigorous scrutiny. Therefore, while the exact answer is speculative based on the information provided, it's clear that the defendant would likely face serious charges, potentially resulting in a conviction for murder, unless there are compelling legal arguments justifying a different outcome."
