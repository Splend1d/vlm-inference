Mother's viral load\n\nThe risk of HIV transmission from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding is directly related to the mother's viral load. Higher viral loads in the mother increase the risk of transmission to the infant. Therefore, managing and reducing the viral load through antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV."
