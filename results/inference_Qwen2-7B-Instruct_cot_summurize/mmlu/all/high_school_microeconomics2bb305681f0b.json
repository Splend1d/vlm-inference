Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.\n\nIn microeconomics, the principle of equi-marginal utility or the law of diminishing marginal returns states that a firm should allocate its inputs in such a way that the marginal revenue product (of each input equals its price. In this case, we're looking at the marginal product of labor (MP_L = 200 and the marginal product of capital MP_K = 50. Given that the price of labor PL = $2 and the price of capital PK = $1, the firm should ensure that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{MP_L}{PL} = \\frac{MP_K}{PK} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{200}{2} = \\frac{50}{1} \\]\n\\[ 100 = 50 \\]\n\nThis shows that the firm is not currently allocating its inputs efficiently according to the principle of equi-marginal utility. To correct this, the firm should decrease its use of capital ( (since increasing its marginal product relative to labor's would make it more cost-effective) and increase its use of labor (since labor has a higher marginal product than capital per dollar spent on it.\n\nThus, by decreasing capital and increasing labor, the firm ensures that the marginal product of capital falls (as it becomes relatively less productive compared to labor, and the marginal product of labor rises. This reallocation aligns with the principle of equi-marginal utility, maximizing the firm's profits."
