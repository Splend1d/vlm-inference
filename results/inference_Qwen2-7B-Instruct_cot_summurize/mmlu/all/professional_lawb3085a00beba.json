The defendant, who did not challenge the legality of the airport search, was subsequently prosecuted for possession of heroin. At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf and said that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was accompanying the defendant when he was arrested. The girlfriend died in a skydiving accident two weeks before the defendant's trial. Moreover, the defendant testified that although he was a former heroin addict, he had not used any heroin in the past three years. On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant to roll up the sleeves of his shirt and exhibit his arms to see if there were any needle marks. This request is\n\nA. objectionable, because the defendant has a privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. objectionable, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nC. permissible, because such evidence is relevant to the defendant's credibility.\nD. permissible, because the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand.\n"

The prosecutor is trying to establish whether the defendant's testimony about not using heroin for the past three years is truthful. Needle marks on the defendant's arms could potentially contradict his testimony and suggest that he may still be using heroin.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. The privilege against self-incrimination does not apply here because the defendant voluntarily took the stand and is now subject to cross-examination. The defendant cannot refuse to answer questions simply because they might incriminate him.\n\nB. While there is a risk of unfair prejudice, the probative value of the evidence (i.e., its relevance to the defendant's credibility and possible drug use\u2014outweighs this concern. The court would consider the potential for prejudice but ultimately determine that the evidence is admissible because it is relevant to the case.\n\nD. The defendant did waive his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand. However, this waiver applies only to the testimony given during the trial, not to any additional questions that might incriminate him beyond what he has already disclosed through his testimony."
