Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, blowing up your little cousin's balloon without her permission can be considered morally wrong, especially if she was excited about it or needed it for a specific purpose. This action could potentially spoil her celebration or cause distress.\n\nIn Scenario 2, not going to school due to having a cold is generally not considered morally wrong. It is a personal decision based on one's health, and it is reasonable to prioritize health by staying home when sick. However, this might also involve considering the impact on others, such as teachers or peers who might have to cover for the absence, but from a personal moral standpoint, it is not typically viewed as wrong."
