It involves using lines that converge at a point on the horizon, known as a vanishing point, to give the impression of depth and distance. This technique can be very effective in adding depth to a pencil drawing.\n\nThe other options you mentioned are more related to how we perceive depth in the real world:\n\nA. Retinal disparity is the difference in the images projected onto each retina due to our binocular vision. This difference allows us to perceive depth through stereopsis.\n\nB. Convergence is when our eyes turn inward slightly to focus on objects at close distances. This also contributes to our perception of depth.\n\nC. Closure refers to the tendency of our brain to fill in gaps in visual information to make sense of incomplete shapes or patterns. While it's not directly a technique for adding depth in drawing, it's part of our perceptual processes."
