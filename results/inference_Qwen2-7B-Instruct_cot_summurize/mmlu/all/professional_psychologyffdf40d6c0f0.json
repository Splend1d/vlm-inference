This refers to lawyer-client privilege, doctor-patient privilege, or other types of confidentiality that are protected by law. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the concept of privilege also extends beyond just legal contexts to include personal advantages or benefits that some individuals may have simply because of their social status, race, gender, or other characteristics ( - this latter usage isn't directly listed among your options but it is another common meaning of the word 'privilege'. \n\nIn ethics, the term \"privilege\" often refers to B. an ethical term referring to an obligation not to reveal confidential information. This is closely related to the concept of confidentiality and is often associated with professions such as doctors, lawyers, therapists, etc., where there is an ethical duty to keep certain information private.\n\nOption C is not entirely accurate because while legal privilege can protect confidential information, it does not necessarily equate to the ethical concept of confidentiality. They are two different things, although they often overlap in practice."
