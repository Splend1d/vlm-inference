An auto mechanic fixing his dentist\u2019s car for a filling\n\nU.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) calculations primarily include the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, usually a year. Therefore, an auto mechanic fixing a dentist's car for a filling would be included since it involves the exchange of goods or services in the market.\n\nB. A stay-at-home dad providing childcare for his children is not included because unpaid household work is not counted in GDP calculations.\n\nC. A worker donating $200 to the Red Cross is not included because GDP only measures the value of goods and services that are exchanged for money or other forms of payment. Donations do not involve such transactions.\n\nD. High school students spending their Saturdays building homes for the homeless might not be directly included in GDP calculations as they are likely volunteering their time without expecting payment. However, if the materials used were purchased and involved economic transactions, the value of those transactions could contribute to GDP. But the volunteer labor itself is not counted."
