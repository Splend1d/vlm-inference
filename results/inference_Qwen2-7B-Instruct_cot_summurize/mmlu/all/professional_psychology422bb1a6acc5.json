Aging is related to some loss of erectile rigidity in the male\n\nThis statement expresses a relationship between aging and sexual functioning, specifically focusing on males. Research has shown that as men age, they may experience some loss of erectile rigidity due to various factors such as changes in blood flow, decreased testosterone levels, and possibly hormonal shifts or other health conditions. However, it's important to note that sexual function can vary greatly among individuals and be influenced by many factors beyond age alone."
