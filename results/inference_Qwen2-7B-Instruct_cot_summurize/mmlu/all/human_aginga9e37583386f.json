Occur more for some and less for others and, within the same person, more for some systems and less for others.\n\nThis is because physical changes associated with aging (such as those related to bone density, muscle mass, or cognitive function\u2014occur at different rates and to varying degrees among individuals. Moreover, these changes can also happen differently across various physiological systems within the same individual. Gerontology studies these variations and the underlying factors contributing to them."
