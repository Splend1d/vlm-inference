The worry is that if a patient finds support or solutions within the group setting, they might feel less need for or benefit from the individual therapy sessions, potentially leading them to terminate the individual therapy prematurely.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this concern can also apply to group therapy as well; patients might find the group setting so beneficial that they feel satisfied with it alone, potentially overlooking the unique benefits of individual therapy.\n\nOptions B and C suggest issues related to timing and communication between group and individual therapy sessions, which could be problematic but don't necessarily reflect a core concern about the concurrent provision of both types of therapy. Option D points to potential conflicts between the advice given by different therapists, which is indeed a concern but doesn't directly address the primary issue of patient termination of individual therapy due to perceived redundancy or satisfaction with the group therapy."
