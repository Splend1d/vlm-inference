Therefore, if the object is 100 cm away from the mirror, the image will also be 100 cm away from the mirror. \n\nThe formula to calculate the image distance (d' when you know the object distance (d and the focal length (f (which for a plane mirror is not needed) is:\n\n\\[ d' = d \\]\n\nIn this case, since \\( d = 100 \\, \\text{cm} \\), the image distance \\( d' \\) is also \\( 100 \\, \\text{cm} \\)."
