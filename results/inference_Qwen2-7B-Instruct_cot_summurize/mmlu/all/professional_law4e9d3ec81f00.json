This clause can be used to justify anti-discrimination laws in various areas, including housing, because it ensures that all individuals are treated equally under the law without regard to race. \n\nIn contrast:\n\nA. While Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with Indian Tribes, it is not specifically aimed at providing authority for civil rights legislation.\n\nB. The enforcement provision of Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment focuses on abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude, not necessarily on broader civil rights issues such as racial discrimination in housing.\n\nD. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies primarily to actions by the federal government, and its application to state actions is limited through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, which incorporates some protections from the Bill of Rights to the states through the doctrine of selective incorporation. However, it does not directly provide a basis for anti-discrimination laws in housing."
