The state has the burden of proof to show that there is a compelling state interest to support the statute.\n\nIn a case where a state law is challenged as discriminatory or otherwise violating constitutional rights, the party challenging the law (in this case, the resident aliens) generally does not bear the burden of proving the law is unconstitutional. Instead, the state enacting the law would typically have the burden of demonstrating that the law serves a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. This is known as strict scrutiny.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer. The resident aliens would likely bring a challenge under equal protection or due process clauses of the U.S. Constitution, which would require the state to justify its discriminatory action with a compelling state interest."
