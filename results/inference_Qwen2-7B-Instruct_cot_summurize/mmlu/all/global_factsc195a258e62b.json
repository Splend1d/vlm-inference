However, this number does not directly break down into how many children fall specifically within the age range of 5-14 years old.\n\nAs for the exact number of children aged 5-14 who were working globally as of 2012, the specific choice from your options isn't provided by standard sources. The ILO's data tends to give broader estimates rather than precise breakdowns by age group. However, it's known that a significant portion of child laborers are under the age of 15, so an estimate around 30 million would be speculative and not supported by exact figures provided by recognized international organizations.\n\nGiven the information available and the options you've provided, none of A, B, C, or D can be definitively confirmed based on standard sources for the number of children aged 5-14 working globally as of 2012. It's important to consult the most recent and accurate data provided by organizations like the ILO for such statistics."
