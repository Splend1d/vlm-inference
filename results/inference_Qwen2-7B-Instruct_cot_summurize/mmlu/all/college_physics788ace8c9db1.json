                    "text": "The primary source of the Sun's energy comes from a series of thermonuclear reactions known as nuclear fusion, occurring in its core. Specifically, the reactions involve hydrogen atoms (primarily protons) coming together to form helium. The most common sequence of these reactions involves the fusion of four hydrogen nuclei (protons - to be precise - to form one helium nucleus.\n\nThis process can be represented by the following nuclear equation:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times ^1_1 H \\rightarrow ^4_2 He + Energy \\]\n\nHere, \\( ^1_1 H \\) represents a hydrogen atom (a proton), and \\( ^4_2 He \\) represents a helium atom (which has two protons and two neutrons). The 'Energy' on the right side represents the release of energy, which is a key part of how stars like the Sun generate their energy through nuclear fusion.\n\nSo, considering the options given:\n\nA. Two hydrogen atoms and one helium atom  \nB. Four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom  \nC. Six hydrogen atoms and two helium atoms  \nD. Three helium atoms and one carbon atom  \n\nThe correct answer would be B. This is because it corresponds to the actual process of nuclear fusion that powers the Sun, where four hydrogen atoms combine to form one helium atom, releasing an enormous amount of energy in the process."
