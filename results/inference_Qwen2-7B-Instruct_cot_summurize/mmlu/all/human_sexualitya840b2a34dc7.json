Orgasmic reconditioning\n\nThis sounds like a process that might be used in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating sexual disorders, specifically paraphilias, which are include certain types of intense sexual interests or behaviors that can cause distress or harm to the individual or others involved. \n\nOrgasmic reconditioning involves teaching a person to experience an orgasm through different, less problematic sexual fantasies. The goal is to help the individual learn to control their arousal and redirect it towards more acceptable sexual thoughts.\n\nIt's important to note that this type of treatment should only be carried out by a qualified mental health professional who specializes in such treatments. It's not advisable to attempt such self-treatment without professional guidance."
