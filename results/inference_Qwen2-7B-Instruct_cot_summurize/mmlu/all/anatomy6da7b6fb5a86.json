It is attached to the coronoid process of the mandible anteriorly, and to the pterygopalatine fossa posteriorly. Its main function is to aid in the protrusion of the jaw, which is the movement that allows us to bring our lower teeth towards our upper teeth for biting. Additionally, it assists in lateral movements of the jaw, such as moving the jaw side-to-side."
