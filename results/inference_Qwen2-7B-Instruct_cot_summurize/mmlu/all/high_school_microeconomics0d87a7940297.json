                    "text": "Option D, \"price = marginal cost,\" is not correct for a perfectly competitive firm in the long run.\n\nIn perfect competition, firms operate at a level where price (P equals both marginal revenue (MR) and marginal cost (MC (at the point of profit maximization). However, in the long run, firms can enter or exit the market based on profits, leading to a situation where firms earn only normal profits (zero economic profit), not economic profits. At this point, price equals minimum average total cost (ATC, not marginal cost. This ensures that no new firms will enter the market and existing firms will stay, as they are earning just enough to cover all their costs, including opportunity costs. Thus, in the long run, for a perfectly competitive firm:\n\nA. Price = Minimum Average Cost.\nB. Price = Marginal Revenue.\nC. Price = Minimum Average Variable Cost ( (This statement is incorrect because, in reality, price does not equal minimum average variable cost; it's the minimum average total cost that matters.)\nD. Price \u2260 Marginal Cost ( (This is the correct answer because in the long run, in perfect competition, price equals minimum average total cost, not marginal cost.)"
