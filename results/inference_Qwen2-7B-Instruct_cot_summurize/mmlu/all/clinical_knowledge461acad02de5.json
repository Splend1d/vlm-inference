A 14-16 gauge needle is relatively thick. These types of needles are often used for patients who have received trauma or burns because they can handle the thicker, more resilient skin and tissues associated with these conditions. They might also be used when there's a need for a larger volume of fluid or medication to be administered at once, or when there's a risk of vessel puncture due to poor vessel visualization or other factors."
