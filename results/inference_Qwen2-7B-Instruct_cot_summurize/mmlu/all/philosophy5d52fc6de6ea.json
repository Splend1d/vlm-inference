                    "text": "Cicero was a prominent Roman statesman, lawyer, and philosopher who lived from 106 BC to 43 BC. He was known for his defense of republican principles and his writings on various philosophical topics, including ethics and morality.\n\nGiven the context of Cicero's views on morality and ethics, it's likely that he would strongly oppose any doctrine that undermines the importance of moral values or justifies immoral behavior. Among the options provided, option B, \"a thing may be expedient without being morally right,\" seems to align most closely with what Cicero might consider a pernicious doctrine. Cicero believed in the importance of moral integrity and often argued against the notion that actions justified by their outcomes (consequentialism) could override moral principles.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Cicero did not explicitly articulate his views on all the options presented in this question. The statement about the gods not caring (option A, is not directly aligned with Cicero's philosophy as he was an advocate for moral virtue in human affairs rather than divine intervention. Option C, which posits that moral rightness is relative to one's culture, challenges the universality of moral standards, which was a key point of contention during Cicero's time. Cicero argued for universal moral principles that transcended individual cultures.\n\nOption D, suggesting that it is sometimes permissible to lie, goes against Cicero's ethical stance. Cicero held that truthfulness is a cardinal virtue, and lying was considered morally wrong.\n\nThus, while option B (\"a thing may be expedient without being morally right\") might resonate with Cicero's emphasis on moral integrity, it's important to consider that Cicero's actual views would be grounded in his philosophical framework that values moral virtue over mere practicality or expediency."
