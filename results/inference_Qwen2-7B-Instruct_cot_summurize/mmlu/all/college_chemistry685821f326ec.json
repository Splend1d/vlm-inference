Al\n\nExplanation: The stability of oxidation states generally increases down a group in the periodic table due to the addition of electron shells, which shields the outer electrons from the nuclear charge, making them less reactive. However, within a group, the stability of higher oxidation states can decrease as the element moves up the group due to the increasing effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer electrons.\n\nFor Group 13 ( (also known as the Boron group), let's consider their common +3 oxidation state and compare it with the hypothetical +1 oxidation state:\n\n- **Boron (** \\( \\text{B} \\) has an atomic number of 5. Its electronic configuration is \\( \\text{1s}^2\\text{2s}^2\\text{2p}^1 \\). A +1 oxidation state would imply losing its outermost electron (to become \\( \\text{1s}^2\\text{2s}^2 \\), which is similar to the configuration of neon. While this configuration might seem stable, it is not the most common or stable oxidation state for boron, which typically exhibits a +3 state (\\( \\text{B}^{3+} \\)).\n\n- **Aluminum**, \\( \\text{Al} \\), with an atomic number of 13, has an electronic configuration of \\( \\text{1s}^2\\text{2s}^2\\text{2p}^6\\text{3s}^2\\text{3p}^1 \\). Losing one electron to form \\( \\text{Al}^{3+} \\) is more energetically favorable than gaining two electrons to form \\( \\text{Al}^{+} \\) because the energy required to add an electron to an already filled 3p subshell is significantly higher than removing an electron from the 3s subshell. Thus, aluminum typically forms \\( \\text{Al}^{3+} \\).\n\n- **Indium**, \\( \\text{In} \\), and **Thallium**, \\( \\text{Tl} \\), being further down the group, have more electron shells that shield the outer electrons from the nucleus. They typically exhibit the +3 oxidation state but, theoretically, the +1 oxidation state could be considered less stable due to the increased effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons compared to the lower group elements.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, aluminum ( \\( \\text{Al} \\) is the correct choice since it is more likely to lose three electrons to achieve a stable +3 oxidation state rather than gaining two electrons to achieve a +1 state, considering the energy cost involved."
