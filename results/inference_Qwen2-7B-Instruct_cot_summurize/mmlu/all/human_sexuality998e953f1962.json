These hormones activate the body's \"fight or flight\" response, which prepares the body to respond to a perceived threat. This response involves several physiological changes, including increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels in non-essential areas of the body, like the genital region.\n\nAs a result, during times of high anxiety, there may be less blood flow directed to the penis, which can make achieving or maintaining an erection difficult. This is because the blood supply needed for an erection is redirected towards the muscles responsible for fight or flight responses, leaving less available for sexual functions."
