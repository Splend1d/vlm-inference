Groups of order \\(p^2\\) are necessarily finite and since \\(p\\) is prime, there are only two possible orders for the center of the group ( namely, 1 or \\(p^2\\). If the center has order \\(p^2\\), then the group is abelian (since every element commutes with every other element. If the center has order 1, this would imply that the group is non-abelian which contradicts the fact that the quotient group (which is cyclic of order \\(p\\) ( would be abelian forcing the original group to also be abelian. Hence, all groups of order \\(p^2\\) are indeed Abelian.\n\nStatement 2: For a fixed prime \\(p\\), a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of a group \\(G\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) if and only if it is the only Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\nThis statement is false. A Sylow \\(p\\\\)-subgroup being normal in \\(G\\) does not necessarily mean it is the only one. The uniqueness of a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup implies its normality, but the converse is not always true. For instance, consider the symmetric group \\(S_4 \\) and the prime \\( p = 2 \\). The Sylow 2-subgroups of \\( S_4 \\) are isomorphic to \\( D_8 \\) (the dihedral group of order 8, and there are three such subgroups in \\( S_4 \\), making them not unique. However, they are all normal in \\( S_4 \\) because \\( S_4 \\) has a normal subgroup of index 2 ( which is the alternating group \\( A_4 \\), and any subgroup of index 2 in a group is always normal. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. False, True**."
