According to Bem's Self-Perception Theory (1972, individuals can infer their own attitudes and emotions based on their own behavior and the context in which that behavior occurs. \n\nThis theory suggests that when someone observes their own behavior without knowing their underlying intentions or reasons, they will attribute those behaviors to internal states like attitudes or emotions. For example, if someone donates money to charity and then later claims they feel charitable towards helping others, they are likely inferring their attitude from their observed behavior.\n\nOption A refers to cognitive dissonance theory proposed by Leon Festinger, not Bem's Self-Perception Theory.\n\nOption B describes Festinger's social comparison theory, which posits that people evaluate themselves through comparisons with others.\n\nOption C is more aligned with the attribution theory, which discusses how people explain the causes of events or behaviors, often attributing successes to internal factors and failures to external factors. This is distinct from Bem's Self-Perception Theory."
