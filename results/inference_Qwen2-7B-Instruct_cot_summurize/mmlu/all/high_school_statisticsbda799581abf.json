                    "text": "A. The standard deviation of the population is also zero.\n\nExplanation: The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. If the sample standard deviation is zero, it means there is no variation within the sample; all values are identical. This implies that every value in the sample is exactly the same as the others, but it does not necessarily mean that this property extends to the entire population. Therefore, option A is the correct choice because if the sample standard deviation is zero, it suggests that the population's dispersion might also be zero if the population is as homogeneous as the sample.\n\nOptions B, C, and D cannot be universally confirmed from the given information alone:\n\nB. The sample mean and sample median are equal. - This could be true for any symmetric distribution within the sample, but without knowing the specific distribution or having additional information about the relationship between the sample mean and median, we cannot definitively say this is always true just because the standard deviation is zero.\n\nC. The sample may have outliers. - This statement is false. If the standard deviation is zero, it indicates that there are no outliers in the sample, as outliers would contribute to the variability, thus increasing the standard deviation.\n\nD. The population has a symmetric distribution. - While a symmetric distribution can result in a standard deviation of zero ( if all values in the population are identical), the fact that the sample has a standard deviation of zero does not necessarily imply anything about the symmetry of the population's distribution. The population could be perfectly uniform (all values identical) or symmetrically distributed around a single value with no spread, or it could be asymmetric with no variation at all, which would also result in a standard deviation of zero. Without further information, we cannot conclude that the population must have a symmetric distribution."
