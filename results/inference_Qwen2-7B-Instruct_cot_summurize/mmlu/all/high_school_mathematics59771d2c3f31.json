The multiples of 3 in this range are 3 and 6. So, there are are 2 favorable outcomes out of 8 possible outcomes. Thus, the probability that Juan rolls a multiple of 3 is:\n\\[P(\\text{Juan rolls a multiple of 3}) = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of Amal rolling a number that is a multiple of 3.\n\nOn a six-sided die, the multiples of 3 are 3 and 6. There are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. Thus, the probability that Amal rolls a multiple of 3 is:\n\\[P(\\text{Amal rolls a multiple of 3}) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability that either Juan or Amal rolls a multiple of 3, considering the independence of their rolls.\n\nSince the rolls are independent events, the probability that either event occurs can be calculated by considering the complementary probability (i.e., neither event happening and subtracting from 1.\n\n- Neither Juan nor Amal rolls a multiple of 3:\n    - Juan does not roll a multiple of 3: \\(P(\\text{not Juan's multiple of 3}) = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}\\)\n    - Amal does not roll a multiple of 3: \\(P(\\text{not Amal's multiple of 3}) = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n    - Combined probability both do not roll a multiple of 3: \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of them rolls a multiple of 3 is:\n\\[P(\\text{At least one rolls a multiple of 3}) = 1 - P(\\text{Neither rolls a multiple of 3}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe probability that the product of the two rolls is a multiple of 3 is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is **A. \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)**."
