There can be periods of high satisfaction followed by times of lower satisfaction, and vice versa. Factors such as personal growth, life changes (like having children, financial stress, or communication issues, can impact marital satisfaction positively or negatively at different stages of a long-lasting marriage. Therefore, option D best captures the complexity and variability of marital satisfaction over the course of a long marriage."
