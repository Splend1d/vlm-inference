In fact, providing food to an animal can be seen as a benevolent act, assuming the cow is hungry and the grass provided is safe for it to eat.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving Advil ( a common over-the-counter pain reliever, to a sick child without consulting a healthcare professional is generally considered a morally wrong act. This is because it could potentially lead to adverse health effects, especially if the dosage is incorrect or if the child has underlying medical conditions that might affect how they should take the medication. Always administering medication to children requires careful consideration of dosage and safety, ideally under the guidance of a medical professional."
