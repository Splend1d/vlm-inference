Regular flushing of a cannula, typically every 4 hours, helps to maintain the patency of the line and prevent blockages by removing any blood or fluid that may have clumped together inside the cannula. This practice is particularly important in ensuring the effectiveness of medication delivery or fluid administration through the cannula."
