The transmission can occur directly when an individual comes into contact with these materials, or indirectly through the aerosolization of urine, feces, or saliva from infected rodents in the environment. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Aerosols of urine from infected small mammals\n\nIt's important to note that the spread through sexual contact (A, blood transfer (B, and mosquito bites (D) is not typically associated with Arenaviruses as they are not blood-borne viruses like HIV or transmitted by mosquitoes like dengue or Zika viruses."
