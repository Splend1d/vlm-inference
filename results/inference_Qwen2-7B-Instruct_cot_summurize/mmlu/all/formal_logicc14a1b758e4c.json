Given \\(I = True\\), for \\(I \\cdot \\sim J\\) to be true, \\(\\sim J\\) must also be true, implying \\(J = False\\).)\n- **K = False** ( (From 2, since \\(H\\) is true, \\(K\\) must be false because \\(K\\) is defined as \\(\\sim H\\).)\n- **\\sim K = True** ( (This is true since \\(K = False\\).)\n- **J = False** ( (As per our setup in this counterexample.)\n\nNow, let's check the conclusion:\n- **\\(I \\equiv J\\)** ( Since both \\(I\\) and \\(J\\) are True, this part of the conclusion is False ( (because \\(I\\) is True and \\(J\\) is False).\n\nIn this scenario, all premises (1, 2, and 3) are true:\n1. \\(H\\) is true because \\(I\\) is true and \\(\\sim J\\) is true.\n2. \\(K\\) is false, which matches with the premise that \\(K\\) is equivalent to \\(\\sim H\\).\n3. \\(\\sim K\\) being true (\\(K\\) being false) implies \\(J\\) is true, which aligns with premise 3.\n\nHowever, the conclusion \\(I \\equiv J\\) is false, which means the argument is invalid. This counterexample specifically addresses the condition where I, H, and K are true and J is false, matching option B. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Invalid.
