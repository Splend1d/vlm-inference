Since the work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy, we can write:\n\nqEd = (1/2 mv^2 - 0\n\nwhere v is the final velocity of the particle. Solving this for v:\n\nv = sqrt(2qEd/m\n\nIf the original velocity is doubled (2v) and the mass is halved (m/2), then the new velocity becomes:\n\nv' = sqrt(2qE(2d)/(m/2) = 2*sqrt(2qEd/m)\n\nThe factor by which the velocity changes is 2, so the distance traveled will be affected by the square of that factor ( because distance is proportional to the square of velocity in this scenario. So, the distance traveled becomes:\n\nd' = (2^2)*d = 4d"
