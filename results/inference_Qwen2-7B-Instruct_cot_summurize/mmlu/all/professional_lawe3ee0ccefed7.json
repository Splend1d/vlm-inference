As the tenant inspected the room one last time, he noticed a bookcase that he had screwed into the wall when he first moved in. While he pondered whether to remove the bookcase, the tenant concluded that it constituted a fixture and, therefore, was a permanent part of the realty. Nonetheless, the tenant decided that the bookcase would fit nicely in his new apartment, so he removed it from the bedroom wall. When the landlord learned that the tenant had removed the bookcase, he contacted the tenant and demanded that he return it to the apartment. The tenant refused. If the tenant is subsequently prosecuted for larceny, he will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because the chattel was the personal property of the landlord.\nB. guilty, because severance of the bookcase from the wall was sufficient asportation to constitute larceny.\nC. not guilty, because the tenant cannot be found guilty of theft for removing his own property.\nD. not guilty, because the bookcase was a fixture.\n"

The act of removing the bookcase from the wall can be seen as asportation, which is the moving of an object from one place to another, and this is typically considered sufficient to establish the element of asportation in a larceny charge. The fact that the bookcase was attached to the wall does not negate the act of taking it as personal property, especially since the tenant removed it from the apartment.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the classification of the bookcase as a fixture or personal property could potentially affect the landlord's legal rights. If the bookcase was indeed considered a fixture, it might not be considered personal property, and the landlord might have different legal remedies available. But, based solely on the information provided and focusing on the larceny charge, the tenant's removal of the bookcase constitutes asportation and could lead to a finding of guilt for larceny."
