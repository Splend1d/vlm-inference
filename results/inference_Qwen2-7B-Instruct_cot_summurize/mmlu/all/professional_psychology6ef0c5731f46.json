The options provided do not directly represent the proper comparison rate, but they can be discussed in terms of their relevance to evaluating therapy effectiveness:\n\n1. **Incidence in the population of the disorder being targeted** - This could be useful for understanding the potential market or population that might benefit from the new therapy. However, it does not directly measure the therapy's effectiveness.\n\n2. **Relapse in those who experience spontaneous remission** - This option seems less directly related to evaluating the effectiveness of a new psychotherapy. Spontaneous remission refers to recovery without any intervention, and measuring relapse rates in this context might not provide a fair comparison to the therapy's effectiveness.\n\n3. **Cure rate for the currently most effective therapists** - This could be a reasonable approach if you want to compare the new therapy against the outcomes achieved by the most effective therapists using the current standard of care. It would require identifying a set of highly skilled practitioners and measuring their outcomes before comparing them to the outcomes of patients treated with the new therapy.\n\n4. **Cure rate for current treatment modalities** - This is likely the most appropriate choice for a comparison rate. It involves assessing how the new psychotherapy compares to existing treatments in terms of achieving a cure or significant improvement. This comparison helps determine whether the new therapy offers a better outcome than what is currently available.\n\nIn summary, while all the options have some relevance in different contexts, option 4 ( \"Cure rate for current treatment modalities\" is the most direct way to evaluate the effectiveness of a new psychotherapy by comparing it to the outcomes of current treatments."
