The defense medical expert did an independent medical examination and reviewed all medical records. The expert testified that the accident did not cause the injuries because the medical records proved a long history of prior treatment for the same symptoms. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff but awarded only $10 in damages. On post-trial motions, the plaintiff argued that the expert's testimony was inadmissible hearsay because he based it on prior treating physicians' records, and the prior doctors were not available for cross-examination. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, what is the correct ruling?\n\nA. Testimony regarding the plaintiff's condition prior to the accident is irrelevant and the testimony is inadmissible.\nB. The Federal Rules of Evidence allow the admission of hearsay statements that were made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.\nC. Medical testimony that is relevant to the issues can never by excluded from the defendant's case because it is always reliable.\nD. The testimony is inadmissible hearsay because there was a constitutional right under these facts to cross-examine the doctors who wrote the prior records.\n"

The Federal Rules of Evidence allow the admission of hearsay statements that were made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 803(4), statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are generally admissible as non-hearsay. This exception allows a treating physician to testify about a patient's medical history, including symptoms and complaints made by the patient at the time of the initial visit, even if those patients are no longer available for cross-examination. Therefore, the expert's testimony based on reviewing the medical records would likely be admissible, unless the specific circumstances or context of the records suggest otherwise."
