IP Network Browser\n\nSNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) enumeration typically involves discovering and gathering information about devices on a network that support SNMP. An IP Network Browser is a tool that can be used for this purpose, as it allows you to scan and discover devices on a network, often displaying the results in terms of IP addresses and device names or SNMP community strings.\n\nDNSlookup, Whois, and Nslookup are primarily used for domain name system (DNS) lookups and whois queries which provide information about registered domains, but they are not commonly used for SNMP enumeration."
