This initial velocity adds to the constant acceleration due to gravity acting on the ball. However, the acceleration due to gravity remains constant at approximately 9.8 m/s^2 regardless of the object's speed or the force with which it was thrown. Therefore, even when you throw the ball downward, the acceleration due to gravity will still be 9.8 m/s^2.\n\nSo, option A correctly states that the acceleration immediately after leaving your hand is 9.8 m/s^2."
