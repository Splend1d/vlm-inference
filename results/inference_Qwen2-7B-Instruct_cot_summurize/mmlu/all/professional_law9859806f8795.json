After telling his employer by phone that he was going for lunch and getting approval, he pulled into the entrance of a restaurant where he intended to have his usual 30- minute lunch break. While entering the parking lot, the driver carelessly ran over and seriously injured a pedestrian. The injured person sued the driver and the driver's employer for negligence in causing her injuries. Is the employer liable?\n\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\nB. Yes, because the employer owned the truck.\nC. No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\nD. No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\n"

Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\n\nUnder the doctrine of vicarious liability, an employer may be held liable for the negligent acts of their employees if those acts were committed within the course and scope of employment. In this case, assuming the truck driver was on duty, at work, and had the employer's permission to leave for lunch, the injury sustained by the pedestrian could potentially fall under the category of an act committed within the course and scope of employment. This would make the employer liable for any damages caused by the employee's actions during that time.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the specifics of the situation, such as the exact timing of the accident relative to the lunch break and whether the driver was still performing work-related duties or had completed them for the day, would need to be considered to make a definitive determination."
