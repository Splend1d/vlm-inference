Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character are evaluated based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Helping a friend who is going through a tough time after losing a girlfriend is generally seen as a supportive and caring action. It is not considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Going skinny-dipping in a community pool when others are present, especially if it is not allowed or respected community norms, can be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate. Depending on the context and the specific circumstances, this could be considered morally wrong, particularly if it leads to discomfort or violation of privacy for other community members. However, without more information about how it specifically affected others, it might still lean towards being a breach of social etiquette rather than a clear-cut moral wrongdoing under US standards. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
