Take this winter:\nThe Shanxi troops were never sent home.\nThe District Officers are demanding the land tax,\nBut where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!\nI honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,\nIt's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry\nAnd live with the neighbors next door.\nBut a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.\"\nDu Fu, \"Ballad of the Army Carts,\" ca. 750 C.E.\nThe poem provides evidence of which of the following with respect to gender relations in Tang society?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The poem \"Ballad of the Army Carts\" by Du Fu provides evidence of traditional Chinese gender relations in Tang society. It does not directly address Confucian relationships between husbands and wives, nor does it mention the specific actions of Empress Wu Zetian or any reversal of traditional gender roles during her reign. The poem does not emphasize the importance of sons over daughters for conscription purposes, as that is not the focus of the text.\n\nHowever, the poem does suggest that agricultural work was often performed by women, as indicated by the lines about wives being strong enough to handle a hoe and plow, even though the fields were all a mess. This implies that women played significant roles in farming, which was a common aspect of life in rural communities during the Tang dynasty.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Confucian relationships between husband and wife were still strong in Tang society. - This statement cannot be confirmed or denied based on the information given in the poem, as it focuses on societal expectations rather than personal relationships.\n\nB. Imperial rescripts emphasized the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas. - The poem does not provide evidence of imperial policies regarding conscription quotas or the emphasis on sons over daughters in such policies.\n\nC. Agricultural work could be shared by women and men alike. - This is the most accurate interpretation based on the information given. The poem suggests that women were involved in agricultural labor, although it also highlights the difficulties they faced compared to men.\n\nD. Traditional Chinese gender relations were reversed during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian. - The poem does not provide evidence of any reversal of gender roles during Empress Wu Zetian's reign.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Agricultural work could be shared by women and men alike."
