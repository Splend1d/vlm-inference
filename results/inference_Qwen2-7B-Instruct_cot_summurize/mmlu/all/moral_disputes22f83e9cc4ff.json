It depends heavily on factual claims about the consequences of different actions, specifically the overall effects (beneficial or harmful) those actions will have on the well-being of all affected individuals. This is why option D is correct - utilitarian arguments rely on assessing the outcomes of various actions to determine which course of action leads to the greatest good for the greatest number."
