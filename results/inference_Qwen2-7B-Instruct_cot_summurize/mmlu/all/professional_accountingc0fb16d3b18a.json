Unrestricted net assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets.\n\nIn the context of a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization's statement of financial position, total net assets typically include the organization's unrestricted, temporarily restricted, and permanently restricted assets. These categories reflect the different uses and limitations on the assets that the organization has acquired or generated during its operations. \n\n- **Unrestricted Net Assets**: These are the assets that can be used by the organization without any restrictions or limitations as to their use.\n- **Temporarily Restricted Net Assets**: These are the assets that are subject to certain conditions that must be met before they can be used by the organization. Once those conditions are met, the assets become unrestricted.\n- **Permanently Restricted Net Assets**: These are the assets that are subject to conditions that cannot be changed or removed, meaning the assets can only be used according to the donor's wishes and cannot be converted into unrestricted assets.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not accurately represent the typical breakdown of total net assets in a non-profit organization's financial statements. Option A combines total current net assets and total other assets, which does not specifically address the distinction between unrestricted, temporarily restricted, and permanently restricted assets. Option B focuses on total current assets and restricted assets, which again does not encompass the full spectrum of restrictions that may apply to an organization's net assets. Option D incorrectly pairs unrestricted net assets with restricted net assets while excluding total current assets from the description, which is not how net assets are typically classified or reported."
