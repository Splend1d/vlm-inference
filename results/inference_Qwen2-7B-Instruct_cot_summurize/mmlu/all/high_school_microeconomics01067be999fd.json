In this case, David was willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring, but only paid $125. So, his consumer surplus is $175 - $125 = $50.\n\n- **Producer Surplus**: This is the difference between what a producer receives and what they would be willing to accept as payment. Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, so for two hours, she would value the tutoring at $100. She received $125, so her producer surplus is $125 - $100 = $25.\n\nGiven these calculations:\n\n- **Consumer Surplus** = $50\n- **Producer Surplus** = $25\n\nThe difference between consumer and producer surplus is $50 (which means:\n\n**A. Consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by between $50 and $75.**\n\nThis statement is true. The other options do not match the calculated values or logical relationships between consumer and producer surplus in this scenario."
