All of the above\n\nEncryption and decryption indeed provide secrecy or confidentiality by transforming data into a secure format that is unreadable without the proper decryption key. However, they do not inherently provide:\n\nA. Authentication - This refers to verifying the identity of the entities involved in a communication. Encryption alone does not ensure that the parties communicating are who they claim to be.\n\nB. Integrity - This ensures that the data has not been altered or tampered with during transmission. Encryption primarily focuses on keeping the data secret rather than ensuring its integrity.\n\nC. Privacy - While encryption can contribute to privacy by protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, it does not guarantee complete privacy, as other factors such as surveillance laws and regulations also play a role.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above."
