We're given:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{LCM}(45, x)}{\\text{GCD}(45, x)} = 33 \\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(45, x) \\times \\text{GCD}(45, x) = 45 \\times x \\]\n\nFrom the first equation, rearranging gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(45, x) = 33 \\times \\text{GCD}(45, x) \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 33 \\times \\text{GCD}(45, x)^2 = 45 \\times x \\]\n\nSince 45 can be factored into prime factors as \\(45 = 3^2 \\times 5\\), let's consider the possible values of \\(x\\) to find the smallest one.\n\nGiven the options, we'll check each one:\n\nA. For \\(x = 165\\):\n- \\(GCD(45, 165) = 15\\)\n- Thus, \\(\\text{LCM}(45, 165) = 33 \\times 15 = 495\\)\n- Checking if \\(495 \\times 15 = 45 \\times 165\\), which simplifies to \\(7425 = 7425\\), confirming this works.\n\nB. For \\(x = 46\\):\n- \\(GCD(45, 46)\\) is 1 since 45 and 46 are coprime.\n- Thus, \\(\\text{LCM}(45, 46) = 45 \\times 46\\).\n- Checking if \\(45 \\times 46 / 1 = 45 \\times 46\\) matches the condition directly.\n\nC. For \\(x = 45\\):\n- \\(GCD(45, 45) = 45\\)\n- Thus, \\(\\text{LCM}(45, 45) = 45\\)\n- Checking if \\(45 \\times 45 / 45 = 45\\), which doesn't match our condition.\n\nD. For \\(x = 9\\):\n- \\(GCD(45, 9) = 9\\)\n- Thus, \\(\\text{LCM}(45, 9) = 45\\)\n- Checking if \\(45 \\times 9 / 9 = 45\\), which also doesn't match our condition.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the other integer that meets the given condition is **165**, which corresponds to option A."
