The sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Here, \\(2 + 2\\) is not greater than \\(4\\), so these lengths cannot form a triangle.\n\nC. 4,12,12 - This set of sides can form an isosceles triangle because it has two equal sides (12 and 12.\n\nD. 5,5,5 - This set of sides can form an equilateral triangle, which is a special case of an isosceles triangle where all three sides are equal.\n\nTherefore, **Option B ( 2,2,4** could NOT be the sides of an isosceles triangle."
