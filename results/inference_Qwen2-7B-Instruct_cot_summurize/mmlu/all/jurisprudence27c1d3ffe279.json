This can lead to the argument that certain human rights, which are seen as universal and inherent in many ethical frameworks, may not apply or be understood in the same way across different cultures. \n\nCognitivism, on the other hand, holds that moral statements express beliefs that can be true or false, and that there are objective moral truths that can be discovered. This provides a stronger argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights because it supports the idea that certain moral principles (like human rights) are universal and not culturally specific. They can be argued to have an objective validity independent of individual cultures or societies."
