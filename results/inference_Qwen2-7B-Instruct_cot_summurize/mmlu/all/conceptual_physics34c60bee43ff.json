The formula for converting between decibels and intensity ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Intensity Ratio} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{\\text{dB}}{10}\\right)} \\]\n\nGiven two decibel levels, \\( \\text{dB}_1 \\) and \\( \\text{dB}_2 \\), the ratio of their intensities \\( I_1 \\) to \\( I_2 \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_1}{I_2} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{\\text{dB}_1 - \\text{dB}_2}{10}\\right)} \\]\n\nFor a difference in decibels from 60 dB to 80 dB, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_1}{I_2} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{80 - 60}{10}\\right)} = 10^2 = 100 \\]\n\nSo, a sound of 80 dB is 100 times more intense than a sound of 60 dB. However, the question seems to imply a comparison between a single 80 dB sound and a reference of 60 dB, making the calculation a bit misleading in its phrasing since it's comparing against itself (the difference between 80 dB and 80 dB would yield an intensity ratio of 1, not useful for this context.\n\nAssuming the intention was was to compare an 80 dB sound to a baseline of 0 dB ( (a common reference point in many discussions), the calculation would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_{80dB}}{I_{0dB}} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{80 - 0}{10}\\right)} = 10^8 \\]\n\nBut given the context provided and the options available, the closest and most accurate answer based on the information given (comparing an 80 dB sound to a 60 dB sound directly, is that the 80 dB sound is 100 times more intense than the 60 dB sound."
