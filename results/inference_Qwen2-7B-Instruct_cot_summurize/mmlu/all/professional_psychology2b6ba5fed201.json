Whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing.\n\nThis answer choice aligns with the principles of age discrimination laws such as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ( (ADEA). These laws prohibit employers from making employment decisions based on an individual's age if they are 40 years or older, unless age is a bona fide occupational qualification. If an employer fires an employee because of their age, it would generally be considered age discrimination regardless of the company policy. \n\nIt is worth noting that proving age discrimination can be challenging and requires showing that age was a motivating factor in the employment decision, not just that age was a factor. The other options provided do not accurately capture the legal standard for proving age discrimination."
