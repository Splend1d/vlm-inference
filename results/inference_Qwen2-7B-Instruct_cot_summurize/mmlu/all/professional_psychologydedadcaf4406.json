The predictor has an inverse relationship with the criterion.\n\nIn a regression analysis, a negative regression coefficient indicates that as the value of that predictor increases, the predicted value of the criterion variable decreases, assuming all other variables are held constant. This suggests an inverse or negative relationship between the predictor and the outcome. It does not necessarily mean you should eliminate the predictor ( (option A), nor does it imply the predictor is uncorrelated with other predictors (option C). Furthermore, while errors in data entry or calculations could lead to incorrect coefficients, without evidence of such errors, option D is not the most likely explanation based on the information provided."
