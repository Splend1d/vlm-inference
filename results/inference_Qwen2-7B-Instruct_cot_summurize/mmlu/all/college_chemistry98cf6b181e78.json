Ionic compounds typically have high melting points due to the strong electrostatic interactions between ions.\n\nB. \\(AgCl\\) - Similar to \\(HCl\\), this is also an ionic compound, formed by silver (Ag) and chlorine (Cl). Thus, it will likely have a high melting point due to the strong ionic bonds between its ions.\n\nC. \\(CaCl_2\\) - Another ionic compound, formed by calcium (Ca) and two chloride (Cl) ions. The presence of calcium ions (Ca\u00b2\u207a) means that there are more ions per unit cell compared to simpler ionic compounds like \\(HCl\\) or \\(AgCl\\), which generally results in higher melting points because more energy is required to overcome the electrostatic interactions between all these ions.\n\nD. \\(CCl_4\\) - This is a covalent compound, specifically carbon tetrachloride. Covalent compounds often have lower melting points than ionic compounds due to weaker intermolecular forces such as London dispersion forces. \n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n- \\(HCl\\), \\(AgCl\\), and \\(CaCl_2\\) are all ionic compounds, and since they have the same type of bonding, their melting points would be similar. However, the structure of \\(CaCl_2\\) (having more ions per unit cell might contribute slightly higher melting point than \\(HCl\\) and \\(AgCl\\).\n  \n- \\(CCl_4\\) is a covalent compound, and thus, it has the weakest intermolecular forces among the given options, resulting in the lowest melting point.\n\nTherefore, the compound with the lowest melting point among the options provided is **D. CCl4**."
