Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the act of planting a kiss on your boyfriend without his consent can be seen as manipulative and disrespectful, especially if the intention is simply to \"see if sparks would fly.\" This action violates the principle of respecting personal boundaries and autonomy, which are fundamental components of moral behavior in interpersonal relationships.\n\nIn Scenario 2, dividing livestock implies that you are treating living beings as property, potentially for the purpose of consumption or distribution. This action can be morally questionable depending on the context ( for example, if it involves harming animals unnecessarily, exploiting them, or violating ethical standards related to animal welfare. Without additional context about how the livestock was treated and the purpose of dividing them, it's difficult to definitively label this scenario as \"wrong\" in every sense, but it generally align with principles that advocate for humane treatment of animals and respect for life.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, both scenarios involve actions that could be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
