                    "text": "The theory giving the buyer her best chance of success in this situation would likely be B: the buyer has an easement by implication. An easement by implication arises when a property owner grants access to another piece of land as part of a larger parcel or through the use of the land over time in a way that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the property. In this case, the buyer constructed a house on the eastern two-thirds of the land and needed access to a road. By clearing the path across the seller's retained land, which provided a convenient route to the road, the buyer may have impliedly gained an easement for the use of that path.\n\nFor an easement by implication to exist, the following conditions are typically required:\n\n1. **Necessity**: The easement must be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dominant tenement ( in this case, the buyer's land with the house.\n2. **Reasonable Use**: The use of the path must be reasonable and consistent with the nature of the dominant tenement.\n3. **Continuity**: The use of the path must have been continuous and uninterrupted for a period of time, often referred to as the statutory period (which varies by jurisdiction.\n\nGiven that the buyer used the path daily for several months and that it was readily apparent and convenient for her use, it could be argued that she had a right to use the path for accessing her property. If the court determines that the use of the path was necessary and reasonable, and that it has been used continuously, the buyer may successfully argue for an easement by implication.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not seem to apply as effectively in this scenario:\n\n- **A** ( Easement by Necessity typically applies when there is no other reasonable means of access to the property, and it is less likely to be successful if the buyer had alternative means of access.\n- **C** : Easement by Prescription requires proof of continuous, open, and notorious use for a statutory period, which might not be met if the seller was aware of the use but did not object immediately upon its commencement.\n- **D** : An Express Easement would require some form of written agreement between the parties, which is not mentioned in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to offer the strongest basis for the buyer's claim."
