This division was named after the Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini, who first observed it in 1675. The Cassini Division is located between the A and B rings systems of Saturn and is approximately 3.2 million kilometers wide. Its existence is due to the gravitational influence of Saturn's moon Mimas, which causes the particles in the rings to organize into a stable pattern that prevents them from filling in the gap."
