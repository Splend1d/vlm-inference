Engaging in self-care and seeking professional help can be crucial steps in managing personal difficulties. Additionally, considering a temporary suspension of practice ensures that clients receive appropriate care while the psychologist addresses their own needs. It's also wise to communicate with clients about the situation if it becomes necessary for them to find another therapist, but this should ideally not be an immediate action unless the psychologist feels unable to provide adequate care due to their personal struggles."
