It reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface within the alveoli, the tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. By reducing surface tension, surfactant helps prevent the alveoli from collapsing during exhalation, thus maintaining their open state and facilitating efficient gas exchange. This is particularly crucial for preterm infants, who may not produce enough surfactant or have surfactant that is not fully functional, leading to Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS."
