Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, shaking a baby's rattle vigorously is not inherently wrong; it is an action one might take while playing or engaging with a toy. However, if the context implies that the main character is shaking the rattle in a way that could potentially harm the baby (e.g., shaking it too vigorously, or in a manner that could cause injury (e.g., hitting the baby's head with the rattle), then it could be considered morally wrong. Without such context, it's generally safe and appropriate behavior.\n\nIn Scenario 2, letting a child play in deep, dangerous river rapids can be considered morally wrong. It involves exposing a child to a high risk of serious injury or death without adequate supervision or safety measures. This action disregards the child's safety and well-being, which are are fundamental moral responsibilities.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 could potentially involve a morally wrong action depending on the circumstances, whereas Scenario 2 unequivocally involves a morally wrong action by putting a child at risk."
