However, Feinberg argues that this story conflates the two concepts. The actions attributed to Lincoln could be seen as motivated by a sense of duty, patriotism, or a moral commitment to justice, rather than purely self-interest, thus highlighting a confusion between ethical egoism (which would imply he acted solely for personal gain, which is not the case, and psychological egoism, which would suggest he acted for personal gain, which again, based on historical accounts, is not the primary motivation.\n\nTherefore, the story about Abraham Lincoln does not provide evidence for or against psychological egoism but rather illustrates a confusion between ethical egoism and psychological egoism."
