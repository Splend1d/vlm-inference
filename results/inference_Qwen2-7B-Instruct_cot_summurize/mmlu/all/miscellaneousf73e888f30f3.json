It's particularly effective for shaping behaviors, especially in settings where you want to increase or decrease certain behaviors over time. In a classroom setting, operant conditioning can be used to encourage students to stay focused and engaged in their tasks by providing positive reinforcement (such as praise or rewards when they are on task) or negative reinforcement (removing an unpleasant stimulus when they return to task after being off-task). \n\nThe other options involve different psychological principles or conditions:\n\nA. Determining whether a toddler is securely attached refers to attachment theory, which deals with the emotional bond between infants and caregivers, not operant conditioning.\n\nC. Measuring a dependent variable is a part of experimental design and statistical analysis, not a specific psychological principle like operant conditioning.\n\nD. Preventing anterograde amnesia typically involves cognitive therapies or interventions aimed at memory enhancement, which might include mnemonic techniques or other forms of memory training, but not specifically operant conditioning."
