The vertical component of the initial velocity (v_y can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ v_y = v \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nwhere \\(v\\) is the initial velocity (10 m/s, and \\(\\theta\\) is the launch angle 30\u00b0.\n\nFirst, let's find \\(v_y\\):\n\n\\[ v_y = 10 \\cdot \\sin(30\u00b0) \\]\n\\[ v_y = 10 \\cdot 0.5 \\]\n\\[ v_y = 5 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nNext, we use the kinematic equation for the vertical motion to find the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height. At the maximum height, the vertical velocity \\(v_f\\) will be 0. The kinematic equation for this scenario is:\n\n\\[ v_f = v_i + at \\]\n\nwhere \\(v_f\\) is the final vertical velocity (0 m/s at the top of the trajectory, \\(v_i\\) is the initial vertical velocity (5 m/s, \\(a\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.81 m/s\u00b2), and \\(t\\) is the time.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for \\(t\\), we get:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{v_f - v_i}{a} \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{0 - 5}{-9.81} \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{-5}{-9.81} \\]\n\\[ t \u2248 0.51 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nThis is the time to reach the maximum height. Since the time to fall back to the ground is the same as the time to rise, the total flight time \\(T\\) is twice this value:\n\n\\[ T = 2 \\times t \\]\n\\[ T = 2 \\times 0.51 \\]\n\\[ T \u2248 1.02 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice to our calculated total flight time is B. 1 s."
