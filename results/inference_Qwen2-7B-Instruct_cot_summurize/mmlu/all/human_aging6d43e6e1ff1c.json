However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), globally, about 31% of adults aged 18 years and older meet the physical activity guidelines that recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity each week, or an equivalent combination of both. This number can vary significantly by country and region.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- A. Less than 50% is plausible based on global averages.\n- B. More than 75% seems unlikely given the WHO's global average.\n- C. Less than 25% might be too low for some regions but could apply to others.\n- D. More than 50% might not align with the global average but could be true for more active regions-specific populations.\n\nFor precise figures, one would need to consult recent reports from reputable health organizations or databases that track physical activity levels globally."
