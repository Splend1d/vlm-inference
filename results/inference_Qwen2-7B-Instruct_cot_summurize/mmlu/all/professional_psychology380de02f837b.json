This includes details such as the study's purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, and their rights to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. After the study concludes, it is crucial to debrief participants, which involves providing them with the full details of what the study was about, how their data will be used, and any information that might have been withheld during the consent process due to potential harm. \n\nThis ensures that participants understand the context of the study and can make fully informed decisions regarding their involvement. It also allows researchers to address any concerns participants may have, provide necessary support, and clarify any misconceptions they may have developed during the study. \n\nOptions A, B, and D either fail to provide adequate information to participants, potentially violating their rights to informed consent, or do not take into account the ethical obligation to provide a comprehensive explanation of the study's true purpose post-participation."
