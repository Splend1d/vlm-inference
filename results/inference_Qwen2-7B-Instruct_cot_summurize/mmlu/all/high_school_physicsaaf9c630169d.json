In this case, the sound waves from the alarm ( which is moving downward due to gravity - are affecting the observed frequency.\n\nFor a source moving towards an observer, the observed frequency will be higher than the emitted frequency. Conversely, if the source moves away from the observer, the observed frequency will be lower than the emitted frequency. \n\nAs the alarm falls, its speed relative to the student increases because the student is stationary on the ground while the alarm is falling down. Therefore, the observed frequency will appear higher than 400 Hz initially, and as the alarm falls faster, the frequency will continue to increase.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. appears higher than 400 Hz and the frequency increases as it falls."
