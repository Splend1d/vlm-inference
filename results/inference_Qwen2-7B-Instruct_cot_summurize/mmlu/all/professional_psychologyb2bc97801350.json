These can be psychological, emotional, or related to physical health issues. People who experience an \"acute onset of significant symptoms\" are likely to benefit the most from such interventions as they may need immediate assistance and tailored strategies to cope with their situation.\n\nWhile other factors like personal experiences with crisis, understanding of social realities, and coping mechanisms can influence how someone benefits from crisis group intervention, the primary focus tends to be on those who are currently facing significant and immediate challenges."
