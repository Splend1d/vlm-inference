When a bacteriophage ( a type of virus that infects bacteria, carries and transfers bacterial DNA between cells during the infection process, it can introduce new genetic material into the recipient cell. This can lead to changes in the bacterial genome, potentially resulting in new traits or characteristics. These changes may provide a selective advantage, allowing the bacteria to adapt to their environment, survive antibiotic treatments, or resist other predators. Over time, such processes can contribute to evolutionary changes within bacterial populations."
