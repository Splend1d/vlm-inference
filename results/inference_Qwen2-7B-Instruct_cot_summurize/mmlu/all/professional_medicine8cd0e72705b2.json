Physical examination shows localized tenderness over the lumbar spine after movement. X-rays of the spine show a compression fracture of L1-2. A DEXA scan shows decreased bone mineral density. Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations and serum alkaline phosphatase activity are within the reference ranges. A bisphosphonate drug is prescribed. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?\n\nA. Decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 concentration\nB. Decreased osteoclast activity\nC. Decreased osteoprotegerin production\nD. Increased 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol concentration\n"

Osteoclasts are specialized cells that break down bone tissue as part of normal bone remodeling. In individuals with osteoporosis, excessive bone resorption leads to weakened bones and an increased risk of fractures. Bisphosphonates bind to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix, preventing osteoclasts from attaching and activating. This results in a reduction in bone turnover and a decrease in bone loss, thereby increasing bone density and reducing the risk of fractures."
