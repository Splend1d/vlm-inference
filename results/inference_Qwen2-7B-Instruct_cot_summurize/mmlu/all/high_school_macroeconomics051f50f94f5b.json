The government increases taxes and decreases spending.\n\nAn inflationary gap occurs when the actual level of economic activity exceeds its potential, leading to higher prices (inflation. To address this, contractionary fiscal policy is needed to reduce aggregate demand and move the economy back towards its potential output. Increasing taxes directly reduces disposable income, decreasing consumer spending and thus aggregate demand. Simultaneously, decreasing government spending also reduces aggregate demand. Both actions work together to help cool down an overheating economy and reduce inflationary pressures without necessarily causing a recession if managed carefully."
