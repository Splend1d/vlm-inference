The buyer told the owner that she was very interested in buying the business, but that she needed to get a loan from the bank to finance the purchase. The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000. The written agreement contained a provision wherein the sale would not take effect \"unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank to finance the purchase of the business. \" Subsequently, the buyer made no effort to attempt to obtain a loan from a bank so that the sale could be finalized. After several months, the owner filed suit against the buyer for breach of contract. Which of the following will be the owner's strongest argument in support of his action against the buyer for breach of contract?\n\nA. The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a \"condition\" to the buyer's duty to buy the business.\nB. Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.\nC. Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, it should be stricken from the contract because it is an unconscionable term.\nD. The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.\n"

The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.\n\nThis argument is based on the fact that while the contract specified that the sale would only proceed if the buyer obtained a loan, there is also an expectation that the buyer will act in good faith and make a reasonable effort to fulfill their contractual obligations. By making no effort to secure the necessary financing, the buyer failed to meet this implicit requirement. This can be seen as a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, which is generally implied in every contract.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not directly address the buyer's failure to act reasonably in trying to obtain the loan. Option A simply restates the condition in the contract without addressing whether it was properly framed as a condition or not. Option B suggests that the condition should be excused due to the potential hardship on the owner, but this is not necessarily a legal basis for excusing the condition. Option C argues that the condition is unconscionable, which is a legal argument that might be relevant in some cases but does not specifically address the buyer's actions in failing to meet the condition."
