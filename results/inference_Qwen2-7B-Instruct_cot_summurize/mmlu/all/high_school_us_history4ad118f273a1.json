They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S.

The Truman Doctrine was introduced in March 1947 and aimed to contain the spread of communism, particularly in Europe after World War II. The passage highlights the importance of preventing the rise of totalitarian regimes, which he believed could occur when people are impoverished and desperate. Truman argued that it was crucial to support nations threatened by communism to prevent them from falling under its influence. This doctrine led to significant foreign policy decisions, including the aid to Greece and Turkey, which was one of the first actions taken under the doctrine. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
