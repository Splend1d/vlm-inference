We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nIn harmony with the sentiments of the excerpt above, which of the following best characterizes the \"Square Deal\" of Theodore Roosevelt?\n\nA. Conservation, trust-busting, consumer protection\nB. Protective tariffs, centralized banking, conservation\nC. Equal opportunity, women's suffrage, laissez-faire economics\nD. Laissez-faire economics, support of labor unions, conservation\n"

The Progressive Party Platform echoes these concerns, emphasizing equal opportunity, industrial justice, and the use of sovereign power to promote the general welfare."
