The term \"paradoxical sleep\" refers to the fact that during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, the brain is highly active, similar to when a person is awake, while the body is largely paralyzed, except for the eye muscles and a few other muscles involved in breathing. This unusual state of high brain activity paired with physical inactivity was considered paradoxical until we learned more about the functions of REM sleep. REM sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and processing, among other functions."
