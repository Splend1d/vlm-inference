Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the attorney's indifference to their clients' wealth could be seen as unprofessional or insensitive, particularly if it leads to unfair treatment or neglect of a client's case based on financial status rather than the merits of the case. This behavior could potentially violate ethical guidelines for attorneys that emphasize treating all clients with respect and providing competent representation regardless of their economic situation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking hotel robes and towels as souvenirs is generally considered theft, which is morally wrong. Hotels have property rights over their items, and taking them without permission violates those rights. While it might seem like a minor offense, it is still a violation of property rights and can be legally actionable.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves a potential moral wrongdoing in terms of professional ethics, while Scenario 2 clearly involves a moral wrongdoing by committing theft."
