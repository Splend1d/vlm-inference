He allowed her husband to drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After securing her inside the squad car, he conducted a search of her vehicle. The officer found a bag of cocaine inside a zippered jacket on the back seat. He arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\n\nAccording to the legal principle established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Chimel v. California ( 395 U.S. 752 ( 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 ( (1969), and its subsequent interpretations, when a person is lawfully arrested, the police may conduct a search of the area within the immediate control of the arrestee at the time of the arrest without needing a separate warrant. This includes the arrestee's person, their clothing, and any containers or objects they might have on them. \n\nIn this case, the officer arrested the driver for driving under suspension. As part of the lawful arrest, the officer searched the car incident to the arrest. The discovery of the cocaine was within the scope of the search incident to arrest because it was found on the back seat where the driver had access. Therefore, the trial court is unlikely to grant the suppression motion based on the search being incident to the arrest.\n\nIt's important to note that the specifics of the case could influence the outcome, such as whether the officer had probable cause to believe the driver had committed the offenses of possession and possession with intent to deliver before conducting the search, or if there were any other exigent circumstances justifying the search beyond the immediate control rule. However, based solely on the information provided, the answer would be C."
