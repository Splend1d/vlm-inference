Price is determined by the equilibrium in the entire market.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, individual firms are price takers, meaning they have no control over the market price. The price is determined by the interaction of all buyers and sellers in the market, and each firm must accept this price as given when setting its own quantity produced. This is why the correct statement is that price is determined by the equilibrium in the entire market. \n\nTo clarify the other options:\n\nA. Demand is downward-sloping. - This is generally true for most firms, but not specifically for a perfectly competitive firm since they are price takers and do not set their own prices.\n\nB. The demand curve lies above the marginal revenue curve. - In a perfectly competitive market, the marginal revenue (MR) curve actually lies directly on top of the demand curve, which is also downward sloping.\n\nD. Average revenue differs from price. - In perfect competition, average revenue (AR, which equals total revenue divided by quantity, is equal to the price because each unit sold fetch the same price. Therefore, AR does not differ from price."
