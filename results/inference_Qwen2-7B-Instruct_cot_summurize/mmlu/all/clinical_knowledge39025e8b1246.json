Among the options provided, it is true that anaemia is a common finding in individuals with RA. The exact reason for this anaemia is not fully understood, but it may be related to chronic inflammation, decreased production of red blood cells, or increased breakdown of red blood cells.\n\nLet's clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Rheumatoid factor is present in about 80% of rheumatoid cases, not 25%. This antibody is often used as a diagnostic marker for RA.\n\nB. RA is actually considered a polyarthritis, meaning it affects multiple joints, rather than an oligoarthropathy which refers to a condition affecting few joints.\n\nD. Heberden's nodes are are bony enlargements typically found at the distal interphalangeal joints and are more commonly associated with osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis."
