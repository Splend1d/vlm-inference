Decreasing [Fe2+].\n\nIn a voltaic cell, the potential difference (or electromotive force (EMF) depends on the concentrations of the reactants and products according to the Nernst equation. The EMF is directly proportional to the negative logarithm of the activity or concentration of the reducing agent (in this case, Fe2+) and inversely proportional to the activity or concentration of the oxidizing agent (in this case, Ag+).\n\nGiven the redox reaction:\n\n\\[2Ag^+(aq) + Fe(s) \\rightarrow 2Ag(s) + Fe^{2+}(aq)\\]\n\n- **A. Increasing [Fe2+]** would decrease the cell potential because Fe2+ is a product and increasing its concentration shifts the reaction to the left, decreasing the driving force.\n- **B. Adding more Fe(s)** does not change the concentrations of ions in solution and thus does not affect the potential.\n- **C. Decreasing [Fe2+]** would increase the cell potential because it shifts the reaction to the right, favoring the formation of more Fe2+ ions.\n- **D. Removing some Fe(s)** does not change the concentrations of ions in solution and thus does not affect the potential.\n\nTherefore, decreasing the concentration of Fe2+ ( leads to an increase in the potential of the voltaic cell."
