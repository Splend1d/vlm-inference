Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n- In Scenario 1, pushing an elderly woman around the park is considered morally wrong because it involves physical aggression towards someone who may be more vulnerable due to their age and possibly mobility issues. This action can cause physical harm or at the very least, emotional distress.\n- In Scenario 2, forcing one's child to eat cement is not only morally wrong but also potentially life-threatening. It violates the child's basic rights, including the right to bodily integrity and the protection against harm from caregivers. This act is illegal in many jurisdictions and goes against the ethical responsibility of parents to ensure the safety and well-being of their children."
