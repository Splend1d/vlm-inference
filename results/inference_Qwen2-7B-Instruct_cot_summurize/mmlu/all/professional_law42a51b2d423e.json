                    "text": "During a three-month period, a city was stunned by a series of mysterious deaths, which claimed the lives of 20 people. Although all the victims had apparently died from poisoning, the police were in a quandary as to who was responsible for the killings. There was finally a breakthrough in the investigation when a police toxicologist determined that all the victims had died after eating poisoned apples which had been purchased at a local market. The apples had all been contaminated with a pesticide. The police then received a letter from a person who claimed responsibility for the poisonings. The letter stated that the killings were in retaliation for the city's new policy of prosecuting toxic polluters. Acting upon an anonymous tip, the police arrested the owner of a pest control company engaged in the manufacture of pesticides, and charged him with 20 counts of murder. Thereafter, the city's largest newspaper ran a series of articles on the killings and referred to the owner as the pesticide poisoner. After the preliminary hearing, the state trial judge issued an exparte injunction against the newspaper prohibiting it from publishing any news during the trial that might be prejudicial to the owner. The newspaper appealed. In light of the U. S. Supreme Court cases to date, the state appellate court should\n\nA. dissolve the injunction, because a news story about a matter of public interest is absolutely privileged.\nB. dissolve the injunction, because it is an impermissible prior restraint on the freedom of the press.\nC. uphold the injunction, because the inference of guilt in any prejudicial coverage would deny the defendant his constitutional right of a fair trial.\nD. uphold the injunction, because reference to the defendant by the name pesticide poisoner would be inflammatory and prejudicial.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. dissolve the injunction, because it is an impermissible prior restraint on the freedom of the press.\n\nIn the United States, freedom of the press is protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution. This protection extends to the ability of the media to report on matters of public interest without interference or restraint from the government. An injunction that prohibits a newspaper from publishing news that may be prejudicial to the defendant during the trial is considered a prior restraint, as it restricts speech before it occurs. Such restraints are are generally disfavored unless there is a compelling reason, such as a substantial likelihood of irreparable harm or a clear showing of probable cause to believe that the publication would violate specific laws or pose a serious threat to national security, privacy rights, or other significant interests.\n\nIn this case, the state trial judge's issuance of an exparte injunction against the newspaper is seen as an impermissible prior restraint on the freedom of the press. The court should dissolve the injunction, allowing the newspaper to continue reporting on the matter as it sees fit, as long as the content does not violate any applicable laws or pose an imminent threat to a legitimate interest. The newspaper's right to report on the matter of public interest outweighs the potential concerns regarding the defendant's right to a fair trial, as the defendant has not yet been found guilty and remains presumed innocent until proven otherwise."
