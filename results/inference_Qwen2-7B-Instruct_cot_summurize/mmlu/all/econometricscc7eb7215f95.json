However, taking logarithms of each of the variables (i) is typically done to linearize relationships or stabilize variance, not specifically to address autocorrelation. Using dummy variables to remove outlying observations (iii) might help if the outliers are causing the autocorrelation, but it's not a standard approach for dealing with autocorrelation. Therefore, options i) and iii) are not typically used as primary methods to deal with residual autocorrelation."
