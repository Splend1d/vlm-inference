A classroom test over a chapter in a textbook is a good example of an achievement test because it assesses whether the student has understood and retained the information presented in that specific chapter.\n\nThe other options are not achievement tests:\n\nA. An IQ test measures intelligence quotient, which is more about innate cognitive abilities rather than acquired knowledge.\n\nC. An entrance exam for law school is often more focused on assessing analytical reasoning skills, knowledge of legal principles, and sometimes writing ability, but it's not necessarily tied to a specific body of content learned in a course.\n\nD. A personality test based on the Big Five personality traits ( assesses aspects of personality like openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, which are more about personal characteristics rather than academic achievement in a specific subject."
