The court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that law in this action.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen a federal court is deciding a case involving state law, it generally applies the law of the state where the court is located (in this case, State B, because the court's jurisdiction is based on the diversity of citizenship between the parties (not their states of residence. This principle is known as the \"lex loci delicti\" or the \"law of the place of the tort,\" meaning the law of the state where the tort (or wrongful act) occurred governs the case.\n\nIn this scenario, the truck driver is filing a lawsuit based on negligence in a federal court within State B. Therefore, the court should apply the negligence law of State B to determine liability and damages, unless there is a compelling reason to apply the law of another state under established principles of conflict of laws. These principles could include factors like the \"most significant relationship\" test, which considers which state has the greatest interest in applying its law to the case based on the location of the incident, the parties' residences, or other relevant connections."
