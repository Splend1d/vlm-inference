In this perspective, psychological disorders or mental health issues can often be attributed to unmet needs or an inability to fulfill one's potential due to environmental constraints or personal circumstances. \n\nA. Neurochemical imbalances are more commonly associated with biological theories of mental illness.\nB. Unhealthy attributional styles are related to cognitive approaches, particularly in understanding how individuals interpret events and their impact on their emotions and behavior.\nC. Learned associations are refer to classical conditioning or operant conditioning processes, which are part of learning theories and not typically the primary focus of humanistic psychology when explaining psychological disorders."
