In sports such as soccer, where high-intensity activities are interspersed with periods of rest, the lactate concentration in the blood can rise significantly.\n\nRegarding the options you've provided:\n\nA. This statement is not accurate. In professional or elite soccer, the blood lactate concentration can indeed increase significantly above 3 mM, especially during periods of high-intensity play.\n\nB. This statement is generally incorrect. The lactate concentration at the end of the game is often higher than at the end of the first half, due to the cumulative effect of increased physical exertion over the entire duration of the game.\n\nC. This statement is correct. The lactate concentration is typically higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half. This is because the longer duration and varying levels of intensity in soccer can lead to an accumulation of lactate in the muscles and bloodstream.\n\nD. This statement is also correct. As the game progresses and players become more fatigued, their lactate production increases due to the body's increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism. This is particularly evident in the latter stages of the game when players are more fatigued and the metabolic rate is higher.\n\nSo, the correct answers based on your options are C and D."
