VGGNets indeed use convolutional kernels of smaller width and height (3x3 pixels) compared to AlexNet's initial layer which uses 11x11 kernels.\n- **Statement 2**: This is false. Data-dependent weight initialization procedures, such as the Xavier/Glorot initialization or He initialization, were introduced before the advent of Batch Normalization. Batch Normalization itself was introduced by Ioffe and Szegedy in their paper \"Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift\" in 2015, whereas data-dependent weight initialization techniques were used earlier in the development of deep learning models."
