On appeal, he had a de novo trial before a county trial court. He presented medical testimony diagnosing the disease of alcoholism, which was marked by a nearly uncontrollable urge to drink. The defense claimed that a person could not be convicted for suffering from a disease process. The state simply argued that the man had no defense to what he did. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the man's appeal after his conviction. Will the Court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because it is unconstitutional to punish someone for the status of being an alcoholic or a drug addict.\nB. Yes, because when a person acts under a compulsion that is part of a medical disease, this negates criminal intent.\nC. No, because the man was sane and knew the difference between right and wrong when he was sober.\nD. No, because he was convicted not for being a chronic alcoholic but for the actions of being in public while drunk.\n"

Yes, because when a person acts under a compulsion that is part of a medical disease, this negates criminal intent.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court might likely reverse the conviction on the grounds that the man acted under the compulsion of a medical disease, specifically alcoholism. This would negate his criminal intent, as he lacked the mental capacity to form the requisite intent required for the crime of public intoxication. The argument that a disease process should absolve a person of criminal responsibility aligns with the idea that one cannot be held accountable for actions taken under the influence of a medical condition that impairs their judgment or control over their actions."
