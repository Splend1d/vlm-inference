He was convicted and received a life sentence. The felon, however, was pardoned by the President of the United States, who was a childhood friend. A great hue and cry ensued, and the talking heads on television proclaimed that legislation was needed to prevent such injustice again. Would such legislation be constitutional?\n\nA. No. While what the president did wasn't a good idea, the Constitution expressly grants the President an unqualified power to pardon.\nB. Yes, under Article I.\nC. Yes, under Article II\nD. Yes, because Congress can put limits on the pardon power.\n"

Yes, under Article II.\n\nThe Constitution grants the President of the United States broad authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment ( (Article II, Section 2). This includes the power to pardon individuals who have been convicted of federal crimes. Therefore, if the President chose to pardon the individual in question, it would be within their constitutional authority, even if many people believe it to be unjust or inappropriate.\n\nLegislation could potentially address concerns about the use of pardons in specific circumstances or to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. However, any such laws would need to be crafted carefully to ensure they do not infringe upon the President's constitutional powers to pardon, which are are considered essential for the balance of powers among the branches of government."
