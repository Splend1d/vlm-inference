Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the main character goes home despite being explicitly told by the other person that they do not want to share their address. This action is considered disrespectful and potentially invasive of personal boundaries, which are are fundamental components of privacy and consent in interpersonal relationships.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character has sex with their wife because they were feeling good. This scenario does not appear to involve any moral wrongdoing. It is generally understood that married individuals have the right to engage in sexual activities with each other within the confines of their marriage, provided there are no other parties involved or any form of deception. \n\nPlease note that while this answer provides a general perspective based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it's important to consider that cultural norms, individual beliefs, and legal perspectives can vary widely."
