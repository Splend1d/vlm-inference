We already have \\(2^2\\) and \\(3^2\\), which are are both even powers, but \\(17\\) is only to the first power.\n\nTherefore, for \\(n \\cdot 17\\) to become a perfect square (and thus the entire expression inside the square root to be a perfect square, \\(n\\) must include at least one more \\(17\\). This is because having two \\(17\\)s would make their product \\(17^2\\), which is a perfect square.\n\nHence, the least possible positive integer value of \\(n\\) is \\(17\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **C. 17**."
