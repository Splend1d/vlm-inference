Higher rainfall leads to more water being available for plant growth, which then results in more food production. This additional food supply can lead to better storage capacity and potential population growth or migration, as there would be less need to hunt or gather as much frequently. The stalagmite's isotopic composition reflects these changes over time, providing a record of past environmental conditions and human activities."
