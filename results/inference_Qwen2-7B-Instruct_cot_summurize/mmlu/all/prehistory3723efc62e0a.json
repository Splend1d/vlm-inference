The Maya civilization in Mesoamerica did develop a written language, but in South America, the Incas, for example, did not have a written language in the conventional sense. Instead, they used a combination of knotted strings (quipus, which were used by the Inca and other Andean cultures, and possibly oral traditions to record information. However, this system was more rudimentary compared to a full-fledged writing system."
