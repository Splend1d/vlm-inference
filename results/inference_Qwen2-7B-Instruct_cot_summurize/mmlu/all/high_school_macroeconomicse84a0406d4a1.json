Supply-side economics argues that tax cuts can lead to increased aggregate supply through various mechanisms such as increased savings, investment, and productivity.\n\nExplanation of other options:\n- B: This statement aligns with supply-side thinking, suggesting that tax cuts can boost aggregate supply by increasing incentives for saving, investment, and capital accumulation.\n- C: This statement also align with supply-side economics, indicating that tax increases can decrease aggregate supply due to reduced incentives to work.\n- D: This statement fits within supply-side theory, suggesting that tax cuts can encourage risk-taking, which can contribute to increased aggregate supply."
