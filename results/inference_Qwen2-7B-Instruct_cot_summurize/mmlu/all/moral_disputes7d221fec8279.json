CBT is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on teaching individuals how to identify and challenge negative patterns of thought, or distortions, that contribute to their emotional and behavioral difficulties. By doing so, the therapy aims to help people change their thinking in a way that leads to more adaptive behaviors and emotional well-being. \n\nWhile CBT can sometimes involve rewarding good behavior (as part of its techniques like systematic desensitization or behavior activation), its core objective is not primarily about building grit, achieving stoic wisdom, or simply rewarding positive actions. These might be outcomes of improved mental health and functioning that result from CBT, but they are not the primary goals of the therapy itself."
