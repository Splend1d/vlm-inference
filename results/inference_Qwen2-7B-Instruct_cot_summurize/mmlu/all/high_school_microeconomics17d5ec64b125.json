Air pollution from a power plant is blowing downwind and harming the trees in your community. Tax the production of electricity.\n\nExplanation:\nA negative externality occurs when an economic activity imposes costs on third parties who are not involved in the transaction, but bear the burden of the cost. In this case, the air pollution from the power plant harms the trees in the community, creating a negative externality.\n\nOption D addresses this issue by implementing a tax on the production of electricity generated by the power plant. This tax serves as a Pigouvian tax, which aims to internalize the external cost by making the producer pay for the damage caused to the environment. By increasing the cost of production, the power plant has an incentive to reduce emissions or adopt cleaner technologies, thereby mitigating the negative externality.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not effectively address the negative externality:\n\nA. Taxing the citizens of the community does not directly address the source of the problem (the power plant, and may not be sufficient to induce the necessary changes in behavior or technology to eliminate the negative externality.\n\nB. Giving a tree subsidy to the neighbor does not address the pollution problem created by the power plant. It merely encourages the neighbor to plant more trees, which may help offset the harm, but does not solve the underlying issue.\n\nC. Giving a subsidy to the hog farmer does not address the pollution of the neighbor's drinking water. Instead, it might encourage increased hog farming, potentially exacerbating the problem."
