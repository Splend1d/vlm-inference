In this context, it means that if you select a group of individuals who are at the extreme end of a distribution ( (for example, the most severely disturbed patients), they are likely to appear less extreme after receiving a treatment simply because of natural variability. This doesn't necessarily mean the treatment had an effect; it could be due to regression toward the mean.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a significant t-test between severely disturbed patients and less severely disturbed patients only indicates that there is a difference between these two groups but does not address whether this difference is due to the treatment or regression toward the mean.\n\nOption C refers to historical and maturation variables, which might also influence the results, but it's not the primary issue being addressed here.\n\nOption D mentions the placebo effect, which is indeed a factor in some treatments, but it does not directly explain why the conclusion that the treatment is effective with extreme cases would fail without considering regression toward the mean."
