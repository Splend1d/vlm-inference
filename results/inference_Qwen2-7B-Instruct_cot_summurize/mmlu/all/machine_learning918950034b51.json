The number of hidden nodes\n\nIncreasing the number of hidden nodes generally allows the model to learn more complex representations, potentially reducing underfitting by capturing more intricate patterns in the data. However, it also increases the risk of overfitting if the network becomes too complex for the given amount of training data. Balancing the number of hidden nodes is crucial for achieving a good trade-off between underfitting and overfitting."
