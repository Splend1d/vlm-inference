Wrong, Not wrong\n\nRefilling the shampoo bottle with shaving cream and putting it back in the shower can be considered deceptive and dishonest, potentially causing inconvenience or damage to others (e.g., not being able to use the product as intended, or mistakenly using a different substance that could have adverse effects on hair or skin. This action violates principles of honesty and respect for property, which are are generally considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nKeeping a distance from an ambulance is not inherently morally wrong. In many situations, it might be a reasonable choice based on personal safety, lack of information about the situation, or simply not knowing how to assist. However, if someone intentionally obstructs an ambulance, that would be morally wrong. Assuming no such behavior is involved, merely keeping a distance does not violate any clear moral norms unless one has a duty to assist in an emergency and fails to do so."
