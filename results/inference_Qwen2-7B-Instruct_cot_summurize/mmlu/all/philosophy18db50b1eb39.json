According to Kant:\n\n- Laws of nature are laws according to which \"everything will happen\". These are the natural laws that govern the physical world and determine how things occur or change based on empirical observations and scientific understanding.\n\n- Laws of freedom, on the other hand, are laws according to which \"everything ought to happen\". These are the moral laws that govern human actions and determine what is right or wrong based on rational principles and duties, not empirical observations."
