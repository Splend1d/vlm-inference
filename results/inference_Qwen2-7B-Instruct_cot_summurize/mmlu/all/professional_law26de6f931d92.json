The neighbor took it and returned with a bank check for the full amount, demanding that the deed be tendered. The property owner then decided that the terms were not reasonable and he returned the money and refused to tender a deed. Neighbor sued for specific performance. The property owner defended on the basis that the neighbor did not accept the agreement's terms and did not sign the document. Neighbor sued for specific performance of the transaction. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the neighbor?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor did not expressly state that he accepted the agreement.\nB. No, because the neighbor had to put his signature on the document to make it a binding contract.\nC. Yes, because neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\nD. Yes, because the property owner created a binding contract when he prepared an agreement containing the agreed terms.\n"

Yes, because neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\n\nIn contract law, acceptance can be demonstrated through various forms of conduct, including actions that show a party's agreement to the terms of a proposed contract. In this scenario, the neighbor's tendering of the full sale price constitutes an act of acceptance, as it shows clear intent to fulfill the conditions set out in the agreement. This action creates a binding contract between the two parties, making the court likely to rule in favor of the neighbor if they pursue a case for specific performance. Specific performance is a legal remedy that requires the other party to fulfill their obligations under the contract, particularly when monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate the aggrieved party."
