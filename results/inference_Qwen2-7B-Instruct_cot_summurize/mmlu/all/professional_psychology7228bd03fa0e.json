The components typically involved in Needs Analysis include:\n\nA. Organization Analysis: This involves assessing the overall goals, strategies, and operational requirements of the organization to identify any gaps or needs for improvement.\n\nB. Task Analysis: This step focuses on identifying the specific tasks that employees need to perform effectively within their roles and determining the skills, knowledge, and abilities required to complete these tasks.\n\nC. Person Analysis: This component involves evaluating the current skills, knowledge, and abilities of the workforce to identify any mismatches between job requirements and employee capabilities.\n\nProgram Design is not a component of Needs Analysis itself but rather follows from it as part of the broader training development process. Program Design involves creating the actual training curriculum, content, delivery methods, and evaluation criteria based on the results of the Needs Analysis."
