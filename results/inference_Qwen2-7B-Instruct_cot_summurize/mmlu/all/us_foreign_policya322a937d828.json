They see it as a challenge to European global influence\n\nContemporary European liberal democrats often perceive American exceptionalism, which is the belief in America's unique role and destiny in the world, as a challenge to their own geopolitical influence. This perception stems from the fact that American foreign policy under the influence of exceptionalism often prioritizes American interests and values, sometimes at the expense of European allies' concerns or autonomy. This can lead to a sense of being sidelined or overshadowed by American decisions and actions on the global stage."
