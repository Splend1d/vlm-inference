This mode is more efficient as it reduces power loss and improves the inverter's performance.\n\nIn an underdamped RLC circuit, the load capacitance is high enough that it can provide sufficient energy to assist in switching off the inverter switches during the zero crossing of the AC output, thus facilitating load commutation."
