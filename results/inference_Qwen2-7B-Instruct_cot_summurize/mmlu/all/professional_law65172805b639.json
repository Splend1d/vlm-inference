After several hours, both the friend and the defendant passed out. In the middle of the night, the defendant awoke with a headache. He went down to the kitchen and poured himself another shot of whiskey. The defendant also felt hungry and decided to make himself some eggs. After fixing his snack, he inadvertently forgot to turn off the stove. A gas leak occurred, causing a fire that burned down the house. If the defendant is charged with arson, he will be found\n\nA. guilty, because the defendant was reckless.\nB. guilty, because the defendant was criminally negligent.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant did not commit a felony.\nD. not guilty, because arson requires the presence of malice.\n"

Criminal negligence occurs when a person fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. By pouring himself more alcohol, preparing food, and forgetting to turn off the stove, the defendant demonstrated a lack of due care for the safety of himself and others, which contributed to the fire. This behavior could be seen as a gross deviation from the expected level of caution under the circumstances.\n\nIt's important to note that the determination of guilt or innocence in a real-life case would depend on the specific laws and legal standards of the jurisdiction where the crime took place, as well as the evidence presented during the trial. The factors mentioned here provide a general understanding based on common definitions of criminal negligence."
