During the jury trial, eyewitnesses gave conflicting testimony on the arrest. At the close of evidence, the protester moved for judgment as a matter of law, which the court denied. The court instructed the jury that the protester\u00d5s burden of proof was clear and convincing evidence, rather than the correct burden of preponderance of the evidence. The jury returned a verdict for the officer, and the court entered judgment accordingly. What is the protester\u00d5s best option for challenging the judgment?\n\nA. Seek a new trial, because the jury instruction affected the protester\u00d5s substantial rights.\nB. Seek a new trial, because the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence.\nC. Seek judgment as a matter of law, because the jury did not have legally sufficient evidence to find for the officer.\nD. Seek judgment as a matter of law, because the jury\u00d5s findings were clearly erroneous.\n"

Seek a new trial, because the jury instruction affected the protester's substantial rights.\n\nThe protester's best option for challenging the judgment would be to appeal the case and seek a new trial based on the incorrect jury instruction regarding the burden of proof. This is because the judge's misdirection of the jury in instructing them to apply the standard of \"clear and convincing evidence\" instead of the correct \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard likely influenced the outcome of the case. This error affects the protester's substantial rights and justifies seeking a new trial.\n\nThe other options are not as strong justifications for overturning the judgment:\n\nB. Seeking a new trial because the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence would require showing that the jury's decision was so unreasonable that it should not stand. This is a more subjective assessment and is typically reserved for cases where the evidence is overwhelming and the jury's decision is clearly mistaken.\n\nC. Seeking judgment as a matter of law because the jury did not have legally sufficient evidence to find for the officer would require demonstrating that there was no evidence to support the officer's defense. However, since the jury found in favor of the officer, this suggests that there was at least some evidence supporting the officer's actions.\n\nD. Seeking judgment as a matter of law because the jury's findings were clearly erroneous would require proving that the jury's factual findings were incorrect. Given that the jury made a finding, this would also be a difficult argument to make, especially if the jury's decision was based on conflicting eyewitness testimony.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the strongest basis for challenging the judgment due to the potential impact of the incorrect jury instruction."
