The amount that decays or remains can be calculated based on the number of half-lives that have passed.\n\n- After 1 half-life, 50% of the isotope has decayed and 50% remains.\n- After 2 half-lives, another 50% of the remaining isotope decays (leaving 25% ( (50% of the original isotope).\n- After 3 half-lives, another 50% of what's left decays, leaving 12.5% of the original isotope.\n\nSo, after 3 half-lives, 25% of the isotope would remain. Therefore, option A is correct."
