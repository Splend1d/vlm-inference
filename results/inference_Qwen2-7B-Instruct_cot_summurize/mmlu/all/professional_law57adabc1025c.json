A state law was subsequently passed requiring the city to prepare a general plan governing both land use and open-space development. The city's plan, with new density requirements, effectively limited development of the five-acre lot to a total of one to five single family residences. The partnership sued the city, asking for a declaratory judgment that the city had taken its property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The partnership lost at the local and appellate levels. The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case \u0080\u0094 what did it decide?\n\nA. This was illegal spot zoning that was unconstitutional.\nB. This was an unlawful taking without prior notice and therefore unconstitutional.\nC. The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional.\nD. The law was a violation of the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n"

The United States Supreme Court decided that the city's plan, which effectively limited the development of the five-acre lot to a total of one to five single-family residences, was constitutional. The court ruled that the city's action was not an illegal \"spot zoning\" because the change in zoning applied to all similar properties in the area, not just to this specific parcel. It also determined that the decrease in the value of the property due to the new density restrictions was not a taking that required compensation under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because the restrictions were part of a general plan designed to promote public welfare."
