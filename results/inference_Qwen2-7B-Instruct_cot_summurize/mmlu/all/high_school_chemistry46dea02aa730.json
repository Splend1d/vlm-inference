                    "text": "The correct answer is C. As5+. \n\nTo understand why, let's look at the electron configurations for each ion:\n\nA. Rb+ ( has an electron configuration of [Kr]. Rubidium (Rb) is in period 5 and group 1 of the periodic table, which means it has 37 electrons. Losing one electron to form the Rb+ ion leaves it with the electron configuration of krypton ([Kr]), which has 36 electrons.\n\nB. Se2- has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s^2 3d^10 4p^4. Selenium (Se) is in period 4 and group 16 of the periodic table, which means it has 34 electrons. Gaining two electrons to form the Se2- ion adds two electrons to its outer shell, giving it the electron configuration of argon ([Ar]) plus two more electrons, resulting in the configuration mentioned.\n\nC. As5+ has an electron configuration of [Kr]4d^10 5s^1 5p^3. Antimony (As) is in period 5 and group 15 of the periodic table, which means it has 49 electrons. Losing five electrons to form the As5+ ion removes five electrons from its outer shell, giving it the electron configuration of krypton ([Kr]) plus ten electrons from the 4d subshell, one electron from the 5s subshell, and three electrons from the 5p subshell.\n\nD. Sr2+ has an electron configuration of [Kr]. Strontium (Sr) is in period 5 and group 2 of the periodic table, which means it has 38 electrons. Losing two electrons to form the Sr2+ ion leaves it with the electron configuration of krypton ([Kr]), which has 36 electrons.\n\nSo, the As5+ ion has a different electron configuration than the others because it has removed electrons from multiple subshells rather than just one, as the other ions do."
