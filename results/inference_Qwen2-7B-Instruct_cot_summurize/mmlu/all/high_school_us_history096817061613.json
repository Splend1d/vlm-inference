It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?\n\nA.

Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois\n\nThe Iroquois were known for practicing mixed agriculture, which involved cultivating a variety of crops, including maize ( (corn), beans, and squash, in addition to hunting, fishing, and gathering wild foods. This system, known as the Three Sisters, was beneficial because the beans provided nitrogen to the soil, the corn provided a structure for the beans to climb, and the squash covered the ground, suppressing weeds and retaining moisture. The Iroquois' agricultural practices demonstrate a balance between cultivating staple crops like maize while also incorporating other resources to ensure food security.\n\nIn contrast, the options provided do not accurately reflect the practice of maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico:\n\nA. Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux refers to the hunting of buffalo, a significant part of the Lakota Sioux's subsistence and cultural life but not directly related to maize cultivation.\n\nB. Wolf domestication by the Algonquians involves the domestication of wolves, which is not related to agricultural practices or maize cultivation.\n\nD. Seal hunting among the Inuit involves the hunting of seals, another aspect of Inuit subsistence but not connected to maize cultivation."
