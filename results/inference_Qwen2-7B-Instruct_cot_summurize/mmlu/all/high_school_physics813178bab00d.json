This principle is known as the superposition principle in electrostatics. Mathematically, the electric field \\(E\\) at a distance \\(r\\) from a point charge \\(q\\) is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{k|q|}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant. If we have a system of multiple point charges, the total electric field at any point is the vector sum of the individual fields contributions. However, when measuring the electric field with a test charge, we typically consider the limit where the test charge is so small that its presence does not significantly alter the electric field around the source charges. \n\nIn this case, both Experimenter A using a test charge \\(q_0\\) and Experimenter B using a test charge \\(2q_0\\) would measure the same electric field strength between the parallel plates because the electric field lines are uniform and do not depend on the magnitude of the test charge. The direction might be the same for both, but the magnitude (and thus the strength of the electric field they measure, assuming no other influences like acceleration effects due to the charges' movement which was not mentioned in the question - will be identical."
