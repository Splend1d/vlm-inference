These plants have a mutualistic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. \n\nLegumes, such as peas, beans, and clovers, form a symbiotic relationship with certain types of bacteria called rhizobia. These bacteria live in nodules on the roots of the legume plants. In this relationship, the bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by the plant (a process called nitrogen fixation. In return, the plant provides the bacteria with carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis. This mutualistic relationship allows legumes to thrive in nitrogen-poor soils without needing to rely on external sources of nitrogen."
