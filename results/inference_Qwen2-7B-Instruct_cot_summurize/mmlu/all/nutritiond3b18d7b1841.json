                    "text": "The correct statement about intestinal motility is:\n\nB. The release of insulin after eating a meal will slow the emptying of the stomach.\n\nInsulin, released by the pancreas after consuming a meal, helps regulate blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells. This process can also have an effect on the digestive system by slowing down gastric emptying, allowing the body more time to absorb nutrients.\n\nTo clarify the other options:\n\nA. The migrating motor complex ( This refers to a series of spontaneous contractions that occur in the gut when it's not actively digesting food. It's part of the resting tone of the gastrointestinal tract and helps maintain its health rather than moving food after a meal.\n\nC. At the start of a meal, the stomach increases its \"tone\" in order to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents, via the pylorus. This statement is partially correct. The stomach does indeed increase its tone (or \"tonicity\") to mix and break down food, but it doesn't necessarily develop pressure to expel its contents through the pylorus right away. The pyloric sphincter opens as needed to allow food to pass from the stomach to the small intestine.\n\nD. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, slows intestinal motility. While the presence of undigested substances like fats and starches can influence the speed of digestion, they don't directly cause a slowdown in intestinal motility. Instead, these substances may require more enzymatic activity to be broken down, which could indirectly affect the rate of digestion."
