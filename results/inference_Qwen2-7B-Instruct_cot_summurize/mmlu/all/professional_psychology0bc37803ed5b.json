It has asymmetrical frequency distributions\n\nExplanation: A skewed distribution refers to a situation where the data is not evenly distributed around the mean, leading to an asymmetry in the shape of the distribution. This means the distribution leans more to one side than the other. The other options describe characteristics of a normal or Gaussian distribution, which is symmetric and bell-shaped."
