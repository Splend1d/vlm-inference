These events disrupt the normal functioning of markets by affecting the availability or cost of inputs necessary for production, thereby impacting the supply side of an economy.\n\nA vertical Phillips curve represents a situation where there is no trade-off between unemployment and inflation in the long run. Supply shocks can contribute to such a scenario if they lead to persistent inflation without a corresponding decrease in unemployment.\n\nStructural shocks refer to changes in the underlying structure of an economy that may not be temporary, such as technological advancements or policy reforms. While these can also affect economic outcomes, droughts and technical glitches are specifically related to supply-side disruptions.\n\nDemand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, typically driven by factors like increased spending or lower interest rates. While droughts and other supply shocks can contribute to higher prices due to reduced supply, they do not directly cause demand-pull inflation."
