A new partnership of nations has begun. And we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective\u2014a new world order\u2014can emerge; a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony.\n\u2014President George Herbert Walker Bush, Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, September 11, 1990\nPresident Bush's \"new world order\" most directly resembles which of the following?\n\nA. The Monroe Doctrine\nB. Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\"\nC. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points\nD. Containment policy toward the Soviet Union\n"

                    "text": "President Bush's \"new world order\" most directly resembles option D: Containment policy toward the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine, established in 1823, was a U.S. policy that warned European powers not to reestablish colonies in the Americas. It did not involve a global policy or framework.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\" diplomacy emphasized the use of military power and strong leadership to promote American interests abroad, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nWoodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points were a set of principles proposed by President Wilson during World War I, aiming for a just peace that included self-determination, freedom of the seas, and disarmament. While they were a vision for post-war international relations, they did not specifically target the Soviet Union or imply a containment strategy.\n\nContainment policy, developed during the Cold War, was a strategic approach to limit the spread of communism. This policy involved political, economic, and military efforts to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence globally. President Bush's reference to a \"new world order\" after the Gulf War implies a desire for a global system where nations cooperate to prevent aggression, which aligns closely with the principles of containment policy aimed at managing international relations in the face of a global superpower adversary."
