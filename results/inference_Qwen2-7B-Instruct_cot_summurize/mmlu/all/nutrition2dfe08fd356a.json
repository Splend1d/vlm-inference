An increase in basal metabolic rate that is not fully explained by a change in body composition during chronic overfeeding\n\nAdaptive thermogenesis refers to the body's ability to adjust its metabolic rate as an adaptation to changes in environmental conditions, particularly changes in temperature and energy availability. When exposed to cold, for example, adaptive thermogenesis involves mechanisms that increase heat production to maintain body temperature, such as increased shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis.\n\nHowever, when referring specifically to \"chronic overfeeding\", it implies a change in energy availability rather than temperature. In this context, adaptive thermogenesis refers to the body's response to increased caloric intake, which can lead to an increase in basal metabolic rate ( or the number of calories burned at rest. This increase is not solely due to changes in body composition ( like fat gain or muscle gain, but also includes adjustments in metabolic efficiency and other physiological responses to maintain homeostasis and energy balance."
