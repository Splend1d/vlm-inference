Psychologists working in these communities should clarify their role vis-\u00e0-vis traditional healers.\n\nIt's crucial for psychologists to understand and respect the cultural context and practices within minority communities. Awareness of traditional healers' roles can help psychologists integrate their expertise into their practice, ensuring that they complement rather than compete with existing community practices. This approach fosters trust and can enhance the effectiveness of psychological interventions by addressing both the psychological and cultural needs of clients. It also promotes a holistic view of health and wellness, which is often more aligned with the client's worldview. Therefore, clear communication about the psychologist's role and how it interacts with traditional healing practices is essential for collaborative care and effective treatment."
