All returns were filed on the original due date. The proposed adjustment relates to the disallowance of corporate jet usage for personal reasons. The agent does not find the error to be fraudulent or substantial in nature. Which of the following statements regarding this adjustment is correct?\n\nA. The adjustment is improper because an agent may only propose adjustments to the year under examination.\nB. The adjustment is proper because there is no statute of limitations for improperly claiming personal expenses as business expenses\nC. The adjustment is proper because it relates to a change in accounting method, which can be made retroactively irrespective of the statute of limitations.\nD. The adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. The adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment.\n\nExplanation: Generally, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS has three years from the date a tax return was filed to audit it. This period can extend to six years if there's an understatement of more than 25% of the tax owed. However, in cases where there's fraud or a substantial understatement of income, there is no time limit for the IRS to audit the return. Since the agent acknowledges that the error is not fraudulent or substantial in nature, it falls outside these exceptions. Thus, proposing an adjustment for years beyond the standard three-year window would be improper, unless there's a specific exception applicable in this case, which is not mentioned. \n\nOptions A, B, and C either misinterpret the rules around the statute of limitations for tax audits or incorrectly state that adjustments can be made retroactively without considering the expiration of the statute of limitations."
