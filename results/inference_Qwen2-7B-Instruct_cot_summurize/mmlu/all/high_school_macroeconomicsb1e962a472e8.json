When such a policy leads to a large increase in real output (the total value of goods and services produced) and a small increase in the price level, it suggests that the economy was operating below its full capacity. This means there were some unemployed resources, such as labor and capital, which could be utilized without causing significant inflation. \n\nHere's why the other options are not necessarily correct:\n\nA. Inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus. - The small increase in the price level suggests that inflation might have been low or manageable before the fiscal stimulus, not that it was already impacting the economy heavily.\n\nC. Aggregate supply decreased. - An increase in real output with a small price level increase would typically indicate that aggregate supply has actually increased rather than decreased, because more output is being produced at relatively the same price level.\n\nD. Aggregate demand is steeply sloped. - A steeply sloping aggregate demand curve implies that a small change in the price level leads to a large change in the quantity demanded. However, the scenario described indicates that while there was an increase in real output, the price level did not increase proportionally, suggesting that the increase in demand may not have been as steeply sloped as implied by option D."
