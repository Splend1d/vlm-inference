She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week, an SRS of 30 seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week, and an SRS of 30 sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group. After one school year, the mean GPAs from each group will be compared. Is this a good experimental design?\n\nA. Yes.\nB. No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\nC. No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.\nD. No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\n"

No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThis experimental design has several limitations that prevent it from establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between the amount of reading and GPA. First, it lacks random assignment to the different conditions ( the groups are not randomly selected from the population, but rather selected based on grade level. This means that any differences observed in GPA could be due to other factors associated with grade level, such as prior knowledge or teaching methods.\n\nSecond, the lack of a control for the amount of reading outside of the intervention means that we cannot isolate the effect of the additional reading time. Students in all groups are already reading at their own pace, so it's unclear how much of any difference in GPA is due to the extra reading time versus their pre-existing reading habits.\n\nThird, the design does not account for individual differences in student motivation, interest, or learning style, which can also influence GPA. These factors might affect how students use the extra reading time provided.\n\nLastly, the sample size is small relative to the number of variables being tested ( three separate groups with different amounts of reading time, which might not provide enough statistical power to detect meaningful differences if they exist.\n\nTherefore, while the study may suggest correlations between reading time and GPA, it cannot definitively conclude that increased reading time causes higher GPA without controlling for these potential confounding variables and ensuring that the assignment of groups was randomized."
