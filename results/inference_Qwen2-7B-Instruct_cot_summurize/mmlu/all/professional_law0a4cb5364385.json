The offeree sent a notification to the offeror stating, \"We have received your offer to sell landscaping stone per specified terms this date.\" The offeror shipped the goods upon receiving that notification. On the date of shipment, the offeree posted an acceptance form with slight modifications to the terms. After the goods arrived, the offeree called the offeror's manager and told him that the company was unable to accept the offer at this time, he was shipping the goods back, and to \"ignore any paperwork we sent.\" The offeror sued the offeree for breach of contract. Who will prevail?\n\nA. The offeror will prevail because the posting of the acceptance finalized a contract between the parties.\nB. The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.\nC. The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.\nD. The offeree will prevail because it rejected the offer when it called the offeror's manager.\n"

The offeror will prevail because the posting of the acceptance finalized a contract between the parties.\n\nThe key point here is whether there was a valid acceptance of the offer. In contract law, an acceptance must mirror the terms of the offer precisely unless the offeror has previously agreed to modify the terms. The fact that the offeree posted an acceptance form with slight modifications suggests that they were attempting to accept the offer but wanted to make changes. However, since the offeror shipped the goods upon receiving the initial notification, which could be interpreted as a tacit or implied acceptance, the contract may have been formed at that point.\n\nThe subsequent call from the offeree stating that they were unable to accept the offer at that time and shipping the goods back might indicate a rejection of the contract or a communication of intent not to adhere to the terms already accepted. However, without a clear legal document that explicitly communicates rejection and cancellation of the contract, the court might still consider the initial shipment and acceptance process as forming a binding contract.\n\nLegal proceedings would likely focus on the specifics of the communications, the terms of the offer, and the conduct of both parties in determining whether a contract was formed and then breached. In many jurisdictions, if the offeror sends goods based on an acceptance, this can be seen as a form of performance that constitutes a valid acceptance, even if it's not in writing or exactly as specified. Therefore, the offeror might have grounds to argue that a contract was formed upon shipment and that the offeree breached it by subsequently attempting to reject it.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on general principles of contract law and may vary depending on specific legal jurisdiction and the exact wording and context of the communications involved. For precise legal advice, consulting with a lawyer who specializes in contract law would be advisable."
