This differentiation allows firms to engage in some degree of pricing power, but the presence of many competitors limits this power. In such an environment, firms often invest heavily in advertising and product differentiation to attract customers and gain a competitive advantage. The other options do not specifically define monopolistic competition:\n\nA. Strong barriers to entry are more typical of oligopolies or monopolies rather than monopolistic competition.\nB. A long-run price exceeding average total cost is not a defining feature of monopolistic competition; instead, firms operate where price equals marginal cost in the long run.\nC. A price exceeding average variable cost causing excess capacity is more indicative of a perfectly competitive market or a market with imperfect competition, where firms may be unable to cover their variable costs."
