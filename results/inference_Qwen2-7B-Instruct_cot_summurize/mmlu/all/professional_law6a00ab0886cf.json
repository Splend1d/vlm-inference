The defendant is alleged to have masterminded a scheme wherein he set up a nonexistent corporation that never conducted business. The victims were sent prospectuses containing false financial data, which induced them to purchase stock in the phony corporation. At trial, the prosecution seeks to introduce into evidence proof that the defendant had set up 10 other so-called dummy corporations that never existed. This evidence is\n\nA. admissible, to show defendant's character trait for dishonesty.\nB. admissible, to show his intent to defraud.\nC. inadmissible, because character cannot be proved by specific instances of misconduct.\nD. inadmissible, because the evidence is not relevant.\n"

This is because it suggests a pattern or modus operandi consistent with the charge of false pretenses, indicating that the defendant had a history of setting up and operating fraudulent corporations to deceive others. This evidence can help establish the defendant's motive and plan to defraud the victims by misrepresenting the existence and financial health of the corporations they invested in."
