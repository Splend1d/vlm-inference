Proximity, Temporal immediacy, Social dissensus.\n\nThese three factors - Proximity, Temporal immediacy, and Social dissensus - can significantly influence the moral intensity of an issue or situation. \n\n1. **Proximity**: This refers to how close or related someone feels to the people or things involved in the situation. The closer one feels to the affected individuals, the stronger their emotional response and the higher the moral intensity they might perceive.\n\n2. **Temporal immediacy**: This factor concerns whether the consequences of an action are immediate or delayed. Immediate consequences often have a higher moral intensity because they evoke a more direct sense of responsibility.\n\n3. **Social dissensus**: This refers to the disagreement or lack of consensus within society about what is morally right or wrong regarding a particular issue. When there is significant social dissensus, it can increase the moral intensity of the issue as people may feel more compelled to take a stand on their beliefs.\n\nIt's important to note that 'social consensus' was mentioned in the question but is not one of the options provided in the answer choices. 'Cultural immediacy' was also included in the distractor options but isn't a term typically used in discussions of moral intensity. The term 'futility of effect' could refer to the perceived lack of meaningful outcome from actions, which isn't directly listed among the answer choices either."
