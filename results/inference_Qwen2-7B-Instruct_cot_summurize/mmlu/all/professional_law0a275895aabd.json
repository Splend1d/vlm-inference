                    "text": "A homeowner died in 1985. His will devised his estate in a southern state to his uncle and his best friend \"to share and share alike as tenants in common. \"At the time of the homeowner's death, the uncle lived in a different part of the southern state (in which the estate was located), while the best friend resided in a northern state. After the homeowner's funeral, the uncle returned to his own residence, but the best friend decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. To earn extra money, the best friend rented a small house on the property to a teacher and received a monthly rental payment from her. The best friend also grew fruits on the property and sold them at a stand on Fridays. The uncle has been generally aware of this, but because he cared little about the estate, the uncle has never pressed the best friend about the property. Since 1985 the uncle has not paid any rent or other compensation to the best friend, nor has the best friend requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the uncle and the best friend for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and follows majority rules on rents and profits. There is no applicable legislation on the subject. The uncle brings an appropriate action for a portion of the proceeds that the best friend received from his fruit stand and a portion of the rent that the teacher paid. If the best friend contests the apportionment of the monies he received, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops and the rents paid by the teacher.\nB. As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops, and the uncle is entitled to a share of the rent paid by the teacher.\nC. The uncle is entitled to a share of the rent that the teacher paid and the profits from the best friend's crops.\nD. The uncle is entitled to no share of any of the monies raised because the uncle's lack of contact with the best friend will be deemed a waiver.\n"

                    "text": "In the scenario provided, the best friend has been occupying and managing the estate since the homeowner's death, paying taxes, maintaining the property, renting out a house, and selling fruits. This behavior indicates that the best friend has been in possession of the property as a tenant in common with the uncle, sharing and sharing alike as per the homeowner's will.\n\nGiven that the state recognizes the common law types of cotenancies and follows majority rules on rents and profits, the best friend would likely retain control over the fruits' profits and the rent payments from the teacher under the principle of joint tenancy with right of survivorship. This principle allows each tenant in common to manage the property according to their wishes, within reason, without interference from the other tenants unless specifically terms dictate otherwise.\n\nThe uncle's lack of contact with the best friend does not necessarily constitute a waiver of his rights under the law, especially if he was unaware of the best friend's actions until the disputes in 2010. However, the law typically requires some form of notice or communication regarding the division of property among co-tenants. Without clear evidence that the uncle consented to the best friend's actions, the court would likely interpret the uncle's passive behavior as a lack of objection rather than a waiver of his rights.\n\nConsidering these factors, the correct answer would likely lean towards option B: As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops, and the uncle is entitled to a share of the rent paid by the teacher. This interpretation assumes that the uncle's rights were not waived due to his lack of contact and that the best friend's actions were reasonable and within the bounds of a tenant in common's responsibilities."
