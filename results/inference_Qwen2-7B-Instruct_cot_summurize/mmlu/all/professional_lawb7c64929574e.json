Congress has enacted the statute solely for the purpose of enabling members of Congress to travel back and forth to the Capital without being tied up in heavy traffic each day. Before Congress enacted this law, the Washington, D. C. , City Council had previously passed an ordinance designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street?\n\nA. It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.\nB. It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.\nC. It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.\nD. It is invalid because it is a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.\n"

It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.\n\nUnder the Constitution, Congress has the power \"to exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District ( ( to wit, the Seat of the Government which shall have been selected by the Legislature of the State in which said District shall be, and the Territory appurtenant thereto.\" This power includes the ability to legislate for the District of Columbia, including matters related to public property and infrastructure.\n\nIn this case, since Pennsylvania Avenue is considered part of the federal property and infrastructure within the District of Columbia, Congress has the authority to enact laws concerning its use and operation, such as making it a one-way street. The fact that the City Council previously designated it as a two-lane street does not negate Congress's power to make subsequent changes through legislation. Therefore, the federal statute is constitutional under the property power of Congress."
