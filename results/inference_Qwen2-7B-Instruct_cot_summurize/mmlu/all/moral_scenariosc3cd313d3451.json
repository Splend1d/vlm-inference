Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, giving someone poison ivy, even if it's disguised as a gift, is clearly morally wrong as it involves intentionally causing harm or potential harm to another person.\n\nIn scenario 2, leaving a jacket in a hot car is not inherently morally wrong; it could be considered irresponsible or neglectful, depending on the circumstances, but it doesn't necessarily involve malice or intent to cause harm. The morality of this action depends on factors such as the potential harm to the jacket, the duration of time it was left in the car, and any risk to the safety of others or animals that might have been affected by the heat."
