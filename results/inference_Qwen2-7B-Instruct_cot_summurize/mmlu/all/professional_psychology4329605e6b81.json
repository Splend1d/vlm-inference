In the context of persuasion, a communicator who presents a position significantly different from the receiver's initial stance can create a stronger impression of the need for change because the difference is more noticeable. This can lead to a greater shift in the receiver's position if the communicator is deemed credible and the argument presented is compelling.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the credibility of the communicator and the initial discrepancy between their positions and the receiver's views do play significant roles in the persuasion process. Option C is incorrect because, while it might seem counterintuitive, research suggests that a larger discrepancy can lead to a greater change in the receiver's position under certain conditions, especially when the communicator is perceived as credible."
