Poor cognitive development\n\nWhile all the options you've provided may be associated with vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in various ways, option B is the most directly linked to cognitive development. Vitamin A plays a crucial role in vision, immune function, and cell differentiation, but it also supports brain development and cognitive functions.\n\n- A: Goitre refers to an enlargement of the thyroid gland, which is not typically a direct result of vitamin A deficiency.\n- C: Poor bone growth can be related to vitamin A deficiency because it's involved in the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus needed for bone health, but it's not the primary effect compared to cognitive development.\n- D: Increased risk of mortality is indeed a serious consequence of VAD, as it weakens the immune system, making children more susceptible to infections, which can be fatal. However, while this is a significant impact, poor cognitive development is often seen as a more direct and immediate effect on children's health and development.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most accurate choice when considering the direct effects of vitamin A deficiency on children."
