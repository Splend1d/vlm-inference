The bandwagon fallacy specifically occurs when someone argues that something must be true or good simply because many other people believe it to be so.\n\nIn general, an \"appeal to the people\" can be seen as a type of logical fallacy where someone tries to win an argument by gaining the support of the audience rather than presenting valid reasoning."
