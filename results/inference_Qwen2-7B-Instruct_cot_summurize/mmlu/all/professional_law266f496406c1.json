Yes, as a statement of an opposing party.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against an opponent and is the statement of the opponent. In this case, the defendant's statement to the FBI investigator regarding the offer to provide information about a large-scale fraud in exchange for the investigator's promise to \"stop worrying about a little vacation\" is considered a statement made by the defendant (the opposing party. Therefore, this statement is admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(A) as it is part of the defendant's statement made during the course of the investigation against the defendant.\n\nIt's important to note that the context of the conversation and the circumstances under which the statement was made may affect its admissibility and weight in court. However, based solely on the information provided, the statement qualifies as a statement of an opposing party."
