                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Antigenic variation.\n\nAntigenic variation refers to the ability of certain pathogens, like Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the causative agent for gonorrhea) to change their surface proteins, which can allow them to evade the host's immune system. This means that even if the body has previously mounted an immune response against the pathogen, it might not be able to recognize and effectively neutralize the new form of the pathogen when it re-infects. This property facilitates recurrent infections in sexually active individuals, especially those with multiple sex partners, as they are repeatedly exposed to variants of the same strain."
