The characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is 3 because adding the multiplicative identity (1) three times gives us back the additive identity (0).\n\n- \\( 3\\mathbb{Z} \\) is the set of all multiples of 3, i.e., {..., -6*3, ..., 0, ..., +n*3, ...}. This is an infinite set, but when considered in the context of a ring, it can be thought of as the integers modulo some number that makes sense in the context of the operations within the ring. Since we're dealing with a direct product with \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), the characteristic of \\( 3\\mathbb{Z} \\) effectively \"collapses\" into the context of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) because any multiple of 3 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) will give 0 ( since \\( 3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\). Thus, the characteristic of \\( 3\\mathbb{Z} \\) in this context is also 3.\n\nWhen considering the direct product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times 3\\mathbb{Z} \\), the characteristic of the resulting ring is the least common multiple (LCM of the characteristics of its components. Since both have a characteristic of 3, the characteristic of the direct product ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times 3\\mathbb{Z} \\) is 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3"
