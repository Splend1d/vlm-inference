A fusion crust - This is formed when the meteorite burns up in the Earth's atmosphere, and suggests an extraterrestrial origin.\nB. Solidified spherical droplets - These are often called \"tektites\" and are formed when a meteorite vaporizes upon impact, then re-solidifies. They are also evidence of an extraterrestrial origin.\nD. Different elemental composition than Earth - Meteorites typically have a composition similar to that of asteroids or other celestial bodies, which may differ from the Earth's composition.\n\nOn the other hand, being highly processed does not necessarily mean it is a meteorite. Processing can occur in various ways on Earth, such as through geological processes like weathering, erosion, and metamorphism, which could alter the original composition or appearance of the rock. Therefore, this characteristic alone would not necessarily suggest that a rock is a meteorite."
