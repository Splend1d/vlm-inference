Copyright law specifically deals with original works of authorship, such as literary works, music, art, and software. It grants the creator exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, display, perform, and create derivative works based on their creation. Trademark law, on the other hand, protects signs or symbols that identify and distinguish products or services of one company from those of others. Both laws aim to encourage creativity and innovation by providing creators and owners with legal protections for their intellectual property."
