A buyer sent a signed letter to a seller that stated: \"Ship 100 boxes of nails at $3 per box, the price quoted in your circular.\" The seller mailed the buyer a signed form acknowledgment that agreed to the buyer's terms and stated on the reverse side: \"Disputes regarding quality shall be arbitrated.\" The buyer did not reply to the seller's acknowledgment, and the seller shipped the nails. When the buyer received the nails, it found their quality to be unsatisfactory and sued the seller for breach of warranty. The seller has asked an attorney whether the parties' contract requires arbitration of the buyer's claim. What is the best advice the attorney can provide?\n\nA. A contract was formed pursuant to conduct when the buyer received the nails, and a court would exclude the arbitration provision from the contract.\nB. A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract. arbitration term became part of the contract.\nC. A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.\nD. No contract exists, because the arbitration term in the seller's acknowledgment created a counteroffer that the buyer never accepted.\n"

A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen the buyer sent the initial letter with the order, it was an offer by the buyer. The seller's acknowledgment, which included the arbitration clause, was a response to this offer. In this scenario, the acknowledgment acts as a counter-offer since it includes additional terms (in this case, the arbitration clause). If the buyer does not object to these additional terms within a reasonable time, the counter-offer becomes a binding contract between the buyer and the seller.\n\nThe arbitration clause in the acknowledgment is thus considered part of the contract once the buyer received the acknowledgment without objection. Therefore, the best advice the attorney can provide is that there is a contract formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract. \n\nIn this situation, the arbitration term would typically govern disputes regarding quality, including the buyer's current claim about the unsatisfactory quality of the nails. The buyer would have to follow the procedures outlined in the arbitration agreement to resolve any disputes."
