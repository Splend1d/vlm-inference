She is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. Her mother is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall. There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. The same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother?\n\nA. It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother\nB. It is a polymorphism\nC. It is a sequence variant of unknown significance\nD. It will change the folding of the protein\n"

It is a sequence variant of unknown significance\n\nThe description provided indicates that the single nucleotide difference does not change the amino acid at that locus, suggesting that it does not directly cause a disease phenotype. The fact that this mutation is also found in 15 out of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome suggests it might be a polymorphism or a sequence variant of unknown significance. Polymorphisms are common genetic variations present in a population, and some can be associated with increased risk for certain diseases. However, without more information about the functional impact of the mutation, it's classified as \"variant of unknown significance.\" Therefore, option C is the most appropriate choice given the information provided."
