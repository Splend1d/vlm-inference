This could imply that even the \"average\" homes in the city were quite impressive or well-constructed, indicating a high standard of living for its inhabitants. However, this does not necessarily mean that all aspects of society were equal ( it could also suggest that wealth and resources were distributed in a way that allowed for a significant level of comfort and quality of life among the majority of the population, despite possible disparities in other societal roles or statuses."
