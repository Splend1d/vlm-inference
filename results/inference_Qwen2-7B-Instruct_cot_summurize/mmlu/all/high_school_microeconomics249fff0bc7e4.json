It is part of labor law and concerns the rights of workers to organize and bargain collectively. \n\nOn the other hand, B. The Sherman Act, C. The Clayton Act, and D. The Robinson-Patman Act are all significant antitrust laws in the United States:\n\n- The Sherman Act ( was enacted in 1890 and is the oldest federal antitrust law. Its main purpose is to prevent illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade.\n\n- The Clayton Act, enacted in 1914, strengthened antitrust laws by prohibiting certain specific business practices that were deemed anti-competitive, such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing contracts.\n\n- The Robinson-Patman Act, enacted in 1936, prohibits price discrimination that lessens competition or tends to create a monopoly.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. The Wagner Act."
