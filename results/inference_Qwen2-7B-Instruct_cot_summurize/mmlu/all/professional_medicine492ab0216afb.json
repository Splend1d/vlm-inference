He has no history of similar symptoms. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 110/50 mm Hg. A grade 3/6, diastolic blowing murmur is heard over the left sternal border and radiates to the right sternal border. Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Acute myocardial infarction\nB. Aortic dissection\nC. Esophageal rupture\nD. Mitral valve prolapse\n"

Acute Myocardial Infarction\n\nKey points that suggest this diagnosis:\n- The patient's age, hypertension, smoking history, and presentation with sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and hypotension ( \n- The presence of a diastolic blowing murmur heard over the left sternal border and radiating to the right sternal border, which could indicate elevated intracardiac pressures or pericardial effusion often seen in acute myocardial infarction.\n- Decreased femoral pulses bilaterally, which could suggest significant cardiac output reduction due to the myocardial infarction.\n- The ECG showing left ventricular hypertrophy can be seen in long-standing hypertension, but it is also a finding that may occur in acute myocardial infarction, particularly if the heart is compensating for the damage.\n\nWhile other options (B, C, and D might present with some overlapping symptoms, their characteristic signs and the context provided by the patient's history and exam findings point towards an acute myocardial infarction as the most probable diagnosis."
