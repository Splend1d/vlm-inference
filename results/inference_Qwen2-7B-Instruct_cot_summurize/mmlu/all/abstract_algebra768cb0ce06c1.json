Given three groups G, H, and K each of order 4, by the classification of finite abelian groups (or simply by enumeration for small orders, we know that any group of order 4 must be isomorphic to either \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4\\) ( (the cyclic group of order 4) or \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\) ( (the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2). Since there are only two possible structures for groups of order 4, it follows that at least two of the groups G, H, and K must have the same structure, and thus they are isomorphic.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is false. The claim that if \\(Z_r + Z_s\\) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \\(Z_m + Z_n\\), then \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\) does not hold in general. Consider \\(Z_3 + Z_5\\), which is a group of order 15 ( and is isomorphic to \\(Z_{15}\\). However, this does not imply that 3 divides some \\(m\\) and 5 divides some \\(n\\) when considering \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) as a whole, since \\(Z_{15}\\) itself could be considered as a subgroup of some larger \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) do not necessarily divide 3 or 5 respectively, depending on how they are structured together.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
