High dose \u03b2-carotene supplements\n\nWhile some studies have suggested that high doses of \u03b2-carotene supplements might increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers, this effect is not consistent across all studies and is generally considered to be less well-established than other risk factors for lung cancer.\n\nOther factors listed:\n- A. Saturated fat: There is no direct evidence linking saturated fat consumption to an increased risk of lung cancer.\n- B. Obesity: Obesity can increase the risk of several types of cancer, including lung cancer, but the exact mechanism is not fully understood.\n- D. Alcohol: While alcohol consumption has been linked to various health risks, including liver, breast, and mouth cancers, there is no strong evidence to suggest it directly increases the risk of lung cancer. However, smoking and alcohol consumption together significantly increase the risk of lung cancer."
