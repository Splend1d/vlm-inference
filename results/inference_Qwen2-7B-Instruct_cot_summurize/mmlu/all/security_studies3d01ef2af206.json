The strategy for state security that is preoccupied with creating and maintaining a distribution of power in the system, beneficial in terms of maintaining security and stability.\n\nThis perspective is often associated with the concept of \"security communities,\" where states cooperate to prevent conflict and ensure mutual security. It emphasizes the importance of institutions, norms, and rules in promoting peace and stability. This approach recognizes that security is not just about military capabilities but also about the political and economic relationships between states. \n\nAdditionally, this perspective incorporates elements from other approaches as well:\n- A. It acknowledges the social construction of threats, recognizing that what constitutes a threat is often culturally and politically constructed.\n- B. Peacekeeping, peace-making, and conflict prevention have become central activities in international relations, particularly after the Cold War, as global actors sought to avoid the horrors of large-scale conventional warfare and nuclear war.\n- C. Re-addressing past practices, such as colonialism and imperialism, as causes of insecurity has been a significant part of understanding contemporary conflicts and advocating for justice and reconciliation.\n\nHowever, the focus on maintaining a distribution of power, as seen in the balance of power theory, remains a core component of many security analyses in the post-Cold War era. This includes discussions around nuclear deterrence, arms control, and the role of international organizations in managing great power competition and regional tensions."
