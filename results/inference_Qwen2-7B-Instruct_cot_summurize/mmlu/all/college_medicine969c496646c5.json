Contact hypothesis: This theory suggests that intergroup contact can reduce prejudice if it is managed properly. The task force's recommendation of paid community improvement projects open to people from different, possibly conflicted, groups aligns with this hypothesis.\n\nIII. Hypothesis ( It seems like there might be a typo in your question here, as \"Hypothesis\" isn't a specific term or theory in social psychology. If you meant something like the \"stereotype threat hypothesis\" or another specific hypothesis, please clarify. However, assuming it was intended to refer to another specific theory or concept, the other two options cover well-established theories. \n\nIV. Legal hypothesis: This could refer to the idea that laws and ordinances can influence behavior and attitudes. The recommendation of stricter anti-hate ordinances at the local level align with this idea, as laws can indeed be a tool to reduce prejudice and hate crimes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would likely be B, assuming the intention was to include a specific theory or concept related to the other options listed. However, without clarification on \"Hypothesis,\" it's difficult to provide an exact match."
