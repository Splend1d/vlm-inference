This means that our responsibilities towards animals derive from our duties to other humans who have a relationship with those animals. For example, if we keep pets, we have a responsibility to care for them because of our duty to the people who own or care for those pets. Carruthers argues that this doesn't mean we don't have any direct duties to animals, but rather that they are secondary to our primary obligations to other humans."
