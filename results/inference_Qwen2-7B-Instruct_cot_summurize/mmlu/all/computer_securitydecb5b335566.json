Taking care to avoid activities during a penetration test that might attract attention, e.g., by operators or IDS services\n\nBeing \"stealthy\" in a penetration test means conducting the assessment in such a way as to minimize detection. This involves various techniques such as using legitimate credentials, avoiding suspicious network traffic patterns, and blending in with normal system activity. It doesn't necessarily mean being physically located in an undisclosed place (A), encrypting all communications (B), or performing the test without the knowledge of the target organization (though this last one is often a requirement of ethical hacking engagements). Instead, it's about conducting the test in a manner that does not trigger alerts or suspicion, allowing for more thorough discovery of vulnerabilities."
