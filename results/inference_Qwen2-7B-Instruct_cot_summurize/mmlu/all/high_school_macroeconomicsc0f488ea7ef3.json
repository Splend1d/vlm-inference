Higher interest rates that cause an increase in net exports.\n\nWhen higher interest rates lead to an increase in net exports, it offsets the stimulative effect of expansionary fiscal policy. Expansionary fiscal policy typically involves government spending increases or tax cuts, which aim to boost aggregate demand and economic growth. However, if higher interest rates attract foreign capital inflows due to the higher returns offered by the domestic economy, this can lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency. A stronger currency makes domestic goods more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially reducing net exports. Since net exports contribute positively to GDP, this offsetting effect of higher interest rates on net exports lessens the overall impact of expansionary fiscal policy."
