Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nAccording to contemporary American moral standards, hitting or using physical force to discipline children is generally considered morally wrong and abusive. This practice has been widely condemned by child welfare organizations and many legal systems, advocating for non-violent methods of discipline. \n\nOn the other hand, helping your child learn to ride a bike by giving the bike a tune-up is not considered a morally wrong act. In fact, it is seen as supportive and caring behavior, encouraging independence and skill development."
