Chickenshop's reply constitutes a counteroffer and no contract was formed.\n\nIn this scenario, Chickenshop's response introduces new terms (specifically referring to \"city scale weight certificate,\" which were not part of Calvin Poultry Co.'s original offer. This indicates that Chickenshop is not simply accepting the original terms but is instead proposing a modification or change to the agreement. Since the terms have been altered, this does not constitute an acceptance of Calvin's offer but rather a proposal of a new set of terms, which is considered a counteroffer. \n\nTherefore, no contract was formed based on the information provided because there was no mutual agreement on the same terms."
