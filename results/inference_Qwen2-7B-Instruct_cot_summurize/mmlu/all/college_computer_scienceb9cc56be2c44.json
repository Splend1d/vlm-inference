Even if the process is immediately terminated, the damage might have already been done, and the system could be compromised with lingering threats. Malicious code or backdoors left by the process may persist in the system's memory, registry, or files, making it necessary to thoroughly scan and clean the entire disk to remove these threats. Rebooting the machine or replacing files that show signs of virus infection might help to some extent, but it's not guaranteed to eliminate all traces of the threat. In severe cases, wiping the entire disk and reinstalling the operating system might be the most effective way to ensure the system is free from the malicious process's influence."
