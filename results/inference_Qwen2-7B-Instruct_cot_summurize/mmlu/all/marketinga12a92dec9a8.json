Value-based pricing.\n\nValue-based pricing is an approach where the price of a product or service is determined based on its perceived value to the customer, rather than on the cost of producing it. This method acknowledges that different customers may place different values on the same product, depending on their needs, preferences, and circumstances. The goal is to set prices that reflect the true value that the product offers to each individual customer, which can lead to higher profit margins if executed correctly.\n\nThe other options you provided do not accurately describe the starting point for the pricing process in relation to the customer:\n\nB. Cost-based pricing involves setting the price around the cost of production, including fixed and variable costs. It does not necessarily consider the customer's perception of value.\n\nC. Customer-led pricing suggests a model where customers themselves determine the price of products or services, often through mechanisms like auctions or marketplaces where supply and demand dictate the final price.\n\nD. Sales pricing typically refers to the practice of adjusting prices based on sales volume, market conditions, or promotional strategies. It doesn't inherently prioritize the customer's perspective on value."
