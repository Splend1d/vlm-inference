Among the options provided:\n\nA. Make inquiries of management concerning restrictions on the availability of cash balances. - This is a relevant procedure as it helps the CPA understand the liquidity position and any potential limitations on the use of cash, which can impact the financial statements.\n\nB. Communicate deficiencies in the design of internal control to the entity's audit committee. - While important for issuers, this step is less critical for nonissuers since they are not subject to the same regulatory reporting requirements.\n\nC. Examine trend analysis to determine the appropriateness of the CPA's assessment of detection risk. - Trend analysis might be used by CPAs to evaluate the consistency of financial data over time, but it is not a core procedure in a review engagement for nonissuers.\n\nD. Evaluate management's plans for dealing with negative trends and financial difficulties. - Although useful for understanding the entity's strategies, this is not a standard procedure in a review of financial statements for nonissuers.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate procedure for a CPA when reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer is **A. Make inquiries of management concerning restrictions on the availability of cash balances**."
