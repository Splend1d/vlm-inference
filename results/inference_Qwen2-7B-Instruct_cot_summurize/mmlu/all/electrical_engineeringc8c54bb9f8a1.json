                    "text": "Thin laminations are indeed used in machines, particularly in electric motors and transformers, to reduce both A. Eddy current losses and B. Hysteresis losses. \n\nEddy currents are induced currents that circulate within conductive materials when exposed to changing magnetic fields. They result in heat loss which can decrease the efficiency of the machine. By stacking thin sheets (laminations) of\u7edd\u7f18material like silicon steel or\u7535\u5de5\u94a2 between the windings, eddy currents are restricted to flow within each individual sheet rather than through the entire cross-section of the core, significantly reducing their effect.\n\nHysteresis losses occur due to the energy dissipated as the magnetic field is cycled on and off within the core material. This is because the magnetic domains in the core material take time to align with the external magnetic field, causing energy loss. By using thin laminations, the resistance to this reorientation is increased, thus reducing hysteresis losses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Both A and B."
