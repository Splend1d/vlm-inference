A group of five demonstrators who wanted to protest inadequate state funding for children's services applied for a permit to march single file on the sidewalk surrounding the capitol building. Each demonstrator planned to carry a two-foot-square sign that would read, \"Our lawmakers do not care about our children.\" The group's permit application was denied pursuant to the state law, and the group has filed an action challenging the law's constitutionality. Should the court uphold the law's constitutionality?\n\nA. No, because even though the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is more restrictive than needed to serve a legitimate government interest. government interest.\nB. No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.\nC. Yes, because even though the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is necessary to serve a compelling public interest.\nD. Yes, because the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is reasonable.\n"

Yes, because the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is reasonable.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that not all public property is necessarily a public forum for First Amendment purposes. In such non-public forums, governments have greater latitude in restricting speech based on considerations like maintaining order or avoiding disruption. If the capitol grounds and surrounding sidewalks are designated as a non-public forum by the state legislature, then the state can reasonably enact laws to maintain order and ensure the functionality of the capitol area. This includes limiting certain types of expressive activities, such as the display of signs, if doing so is necessary to achieve a legitimate government interest, such as preserving the aesthetic appearance and operational efficiency of the capitol building. Therefore, if the law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose and does not impose an excessive burden on speech, it could be upheld under the standards applicable to restrictions in non-public forums."
