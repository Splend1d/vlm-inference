This theory posits that in a mass society, controlled by large corporations and powerful institutions, the media serves to reinforce the status quo and the values of the dominant or ruling class. It assumes that people consume media content without critically analyzing it, leading to a homogenization of opinions and behaviors. Therefore, option C accurately represents a key aspect of the mass-society theory."
