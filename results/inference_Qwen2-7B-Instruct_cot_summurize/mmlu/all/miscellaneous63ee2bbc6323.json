The periodic table, as we know it today, largely took shape during this period, with scientists like Dmitri Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer organizing elements based on their properties and predicting the existence of undiscovered elements.\n\nHere's a brief overview:\n\n- **Late 18th to Early 19th Century**: Elements such as potassium (K), sodium (Na), and chlorine (Cl) were identified in the late 18th century.\n\n- **Mid-19th Century**: The mid-19th century saw significant advancements. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev published his first version of the periodic table, which helped organize known elements by atomic weight and predicted the existence of undiscovered elements based on gaps in the table. Mendeleev's work laid the foundation for modern chemistry.\n\n- **Late 19th to Early 20th Century**: During this period, many more elements were discovered, including:\n    - **Titanium (Ti** ( (1825)\n    - **Zinc (Zn** (discovered in the 16th century but its properties were not fully understood until later)\n    - **Antimony (Sb** (discovered around 3000 BC, but its properties were better understood in the 19th century)\n    - **Tellurium Te** ( (1817)\n    - **Mercury Hg** ( (discovered in ancient times but properties were further explored in the 19th century)\n    - **Radium Ra** ( (1898)\n    - **Polonium Po** ( (1898)\n\nThus, while elements were continuously being discovered throughout these centuries, the 19th century stands out for its pivotal role in the systematic understanding and discovery of chemical elements, leading to the comprehensive organization of the periodic table that we use today."
