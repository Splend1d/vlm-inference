Stealing is considered a violation of property rights and trust placed by others in one's integrity. The nurse in this scenario is likely employed by the organization and has access to its resources, but taking items for personal use without permission is theft.\n\nScenario 2 is not wrong. The individual going to work when they are scheduled to is an action that aligns with their job responsibilities. It's part of their employment agreement to be present during the hours they have been assigned. Therefore, there is no moral wrongdoing involved in showing up to work."
