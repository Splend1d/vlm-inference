A baseball player hits baseballs from a tee in order to build muscle memory.\nB. A concert flute player falls short of finishing a piece that has a very complex ending without mistakes\nC.

A high diver takes instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move.\n\nExplanation:\nVygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD refers to the difference between what a learner can do without help and what they can achieve with guidance and encouragement from a skilled partner. In other words, it's the range of tasks that a child can perform with the assistance of an adult or more capable peer.\n\nOption D describes a scenario where a high diver is taking instruction from her coach to improve her form, which aligns with the concept of ZPD. The diver cannot perform the task perfectly on their own but with the help and guidance of the coach, they can achieve a higher level of performance. \n\nOption A involves building muscle memory through repetitive practice, which is more related to skill acquisition rather than the ZPD concept. \n\nOption B talks about falling short of completing a complex piece, which doesn't specifically describe the process of learning and development through guidance. \n\nOption C involves submitting a paper for review, which might be an example of applying knowledge and skills learned independently, not necessarily within the context of ZPD."
