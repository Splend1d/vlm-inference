Investigative Surveillance\n\nThe Sixth Amendment's right to counsel applies once an individual has been \"accused\" of a crime, typically at the arraignment stage or after formal charges have been filed. Before this point, during investigative surveillance or preliminary hearings where there is no formal accusation, the defendant generally does not have the constitutional right to appointed counsel under the Sixth Amendment. However, in some jurisdictions, state laws may provide the right to an attorney during these pre-accusation stages."
