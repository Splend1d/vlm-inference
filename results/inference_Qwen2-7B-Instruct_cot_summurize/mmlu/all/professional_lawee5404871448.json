The prosecution put the witness on the stand at trial to tell what he observed. The defendant's counsel impeached his testimony by bringing up prior inconsistent statements and accusing him of changing his story for trial. The prosecution then attempted to rehabilitate his credibility by referencing prior consistent statements. Prior consistent statements are not generally admissible because they are said to be repetitive, cumulative and to unfairly bolster the witness's credibility. Will the court likely allow the prosecution to rehabilitate the witness using prior consistent statements under these facts?\n\nA. No, because the witness cannot be rehabilitated once a successful impeachment has occurred.\nB. No, because it would tend to confuse the jury with too much conflicting evidence.\nC. Yes, because it is being used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.\nD. Yes, because all repetitive prior statements are important to show the consistency of the witness' testimony.\n"

Yes, because it is used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen a witness's credibility is attacked, prior consistent statements can sometimes be used to rehabilitate that witness's credibility. This is known as \"prior consistent statement\" evidence. It is generally admitted to counteract an attack on the witness's memory or motive to lie. However, there are strict rules around when such evidence can be introduced, including the requirement that the statements must have been made before the motive to fabricate arose.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendant's counsel impeached the witness's testimony by bringing up prior inconsistent statements, suggesting the witness changed his story for the trial. The prosecution's attempt to rehabilitate the witness's credibility by referencing prior consistent statements is a standard legal procedure under these circumstances.\n\nTherefore, under normal legal procedures, the court would likely allow the prosecution to use prior consistent statements to rehabilitate the witness's credibility, assuming those statements were made before the motive to fabricate arose. This allows the jury to see the consistency in the witness's account over time, which may help restore their confidence in the witness's testimony."
