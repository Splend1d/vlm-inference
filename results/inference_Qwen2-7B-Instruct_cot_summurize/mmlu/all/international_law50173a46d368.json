This doctrine is primarily used in international law, particularly concerning the application of laws across national borders.\n\nOption B accurately describes the effects doctrine: \"The effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction on the State which has an effective link with the harmful conduct.\" This means that if a person's actions have significant consequences in a particular country, that country may have the right to apply its laws and enforce them against the individual, regardless of where the action was initiated or where the person resides.\n\nIn essence, the effects doctrine allows for legal action in a country where the actions have had a substantial impact, even if the actions themselves took place elsewhere. This can be crucial in cases of environmental damage, cybercrime affecting multiple countries, or other transnational issues where harm is felt beyond the boundaries of any single nation."
