When he was refused admittance, the man angrily shouted to the club's doorman, \"You'll be sorry for this. After I'm through, this club will be reduced to rubble. \" Later that same evening, the man returned to the club with two explosives in his possession. He noticed the defendant leaving the club and followed him into a nearby parking lot. As the defendant was about to enter his car, the man grabbed him, pointed a gun and said, \"Follow me, you punk, or I'll blow your brains out. \" The man led the defendant to the rear of the club, handed him the explosives, and directed him to throw them through an open window of the club. In fear of his life, the defendant tossed the explosives into the club, causing an inferno that killed 25 people. In this jurisdiction, the applicable arson statute includes all buildings. If the defendant is charged with felony murder for the death of the people in the club, he will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because they were killings that occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.\nB. guilty, because duress is not a defense to murder.\nC. not guilty, because duress is a defense to arson.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant was justified under the circumstances.\n"

The specific circumstances may vary by jurisdiction, but generally, if someone dies as a result of actions taken while committing a felony that is deemed inherently dangerous ( like arson, which involves the deliberate setting of fires, the perpetrator can be charged with felony murder even if they did not directly cause the death. This is known as the felony-murder rule. \n\nIn this case, the defendant's actions\u2014obtaining explosives, threatening another person, and leading them to commit arson\u2014were part of an inherently dangerous felony. The fact that the defendant was coerced does not necessarily negate the charge of felony murder, as duress is not typically recognized as a defense to murder charges. Instead, it might affect sentencing considerations or defenses to lesser charges related to the felony itself. Therefore, option A is the most likely correct answer based on standard principles of felony murder law."
