                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that when drawing all 8 balls from the box (4 white and 4 black, the balls alternate between white and black.\n\nLet's break down the possible sequences:\n\nSince there are an equal number of white and black balls, the sequence must start with either a white ball or a black ball. If it starts with a white ball, the sequence would be W-B-W-B-W-B-W-B, and if it starts with a black ball, the sequence would be B-W-B-W-B-W-B-W.\n\nNow let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange 4 white balls and 4 black balls without any restrictions. This is simply a permutation problem where we have 8 items in total, 4 of which are identical (white balls, and the other 4 are also identical (black balls. The formula for permutations of \\(n\\) items where there are repetitions is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_k!}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n!\\) is the factorial of \\(n\\), and \\(n_1!, n_2!, ..., n_k!\\) are the factorials of each type of repetition. In this case, \\(n=8\\), \\(n_1=4\\) for white balls, and \\(n_2=4\\) for black balls, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{8!}{4!4!} = \\frac{40320}{(24 \\times 24)} = \\frac{40320}{576} = 70\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 70 different ways to arrange 4 white and 4 black balls.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways these balls can be arranged such that they alternate colors. Since the sequence must start with either a white or a black ball, there are exactly 2 ways to arrange the balls so that they alternate colors: starting with a white ball or starting with a black ball.\n\nTherefore, the probability that all of the draws alternate colors is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{2}{70} = \\frac{1}{35}\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. \\(\\frac{1}{35}\\)."
