All of these about equally.\n\nWhen a uranium nucleus undergoes fission, the energy released is distributed among various forms of energy:\n\n1. **Kinetic Energy of Fission Fragments**: The fission process results in two or more smaller nuclei (fission fragments. These fragments move away from each other with significant kinetic energy, which is a part of the total energy released during fission.\n\n2. **Kinetic Energy of Ejected Neutrons**: In many cases, especially in fast neutron-induced fission, one or more neutrons are also produced and are expelled from the nucleus. These neutrons carry off some of the energy as they travel away from the nucleus.\n\n3. **Gamma Radiation**: Gamma rays are high-energy photons that are emitted by the nucleus after the fission process. They are produced when the nucleus transitions to a lower energy state, which helps to release excess energy and stabilize the resulting daughter nuclei.\n\nThe exact distribution of energy between these forms depends on the specifics of the fission process, including the type of uranium nucleus involved, the conditions under which fission occurs, and the nature of the resulting fission fragments and neutrons. Typically, though, the energy is not equally divided among all forms but rather distributed based on the nuclear physics principles governing the fission process."
