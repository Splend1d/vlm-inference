So, the total amount collected is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Amount} = 6 \\times 500 = 3000 \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. \\(30 \\times 10^1 = 30 \\times 10 = 300\\)\n\nB. \\(30 \\times 10^3 = 30 \\times 1000 = 30000\\)\n\nC. \\((6 \\times 5) \\times 10^2 = 30 \\times 100 = 3000\\)\n\nD. \\((6 \\times 5) \\times 10^3 = 30 \\times 1000 = 30000\\)\n\nFrom the analysis above, we see that option C, \\((6 \\times 5) \\times 10^2\\), calculates the total amount collected as $3000, which matches our calculation from the initial problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C**."
