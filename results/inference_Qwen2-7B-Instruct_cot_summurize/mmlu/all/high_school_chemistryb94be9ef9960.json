Spraying these particles directly into the flame ensures that they are heated uniformly and efficiently, thus \"burning\" them without melting the copper completely.\n\nIt's important to note that when working with flames and potentially corrosive substances, safety precautions should always be taken. Always work in a well-ventilated area, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and goggles, and ensure that you have the necessary knowledge and skills to handle chemicals and flames safely."
