It is an example of nonresponse bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to refuse to answer a survey question.\nB. It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons.\nC.

It is the difference between the same statistics computed from two different samples.\n\nIn this scenario, the newspaper poll and the actual vote represent two different samples taken from the population of interest (eligible voters. The newspaper poll surveyed a group of respondents who self-selected to participate, while the actual vote reflects the participation of those who chose to cast their ballots. These two samples may differ in composition and characteristics, leading to differences in the percentages obtained.\n\nNonresponse bias (option A) could be a factor if certain types of people were more likely to respond to the newspaper poll or vote differently than those who did not respond or vote. However, the question specifically contrasts the newspaper poll results with the results of the actual vote, indicating that the focus is on the difference between these two distinct samples rather than the reason for nonresponse.\n\nOption B refers to a systematic difference between a statistic (the result from a sample) and a parameter (the true value in the entire population), which can indeed be influenced by nonrandom selection, but it does not directly address the difference between the newspaper poll and the actual vote as described in the question.\n\nOption D suggests a discrepancy between a statistic (the result from the sample) and the \"truth\" (the true value in the population), which could occur due to random sampling error. However, this option does not specifically describe the difference between two samples (the newspaper poll and the actual vote.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly identifies that the difference in percentages obtained from the newspaper poll and the vote itself is the difference between the same statistics computed from two different samples: the newspaper poll respondents and the voters who participated in the actual election."
