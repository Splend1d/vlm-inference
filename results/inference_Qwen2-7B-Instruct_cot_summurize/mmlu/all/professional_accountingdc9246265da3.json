Since the contribution margin is the difference between the selling price and the total variable cost, we can express it as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Contribution Margin} = \\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Total Variable Cost} \\]\n\nGiven that the contribution margin needs to be 20% of the selling price, we can write:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times \\text{Selling Price} = \\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Total Variable Cost} \\]\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for the Total Variable Cost gives us:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Variable Cost} = \\text{Selling Price} - ( (0.20 \\times \\text{Selling Price}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Variable Cost} = \\text{Selling Price} \\times ( (1 - 0.20) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Variable Cost} = \\text{Selling Price} \\times 0.80 \\]\n\nPlugging in the selling price:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Variable Cost} = \\$19.00 \\times 0.80 = \\$15.20 \\]\n\nThis total variable cost ($15.20) includes both the variable manufacturing cost and the variable selling and distribution costs ($3.00). To find the target variable manufacturing cost, subtract the known variable selling and distribution costs from the total variable cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Target Variable Manufacturing Cost} = \\text{Total Variable Cost} - \\text{Variable Selling and Distribution Costs} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Target Variable Manufacturing Cost} = \\$15.20 - \\$3.00 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Target Variable Manufacturing Cost} = \\$12.20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $12.20."
