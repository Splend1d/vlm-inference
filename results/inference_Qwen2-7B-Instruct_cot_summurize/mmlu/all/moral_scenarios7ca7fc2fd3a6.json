Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, encouraging someone to commit an act of infidelity, which is generally considered morally wrong and unethical, makes the main character's action morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while it might be considered messy or inconvenient to clean up after one's pet, trashing the dog's poop is not a standard way of handling the situation. It is also not respectful to the environment and potentially harmful to wildlife that could ingest the waste. Thus, this action is also morally wrong from a societal perspective.\n\nHowever, the severity of the wrongness in each scenario varies, with Scenario 1 typically carrying more significant moral implications due to its impact on personal relationships and trust."
