Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?\n\nThe question of whether the future cash flows are expected to change significantly due to the exchange is crucial in determining if the exchange has commercial substance. This is because an exchange with commercial substance alters the pattern or amount of future cash flows of the entity, which can affect its financial position and performance. \n\nIn contrast, A asks about the relative values of the assets involved in the exchange, B focuses on the financial gains from the exchange compared to the increase in future cash flows, and D concerns the tax implications of the exchange, none of which directly address the impact on future cash flows that would indicate commercial substance."
