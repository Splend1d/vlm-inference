We can simulate the computation of \\(M\\) on an input (which is not needed since it's a blank tape) for exactly \\(n\\) steps. If \\(M\\) has not halted by this time, then the answer is no. If \\(M\\) halts within \\(n\\) steps, then the answer is yes. This is possible because the number of configurations of \\(M\\) is finite (given a fixed tape alphabet, there are are only a finite number of states times a finite number of tape configurations (which includes the head position and the symbol under the head). Therefore, if \\(M\\) does not halt within \\(n\\) steps, we can be certain that it will halt after \\(n\\) steps or never halt.\n\n**Problem II:** \"The computation \\(C\\) lasts for at least \\(n\\) steps, and \\(M\\) prints a 1 at some point after the \\(n\\)th step.\"\n\nDecidability: This problem is also decidable. We can simulate \\(M\\) as described above for \\(n\\) steps. If \\(M\\) has not printed a 1 by the end of these steps, then the answer is no. If \\(M\\) has printed a 1 after \\(n\\) steps, then the answer is yes. Since the simulation stops after \\(n\\) steps, we can determine if \\(M\\) prints a 1 within the specified time frame.\n\n**Problem III:** \"M scans at least \\(n\\) distinct tape squares during the computation \\(C\\).\"\n\nDecidability: This problem is undecidable. The reason is that determining whether \\(M\\) scans at least \\(n\\) distinct tape squares involves counting the number of tape squares visited by the head of \\(M\\), which can potentially be unbounded. Since the number of tape squares visited is not limited by any fixed value (especially given that \\(M\\) can move back and forth indefinitely without bounds, it becomes impossible to decide in advance if it will ever visit more than \\(n\\) distinct squares. There is no way to set up a simulation that will conclusively determine if \\(M\\) will ever scan more than \\(n\\) distinct squares without potentially running forever.\n\n**Answer:** Based on the analysis above, the correct choice is **C. I and III only**."
