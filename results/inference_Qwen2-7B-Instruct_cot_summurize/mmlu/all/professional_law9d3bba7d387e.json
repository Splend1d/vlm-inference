The plaintiff alleged that a tire manufactured by the subsidiary in Europe had caused his wife's death in an automobile accident in Europe. The parent corporation does significant business throughout the United States, including in State A. The subsidiary conducts no business and has no employees or bank accounts in State A. The no employees or bank accounts in State A. The subsidiary manufactures its tires for the European market, but 2% of its tires are distributed in State A by the parent corporation. The subsidiary has moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Should the court grant the subsidiary's motion?\n\nA. No, because 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce.\nB. No, because of the general personal jurisdiction established over the parent corporation.\nC. Yes, because the accident did not occur in the United States.\nD. Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.\n"

No, because 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce.\n\nExplanation: The key to determining whether the court should grant the subsidiary's motion to dismiss is to assess whether the subsidiary has sufficient minimum contacts with State A to justify exercising personal jurisdiction. In this case, the fact that 2% of the subsidiary's tires enter State A through the stream of commerce suggests that there is some contact between the subsidiary and State A. This could potentially support the argument that the subsidiary has purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the state, thus subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of its courts.\n\nGeneral personal jurisdiction ( (option B) might also be applicable if the parent corporation has significant business activities in State A, as mentioned. However, this does not directly address the subsidiary's personal jurisdiction.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the location of the accident does not determine the subsidiary's personal jurisdiction in State A; rather, it is based on the subsidiary's contacts with the state.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because the subsidiary's lack of employees or bank accounts in State A alone does not necessarily establish that it lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with the state. The 2% distribution of tires into State A indicates some level of connection.\n\nTherefore, option A best addresses the situation, suggesting that the court should not grant the subsidiary's motion to dismiss due to the subsidiary's involvement in the stream of commerce in State A."
