They are complete organisms that are genetically human: This means that from the moment of conception, an embryo carries the full genetic information necessary to develop into a fully functioning adult human being. This includes all the physical traits, abilities, and characteristics that define humanity.\n\nB. Unlike cells of the mother or father, their growth is directed toward survival and maturation: Embryos have a distinct purpose in life\u2014survival and development into a mature human being. Cells from the mother or father do not share this goal; they serve various functions within their respective parents' bodies. The embryo's specialized cells work together to form organs, systems, and eventually a complete, living human being.\n\nThus, both points highlight the unique status of human embryos as complete human beings with potential for life and development."
