Work-sample tests, which assess a person's ability to perform specific tasks that are are representative of the job duties, are particularly beneficial in this context. They aim to evaluate skills and competencies that are directly applicable to the job role, rather than relying solely on standardized academic or cognitive measures. This approach can provide a more accurate picture of an individual's potential capabilities and may help reduce biases present in other forms of testing."
