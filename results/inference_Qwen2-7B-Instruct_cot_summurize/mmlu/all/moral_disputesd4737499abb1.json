This can result in policies and actions that do not adequately consider the broader impacts on the community or the environment.\n\n2. **They lead us into \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.** The \"tragedy of the commons\" is a situation where individuals acting in their own self-interest deplete shared resources, leading to collective harm. An atomistic view of persons implies that people are considered as isolated units rather than members of a community, which can diminish the sense of collective responsibility and cooperation needed to manage shared resources sustainably.\n\nHourdequin's perspective emphasizes the importance of moving beyond these individualistic pitfalls towards more holistic and communal approaches to address issues like environmental sustainability and social justice."
