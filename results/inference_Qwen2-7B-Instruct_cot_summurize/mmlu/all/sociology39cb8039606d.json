They were predominantly an urban set, as industrialization and economic growth led to the expansion of cities, and many individuals moved from rural areas to urban centers for employment opportunities.\n\nB. Despite their diversity, the middle classes did develop a strong sense of class consciousness. This was partly due to their shared experiences, such as education, lifestyle, and occupation, which differentiated them from both the upper classes (nobility and wealthy landowners) and the working classes (laborers and manual workers). They also had more influence on societal norms and policies-making, which contributed to a collective identity.\n\nC. Many members of the middle classes were involved in 'white-collar' work, which refers to jobs that involve office or administrative tasks rather than physical labor. These professions included clerical roles, teaching, banking, law, and various managerial positions, which were typically associated with higher social status and better living standards compared to manual labor.\n\nThus, option D is correct because it accurately encapsulates the characteristics of the 19th-century middle classes."
