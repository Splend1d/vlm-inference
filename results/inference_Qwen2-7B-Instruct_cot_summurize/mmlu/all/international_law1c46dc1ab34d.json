It requires a permanent population, a defined territory, a government and a capacity to enter into foreign relations\n\nThis convention, which was adopted at the International Conference on the Status of States held in Montevideo, Uruguay, established the following four essential conditions for a state to be recognized internationally:\n\n1. A permanent population: The state must have a stable and continuous population that forms its core identity and contributes to its sovereignty.\n\n2. A defined territory: The state must possess a specific geographic area that it controls and has sovereignty over.\n\n3. A government: The state must have a system of governance capable of maintaining order within its territory and exercising authority over its population.\n\n4. Capacity to enter into international relations: The state must be able to engage in diplomatic and legal interactions with other states or international organizations.\n\nIt's worth noting that while these were the criteria set out in the Montevideo Convention, they may not fully encompass all contemporary views on statehood, particularly when considering entities such as de facto states, which may lack full recognition by the international community but still meet some of these criteria."
