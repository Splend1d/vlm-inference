Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, taking a life jacket from your children during a situation where there are not enough life jackets for everyone is considered morally wrong. This action prioritizes personal safety over that of others and could potentially lead to harm or death for the children.\n\nIn Scenario 2, biting into fruits at the grocery store to check their ripeness is generally not considered morally wrong. It's a common practice, although it might be frowned upon by store policy or etiquette. The action doesn't cause significant harm to others and is usually a reasonable way to ensure you're getting good produce."
