These craters contain the only permanently shadowed region on Mercury\n\nThe reason scientists look for water-ice in craters at Mercury's poles is because these regions are in perpetual shadow, meaning they never receive direct sunlight. This lack of sunlight prevents any volatile compounds, such as water ice, from sublimating ( turning directly from solid to gas. Therefore, if water ice is present, it can remain stable and be detected by spacecraft instruments. The other options listed do not accurately explain why water-ice specifically would be sought after at Mercury's poles."
