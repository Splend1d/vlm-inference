She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, a long history of hypertension, and chronic renal failure presumed secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Reversible causes of renal failure have been excluded. She underwent a tonsillectomy at age 9 years and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at age 68 years. Serum creatinine concentration on admission was 6.0 mg/dL. Her current therapy includes a low-sodium, low-protein American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet, enalapril, and acetaminophen. She is a retired seamstress. She and her husband live on a farm 90 miles from the nearest dialysis facility. In considering longterm treatment options for this patient, which of the following is the most appropriate factor to consider?\n\nA. Her eligibility to receive Medicare\nB. Her history of an abdominal operation\nC. Her history of arthritis\nD. Her suitability for home dialysis\n"

Her suitability for home dialysis\n\nGiven the patient's advanced age, multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and the fact that she lives far from the nearest dialysis facility, considering long-term treatment options should prioritize what is most practical and feasible for her lifestyle and health condition. Home dialysis, if suitable and if she meets the necessary medical criteria, could be an appropriate option as it would allow her to maintain her quality of life by performing dialysis treatments in her own home, potentially reducing the burden of frequent trips to a dialysis facility. This would also require careful consideration of her physical ability to perform self-dialysis, her understanding and adherence to the procedure, and the availability of family support or assistance.\n\nIt's important to note that all factors mentioned are relevant, but the question seems to emphasize the consideration of long-term treatment options given the patient's specific circumstances. The other options listed ( eligibility for Medicare, history of an abdominal operation, and history of arthritis, while relevant to her overall care, are not directly addressing the immediate need for long-term treatment planning for her renal failure."
