This is to ensure that the quality of care provided meets established standards and that the safety and welfare of clients are protected. Without proper licensure, an individual may not be held to these standards and may not be qualified to practice in certain capacities, including administering psychological tests and providing interpretations or evaluations. Supervision by a licensed professional can sometimes mitigate some risks, but it is typically not sufficient to justify unlicensed individuals performing tasks that require licensure."
