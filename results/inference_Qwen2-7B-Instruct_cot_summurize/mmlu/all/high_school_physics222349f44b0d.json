The magnetic field \\(B\\) due to a long straight current-carrying wire at a distance \\(r\\) from the wire is given by:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\mu_0 \\) is the permeability of free space,\n- \\( I \\) is the current flowing through the wire,\n- \\( r \\) is the distance from the wire.\n\nAs you can see, the magnetic field \\(B\\) decreases as \\(1/r^2\\) for large values of \\(r\\). \n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. The electric field due to a finite-length charged rod does not decrease as \\(1/r^2\\); instead, it decreases as \\(1/r\\).\nB. The electric field due to an infinitely long charged cylinder also does not follow an \\(1/r^2\\) decay; it decreases more slowly than \\(1/r\\) but faster than \\(1/r^2\\).\nC. The electric field due to an infinite plane of charge decreases as \\(1/r^2\\), similar to the magnetic field of a long straight current-carrying wire, but since the question asks for the quantity that specifically decreases as \\(1/r^2\\), the correct answer is D."
