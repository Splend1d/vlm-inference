Implosion.\n\nImplosion therapy is a type of behavior therapy that involves gradually exposing the patient to their fears in a real-life setting, increasing the level of difficulty or intensity of the exposure over time. This method helps the individual learn how to manage and overcome their fear through practical, real-world experiences.\n\nFlooding ( option A, refers to a more intense form of exposure therapy where the individual is exposed to the full intensity of the feared situation all at once.\n\nModeling, option B, involves observing someone else perform the desired behavior, which can be effective for learning new skills but does not specifically target overcoming phobias through direct exposure.\n\nReinforced practice, option C, refers to a technique where the desired behavior is rewarded, which might help in building confidence and habit formation, but it's not specifically tied to the gradual exposure approach of implosion therapy."
