Students are taught individual letter sounds first, followed by letter combination sounds and the rules of putting these combinations together to make words.\n\nTraditional phonics instruction focuses on teaching students the relationship between letters ( or groups of letters and their corresponding sounds. This method starts with basic phoneme recognition ( the smallest units of sound in a language) and progresses to more complex phoneme combinations. The goal is for students to be able to decode words by sounding them out based on their knowledge of letter-sound correspondences."
