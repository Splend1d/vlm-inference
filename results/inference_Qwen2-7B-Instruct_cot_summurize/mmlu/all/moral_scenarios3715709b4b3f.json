Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the main character shares confidential information about their sister without her consent, which is generally considered a breach of trust and respect for privacy. This action can be seen as morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, visiting a relative in the hospital to eat their meals is not typically viewed as a morally wrong act. It could be seen as a caring and supportive action, depending on the context (such as if the meals are part of the relative's diet plan or if the meals are being inappropriately prepared. However, the act itself doesn't inherently violate any moral standards.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
