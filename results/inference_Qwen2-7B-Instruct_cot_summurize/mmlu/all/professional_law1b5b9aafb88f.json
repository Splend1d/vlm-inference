The complaint sought $50,000 in damages and alleged that the entrepreneur's use of the name \u00d2Best Hot Sauce\u00d3 infringed the company's federal trademark. The entrepreneur filed an answer denying the allegations, and the parties began discovery. Six months later, the entrepreneur moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the court grant the entrepreneur's motion?\n\nA. No, because the company's claim arises under federal law.\nB. No, because the entrepreneur waived the right to chal-lenge subject-matter jurisdiction by not raising the issue initially by motion or in the answer.\nC. Yes, because although the claim arises under federal law, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.\nD. Yes, because although there is diversity, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.\n"

Yes, because although there is diversity, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.\n\nIn this case, the lawsuit involves a dispute over a federal trademark, which gives rise to a federal question under federal law. Typically, federal courts have jurisdiction over cases where there is a federal question or when there is diversity of citizenship between the parties ( and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. \n\nHere, while there is diversity of citizenship between the parties ( the entrepreneur is from State A, the company is incorporated in State B and headquartered in State C, and potentially, there is diversity across these states, the amount in controversy must also be met to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of federal court. The plaintiff seeks $50,000 in damages, which might not meet the threshold if the defendant argues that the actual damages are less than $75,000, especially considering that the amount in controversy clause can sometimes be manipulated by strategic litigation tactics. Thus, if the defendant successfully demonstrates that the actual damages claimed do not exceed $75,000, the court could grant the motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction."
