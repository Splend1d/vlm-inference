In order to rebut the presumption that the services rendered were gratuitous, since the nephew was a relative of his uncle, the nephew called his sister-in-law as a witness. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. The sister-in-law testified that she had lived in the nephew's house, knew his uncle, and that she was familiar with the uncle's handwriting. The nephew's attorney asked her to look at a letter and to tell the court whether it was written by the uncle. Upon objection by the attorney for the administrator of the estate, the trial judge would most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not a handwriting expert.\nB. sustain the objection, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\nC. overrule the objection, because the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded, an exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. overrule the objection, because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting of the person in question.\n"

Since the statute does not prohibit non-expert witnesses from authenticating documents based on familiarity with the handwriting, the trial judge would most likely allow the testimony. This is because the Dead Man's Statute typically restricts communications between a deceased person and their relatives regarding matters involving the deceased's estate, but does not generally bar non-expert witnesses from testifying about documents or other tangible items they are familiar with."
