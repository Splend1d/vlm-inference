Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, and Niels Bohr. The key experimental information that led to our understanding of atomic structure came from the study of the emission spectra of atoms.\n\nIn 1885, William Ramsay discovered that different elements emit light at characteristic wavelengths when they are heated. This phenomenon is known as the emission spectrum. By analyzing these spectra, scientists could identify the elements and gain insights into their internal structure. \n\nFor instance, when Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers studied the emission spectrum of hydrogen in 1913, they observed a series of lines representing the different wavelengths of light emitted by the hydrogen atom. These lines were later found to correspond to the energy levels of electrons within the hydrogen atom.\n\nThis information played a crucial role in the development of the Bohr model of the atom, proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913. According to this model, electrons orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells, and the emission spectrum provided evidence for these quantized energy levels. This model was a significant step forward in understanding atomic structure, although it had limitations and was eventually replaced by quantum mechanics.\n\nTherefore, the emission spectrum of elements, particularly hydrogen, was the most important experimental information used to deduce the structure of the atom among the options provided."
