Her son says that she repeats herself frequently and has been forgetting to take her routine medications. She takes hydrochlorothiazide for mild systolic hypertension and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She had vulvar cancer 10 years ago treated with wide excision. Her blood pressure is 138/78 mm Hg. Physical examination is within normal limits for her age. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30. Laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, are within normal limits. A CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. \u03b2-Adrenergic agonist\nB. Cholinesterase inhibitor\nC. Dopamine agonist\nD. Prednisone\n"

Cholinesterase inhibitors work by increasing levels of acetylcholine in the brain, which can help improve memory and thinking skills in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The other options do not seem appropriate for this condition:\n\nA. \u03b2-Adrenergic agonists are typically used for conditions like asthma or to increase heart rate.\n\nC. Dopamine agonists are used for conditions such as Parkinson's disease but might not be the first choice for cognitive decline unless specifically indicated by the clinical picture.\n\nD. Prednisone is a corticosteroid used for inflammation and autoimmune disorders, it is not typically used for treating cognitive decline."
