The probability is given by:\n\n\\[ P(H=50) = \\binom{100}{50} (0.5^{50} \\cdot 0.5^{50} = \\binom{100}{50} (0.5^{100} \\]\n\n### B. \\( T \\geq 60 \\)\n\nThis means at least 60 tails, which implies at most 40 heads. We need to sum the probabilities for \\( H = 40, 39, ..., 0 \\):\n\n\\[ P(T \\geq 60) = \\sum_{k=0}^{40} \\binom{100}{k} (0.5^{100} \\]\n\n### C. \\( 51 \\leq H \\leq 55 \\)\n\nThis involves calculating the probability for each value of \\( H \\) from 51 to 55:\n\n\\[ P(51 \\leq H \\leq 55) = \\sum_{k=51}^{55} \\binom{100}{k}0.5^{100} \\]\n\n### D. \\( H \\geq 48 \\) and \\( T \\geq 48 \\)\n\nThis means at least 48 heads and at least 48 tails, which simplifies to \\( H \\) being any value from 48 to 100. However, since \\( T = 100 - H \\), this condition is essentially asking for all possible outcomes except those where both \\( H \\) and \\( T \\) are less than 48:\n\n\\[ P(H \\geq 48 \\text{ and } T \\geq 48) = \\sum_{k=48}^{100} \\binom{100}{k}0.5^{100} \\]\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe key insight here is that the binomial distribution is symmetric around its mean when \\( p = 0.5 \\). The mean number of heads (or tails) is \\( np = 100 \\times 0.5 = 50 \\), so the distribution peaks around 50. \n\n- **Option A** directly corresponds to the peak, making it the most likely outcome.\n- **Options B and C** cover ranges around the peak but do not include the peak itself, and they also involve more calculations.\n- **Option D** covers the entire range of outcomes that satisfy the condition, including the peak but also extending further away from it.\n\nTherefore, **Option A (H = 50** has the greatest probability among the given choices because it aligns precisely with the peak of the binomial distribution."
