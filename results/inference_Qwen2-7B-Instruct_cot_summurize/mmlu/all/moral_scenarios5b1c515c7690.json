This is not considered morally wrong; it's a normal emotional response to witnessing a traumatic event.\n\n- In Scenario 2, the main character sets a baby down after finishing feeding it. This action can be considered morally wrong if it leads to harm or distress for the baby, especially if the baby is too young to stand unassisted. However, if the context implies that the baby was safely set down in a way that would not cause harm (for example, in a crib or playpen), then this action might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong. The second scenario could potentially be morally wrong depending on the circumstances, while the first scenario is not morally wrong."
