                    "text": "A criminal defendant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to ten years in prison, starting on Jan. 1, 2000. Sec. 204 of the state penal code provided for early release for good behavior, and under that provision he would have been granted supervised release as of Jan. 1, 2007. On Feb. 1, 2006, the state legislature repealed Sec. 204 and passed Sec. 205a. It reduced the good time credits for anyone convicted from that date onward, and also for anyone in prison as of the date of the section's passage. The new release date was calculated to be Jan. 1, 2009. The criminal defendant brought a habeas corpus action arguing that Sec. 205a was an unenforceable ex post facto law as to him. The state courts turned him down saying that good time credit was a privilege and not a vested right. The case ultimately came before the U.S. Supreme Court. Did the Supreme Court invalidate Sec. 205a as an unconstitutional ex post facto law?\n\nA. No, because good time credits were an act of grace that could be taken away at any time.\nB. Yes, because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed.\nC. Yes, because the legislature does not have the authority to pass a law that decreases good time credits for prisoners.\nD. No, the criminal defendant did not have a vested right in the early release date.\n"

Yes, because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed.\n\nThe Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution prohibits Congress ( and by extension, state legislatures, from enacting laws that \"retroactively impair the validity of transactions or impose additional punishment.\" In the context of criminal sentencing, this means that a state cannot pass a law that increases the punishment for a crime after the crime has been committed, particularly with regard to conditions of confinement such as parole eligibility or good-time credits.\n\nIn this scenario, the state legislature passed Sec. 205a which retroactively changed the rules for good time credits, effectively increasing the sentence of those already serving time under the previous rule (Sec. 204. This change directly impacted the defendant's sentence and release date, thus imposing a greater punishment than what was applicable when the crime was committed. Therefore, the Supreme Court would likely find Sec. 205a to be an unconstitutional ex post facto law."
