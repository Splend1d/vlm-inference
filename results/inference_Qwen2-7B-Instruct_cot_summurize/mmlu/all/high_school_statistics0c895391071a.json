Replication means the experiment should be repeated several times.\n\nExplanation:\n- A factor can have one or more levels, and it is usually manipulated by the experimenter to observe its effect on the response variable, so it's not the same as the response variable itself. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n- Levels refer to the different conditions or settings within which an independent variable ( or factor is manipulated in an experiment. Treatments refers to the specific condition applied to the experimental units, so while both terms relate to experimental design, they do not mean the same thing. Option C is incorrect.\n- Experimental units are are the entities on which the experiment is performed; they could be individuals, groups, or objects, depending on the context of the experiment. Subjects specifically refer to human participants in experiments, but experimental units can include non-human entities as well. Option D is somewhat correct but not precise enough since \"subjects\" is only one type of experimental unit. The term \"experimental units\" is more general and appropriate in various contexts, including those involving animals or physical objects, not just humans."
