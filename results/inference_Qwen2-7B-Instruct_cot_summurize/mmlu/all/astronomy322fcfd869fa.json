You see the star\u2019s blackbody spectrum with absorption lines due to hydrogen. \n\nWhen light from a star passes through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas, some of the light is absorbed by the hydrogen atoms. This absorption creates dark lines in the spectrum at specific wavelengths where the hydrogen atoms absorb the light. These lines correspond to the energy levels of the hydrogen atoms. At the same time, you would also see the star's blackbody spectrum, which represents the continuous range of wavelengths emitted by the star, shifted due to the presence of the hydrogen gas and its effect on the starlight."
