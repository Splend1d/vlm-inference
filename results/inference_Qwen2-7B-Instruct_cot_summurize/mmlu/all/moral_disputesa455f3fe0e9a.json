All of the above.\n\nConsequentialist theories of punishment suggest that the justification for punishing a lawbreaker lies in the consequences or outcomes of the punishment rather than the inherent nature of the act itself or the character of the individual. Consequentialists would consider various factors when determining the appropriate punishment:\n\n1. **Producing the most overall intrinsic value (**: This means the punishment should aim to maximize positive outcomes and minimize negative ones. It could involve rehabilitation, deterrence, or retribution, depending on which outcome is expected to yield the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\n2. **Treating the person as an end in themselves**: This principle alignss with the idea of respecting the intrinsic worth of the individual being punished. The punishment should not merely serve as a means to an end but should also consider the dignity and rights of the person being punished.\n\n3. **Proportionality to the wrongness of the crime**: This principle ensures that the severity of the punishment corresponds to the severity of the crime committed. It is a fairness consideration that aims to balance justice with mercy, ensuring that the punishment is neither too harsh nor too lenient given the nature of the offense.\n\nTherefore, according to consequentialist theories, a lawbreaker should be punished only if the punishment would likely produce as much overall intrinsic value as any other alternative, it is consistent with treating the person as an end in themselves, and it is proportional to the wrongness of the crime."
