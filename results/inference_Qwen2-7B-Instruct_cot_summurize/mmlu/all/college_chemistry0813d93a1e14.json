Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nOptical isomerism, or chirality, in coordination complexes arises from the presence of a chiral center within the complex, which can be the metal ion itself or one or more of the ligands. In linear complexes, if two different ligands are attached to the metal ion, this can create a chiral environment around the metal ion, leading to the possibility of optical isomerism. \n\nFor the other options:\nA. Square planar complexes can indeed display optical isomerism even if not all four ligands are identical, depending on their arrangement and the properties of the ligands.\nB. Tetrahedral complexes can exhibit optical isomerism if they contain chiral ligands or if the ligands arrange themselves in a chiral manner around the metal ion.\nD. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism under various conditions, including having at least three different ligands, but it's not solely dependent on that criterion. The presence of chiral ligands or the specific arrangement of ligands can lead to optical isomerism in octahedral complexes as well."
