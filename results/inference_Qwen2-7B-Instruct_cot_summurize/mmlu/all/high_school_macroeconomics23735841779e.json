                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Income is transferred from foreign steel producers to domestic steel producers.\n\nWhen a protective tariff is removed on imported steel, it allows for increased competition in the market as foreign steel becomes more affordable or cheaper compared to domestically produced steel. This typically leads to:\n\n- A: Imports may increase, not decrease, because foreign steel becomes more competitive and attractive to consumers and businesses.\n- B: This statement is incorrect. Removing the tariff does not necessarily transfer income from steel consumers to domestic steel producers; instead, it can lead to lower prices and potentially higher demand for steel, which might benefit consumers and the overall economy if the price drop leads to greater consumption.\n- C: Correct. Removing the tariff can result in lower prices for steel, which makes it more attractive to consumers and businesses. As a result, demand for foreign steel increases, leading to higher revenues for foreign steel producers. Domestic steel producers might face reduced demand and possibly lower profits due to increased competition, unless they can adjust their production costs or innovate to remain competitive.\n- D: This statement is not necessarily true. Allocative efficiency refers to how resources are are distributed across society so that goods and services are produced at the lowest possible cost and consumed by those who value them most. While tariffs can distort allocative efficiency by encouraging overproduction or underproduction of certain goods, removing a tariff can improve allocative efficiency by allowing resources to flow to where they are most valued and can be used most efficiently. However, the immediate effects might involve adjustments in production levels and market dynamics, which could temporarily disrupt efficiency until the market reaches a new equilibrium."
