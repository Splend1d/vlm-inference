In the case of satin bowerbirds, males construct elaborate bowers as a way to attract females. If the bowers are more impressive, the males are more likely to be chosen by females for mating, which leads to the traits associated with impressive bowers being passed on to the next generation. This is an example of sexual selection, specifically good genes or ornamentation hypothesis."
