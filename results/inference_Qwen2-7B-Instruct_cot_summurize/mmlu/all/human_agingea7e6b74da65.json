The statement \"physical changes\" typically refers to alterations in one's body or physical state.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Are rapid and frightening - This could apply if they were emphasizing the suddenness and perhaps the perceived negative aspects of physical aging or change.\nB. Can be offset by meditation - This option suggests a belief in the efficacy of meditation as a tool to mitigate or manage physical changes, possibly including those associated with aging.\nC. Take a long time - This implies a slower progression of physical changes, which is generally true for aging processes.\nD. Should not be discussed in public - This option would suggest a view that physical changes should be kept private rather than openly discussed.\n\nWithout more specific context from the article \"Senior View,\" it's difficult to definitively choose one answer over another. However, given common perspectives on aging and health, option B (\"Can be offset by meditation\") might align most closely with holistic or alternative health views, which often suggest practices like meditation can help manage various aspects of health and wellness, including physical changes.\n\nIf you have the full text of the article, it would provide clearer insights into which of these statements best reflects the Paulings' views."
