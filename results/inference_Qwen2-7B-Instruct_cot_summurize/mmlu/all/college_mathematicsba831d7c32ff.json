These pairs are:\n\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\), so (1, 1 is a pair where one number is the square of the other.\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\), so (2, 4 and 4, 2 are a pair where one number is the square of the other.\n\nThis gives us a total of 3 pairs where one number is the square of the other.\n\nGiven there are 10 integers to choose from, the total number of ways Sofia and Tess can each choose one of these 10 integers is \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\) possible pairs.\n\nThe number of pairs where neither integer is the square of the other is therefore the total number of pairs minus the 3 pairs where one number is the square of the other. That is, \\(100 - 3 = 97\\) pairs.\n\nThus, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is the number of favorable outcomes (97 divided by the total number of outcomes, 100.\n\n\\[P(\\text{neither is the square of the other}) = \\frac{97}{100} = 0.97\\]\n\nThis value is not listed among your options, suggesting there might have been a misunderstanding in either the question's setup or the provided answer choices. Given the calculation, the closest correct answer based on the provided options would be:\n\nD. 0.95\n\nHowever, the precise answer calculated is 0.97, indicating a slight discrepancy with the options provided."
