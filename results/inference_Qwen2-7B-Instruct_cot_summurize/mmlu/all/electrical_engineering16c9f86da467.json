For a Wien-bridge oscillator to oscillate, the feedback factor should be in the range that allows for constructive interference of the two feedback paths, which generally corresponds to values around 0.5 or slightly less.\n\nHowever, the exact value can depend on the specific design and components used in the circuit. In some configurations, particularly for achieving a precise oscillation frequency, the feedback factor might be tuned closer to 1/3 to ensure the correct phase margin for oscillation.\n\nTherefore, based on common configurations for achieving stable oscillations in a Wien-bridge oscillator, option A. 1/3, is often chosen as the feedback factor. This choice facilitates the creation of a positive feedback loop necessary for sustained oscillations while maintaining the stability and phase margin required for oscillation."
