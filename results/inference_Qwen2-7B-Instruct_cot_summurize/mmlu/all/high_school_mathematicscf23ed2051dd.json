We're given that \\(l = 2w\\), and the diagonal of the rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem since the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and width of the rectangle. Thus, we have:\n\n\\[l^2 + w^2 = ( (5\\sqrt{5})^2\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(l = 2w\\) into the equation gives us:\n\n\\[(2w)^2 + w^2 = 25 \\cdot 5\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[4w^2 + w^2 = 125\\]\n\n\\[5w^2 = 125\\]\n\n\\[w^2 = 25\\]\n\n\\[w = 5\\]\n\nSince \\(l = 2w\\), then:\n\n\\[l = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10\\]\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width, so:\n\n\\[Area = l \\times w = 10 \\times 5 = 50\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 50**."
