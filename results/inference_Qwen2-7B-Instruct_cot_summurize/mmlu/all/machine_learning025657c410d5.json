The log-likelihood of the data might not always increase through successive iterations of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In fact, the EM algorithm works by alternating between performing an expectation (E-step, creating a function for the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters, and a maximization (M-step which computes parameters maximizing the expected log-likelihood found on the E-step. It's possible that in some cases, the log-likelihood might decrease during the M-step before increasing again in the next iteration, especially if the optimization landscape is complex.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is true. One of the disadvantages of Q-learning is indeed that it requires the learner to have some form of prior knowledge about the environment or at least the dynamics of the environment to some extent. Specifically, Q-learning assumes that the learner knows the number of states and actions available and needs to learn the Q-values for each state-action pair. Without this prior knowledge, the learning process cannot proceed effectively as it needs to know the full structure of the environment to update its policy."
