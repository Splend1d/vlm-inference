This contrasts with the idea of gradualism, which posits that evolution occurs slowly and continuously over time. The concept was first proposed by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould in 1972 as an attempt to explain the fossil record, where the majority of species appear to have changed very little over long periods, with sudden and dramatic changes occurring over much shorter geological timescales."
