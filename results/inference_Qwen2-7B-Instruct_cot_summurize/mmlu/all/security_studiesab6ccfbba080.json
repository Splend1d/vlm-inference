All of these options.\n\nThe 'energy security nexus' refers to the complex interplay between energy, economic growth, environmental sustainability, and national security. Each of the options provided highlights a critical aspect of this concept:\n\nA. It discusses how attempts to exert control over energy reserves can lead to geopolitical tensions, potentially undermining international cooperation and affecting security. This reflects the strategic importance of energy resources in shaping global power dynamics and international relations.\n\nC. This option points out that shared concerns over energy production and supply can drive states to negotiate and cooperate, which is a positive outcome aiming to enhance stability and foster mutual interests among nations.\n\nD. It emphasizes that countries with abundant energy resources can gain leverage in the international system, which could help to address the historical imbalance of power between the 'global North' and 'South'. This is particularly relevant in the context of efforts to mitigate global inequalities.\n\nTherefore, each of these options represents a significant outcome or implication of the energy security nexus, making \"B\" the correct answer."
