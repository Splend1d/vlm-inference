This action violates property rights and trust, as the money belongs to someone else who has lost it, and it is not rightfully theirs to keep.\n\nIn Scenario 2, walking one's dogs for 20 hours might seem like an excessive amount of time, especially if it implies neglect or harm to the dogs ( such as not providing adequate rest, food, or water breaks. However, without specific details about the context (such as whether the dogs were properly cared for during this time, whether it was safe for them to be outside for so long, and the reason behind this action, it's difficult to definitively say it's morally wrong. In many cases, such behavior could be considered irresponsible pet ownership, but it may not necessarily cross into morally wrong territory unless there's evidence of cruelty or neglect.\n\nGiven the information provided, it's most accurate to classify Scenario 1 as morally wrong and Scenario 2 as potentially questionable based on the lack of context, making the answer B."
