The BCG matrix categorizes the business units into four different categories, which are:\n\n1. **Question Marks**: These are the units that have high market growth but low market share. They require significant investment for market share growth but also have the potential to become stars if successful.\n\n2. **Stars**: These are the units with high market growth and high market share. They are typically profitable and require substantial reinvestment to maintain their position and grow further.\n\n3. **Cash Cows**: These are the units with low market growth but high market share. They generate a lot of cash through high sales volumes and minimal investment needs. The goal is to maximize cash flow from these units and protect their market share.\n\n4. **Dogs**: These are the units with low market growth and low market share. They do not generate enough profit to justify reinvestment, so the strategy would be to divest or exit these units.\n\nTherefore, the correct options in the context of the BCG matrix are:\nA. Question marks\nC. Stars\nD. Cash cows\n\nOption B. \"Quick winners\" is not a term used in the BCG matrix, and option C. \"Charging bulls\" does not align with the traditional BCG framework."
