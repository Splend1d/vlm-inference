Utilitarianism demands that one maximize the total amount of happiness produced by an action, taking into account the intensity and duration of pleasure or pain experienced by each person affected by the action. This can be challenging to determine, as it requires knowledge of how different people will react to various outcomes and assigning subjective values to different levels of pleasure or pain. Additionally, utilitarianism may sometimes require individuals to make sacrifices for the greater good, which can be morally difficult for some people to accept."
