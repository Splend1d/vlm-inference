The price will rise and each firm's output will fall as firms exit the industry.\n\nIn the long run, when the market price is below the minimum average total cost, it means that firms are not covering their costs and are experiencing losses. As a result, rational firms will exit the market in order to avoid these losses. As firms exit, the supply in the market decreases, which leads to an increase in the market price. Eventually, the price will rise to a level where it covers the average total cost for the remaining firms ( the breakeven point. At this new price, the firms that remain in the market will operate at a loss, but it will be the least costly option compared to exiting the market. The output of each firm will also decrease as they adjust to the new lower market conditions. This process continues until the market reaches a new long-run equilibrium where only those firms that can cover their costs at the prevailing market price remain."
