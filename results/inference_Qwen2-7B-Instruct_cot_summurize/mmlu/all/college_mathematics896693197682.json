                    "text": "The property you're asking about is called the \"zero divisor\" property. A ring has zero divisors if there exist two non-zero elements whose product is zero.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The ring of complex numbers: In this ring, if \\(z_1\\) and \\(z_2\\) are non-zero complex numbers, then their product \\(z_1 \\cdot z_2\\) cannot be zero unless either \\(z_1\\) or \\(z_2\\) is zero ( due to the nature of complex multiplication. This is because the complex numbers form an integral domain, which means they have no zero divisors.\n\nB. The ring of integers modulo 11: This is a finite field since 11 is prime. In any field, including this one, the only way for the product of two non-zero elements to be zero is if one of them is zero, making it impossible for both to be non-zero. Thus, this ring also does not have zero divisors.\n\nC. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1]: This ring does contain zero divisors. Consider two functions \\(f(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)\\) and \\(g(x) = \\sin(4\\pi x)\\). Both \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are non-zero functions in their respective intervals where they are not identically zero. However, their product \\(h(x) = f(x) \\cdot g(x)\\) is identically zero everywhere on [0, 1], because \\(h(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\cdot \\sin(4\\pi x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\pi x - 2\\pi x) - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\pi x + 2\\pi x\\), which simplifies to \\(h(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\) in [0, 1]. So, \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are non-zero functions whose product is zero, indicating that this ring contains zero divisors.\n\nD. The ring \\(\\{a + b\\sqrt{2} : a, b \\text{ are rational numbers}\\}: This ring is known as the ring of quadratic integers of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). It does not have zero divisors. To see why, suppose \\(a + b\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(c + d\\sqrt{2}\\) are two non-zero elements such that their product is zero. Then:\n\\[ (a + b\\sqrt{2})(c + d\\sqrt{2}) = 0 \\]\nExpanding this, we get:\n\\[ ac + 2bd + ( (ad + bc)\\sqrt{2} = 0 \\]\nThis implies that both the coefficients must be zero since \\(\\sqrt{2\\) is irrational and thus cannot be equal to zero. Therefore, \\(ac + 2bd = 0\\) and \\(ad + bc = 0\\). From these equations, we can solve for \\(a, b, c, d\\) and find that the only solution that satisfies both equations when considering the properties of rational numbers is \\(a = c = 0\\) and \\(b = d = 0\\), which contradicts our assumption that the elements are non-zero. Hence, this ring does not have zero divisors.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C**. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1] contains zero divisors."
