After an unanticipated zoning change increased the land's fair market value to $150,000 during the executory period, the owner refused to close. Wishing to avoid a lawsuit, the buyer assigned the contract (which the contract did not forbid) in an arm's-length transaction to an investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate. The investor paid the buyer $25,000. The investor knew of the owner's refusal to close, and the owner continued to refuse to close despite the investor's demands that he do so. The investor has sued the owner for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\nB. The investor, because she has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change.\nC. The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\nD. The owner, because the investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate, is entitled to money damages but not to specific performance.\n"

The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\n\nIn this scenario, the key factor that could weigh against the investor's claim for specific performance is whether they can be considered a \"bona fide assignee\" or not. A bona fide assignee is one who takes the assignment of a contract without notice of any defects or claims affecting the underlying contract. In other words, if the investor knew about the owner's refusal to close when they purchased the assignment from the original buyer, they might not qualify as a bona fide assignee.\n\nGiven that the owner continues to refuse to close the sale even after the zoning change and assignment to the investor, the court may consider the investor's knowledge of the situation when they purchased the assignment as evidence that they did not take the assignment in good faith. This could lead the court to rule in favor of the owner, especially if the owner can prove that the investor was aware of the potential issues with the contract and still proceeded with the purchase, indicating that they were not a true assignee without notice.\n\nIt's important to note that specific performance is a remedy that courts generally grant when monetary damages are not sufficient to compensate the non-breaching party for their loss. However, in order to obtain this remedy, the plaintiff must typically show that they are a \"bona fide assignee\" or otherwise meet certain criteria to demonstrate their entitlement to the relief sought. The details of the case, including the specifics of the contract terms, the conduct of all parties involved, and local laws and precedents, would also influence the court's decision."
