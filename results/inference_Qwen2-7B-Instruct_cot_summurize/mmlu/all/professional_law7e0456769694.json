It had distinctive tread marks and an unusual wear pattern on the sole. It also had a \"V\" mark on the heel bottom that indicates the brand was a Victory shoe. The detective, armed with a proper search warrant, searched the suspect's apartment, where he found a shoe to a right foot that of the same size, and with a similar wear pattern and the same \"V\" mark as the shoeprint found at the scene. The shoe for the left foot was not found but the shoe for the right foot was seized from the suspect's closet and offered as evidence at trial. Is this admissible evidence?\n\nA. Yes, because it is direct evidence of guilt.\nB. Yes, because it is appropriate circumstantial evidence of guilt.\nC. No, because this shoe is irrelevant and will have no residue or other probative evidence relating to it.\nD. No, because footprint evidence is highly speculative unless both shoes and shoe prints are offered and authenticated.\n"

Yes, because it is appropriate circumstantial evidence of guilt.\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves circumstantial evidence, which is evidence that requires inference to connect it to the conclusion that it establishes a fact in dispute. In this case, the detective has found a shoe (right foot) that matches the footprint in multiple ways - size, tread marks, wear pattern, and the specific brand (Victory shoe with a \"V\" mark on the heel. This provides strong circumstantial evidence that the suspect owned a matching left-footed shoe that could have left the footprint at the crime scene. \n\nWhile direct evidence would be a witness seeing the suspect at the crime scene, this situation provides compelling circumstantial evidence that links the suspect to the crime through his possession of a matching right-footed shoe. However, it does not conclusively prove guilt without additional evidence linking the left-footed shoe to the suspect or to the crime scene. Therefore, the answer is option B."
