Produce a 1-step ahead conditional variance forecast, take its square root and multiply it by the square root of 10\n\nThis is because volatility is typically measured as the standard deviation of returns, which is the square root of the variance. So, if you want to forecast the volatility over 10 days, you would forecast the variance for each day, take the square root to convert back to volatility, and then multiply by the square root of the number of days (to account for the compounding effect of volatility over time.\n\nOptions A and C sum the variances instead of taking their square roots to get the volatilities, which doesn't make sense since volatility is not additive. Option B sums the variances and takes the square root once, which doesn't account for the compounding effect over multiple periods."
