                    "text": "The power of a statistical test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis (H0) when the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is true. It's influenced by several factors including the significance level (\u03b1), the sample size (n), the effect size (which is related to the distance between the hypothesized mean under H0 and the true mean under Ha), and the variability in the data.\n\nGiven:\n- Null hypothesis (H0: \u03bc = 70\n- Alternative hypothesis Ha: \u03bc < 70\n- When \u03bc = 65, we're testing how well our test can detect this difference from the null hypothesis.\n\nThe choice of \u03b1 (significance level) and n (sample size) affects the power of the test in different ways:\n- A smaller \u03b1 (e.g., 0.01 instead of 0.05) reduces the chance of a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis but makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis when it's false, thus potentially reducing power.\n- A larger n increases the precision of the estimate of the population parameter, making it easier to detect differences if they exist, which increases the power.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n**A. \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 15**\n- This has a moderate chance of rejecting the null at a 5% significance level, but the relatively small sample size might not provide enough information to detect the difference between 65 and 70 convincingly.\n\n**B. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 15**\n- The stringent \u03b1 of 0.01 makes it even less likely to reject the null, even if the alternative is true, due to the increased risk of Type II errors ( (failing to reject a false null hypothesis). The small sample size exacerbates this issue.\n\n**C. \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 30**\n- With a slightly higher chance of rejecting the null compared to option A due to the larger \u03b1, and a larger sample size which should provide more information and thus increase the power of the test to detect the difference between 65 and 70.\n\n**D. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30**\n- Similar to option B but with a larger sample size, which should theoretically increase the power of the test to detect the difference between the hypothesized mean and the true mean, despite the stringent \u03b1 level.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBetween options C and D, **option D ( \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30** results in the greatest power of the test when \u03bc = 65. This is because it combines a moderately stringent \u03b1 level with a sufficiently large sample size, which together should provide the best balance for detecting the specified difference from the null hypothesis while minimizing the risk of Type I errors."
