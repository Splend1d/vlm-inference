Actually, for the same \u03b1 (or significance level), as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region increases, not decreases. This is because with more degrees of freedom, the \u03c72 distribution becomes more spread out and has a longer tail to the right, requiring a larger \u03c72 value to fall in the rejection region at a given \u03b1 level."
