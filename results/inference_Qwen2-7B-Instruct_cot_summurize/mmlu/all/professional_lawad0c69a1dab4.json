He arrested her for driving while under suspension and secured her in the rear seat of the squad car. He then searched the car where he found several bags of cocaine inside a coat that was setting on the rear seat; he arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver cocaine. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because this was an unreasonable, warrantless search.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because the initial traffic stop was legal and everything that flowed therefrom was a reasonable step to search for crime.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.\n\nIn the United States, police officers can conduct a search of a vehicle incident to a lawful arrest without needing a separate search warrant. This is based on the principle that the vehicle is considered the arrestee's immediate surroundings, and there is a risk that evidence could be destroyed or removed before a warrant can be obtained. The Supreme Court has upheld this practice in various cases, including Chimel v. California ( (1969) and Michigan v. Long ( (1983).\n\nIn this scenario, the driver was lawfully arrested for driving while under suspension. After the arrest, the officer searched the vehicle and found the cocaine. Assuming the officer acted reasonably and within the scope of the arrest, the search would likely be considered valid under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. Therefore, the trial court is unlikely to grant the suppression motion based on the search being unlawful."
