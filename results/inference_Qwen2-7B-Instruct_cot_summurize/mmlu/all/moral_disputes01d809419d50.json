The concept of intrinsic permissibility in the doctrine of double effect refers to the moral permissibility of an action itself, independent of any good or bad consequences it may have. An action can be considered intrinsically permissible if it aligns with moral principles and values, regardless of the outcomes it produces. This contrasts with instrumental permissibility, where an action might be morally permissible only because of its unintended positive consequences.\n\nTo clarify the other options:\n\nB. This statement confuses intrinsic permissibility with instrumental permissibility. While actions can be morally permissible due to their effects, the doctrine of double effect focuses on the morality of actions based on their inherent nature, not just their outcomes.\n\nC. Whether or not \"no actual person would ever endorse that action\" does not directly relate to the intrinsic permissibility of an action. Moral judgments about actions can vary among individuals, and what one person deems permissible might not be so for another.\n\nD. While an action's value can indeed be related to its connection to intrinsically valuable things, this option does not specifically address the intrinsic permissibility of the action. It could refer to the action's overall moral worth or utility, but it does not capture the distinction between an action being morally right or wrong, irrespective of its effects."
