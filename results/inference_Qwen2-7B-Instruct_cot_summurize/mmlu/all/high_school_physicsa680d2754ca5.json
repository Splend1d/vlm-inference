However, the exact calculation would give us a more precise answer.\n\nFor a rough estimate, considering the options provided, the weight at the mountain peak should be very close to the weight at sea level because the increase in altitude is not significant enough to cause a noticeable change in gravitational force based on the options given. \n\nTherefore, the best estimate among the choices provided would likely be:\n\nC. 30 N\n\nThis choice assumes that the slight decrease in weight due to the increased distance from the Earth's center is negligible given the options provided."
