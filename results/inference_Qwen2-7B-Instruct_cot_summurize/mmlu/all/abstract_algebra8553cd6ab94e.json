In other words, it's the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) for which multiplying any element of the ring by \\( n \\) yields the additive identity (0 of the ring.\n\nFor the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), we can consider the characteristics of each component ring separately and then find their least common multiple (LCM), since the characteristic of the direct product of two rings is the LCM of the characteristics of the individual rings.\n\n- The characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is 3 because in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), adding the multiplicative identity (1 three times results in the additive identity 0.\n- Similarly, the characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is also 3.\n\nSince both components have the same characteristic, the characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is simply 3, as they both satisfy the definition of the characteristic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3"
