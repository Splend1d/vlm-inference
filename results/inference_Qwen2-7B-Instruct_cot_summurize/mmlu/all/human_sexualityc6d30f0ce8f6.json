Infections: Yes, infections such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea), bacterial vaginosis, or urinary tract infections (UTIs can cause pain during intercourse. For men, infections like prostatitis or urethritis can lead to discomfort.\n\nB. Foreskin too tight: This is more commonly referred to as paraphimosis in men, where the foreskin cannot be returned to its normal position over the glans penis, causing swelling and pain. This condition is not typically associated with coital pain in women.\n\nC. Vaginismus: This is a condition characterized by involuntary spasms of the muscles around the vagina, leading to difficulty or pain during penetration. It can affect both men and women.\n\nD. Both A and C: This is correct because infections (like those mentioned under option A) and vaginismus (option C) are indeed likely to cause coital pain for both men and women.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. both A and C."
