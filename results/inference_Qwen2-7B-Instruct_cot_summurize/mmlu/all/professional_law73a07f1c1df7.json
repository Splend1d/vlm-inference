The tenant was later robbed and beaten by an intruder. She sued the landlord for negligence in causing her injuries. The landlord relied on an exculpatory clause in the lease. The clause, set in fine print on the reverse side of the multi-paged, mass-printed, form lease, was a comprehensive, legalistic waiver in which the tenant gave up virtually all of her rights and remedies against the landlord. She responded that the clause was unconscionable and should not be enforced. What will the court most likely rule with respect to the exculpatory clause?\n\nA. This is not a contract for the sale of goods \u0080\u0093 unconscionability is not available with respect to an agreement not covered by the UCC.\nB. The exculpatory clause must be enforced because the tenant voluntarily signed the lease and agreed to its terms instead of choosing another place to live.\nC. The clause is unenforceable because it discriminates against women who are unable to provide their own security.\nD. The clause is unenforceable because the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive.\n"

The clause is unenforceable because the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAn exculpatory clause is a contractual provision that attempts to relieve one party from liability for its own negligent or wrongful conduct. In the context of landlord-tenant relationships, such clauses often try to limit a landlord's responsibility for maintaining safe living conditions. However, they may be unenforceable if they are found to be unconscionable, which generally means they are excessively one-sided and oppressive, particularly when the parties have unequal bargaining power.\n\nIn this case, the tenant had little leverage given the landlord's failure to address the necessary repairs and the subsequent harm she suffered. The exculpatory clause was also buried within a long, complex document presented as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition, making it difficult for the tenant to understand its full implications before agreeing to it. These circumstances suggest that the clause was likely oppressive and therefore unenforceable under principles of unconscionability.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not directly address the specific issues raised by the unconscionability doctrine in this scenario:\n\nA. The Uniform Commercial Code ( (UCC) governs contracts for the sale of goods, not residential leases. Therefore, unconscionability under the UCC would not apply here.\n\nB. The enforceability of a contract does not solely depend on the voluntary acceptance of its terms. Rather, it depends on whether the contract is fair and just under the circumstances, including the presence of unconscionability.\n\nC. While discrimination could potentially factor into a court's analysis, the issue at hand is more about the fairness and enforceability of the contract terms rather than discrimination against women specifically. Moreover, even if discrimination were a factor, it would need to be shown that the clause disproportionately affects a protected group in an unfair manner.\n\nThus, the most likely ruling would be option D, indicating that the exculpatory clause is unenforceable due to the tenant's lack of bargaining power and the clause's oppressive nature."
