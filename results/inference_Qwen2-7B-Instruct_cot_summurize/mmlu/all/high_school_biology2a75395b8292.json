The two species share many proteins in common, and the nucleotide sequences that code for these proteins are almost identical.\n\nExplanation based on homology suggests that the structures are similar due to shared ancestry, which would be reflected in similarities in their genetic codes. In contrast, convergent evolution refers to unrelated species developing similar traits independently as an adaptation to similar environments or challenges. This often does not involve such high levels of genetic similarity. \n\nA) The geographic separation of the species is not necessarily relevant to distinguishing between homology and convergence. Species can evolve similar traits even if they are geographically isolated from each other.\n\nC) Similarities in the size of the structures in adults might suggest homology if it's known that the structures serve the same function and have evolved together over time. However, this alone doesn't provide enough evidence to differentiate between homology and convergence.\n\nD) Adaptation to specific environments is a hallmark of convergent evolution, but it doesn't directly inform us about whether the structures are similar due to homology or not. It could be a result of either, depending on the evolutionary history of the species. \n\nTherefore, B is the most informative piece of information to distinguish between homology and convergent evolution, as it points towards a common genetic origin."
