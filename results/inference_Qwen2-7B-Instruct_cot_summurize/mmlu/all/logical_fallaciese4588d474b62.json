This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a claim must be true or right simply because a large number of people believe it to be so, or because they wish to maintain loyalty to a group or individual, even if there is no strong evidence supporting the claim. \n\nLet's clarify why the other options do not describe the fallacy of appeal to loyalty:\n\nA. Arguing that someone should do something because it will make them more liked by others is an example of an appeal to popularity or an appeal to self-interest, not specifically an appeal to loyalty.\n\nB. Responding to an argument with derision is an example of an ad hominem fallacy, where the argument focuses on attacking the person rather than addressing the argument itself.\n\nC. Arguing that an idea should be accepted only because of who originated the idea is an example of an appeal to authority or an appeal to tradition, not specifically an appeal to loyalty."
