Monarchs were involved in and interested in voyages of discovery.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, is a prime example of how monarchs played a significant role in the Age of Exploration. It was an agreement between the kingdoms of Spain (represented by King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, and Portugal, represented by King Manuel I, concerning the division of newly discovered lands outside Europe. The treaty was aimed at preventing conflicts between the two European powers over territories in the Americas and elsewhere. This shows that the monarchs were indeed interested in and involved in voyages of discovery, which were key to expanding their empires and influence during the late Middle Ages and early modern period."
