On that form, a notice appeared in bold letters: \"TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website.\" She did not access the terms, which she could have done by clicking a conspicuous link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. For the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50, without notice, except that she received email notice that the report was available at the site. The terms and conditions provided that she authorized the charges, unless she notified the company otherwise in advance. Which party will likely prevail on the issue of whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled?\n\nA. The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.\nB. The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.\nC. The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.\nD. The company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms.\n"

The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.\n\nIn this scenario, the terms and conditions were presented prominently to the user by appearing in bold letters and being easily accessible through a conspicuous link. This suggests that the website made a reasonable effort to inform users about the terms they were agreeing to when they created an account. The fact that the user did not access the terms does not necessarily negate her agreement with them, as long as she had the opportunity to do so and proceeded with creating an account and using the service.\n\nMoreover, under the principle of \"clickwrap\" contracts, where users are presented with a notice indicating they must agree to terms to proceed with certain actions ( like creating an account, courts generally find that the user has agreed to the terms if they were adequately notified and given a reasonable opportunity to review them. \n\nThe user's subsequent use of the service, including the automatic billing for the credit reports, further supports that she accepted the terms and conditions. If she was aware of the charges but did not object until after the billing cycle, it would be challenging for her to argue that she was unaware of or did not consent to the terms. \n\nTherefore, the company is more likely to prevail based on these factors."
