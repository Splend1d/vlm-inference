The husband's wife now brings an action to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified that she and her husband had a close relationship and that they were happily married for over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, defendant's counsel asked her if she \"was aware of the affair that her husband was having with his passenger?\"The wife's attorney immediately objected to this question. The judge should rule that the question is\n\nA. objectionable, because the question is beyond the scope of direct examination.\nB. objectionable, because it was highly prejudicial.\nC. unobjectionable, because plaintiff's knowledge of such an affair was probative of the value to be placed on her loss.\nD. unobjectionable, because it was relevant on the issue of negligence.\n"

It may also unfairly prejudice the jury against the wife or suggest that her claim for loss of society and companionship is diminished due to the affair, which is not legally relevant to the damages she can claim. The focus of the case should remain on proving the extent of the loss suffered by the wife due to the death of her husband, rather than on extraneous matters."
