Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, offering a large sundae to an overweight teacher who is dieting might be seen as insensitive or potentially harmful, depending on how it was presented. It could be interpreted as mocking or not respecting their personal boundaries and health concerns, which is generally considered disrespectful and morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, finding a wallet and keeping it without attempting to find the rightful owner would be considered theft, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. The correct action would be to return the wallet to the owner or turn it into local authorities or lost and found."
