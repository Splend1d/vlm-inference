Convolutional Networks ( \n\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks, especially with high-resolution images. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images, which makes them very suitable for image processing tasks.\n\nIn contrast:\n- B. Graph Networks: These networks are used when the data has an irregular structure or can be represented as a graph, such as molecules or social networks. They are not typically used for standard image classification.\n  \n- C. Fully Connected Networks: Although they can be used for image classification, they usually require more computational resources and training time compared to CNNs, and do not exploit spatial hierarchies information that CNNs do.\n  \n- D. RBF Networks: Radial Basis Function Networks are typically used for regression problems rather than classification tasks. They are not commonly used for image classification."
