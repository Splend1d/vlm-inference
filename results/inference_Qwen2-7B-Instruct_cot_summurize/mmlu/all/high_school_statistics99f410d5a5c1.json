About 95% of polls conducted in this way will give a sample proportion within 3.2 percentage points of the actual proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing.\n\nThis means that if you were to conduct many polls using the same method, 95% of those polls would show a range of support for the president's job approval within 3.2 percentage points above or below the reported 43%. \n\nLet's clarify why the other options are incorrect:\nA. This option incorrectly frames the margin of error as a probability statement about the true population proportion, which it is not. It suggests that there's a 3.2% chance the true proportion is not 43%, but actually, the margin of error reflects our uncertainty around the estimate.\nB. This option reverses the probability. It suggests that there's a 95% chance that the true proportion is exactly 43%, when in fact, the margin of error reflects the uncertainty around estimating the true proportion.\nC. This option confuses the interpretation of the margin of error with the confidence interval. While it mentions a confidence interval (between 39.8% and 46.2%, it incorrectly states that about 95% of polls will fall within this range. The correct interpretation of the margin of error does not specify how many future polls will contain this exact range but rather provides a measure of uncertainty for the current poll's estimate."
