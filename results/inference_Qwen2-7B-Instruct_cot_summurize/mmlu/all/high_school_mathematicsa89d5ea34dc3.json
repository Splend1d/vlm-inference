The expression is:\n\n\\[ (9x^9+7x^8+4x^7) + (x^{11}+x^9+2x^7+3x^3+5x+8) \\]\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the terms by their degree, starting from the highest degree term:\n\n\\[ = x^{11} + (9x^9 + x^9 + 7x^8 + 4x^7 + 2x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms:\n\n- For \\(x^{11}\\), there's only one term, so it remains \\(x^{11}\\).\n- For \\(x^9\\), we have \\(9x^9 + x^9 = 10x^9\\).\n- For \\(x^8\\), there's only one term, so it remains \\(7x^8\\).\n- For \\(x^7\\), we have \\(4x^7 + 2x^7 = 6x^7\\).\n- \\(3x^3\\) and \\(5x\\) remain unchanged since there are no like terms to combine with them.\n- Finally, \\(8\\) also remains unchanged since there are no constant terms to combine with.\n\nSo, after combining like terms, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[ x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. \\(x^{11}+10x^9+7x^8+6x^7+3x^3+5x+8\\)**."
