This is typically done to support sellers or producers, especially in industries with high production costs or where the product is considered essential. By setting a price floor above the equilibrium price, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, creating a surplus. However, the intent is usually to ensure that sellers receive a minimum income, rather than to eliminate shortages or directly assist buyers."
