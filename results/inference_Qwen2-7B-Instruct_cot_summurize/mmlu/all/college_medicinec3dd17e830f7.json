The key difference between these two types of inhibitors lies in their binding sites and mechanism of action, not in how they respond to changes in substrate concentration. \n\nUncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex and thus do not affect the initial binding of the substrate to the enzyme. Therefore, increasing substrate concentration should not change the impact of uncompetitive inhibitors.\n\nSimilarly, noncompetitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site on the enzyme, not directly to the substrate or the enzyme-substrate complex. This means that increasing the substrate concentration should also not alter the impact of noncompetitive inhibitors.\n\nThe effectiveness of both types of inhibitors is determined by factors other than substrate concentration, such as the affinity of the inhibitor for its binding site and the relative concentrations of the inhibitor compared to the enzyme and substrate."
