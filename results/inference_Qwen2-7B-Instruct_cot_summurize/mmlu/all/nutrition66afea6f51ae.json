As people age, their metabolic rates tend to slow down, leading to a decrease in energy requirements. Additionally, many older adults may experience a decline in appetite or changes in taste preferences, which can further reduce their overall food intake. It's important to note, however, that this is not a universal rule, and individual differences in health, activity levels, and personal preferences play significant roles in dietary intake across all age groups."
