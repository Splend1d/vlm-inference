Lower feed efficiency\n\nThis is because the feed efficiency measures how effectively the hogs convert the feed into meat or other products. If the feed efficiency has decreased, meaning the hogs are not converting the same amount of feed into output as they did last year, this would lead to lower returns despite potentially higher input costs per unit of output. The decrease in returns cannot be attributed to changes in market prices, purchase prices, or record-keeping practices based on the information provided."
