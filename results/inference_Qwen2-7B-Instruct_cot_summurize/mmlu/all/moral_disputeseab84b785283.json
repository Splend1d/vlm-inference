                    "text": "Baron argues that the ticking bomb scenario, which involves considering whether to torture a suspect who claims to have information about an imminent terrorist attack, presents a complex ethical dilemma. When discussing this scenario, one significant issue he raises pertains to the implications of justifying one instance of torture.\n\nA. Justifying one instance of torture does indeed require justifying the practice of torture. This is because if one instance can be ethically justified under extreme circumstances (like averting a large-scale disaster, it could potentially set a precedent that might justify more instances of torture in the future. This raises concerns about slippery slope ethics, where once the boundaries of acceptable actions are blurred, it becomes easier to justify further unethical actions.\n\nB. It is virtually impossible for torture to be limited to just one instance. This is particularly true when dealing with complex situations like counterterrorism operations, where the potential for repeated scenarios exists. If the first instance of torture is deemed necessary to save lives or prevent harm, it might lead to a justification for using similar methods again in other cases. This perpetuates a cycle that could result in widespread use of torture.\n\nC. Both A and B: Baron's argument encapsulates both points. The justification for one instance of torture can inadvertently legitimize the practice of torture more broadly, and given the nature of scenarios like the ticking bomb case, it is practically inevitable that such justifications could be applied repeatedly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Both A and B."
