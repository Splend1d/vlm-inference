Whoever sells intoxicating liquor to any person who is intoxicated or inebriated is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section shall not apply in the case of sales of intoxicating liquor by a hotel, motel, or inn to any person registered and resident as a guest in such hotel, motel, or inn for consumption upon the premises thereof. \"\"Section 1213. It shall be unlawful for any vendor with a valid state liquor license to sell intoxicating beverages on Sunday. Anyone in violation of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not less than $100 or more than $1,000. \"The state authorities have regularly enforced the aforementioned dram shop statute and \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales. At 12:30 a. m. on Sunday morning, a customer entered a liquor store and purchased a bottle of wine. The clerk who made the sale, thought the time was 11:30 p. m. Saturday night because that was the time shown on the store's wall clock. Unknown to the clerk, the clock was malfunctioning and was running an hour behind. Thus, the clock displayed the wrong time when the clerk sold the wine to the customer. When the clerk made the sale, the customer did not appear to be visibly inebriated. After making the purchase, the customer drank the entire bottle of wine. He then drove off in his car and struck a pedestrian, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the customer was intoxicated from drinking the wine. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the liquor store, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the liquor store was negligent per se by selling the wine in violation of the \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales.\nB. Yes, because the accident would not have occurred but for the sale of the wine to the customer.\nC. No, because the purpose of the \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales was not to prevent accidents caused by drivers driving while intoxicated.\nD. No, because the clerk did not violate the dram shop statute, and his violation of the \"blue law\" resulted from the clock's malfunctioning.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. No, because the purpose of the \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales was not to prevent accidents caused by drivers driving while intoxicated.\n\nIn this scenario, the liquor store was not in violation of the dram shop statute because the customer did not appear to be visibly inebriated at the time of the sale. The sale itself was lawful under the statute since the customer was not visibly intoxicated. \n\nHowever, the store may still be liable if it can be shown that the sale contributed to the harm, despite the customer not appearing visibly intoxicated at the time of the sale. For instance, if there were prior sales to the same customer which indicated a pattern of purchasing large quantities of alcohol close to closing times, which could suggest the customer had a history of consuming excessive amounts of alcohol rapidly.\n\nRegarding the \"blue law\" violation, the store is not liable for this because the sale occurred during a time when sales are typically occur ( and the store is not usually liable for accidents that happen after the sale, even if they are due to intoxication. The \"blue law\" is intended to regulate business hours rather than to ensure public safety post-purchase.\n\nThe customer's intoxication is a separate issue. The pedestrian may argue that the store should have refused to sell the wine if the customer appeared to be intoxicated. However, since the customer did not appear visibly intoxicated, the store's liability would likely rest on whether the sale directly contributed to the harm, which seems tenuous given the customer's intoxication was not evident at the time of the sale and the clock's malfunction.\n\nIn summary, while the \"blue law\" violation is a legal issue that the store may need to address, the primary concern would be whether the sale of the wine to the customer led to the pedestrian's injury. Given the facts provided, the most reasonable answer would be C, as the \"blue law\" violation does not inherently make the store liable for the pedestrian's injuries."
