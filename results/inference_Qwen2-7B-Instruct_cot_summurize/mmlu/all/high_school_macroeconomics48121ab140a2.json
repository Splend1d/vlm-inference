This phenomenon doesn't fit neatly into traditional economic models which suggest that lower unemployment leads to higher inflation (the \"Phillips curve\" concept. However, among your options:\n\nD. The Phillips curve shifts to the right.\n\nThe Phillips curve typically illustrates the inverse relationship between the rate of unemployment and the rate of change in wages and prices. A shift to the right would imply that higher unemployment does not lead to lower inflation as traditionally expected, but instead, there's an increase in both unemployment and inflation simultaneously, which is the essence of stagflation. \n\nIt's important to note that this is a simplification and stagflation can be complex, involving multiple factors beyond just the relationship depicted on a Phillips curve."
