The rate of growth is given by \\(320e^{0.08t}\\), and we need to integrate this with respect to time \\(t\\).\n\nThe integral of \\(320e^{0.08t}\\) with respect to \\(t\\) is found as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\int 320e^{0.08t} dt = \\frac{320}{0.08} e^{0.08t} + C = 4000 e^{0.08t} + C\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(C\\) is the constant of integration. However, since we're looking for the total amount ( which is essentially an accumulation function, we don't need to worry about \\(C\\) in this context because it would be accounted for in the initial investment amount.\n\nGiven that the initial investment is $4000, we can use this as our base value. The value of the investment after 10 years would then be calculated by evaluating the above expression at \\(t = 10\\):\n\n\\[\n4000e^{0.08 \\times 10} = 4000e^{0.8}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the value of \\(e^{0.8}\\):\n\n\\[\ne^{0.8} \\approx 2.22554\n\\]\n\nThen multiply this by the initial investment:\n\n\\[\n4000 \\times 2.22554 \\approx 8902.16\n\\]\n\nRounding off to the nearest dollar gives us approximately $8902.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $8,902."
