Two employees, who work in different departments, are circumventing an internal control.\n\nThis is the most difficult situation for an auditor to detect because it involves collusion and deception between individuals from different departments. The circumvention of internal controls by two separate entities requires sophisticated methods to cover up their actions, making it harder for the auditor to uncover. It also increases the risk of undetected fraud or errors as these individuals might have more access to information and systems, and could potentially manipulate them without leaving clear audit trails."
