High intake of dietary fiber has been associated with a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer because it helps to speed up the passage of food through the digestive system, reducing the time that potentially harmful substances can interact with the colon lining. It also promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut and can help maintain healthy bowel movements."
