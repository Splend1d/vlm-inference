The leasehold agreement between the landowner and tenant provided that the latter was not permitted \"to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an \u0080\u0098A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. \" On February 1 of the following year, the tenant leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The tenant \u0080\u0094corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the tenant. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide \"by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the landowner and tenant. \"Which of the following accurately states the legal effect of the non-assignability clause contained in the landowner \u0080\u0094tenant leasehold contract?\n\nA. The non-assignability provision had no legal effect.\nB. The non-assignability provision made the assignment from the tenant to the corporation ineffective.\nC. The tenant-corporation lease did not effectuate a breach of the landowner \u0080\u0094tenant contract.\nD. Although the tenant-corporation lease constituted a breach of the landowner \u0080\u0094tenant contract, the landowner would nevertheless be required to recognize the validity of the transfer (of the premises) to the corporation.\n"

Since the tenant leased the premises to a corporation without the required credit rating, this action would be in violation of the non-assignability clause.
