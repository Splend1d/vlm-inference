Being landlocked means it has no direct access to the sea, which complicates and often increases the cost of international trade. Goods must travel through neighboring countries to reach maritime ports for export or import, leading to higher transportation costs and potential delays. This can make Mongolia less competitive in global markets compared to coastal nations that have direct access to international shipping routes.\n\nA. Singapore is not landlocked; it is an island nation with direct access to the sea.\nB. Italy is not landlocked; it is located on the Italian Peninsula in Europe and has access to the Mediterranean Sea.\nC. Spain is not landlocked; it is located on the Iberian Peninsula and has access to the Atlantic Ocean."
