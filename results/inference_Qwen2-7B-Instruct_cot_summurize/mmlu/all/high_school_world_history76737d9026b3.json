                    "text": "The statement you've provided from Ottoman Sultan Selim I's letter to Safavid Shah Ismail I in 1514 indicates that the Safavids were causing controversy among Islamic empires due to their actions and beliefs, which were seen as contrary to established religious norms and practices. The passage suggests that the primary issue was not the geographical location or expansionist nature of the Safavid Empire, nor was it directly related to the rejection of core Islamic tenets by the Safavids (as they were Shiites and did follow a branch of Islam. It also does not explicitly mention the enslavement of Christians as a cause of conflict.\n\nInstead, the passage alludes to the issue of introducing \"evil innovation\" into the \"order\" or established norms of Islam, which would logically imply that the Safavids' actions or beliefs were perceived as deviating or against the traditional understanding of Islam held by the Ottomans and other Sunni Islamic states.\n\nGiven this context, the most accurate answer choice based on the information provided would be:\n\nD. Ismail proclaimed himself to be a Caliph.\n\nThis is because the act of claiming to be a Caliph, which is the highest religious and political leadership position in Sunni Islam, would indeed be a significant claim that could be viewed as introducing \"evil innovation\" or challenging the existing order of religious leadership recognized by the Ottomans and other Sunni states. This claim could potentially undermine the authority and hierarchy of leadership within the broader Islamic community, leading to conflicts and tensions between different Islamic states."
