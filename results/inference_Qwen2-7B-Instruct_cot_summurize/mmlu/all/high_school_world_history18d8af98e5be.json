It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nThe political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The political philosophy espoused in Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's \"The Prince,\" written around 1513, diverges from medieval political thought in several significant ways. While all of the options provided touch upon aspects of the differences between Machiavellianism and medieval political thought, option B stands out as the most accurate representation of a fundamental shift:\n\nB. It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology.\n\nMedieval political thought was deeply intertwined with religious doctrine and ethics, often grounded in the teachings of Christianity. Philosophers and political leaders of the time sought to govern according to divine commandments, moral principles, and the will of God. The concept of the 'just ruler' was often tied to the idea of kingship being divinely ordained, and governance was expected to reflect Christian virtues such as charity, humility, and justice.\n\nIn contrast, Machiavelli's work represents a move towards a more secular and pragmatic approach to politics. He argues that rulers should prioritize power and stability over traditional ethical considerations. Machiavelli suggests that it is sometimes necessary to act unethically or even immorally if it serves the purpose of maintaining control and preventing internal strife. This pragmatic approach emphasizes the ends ( (such as state survival and order) justifying the means, even if those means are considered immoral in a traditional ethical sense.\n\nWhile the other options listed also contain elements of the differences between Machiavellian thought and medieval politics:\n\nA. It accepts the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority - This is partially true, as Machiavelli does advocate for strong, assertive leadership. However, his justification for such authority is more pragmatic and less tied to divine right than medieval thinking would suggest.\n\nC. It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past - While Machiavelli did draw inspiration from classical Roman sources, his focus on practicality and realpolitik is what sets him apart from medieval thinkers who might have emphasized philosophical or theological foundations.\n\nD. It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries - This is another aspect where Machiavelli's thought contrasts with medieval ideas, which often had a hierarchical structure based on feudalism and class distinctions. However, this is not the primary difference between Machiavellianism and medieval political thought, especially since medieval texts themselves varied widely in their treatment of social and economic inequality.\n\nTherefore, option B best encapsulates a key way in which Machiavelli's political philosophy divergedes from medieval political thought: its pragmatic, rather than ethical or religious, underpinnings."
