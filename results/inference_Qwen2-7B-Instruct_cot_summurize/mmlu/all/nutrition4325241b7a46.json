Because they respond more rapidly to changes in iron levels in the diet.\nB. Because blood haemoglobin levels can also respond to a variety of other factors and insults, such as lead poisoning, chronic disease, etc.\nC. Because the specific iron indices can be measured more accurately and easily.\nD. Because haemoglobin levels vary with subject age, and between the sexes.\n"

                    "text": "B. Because blood haemoglobin levels can also respond to a variety of other factors and insults, such as lead poisoning, chronic disease, etc.\n\nThis is because haemoglobin levels can be affected by a multitude of factors beyond just iron status. Conditions like anaemia, which can be caused by iron deficiency but also by vitamin B12 deficiency, chronic diseases, genetic disorders, and even acute illnesses can all lower haemoglobin levels. Similarly, haemoglobin can be depleted due to blood loss from menstruation, pregnancy, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, while low haemoglobin levels often indicate iron deficiency, they can also be caused by many other conditions, making them less specific for diagnosing iron status compared to more specialized markers like serum ferritin or transferrin receptors. \n\nSerum ferritin and transferrin receptor levels, on the other hand, are more specific markers of iron stores and demand. Ferritin is an iron-storage protein, so its levels reflect how much iron is stored in the body. Transferrin receptors are involved in the uptake of dietary iron into cells, so their levels reflect the body's need for iron. Changes in these markers tend to occur earlier and more directly in response to alterations in iron intake and storage, making them more reliable indicators of iron status."
