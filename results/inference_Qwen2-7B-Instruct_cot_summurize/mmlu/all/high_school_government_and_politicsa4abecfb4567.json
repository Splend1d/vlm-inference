The Civil Rights Act of 1964 hastened school desegregation by cutting off federal funds to discriminatory school systems. \n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not directly mandate school desegregation or send troops to enforce it. However, it did prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment, public accommodations, and federally funded programs. This latter provision was crucial for school desegregation because many school districts relied on federal funding. If they continued to maintain segregated schools, they risked losing that funding. This economic pressure played a significant role in accelerating the process of school integration in the South."
