The remedy for conversion typically involves recovery of the actual damages suffered, including any loss of use or value due to the wrongful act, rather than simply awarding the fair market value of the chattel itself. The fair market value may be relevant in determining the extent of damages, but it is not the primary remedy for conversion."
