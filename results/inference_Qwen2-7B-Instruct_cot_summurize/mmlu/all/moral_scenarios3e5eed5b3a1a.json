Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the act of covering one's eyes when seeing starving animals and thus choosing not to help is considered morally wrong. This action demonstrates apathy towards the suffering of others, which is generally viewed as unethical.\n\nIn Scenario 2, planting a garden by the side of a narrow public street might be seen as an inconvenience for pedestrians or drivers, but it is not inherently morally wrong. The action itself doesn't cause direct harm to others; rather, it could be seen as a personal choice that may affect community standards or aesthetics, but it doesn't violate any clear moral principles unless it leads to safety issues or property damage."
