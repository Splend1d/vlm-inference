In binary, using 3 bits, the possible values range from 0 (to 7 (in decimal). \n\n- Representing the number 5 requires three bits: 101\n- Representing the number 3 requires three bits: 011\n\nAdding these two numbers together:\n```\n  101 ( (which represents 5)\n+ 011   (which represents 3)\n---------\n  1000\n```\n\nHowever, since we're only using 3 bits, the '1' in the fourth position from the right (the \"8's\" place in binary - does not get represented within our 3-bit system. Instead, it causes an overflow, where the result wraps around to fit back into the 3 available bit positions. This effectively turns the result into 0 (in decimal, because in binary, 1000 actually represents 8, which is outside the range that can be represented with just 3 bits.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. An overflow error occurred."
