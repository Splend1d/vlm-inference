                    "text": "To determine which statement is false, let's analyze the given system of linear equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nw + 3x + 2y + 2z &= 0 \\\\\nw + 4x + y &= 0 \\\\\n3w + 5x + 10y + 14z &= 0 \\\\\n2w + 5x + 5y + 6z &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Row Reduction\n\nFirst, we can simplify this system by using Gaussian elimination or row reduction. Let's rewrite the system in matrix form \\(AX = B\\) and then reduce it to its row echelon form.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 4 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 10 & 14 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad X = \\begin{bmatrix} w \\\\ x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nReducing \\(A\\) to row echelon form, we find that the system reduces to a form indicating that one of the rows is a linear combination of the others, implying that there are redundant equations. Specifically, the fourth equation can be derived from the first three, indicating that the system is dependent and has either no solution or an infinite number of solutions.\n\n### Step 2: Conclusion on Consistency and Solutions\n\nGiven the dependency among the equations, the system is **consistent** because it can be satisfied by some values of \\(w, x, y,\\) and \\(z\\). This means option A is true.\n\n### Step 3: Infinite Solutions\n\nSince there are fewer independent equations than variables, the system indeed has **infinitely many solutions**, confirming that option B is also true.\n\n### Step 4: Sum of Solutions\n\nFor a system with infinitely many solutions, it is generally true that the sum of any two solutions is also a solution. However, without explicitly solving for all solutions, we cannot definitively prove this property directly from the system as presented. The property holds for systems where each variable is determined freely within certain constraints (which this system exhibits due to its dependence. Thus, option C is plausible but requires further justification based on the specific structure of the solution space. Without additional information or solving the system fully, we cannot conclusively disprove C here, but the logic suggests it might be true based on the nature of systems with free variables.\n\n### Step 5: Scalar Multiples of a Solution\n\nOption D claims that every solution is a scalar multiple of \\((-5, 1, 1, 0)\\). To verify this, we would typically solve the system to find the general form of the solution set. Given the dependency among the equations, it is possible to find a basis for the solution space that includes a vector like \\((-5, 1, 1, 0)\\) if such a vector satisfies the system. However, without explicitly finding the solution set, we cannot conclusively confirm this claim.\n\n### Final Assessment\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- **A** and **B** are true based on the system being consistent and having infinitely many solutions.\n- **C** seems plausible based on the nature of systems with free variables, but without a full proof, it cannot be conclusively disproven or proven based on the information provided.\n- **D** requires verification through solving the system, but given the dependency, it's plausible that a solution set could include a vector that is a scalar multiple of \\((-5, 1, 1, 0)\\).\n\nGiven these considerations, **the most definitive answer that can be confidently identified as false without further explicit solution** is **C**: \"The sum of any two solutions is a solution.\" This statement cannot be conclusively proven or disproven without a more detailed analysis of the solution set, which goes beyond the scope of simply identifying dependencies and consistencies in the system. The other options (A, B, and potentially D) align more directly with the characteristics of the system described."
