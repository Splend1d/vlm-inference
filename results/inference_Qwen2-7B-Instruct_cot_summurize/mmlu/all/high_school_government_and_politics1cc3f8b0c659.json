Because new evidence has voided the state-level verdict.\n\nWhen a felony case fails to result in a conviction at the state level, it may be retried at the federal level if new evidence emerges that was not available or considered during the initial state trial. This can include evidence that was not discovered, was improperly excluded, or was newly uncovered through further investigation or technological advancements. Federal courts have jurisdiction over certain crimes and offenses, and they can review cases where new evidence suggests that the original state court decision was incorrect or unjust.\n\nIt's important to note that the \"Double Jeopardy\" provision of the Constitution ( which is option B, generally prevents a person from being tried twice for the same offense after an acquittal or conviction, except in specific circumstances such as separate trials for different offenses or when a state court acquittal is overturned on appeal and the case is sent back for retrial in a higher court within the same state.\n\nOption A, appealing by state prosecutors, refers to the normal process of appealing a case within the same legal system, either state or federal, but does not necessarily lead to a retrying at the federal level just because the state trial failed.\n\nOption D, civil liberties violations, refers to issues related to individual rights and freedoms under the law, which can be raised in court, but is not the reason for retrying a case at the federal level simply because it failed at the state level."
