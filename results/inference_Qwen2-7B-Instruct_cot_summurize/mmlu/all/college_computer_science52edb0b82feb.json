                    "text": "To determine whether the addition of the integers 109 and -42 falls within range in each representation, let's examine each one:\n\n### I. One's Complement\n\nIn one's complement, negative numbers are representeded by inverting all bits of their positive counterparts. The binary representation of 109 (in an 8-bit system is `01101101`. For -42, we first represent 42 as `00101010` and then invert it to get `11010101`.\n\nAdding these two:\n```\n  01101101\n+ 11010101\n---------\n  00111010\n```\n\nThis results in a carry-out from the most significant bit, indicating an overflow. In one's complement, overflow is common and can lead to incorrect results.\n\n### II. Two's Complement\n\nTwo's complement is the most commonly used method for representing signed numbers in computers. Negative numbers are representeded by adding one to the binary representation of its absolute value.\n\nThe binary representation of 109 is `01101101`, and for -42, we add one to `00101010` to get `00101011`.\n\nAdding these two:\n```\n  01101101\n+ 00101011\n---------\n  10010110\n```\n\nThe result is within the range of an 8-bit system since no overflow occurred.\n\n### III. Sign and Magnitude\n\nIn sign and magnitude, the leftmost bit represents the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative. The remaining bits represent the magnitude. Thus, 109 is `01101101` and -42 is `11010100`.\n\nAdding these two:\n```\n  01101101\n+ 11010100\n---------\n  00111001\n```\n\nThis result is also within the range of an 8-bit system without any overflow issues.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, both Two's Complement and Sign and Magnitude allow for the addition of 109 and -42 to be within range without causing overflow. However, the question seems to imply a single correct answer based on the context provided. Given the options, **C. I and II only** might be intended to highlight that Two's Complement specifically avoids overflow for this operation, but technically, **D. I, II, and III** accurately reflects that both Two's Complement and Sign and Magnitude do not cause overflow for this addition.\n\nGiven the typical understanding of the question's intent, the correct answer should align with the clarification above. If strictly adhering to the provided options, the intended answer would likely be **D**, acknowledging the oversight in the question's formulation."
