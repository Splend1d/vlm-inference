These depictions were not only used for aesthetic purposes but also served as a way to record historical events and religious ceremonies. The Mayans believed in the importance of bloodletting rituals and human sacrifices to appease their gods, which is reflected in their art. It's worth noting that while violence was a part of their culture, it's also important to understand that their society had many aspects of life beyond violence, including complex societal structures, advanced mathematics, and intricate artistic expressions."
