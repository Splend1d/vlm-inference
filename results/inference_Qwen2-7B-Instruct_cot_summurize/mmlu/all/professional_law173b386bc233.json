Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.\nB. The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.\nC. Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.\nD. Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.\n"

The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.\n\nUnder criminal law principles, intent and causation play crucial roles in determining guilt. In this scenario, the person who built the bomb had the intent to commit the crime (by creating and placing the bomb, which directly resulted in the explosion and deaths. This person can be held liable under the state statute mentioned.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-defendant who made the phone call to the casino likely did not have the intent to cause harm; instead, he aimed to extort money. While his actions could be considered reckless or negligent, the phone call itself might not be seen as a direct substantial step toward the actual explosion. The explosion occurred due to a faulty wire, which was an unforeseen and independent intervening cause, rather than a result of the actions taken by this co-defendant.\n\nHowever, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific laws regarding accomplice liability, the co-defendant who made the phone call might still face charges as an accessory before the fact if it's proven that he knowingly assisted in the crime. The key factor here is the difference between intent and causation, as well as the distinction between direct action leading to the crime and indirect support of the crime."
