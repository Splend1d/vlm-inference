A completely randomized design with 24 treatment groups.\n\nTo understand why, let's break down the experiment's components:\n\n- There are are 4 levels of temperature ( \n- 2 types of pans, \n- 3 types of ovens\n\nWhen you multiply these together ( 4 * 2 * 3 = 24, you get the total number of unique combinations or 'treatment groups' that need to be tested. Each of these combinations represents a unique set of conditions under which the cakes will be baked.\n\nOption A incorrectly suggests there are only 9 treatment groups, which doesn't account for all possible combinations. \n\nOption C suggests a randomized block design blocked on temperature with 6 treatment groups. While blocking can reduce variability within groups, this option doesn't fully account for all factors and thus isn't accurate.\n\nOption D also proposes a randomized block design but blocks on the type of pan instead of temperature. This would still not fully encompass all possible combinations as it does not account for the effect of oven type.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is option B, a completely randomized design with 24 treatment groups, which accounts for all the interactions between temperature, pan type, and oven type without imposing any blocking structure that wasn't specified in the problem statement."
