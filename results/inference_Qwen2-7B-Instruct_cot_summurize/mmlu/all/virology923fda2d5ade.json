In this case, since three students had to take the test at a later date, their scores might be significantly different from the initial group, potentially skewing the mean if these students performed exceptionally well or poorly.\n  \n- **Median**: The median is less affected by outliers. It represents the middle value when the data is ordered, so it remains relatively stable even if new values are added, as long as these new values do not drastically alter the middle position of the data set.\n  \n- **Mode**: The mode ( which is the most frequently occurring score, might not provide a reliable measure of central tendency if the distribution is multimodal or if the mode is not representative of the central tendency.\n  \n- **Standard Deviation**: This measures the dispersion or spread of the scores around the mean. It does not directly estimate the central tendency but rather indicates how spread out the scores are. Its value can change due to the addition of new scores, especially if those scores are far from the existing mean.\n  \nGiven that the three students' scores could potentially be significantly higher or lower than the rest of the class, the median would be the least biased estimator of central tendency because it is not influenced by the magnitude of these new scores. It focuses solely on the position within the ordered list of scores, making it the most robust choice in this scenario."
