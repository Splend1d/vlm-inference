Fatty acid synthesis** in these subjects.\n\nMalonyl-CoA is an allosteric inhibitor of fatty acid synthase, the key enzyme in the process of fatty acid synthesis. When malonyl-CoA levels rise, it binds to fatty acid synthase, causing a conformational change that reduces the enzyme's activity, thereby inhibiting fatty acid synthesis. This inhibition could be a response to the induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, as insulin promotes fatty acid synthesis and can increase malonyl-CoA production."
