This is because the health care system needs to cater to a larger number of elderly individuals, who generally have more complex medical needs due to age-related illnesses and chronic conditions. Ensuring access to quality healthcare, managing long-term care, and addressing issues like dementia, heart disease, and osteoporosis become major concerns.\n\nWhile options A ( Immunization, B: Adequate schools, and C: Daycare facilities are also important aspects of a country's social and public health policies, they are not the primary concern in countries dealing with an aging population in the same way that health care is."
