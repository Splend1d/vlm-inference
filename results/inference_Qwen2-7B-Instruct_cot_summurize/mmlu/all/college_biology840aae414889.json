Chloroplast\n\nProteins that need to be targeted to the chloroplast, which is an organelle in plant cells and algae responsible for photosynthesis, usually require two different signal peptides. The first signal peptide guides the nascent polypeptide chain through the nuclear pore into the nucleoplasm, where it then folds and is modified before being exported out of the nucleus. The second signal peptide directs the protein to the chloroplast envelope, where it can be further processed and localized within the organelle.\n\nFor other options:\n\nA. Plasma membrane - Proteins targeting the plasma membrane often use a single signal sequence that is recognized by the transport machinery and directed to the Golgi apparatus for further modifications before being inserted into the plasma membrane.\n\nB. Lysosome - Lysosomal proteins are directed to the lysosomes using a specific signal sequence that is recognized by the Golgi apparatus and leads to their incorporation into vesicles that fuse with the lysosomes.\n\nC. Cytosol - Proteins destined for the cytosol do not typically use signal peptides, as they are synthesized directly in the cytoplasm without the need for targeting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Chloroplast."
