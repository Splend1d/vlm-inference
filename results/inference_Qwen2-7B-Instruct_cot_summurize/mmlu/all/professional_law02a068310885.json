The written contract entered included a \"payment clause,\" which provided that the videographer would be \"paid $10,000 for the filming and editing of a 60-minute video of the wedding and the reception. \" The man included in the contract a stipulation that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the videographer filmed and edited the 60-minute video, using high definition equipment, and presented it to the man. The videographer then submitted to the man an invoice statement in the amount of $15,000. Besides the $10,000 contract figure, the bill included a $5,000 charge for the use of the high definition equipment. Denying any additional liability, the man sent the videographer a check for $10,000. The videographer then brought suit against the man to recover the additional $5,000. Which of the following arguments would be most persuasive to support the videographer's contention that when the written contract was executed, the man agreed to pay the videographer $5,000 for use of the high definition equipment in addition to the $10,000 fee?\n\nA. According to the customary trade practice of the video industry, a $10,000 fee for filming and editing means $10,000 in addition to a supplemental charge if high definition equipment is used.\nB. An oral agreement to that effect, if provable, would only supplement, not contradict, the \"payment clause\" as written.\nC. Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document. \"\nD. Assuming arguendo that the written \"payment clause\" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.\n"

Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document.\"\n\nThis argument align with the Uniform Commercial Code ( (UCC), which governs contracts involving goods and certain services. In such cases, the UCC allows for the consideration of extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties, even when the contract itself is clear and unambiguous. This is because the UCC aims to ensure that commercial transactions are are interpreted fairly, taking into account the practical understanding of the parties involved.\n\nThe other options either misrepresent the context or introduce unnecessary complexities:\n\nA. The argument about customary trade practices may not hold up in court, as the contract between the specific parties is the primary consideration, and industry standards are not legally binding.\n\nB. An oral agreement, if proven, might add to the contract but would not necessarily confirm the $5,000 charge for high definition equipment; it could potentially contradict the written contract if the written contract is clear.\n\nD. While equitable considerations might suggest looking at the circumstances surrounding the contract, the UCC's approach through extrinsic evidence is more directly applicable and relevant to resolving disputes over contract terms, especially when the contract appears clear but there are discrepancies in interpretation."
