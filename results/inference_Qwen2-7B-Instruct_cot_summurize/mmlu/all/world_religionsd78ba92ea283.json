Catherine of Siena\n\nCatherine of Siena, a 14th-century Italian mystic, theologian, and doctor of the church, is known for her deep contemplative life and her belief in the unity of God's creation. She taught that all things in the universe, including evil, emanate from God and are part of His plan. In her view, evil can be seen as a distortion that reveals divine love more clearly because it highlights the need for grace and redemption, thereby making the experience of God's love more profound when it is received."
