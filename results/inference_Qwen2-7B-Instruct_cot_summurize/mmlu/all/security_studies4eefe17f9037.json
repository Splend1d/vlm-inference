It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations.\nB. Social constructivists reject the foundations of realism upon which military security studies are based; in rejecting the empirical basis of security studies, the social constructivist approach becomes inadequate in its attempts to formulate military security theory.\nC. Social constructivism is based on philosophical ideas that directly contradict the foundations of military-centred theory. The tendency is for social constructivists to dismiss military endeavours as clumsy and as being detrimental to human security.\nD. In order to study military security, analysts must adopt a realist lens. However, this can later be combined with other approaches, including social constructivism, in order to consider the security of different referent objects such as the environment or human security.\n"

This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations.\n\nSocial constructivism offers a unique perspective on military security by emphasizing the role of shared beliefs, norms, and values in shaping state behavior and international relations. Unlike realism, which focuses primarily on power, interests, and anarchy in the international system, social constructivism argues that these elements are influenced by social constructs and the way actors perceive them.\n\nBy studying military security through a social constructivist lens, analysts can explore how cultural, social, and ideological factors influence the motivations behind military actions, the creation of alliances, and the resolution of conflicts. This approach can lead to a more nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in military operations, as well as the potential for collaboration and cooperation among states.\n\nThe adoption of social constructivism in military security studies encourages the integration of social and development specialists in conflict situations. These experts can provide valuable insights into local cultures, societal dynamics, and the broader social context, which can inform more effective and sustainable peacekeeping and conflict resolution strategies. By considering the impact of social factors, military interventions may be better equipped to address the root causes of conflicts and contribute to long-term stability and security.\n\nIn summary, while realism remains a dominant theoretical framework in military security studies, adopting a social constructivist approach allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the interplay between military actions and cultural, social, and ideological factors. This broader perspective can lead to improved military strategies, enhanced cooperation among nations, and more effective conflict resolution and peacebuilding efforts."
