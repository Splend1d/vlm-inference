During contraction, H zones actually become shorter as the muscle fibers shorten, not elongate. This is because the H zone is the region between two adjacent A bands ( which are composed of myofibrils and are made up of thick filaments ( composed of myosin molecules and thin filaments composed of actin molecules.\n\n- B. This statement is correct. In the relaxed state, tropomyosin is in its high-affinity state, covering the binding sites on actin where myosin heads would bind during muscle contraction. This prevents myosin from binding to actin and thus prevents contraction.\n\n- C. This statement is incorrect. It is the thin filament that contains the actin-binding site and the ATP-hydrolyzing site ( where myosin heads bind to actin and release ADP and phosphate, leading to muscle contraction. The myosin molecule itself has the actin-binding site, but the ATP-hydrolyzing site is part of the myosin motor domain.\n\n- D. This statement is also incorrect. Troponin and tropomyosin are components of the thin filament, not the thick and thin filaments. The thick filament is composed mainly of myosin protein, while the thin filament consists of actin and troponin-tropomyosin complex."
