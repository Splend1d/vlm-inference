                    "text": "A toy collector had purchased 10 antique toys over the last several years and had had them restored by an expert in toy restoration. On June 1, the collector sent the 11th antique toy to the expert with a signed note that read: \"Here is another toy for you to restore. As with all prior jobs, I will pay $500 for the work, but no more.\" On June 4, after receipt of the collector's June 1 note and the toy, the expert began restoring the toy. On June 6, the collector unexpectedly died. On June 7, unaware of the collector's death, the expert sent the collector a note that stated that the restoration work had begun on June 4. The following day, the expert learned of the collector's death. Does a contract exist that binds the expert and the collector's estate?\n\nA. No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.\nB. No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.\nC. Yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.\nD. Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n"

Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n\nIn this scenario, the collector's offer to pay $500 for the restoration work was made via a note sent on June 1st. This offer can be considered as a unilateral contract or a contract by conduct, where the terms of the contract (the price to be paid for the restoration service - were communicated to the expert through the note. \n\nThe expert then accepted this offer by performing the restoration work, which is the performance required under the contract. Even though the expert might not have sent a formal acceptance note until June 7th, the performance of the agreed-upon service is what constitutes acceptance in this context. The expert started the restoration work on June 4th, after receiving the note and the toy, which indicates their willingness to fulfill the terms of the offer.\n\nTherefore, a contract does exist between the collector and the expert, binding the expert to complete the restoration work for $500, even after the collector's death. The contract is valid because it was formed before the collector's death and the acceptance (in the form of work performed) occurred before the expert knew of the collector's death."
