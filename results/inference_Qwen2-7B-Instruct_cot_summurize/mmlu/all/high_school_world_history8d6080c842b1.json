It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following most inspired the national plan advanced by Nkrumah in the second paragraph?\n\nA.

This plan was designed to be in line with the interests of the non-aligned state. Among the options given ( Fascism, Social Darwinism, and Classical liberalism do not align with this goal. Socialism, which focuses on collective ownership of the means of production and democratic control, seems more in line with the desire for a national plan that prioritizes the state's interests.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nD.
