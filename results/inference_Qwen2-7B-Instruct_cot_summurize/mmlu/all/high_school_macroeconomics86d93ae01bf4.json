                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The assumption underlying monetarism that is often highlighted is the stability of the velocity of money. Monetarists believe that changes in the money supply have a direct and predictable effect on price levels, with the velocity of money (the average number of times a unit of currency is spent in a period\u2014remaining relatively constant over time. This assumption allows monetarists to predict inflation and economic fluctuations based primarily on monetary policy decisions.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are not central assumptions of monetarism:\n\n- A. The marginal propensity to consume being constant: While this can be an assumption made for simplifying models, monetarism does not inherently assume that the marginal propensity to consume is constant. It focuses more on the role of the money supply and velocity.\n  \n- B. The money supply is continuous: This refers to the ability of a central bank to adjust the money supply continuously, which is indeed one of the tools used by central banks but not a core assumption of monetarism itself.\n\n- C. The exchange rate is fixed: Monetarism does not necessarily assume a fixed exchange rate system. In fact, monetarist theory can be applied in both fixed and floating exchange rate systems, although the implications might differ. The focus is more on the impact of money supply changes on domestic prices rather than international exchange rates."
