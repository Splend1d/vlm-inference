This dispersion is often driven by factors such as the desire for affordable living spaces, access to nature, or the availability of better-quality living environments outside the traditional city center.\n\nTherefore, option A accurately describes a feature of a decentralized city. The shift of employment and services away from the inner city towards multiple centers in smaller towns and rural areas is a hallmark of decentralization.\n\nOptions B ( the degendering of public space as women use local facilities more, and C gentrification: the movement of middle-class people back into the inner city, do not specifically define what a decentralized city is. While they may occur in certain contexts within a decentralized city, they are not inherent features that universally define a decentralized city.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. the shift of employment and services away from the inner city towards multiple centres in smaller towns and rural areas\n\nAnd it's important to clarify that D. all of the above is not accurate based on the provided information."
