Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\nA. valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\nB. valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\nC. invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\nD. invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.\n"

However, the power to direct civilian federal employees to engage in specific activities, particularly those outside their primary job responsibilities, generally lies with the agency heads or Congress, depending on the nature of the position and the task at hand.\n\nIn this case, the President's directive involves the Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS), which primarily focuses on border control and immigration enforcement. While the President might argue that this is an emergency situation that justifies overriding normal operational boundaries, the courts would typically look for clear statutory authority or a compelling constitutional justification for such an expansion of executive power. Without explicit congressional authorization or a clear constitutional basis, the court would likely find the directive to be an overreach of executive power.\n\nMoreover, if the President's directive is seen as interfering with the day-to-day operations of the INS without proper congressional oversight or legislation, it could be viewed as an encroachment on the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of government. Therefore, the court would most likely rule the executive order invalid based on these considerations."
