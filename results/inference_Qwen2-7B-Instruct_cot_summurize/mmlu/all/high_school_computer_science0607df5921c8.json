The formula should generate numbers from `low` to `high`, inclusive.\n\nOption A doesn't take into account the difference between `high` and `low`. It generates a number between 0 and `high`, then adds `low`, which means the range starts from `low` but could potentially go beyond `high`.\n\nOption B generates a number between 0 and `high - low`, then adds `low`. This also results in an incorrect range because the maximum possible value would be `high - 1` instead of `high`.\n\nOption C correctly calculates the range by considering the difference between `high` and `low` (including both bounds, so it multiplies `Math.random()` by `(high - low + 1)` and then adds `low`. This ensures the generated number can range from `low` to `high` inclusively.\n\nOption D multiplies `Math.random()` by `(high + low)` and then adds `low`. This results in a range starting from `low` but likely exceeding `high` because the maximum value generated would be greater than `high`.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice that will always return a value satisfying the postcondition is **C**."
