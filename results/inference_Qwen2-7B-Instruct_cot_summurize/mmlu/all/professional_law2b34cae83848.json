I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. \"The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6.

I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. \"Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?\n\nA. Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.\nB. Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.\nC.

No, because the man received the letter on May 4.\n\nIn the context of contract law, a valid power of acceptance is typically given when the offeree (the person who receives the offer) is given sufficient notice of the offer. The power of acceptance is considered terminated if it lapses due to an unreasonable delay in responding to the offer, especially if the offer specifies a time limit for acceptance.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman's letter specified a 15-day period from May 1 for the man to decide whether to accept the offer. The man received the letter on May 4, so he still had 11 days within the specified time frame to decide whether to accept the offer. As the man acted promptly upon receiving the letter on May 6 and attempted to accept the offer on May 18, within the 15-day period, his power of acceptance was not terminated by the lapse of time. The fact that he did not read the letter until May 6 does not affect the validity of his response since he still acted within the timeframe provided in the original letter."
