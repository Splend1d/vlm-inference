Engagement of military forces to expel certain social groups from within a state. \n\nWhile institutions A (churches and schools, and institution B political-nationalist strategies, are often employed by states to reinforce cultural and nationalistic values, the engagement of military forces to expel social groups is an extreme measure that is typically not used for cultural or nationalistic purposes. It can be seen as a violation of human rights and is usually associated with conflicts, wars, and ethnic cleansing rather than the maintenance or promotion of cultural values or nationalism."
