To provide housing for all those homeless within a state\n\nWhile the European Court of Human Rights has recognized positive obligations of states, such as the duty to protect individuals from harm, there is no direct ruling that specifically mandates states to provide housing for all homeless individuals. The Court's judgments typically focus on issues like access to healthcare, education, and other fundamental rights, rather than providing a blanket obligation to address homelessness directly. However, cases may interpret existing positive obligations in ways that could be applied to situations involving homelessness, depending on the context."
