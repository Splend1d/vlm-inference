This means that as a consumer consumes more units of a good, the additional satisfaction ( or utility, gained from each extra unit decreases. As a result, consumers are willing to pay less for each additional unit, which is represented by a downward sloping demand curve. \n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. Increasing marginal cost as consumption rises: This would actually cause the supply curve to slope upwards, not the demand curve.\n\nC. Decreasing marginal cost as consumption rises: This is typically associated with economies of scale in production, and it affects the supply curve, not the demand curve.\n\nD. Increasing total utility at an increasing rate as consumption rises: This would suggest that the consumer gains more satisfaction from each additional unit consumed, which is not consistent with the law of diminishing marginal utility that underpins the demand curve."
