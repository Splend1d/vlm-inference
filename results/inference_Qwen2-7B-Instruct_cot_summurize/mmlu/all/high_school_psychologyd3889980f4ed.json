The right frontal lobe is associated with motor functions on the opposite side of the body, so damage to this area can lead to difficulties with movement, particularly in the left side of the body. The other options ( A. understanding auditory information, B. understanding written information, and C. speaking intelligibly - are typically associated with damage to different brain regions such as temporal lobes for auditory processing, and Broca's or Wernicke's areas for speech and language production and comprehension respectively."
