As they were approaching an intersection, their vehicle collided with a motorcycle whose rider was seriously injured in the accident. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. In addition, the roommate brought suit against the rider for operating his motorcycle negligently and driving through a red light. The roommate subsequently reached an out- of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. At trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he observed the rider drive his motorcycle through a red light and then swerve into the path of the graduate's automobile. In rebuttal, the rider offered into evidence the roommate's complaint against the graduate alleging that the latter was driving \"at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred. \"The complaint is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nC. admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise.\n"

This means it is an assertion that would tend to incriminate or be harmful to the declarant (the roommate himself in this case, since he is now testifying on behalf of the defendant (the rider. Under certain exceptions to the hearsay rule, such statements can be admitted into evidence if they meet the criteria for being against the declarant's interest.\n\nOptions A and C refer to other exceptions to the hearsay rule, but they do not apply here. Option A, \"admissible as an admission,\" does not fit because the statement is not made by the defendant but rather by the roommate who has a potential conflict of interest. Option C, \"admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule,\" refers to a situation where testimony given in a prior proceeding is used as evidence in a subsequent trial, which is not applicable in this context.\n\nOption D suggests that the complaint is inadmissible because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise. However, the admissibility of the statement is not necessarily tied to the outcome of the lawsuit but rather to whether it qualifies as a declaration against interest."
