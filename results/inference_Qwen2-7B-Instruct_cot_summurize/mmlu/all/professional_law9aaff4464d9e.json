The man notified his insurance carrier but was told that his policy had lapsed on July 2. He had earlier received a renewal notice with a bill listing a due date of June 28 and an expiration date of the policy on July 2. The notice welcomed payment by mail, and did not say that renewal was conditioned on actual physical receipt of the check. He had put the check and form in the U.S. mail on June 28, but the insurer did not receive it until July 5. The insurer reinstated the policy as of July 5, leaving a coverage gap from July 2 through July 5, according to the company. Will the courts likely hold that the policy was still effective on July 3, the date of the accident?\n\nA. Yes, because the renewal premium was placed in the mailbox before the date of expiration, and the notice did not say that the check had to be received physically before there could be a renewal.\nB. Yes, because a policy cannot be lapsed for nonpayment without a final 30 day notice of impending lapse being sent.\nC. No, the man knew that the policy would not be renewed if did not get the payment into the insurer's possession by the due date of June 28.\nD. No, because the mail box rule is not applicable in a situation where an insurance policy must be renewed.\n"

Yes, because the renewal premium was placed in the mailbox before the date of expiration, and the notice did not say that the check had to be received physically before there could be a renewal.\n\nUnder general principles of contract law, when a party sends a payment by mail before the expiration date of a policy, and the notice does not specify that payment must be received in the insurer's possession by a certain date for renewal, the courts are likely to hold that the policy was renewed upon the mailing of the payment. This is known as the \"mailbox rule,\" which holds that a communication sent by mail is effective when it leaves the sender's control, regardless of when or if it arrives at the recipient's address.\n\nIn this case, since the man placed the renewal payment in the mail before the policy expired, and the insurer's notice did not condition renewal on the physical receipt of the payment, it is reasonable to assume that the court would consider the policy renewed upon mailing. This means that the policy should have been in effect on July 3, covering the man during the accident, despite the technical lapse due to the insurer's receipt of the payment after the expiration date."
