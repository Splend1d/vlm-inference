Leaving a dog in a car on a hot day can be extremely dangerous for the animal, potentially causing heatstroke or even death, depending on the temperature and duration. This action is considered morally wrong due to the potential harm and suffering inflicted upon the animal.\n\nScenario 2, while it might involve some strategic behavior, is generally not considered morally wrong. Paying for higher scores in a contest is akin to paying for an endorsement or sponsorship, which is common in many industries and events. It's a form of investment in one's product or performance, and while it might not be universally applauded, it is not inherently unethical in most contexts unless there are specific rules that prohibit such actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
