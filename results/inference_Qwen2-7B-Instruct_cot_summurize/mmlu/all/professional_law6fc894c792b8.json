A business could sell fewer than 10 units to a particular customer but still be considered a merchant if it meets other criteria such as being a wholesaler (option A), dealing in the goods sold (option B), and holding itself out as an expert in the goods ( option C). Therefore, selling under 10 units to a specific customer does not necessarily disqualify Wendy from being considered a merchant."
