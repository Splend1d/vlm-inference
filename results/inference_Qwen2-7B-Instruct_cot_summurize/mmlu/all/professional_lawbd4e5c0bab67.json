Because of this increased work load, the Court has complained that it is unable to properly review all of its cases. As a consequence, Congress formed a committee to conduct a study on improving the functioning and operation of the Court. Based on the committee's recommendations, Congress enacted a statute dividing the Court into two panels. One panel would be assigned to handle criminal cases exclusively, while the other panel would handle all non-criminal matters. Each panel would be composed of four associate justices and a chief justice. According to the new law, the decisions of each panel would be final and not reviewable by any other court or judiciary. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute?\n\nA. The statute contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.\nB. The statute does not fall within the enumerated powers of Congress and is not necessary and proper for the effectuation of those powers.\nC. Based on the doctrine ofjudicial supremacy, Congress does not have authority to legislate with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\nD. Based on the separate sovereignty doctrine, Congress does not have authority to interfere with the procedural machinery of the Supreme Court.\n"

The statute contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.\n\nThis argument suggests that the Constitution establishes a single Supreme Court ( as an independent judicial branch institution, and Congress's attempt to divide it into separate panels for handling different types of cases could undermine the unity and independence of the Supreme Court as intended by the Constitution. This directly conflicts with the structure and powers delineated in Article III of the Constitution, which states that \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\" The proposed division of the Court could potentially lead to inconsistencies in the interpretation and application of laws and constitutional principles across different case types, thereby compromising the integrity and uniformity of the nation's highest judicial authority."
