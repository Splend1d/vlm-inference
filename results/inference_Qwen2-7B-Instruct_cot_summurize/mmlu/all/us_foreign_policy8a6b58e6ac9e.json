Bush administration changed the direction of US foreign policy by criticizing and sometimes withdrawing from international organizations, particularly after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. This shift was partly driven by a belief in the necessity of unilateral action and a skepticism of multilateral institutions's ability or willingness to confront terrorism effectively. This approach was reflected in policies decisions such as the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which was pursued with less international consensus compared to previous military interventions.\n\nOption B describes an expansion of NATO, which occurred under President George H.W. Bush but continued under George W. Bush; it does not specifically describe a change in direction of US foreign policy initiated by him.\n\nOption C refers to a personal style of leadership, which is more about the administration's management style rather than a significant change in foreign policy direction.\n\nOption D pertains to the level of international support for the United States, which can fluctuate based on various factors and does not necessarily indicate a change in the direction of US foreign policy under the Bush administration."
