The woman then drove through a red light and struck a police car driven by a police officer, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the police officer was returning from an emergency dispatch. The police officer sued the woman to recover damages suffered in the auto accident. At trial, the police officer presented evidence that he was returning from an emergency scene when the woman drove through a red light and struck his patrol car. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's presentation of evidence, the woman moved for a summary judgment claiming the \"firefighter's rule\" barred recovery. The motion for summary judgment should be\n\nA. granted, because the accident would not have occurred but for the emergency.\nB. granted, because the police officer assumed the risk of injury by answering the emergency call.\nC. denied, because the police officer's injury was not related to any special danger of his job.\nD. denied, because the firefighter's rule does not apply to police officers.\n"

                    "text": "The \"firefighter's rule,\" also known as the \"emergency responder exclusion,\" generally refers to a legal doctrine in some jurisdictions that bars recovery by a plaintiff who is injured due to the negligence of emergency responders while they are performing their duties. This rule aims to protect emergency personnel by limiting liability that could arise from their inherently dangerous jobs.\n\nHowever, the application of this rule varies significantly across different jurisdictions, and there may be exceptions or modifications to it. In some places, the rule may not apply to police officers, firefighters, or other first responders, or it may be limited in scope.\n\nGiven the context provided:\n\nThe motion for summary judgment claiming the \"firefighter's rule\" barred recovery should be **D. denied**, because the firefighter's rule does not apply to police officers.\n\nThis conclusion assumes that the jurisdiction in question does not have a specific law that excludes police officers from the application of the firefighter's rule. Without knowing the specific legal context, we can't definitively state that the rule applies to police officers in every situation. Therefore, the court should deny the motion for summary judgment unless there is clear evidence that the jurisdiction has a statute or precedent that specifically excludes police officers from the firefighter's rule."
