Research has consistently shown that individuals who display high levels of \"time urgency\" within this behavioral profile are at greater risk for developing heart disease compared to those with less pronounced Type A characteristics. This increased risk may be attributed to behaviors such as rushed eating, poor stress management, and increased psychological stress, all of which can contribute to cardiovascular health issues."
