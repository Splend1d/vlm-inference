This means if you have a polynomial, and you extend the rational numbers by adding its roots, you get a splitting field.\n\n**Statement 2**: The existence of a field with 60 elements involves understanding finite fields. A finite field, also known as a Galois field, has \\(p^n\\) elements where \\(p\\) is a prime number and \\(n\\) is a positive integer. Since 6 0 is not a prime number, it's not possible to construct a field with exactly 60 elements using this formula directly. However, the question might be asking about a field that can be constructed through other means or possibly misstated. In standard mathematical terms, there is no finite field with exactly 60 elements because 60 does not factor into a product of a prime raised to a power and an integer.\n\nGiven these explanations:\n\n- **Statement 1** is true because a splitting field of a polynomial over \\(Q\\) always exists.\n- **Statement 2** is false based on the standard definition and construction of finite fields.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. True, False**"
