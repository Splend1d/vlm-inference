However, this system does not support virtual memory, which is implemented in systems with paging or segmentation with page tables (II typically found in a segmented paging system. Additionally, purely segmented systems can suffer from internal fragmentation because each segment is fixed in size and may not fit efficiently within the available contiguous memory space, leading to unused gaps between segments (III."
