By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a cousin, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the cousin would pay the owner the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The owner never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the owner conveyed her property interest in the premises to a developer. During the cousin's tenancy, the State Highway Authority filed proceedings to condemn two acres of the tract for the purpose of highway construction. As a result, the cousin contacted the developer and informed him that he should be entitled to an apportioned reduction in the rental. After the developer refused to reduce the rent, the cousin brings an action to have his rent apportioned pro tanto. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the developer, although the cousin would be entitled to terminate the lease.\nB. the developer, because the cousin would be held to the original leasehold contract.\nC. the cousin, because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto.\nD. the cousin, because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.\n"

The cousin is now occupying less land than originally agreed upon, so his rent should be adjusted accordingly. This adjustment reflects the fact that the cousin's use and enjoyment of the property has been diminished by the loss of two acres for highway construction.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The developer is not entitled to a reduction in rent because the cousin's rent obligation is tied to the original lease agreement, not the owner's subsequent actions with the developer.\n\nB. The cousin is not bound by the original lease terms since the terms regarding the payment of taxes were not explicitly addressed in the assignment from the friend to the cousin.\n\nD. While eminent domain can affect the value of the property and potentially lead to adjustments in rent, the specific question pertains to the apportionment of rent based on the reduction of the cousin's property interest, not the legal principle behind eminent domain itself."
