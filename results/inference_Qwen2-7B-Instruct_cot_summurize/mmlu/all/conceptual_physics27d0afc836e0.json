These vibrations consist of compressions ( (regions where the particles are close together) and rarefactions ( (regions where the particles are spread out). Both compressions and rarefactions move in the same direction that the sound wave is traveling. This means that as a sound wave moves through the air, it creates a series of compressions and rarefactions that all travel along with the wave in the same direction."
