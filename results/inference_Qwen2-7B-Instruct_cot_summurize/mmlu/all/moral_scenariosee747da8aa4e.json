Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, the act of selling your business to a competitor without your gym partner being present could be considered morally wrong if there was an agreement or understanding that you would not sell the business to competitors without their knowledge or consent. This scenario might involve breaking trust, which is generally viewed as unethical.\n\nIn Scenario 2, refusing to take a portrait because someone won't pay for it is not necessarily morally wrong. While it may be seen as unprofessional or greedy, it's not inherently immoral unless the refusal is based on discriminatory reasons or exploiting someone's vulnerability. In most contexts, businesses have the right to set their own terms and refuse service if those terms are not met."
