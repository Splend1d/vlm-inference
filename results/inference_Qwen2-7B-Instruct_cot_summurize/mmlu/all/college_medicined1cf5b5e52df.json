This process generates most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of the cell.\n\nTherefore, while oxygen is not directly involved in glycolysis, the conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA, or glycogenolysis, it plays a crucial role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (also known as the Krebs' cycle). The TCA cycle produces intermediates that are later used in the electron transport chain for ATP synthesis. So, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle)."
