This means that the correct answer is:\n\nB. of opportunity cost.\n\nThe concavity of the PPF curve represents the trade-offs between producing two goods or services. As an economy shifts resources from producing one good to another, the opportunity cost\u2014the cost of giving up production of one good to produce more of another\u2014increases. This is due to factors such as the law of diminishing returns, which states that as you add more of one input to a fixed input, the marginal increase in output will eventually decrease. Thus, as an economy produces more of one good, it must give up increasing amounts of the other good, leading to the observed concavity in the PPF."
