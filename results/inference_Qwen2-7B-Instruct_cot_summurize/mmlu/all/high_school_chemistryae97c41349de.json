The more electronegative the central atom, the easier it is to donate a proton.\n\nConsidering this:\n\nA. HBrO: Bromine (Br is more electronegative than chlorine but less electronegative than iodine.\nB. HClO: Chlorine (Cl is more electronegative than bromine but less electronegative than iodine.\nC. HIO: Iodine (I is less electronegative than both bromine and chlorine.\nD. HClO3: Chlorine is the central atom, just like in B, but it has 3 oxygen atoms instead of 1, which typically makes the acid stronger due to resonance stabilization and more effective donation of protons.\n\nGiven these considerations, the strongest acid among the options would be **D. HClO3** because it has a more electronegative central atom (chlorine compared to the others, and the presence of three oxygen atoms leads to a more stable structure, which allows for better proton donation."
