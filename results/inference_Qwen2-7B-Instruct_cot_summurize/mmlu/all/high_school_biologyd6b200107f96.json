Therefore, when we say an individual organism has greater fitness than another, it means that it is more successful at leaving more viable offspring than others of its species. This concept is central to the theory of natural selection, which posits that traits that enhance reproductive success are are more likely to be passed on to future generations. \n\nOptions A, B, and C are not accurate definitions of fitness because they do not necessarily correlate with reproductive success. For example, an organism that lives longer may not necessarily leave more offspring if it is less able to compete for resources or mate successfully. Similarly, while competition for resources and mating frequency can impact reproductive success, they are not the defining criteria of fitness."
