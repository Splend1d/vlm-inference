                    "text": "To determine which statement is true about \\(f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 9x - 18\\), let's analyze each option:\n\n### A. \\(f(x) = 0\\) has three real solutions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo find out if there are three real solutions to \\(f(x) = 0\\), we can use Descartes's Rule of Signs or attempt to factor the polynomial or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, without specific tools or further algebraic manipulation, this requires understanding that a cubic equation always has at least one real root due to the Intermediate Value Theorem and the fact that it changes sign at least once. Moreover, since the leading coefficient is positive and the degree is odd, we know there is exactly one real root (because the other two roots must be complex conjugates, and their presence doesn't affect the number of real roots in a cubic polynomial). This implies that there are indeed three real solutions, considering the nature of cubic equations.\n\n### B. \\(f(x) \\geq -18\\) for all \\(x \\geq 0\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo verify this, we need to check the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) for \\(x \\geq 0\\). Given the nature of the cubic function, as \\(x\\) increases, the \\(x^3\\) term will dominate, causing \\(f(x)\\) to increase without bound. To check if \\(f(x) \\geq -18\\) holds, we can evaluate \\(f(0\\) and see how \\(f(x)\\) behaves as \\(x\\) increases from 0.\n\n\\[f(0) = 0^3 + 2*0^2 - 9*0 - 18 = -18\\]\n\nFor \\(x > 0\\), \\(f(x)\\) will certainly be greater than \\(-18\\) because the \\(x^3\\) term will contribute positively to the value of \\(f(x)\\), making it always greater than \\(-18\\) when \\(x\\) is positive. Thus, **B** is true.\n\n### C. \\(f(x) \\leq -18\\) for all \\(x \\leq 0\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nGiven the cubic nature of \\(f(x)\\), and knowing that the leading coefficient is positive, \\(f(x)\\) decreases as \\(x\\) moves from negative values towards zero, but it does not stay below \\(-18\\) for all \\(x \\leq 0\\). As \\(x\\) approaches 0 from the left, \\(f(x)\\) will eventually exceed \\(-18\\) due to the \\(x^3\\) term. Therefore, **C** is false.\n\n### D. The function \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing for \\(x \\leq -3\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo determine where \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing, we should look at its derivative, \\(f'(x)\\), to find critical points where the function might change direction. The derivative of \\(f(x)\\) is:\n\n\\[f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 9\\]\n\nTo find where \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing, we set \\(f'(x) < 0\\):\n\n\\[3x^2 + 4x - 9 < 0\\]\n\nThis quadratic inequality does not easily reveal decreasing intervals without solving it, but knowing that \\(f'(x)\\) changes sign at the roots of \\(f'(x) = 0\\), we can infer that \\(f(x)\\) decreases between these roots. Without solving explicitly, we understand that the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) and its derivative will depend on the roots of \\(f'(x)\\), which are are not immediately obvious without further algebraic work. However, given the nature of a cubic function and its derivative, it's not straightforward to conclude based on the information provided that \\(f(x)\\) is specifically decreasing for \\(x \\leq -3\\) without additional context or calculations. \n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- **A** is true because a cubic polynomial with a positive leading coefficient will have three real roots.\n- **B** is true because for \\(x \\geq 0\\), \\(f(x)\\) will indeed be greater than \\(-18\\).\n- **C** is false because \\(f(x)\\) does not necessarily stay below \\(-11\\) for all \\(x \\leq 0\\).\n- **D** cannot be conclusively determined without further explicit calculation of the roots of \\(f'(x)\\) and determining the exact intervals where \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing, but it's not directly evident from the information provided that \\(f(x)\\) is specifically decreasing for \\(x \\leq -3\\).\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward true statement based on the provided options is **B**: \\("
