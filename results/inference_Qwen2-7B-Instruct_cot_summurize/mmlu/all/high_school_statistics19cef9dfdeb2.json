To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school, two plans are proposed. Plan I would sample 30 students at random, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Plan II would sample 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the market, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Which is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school?\n\nA. Plan I\nB. Plan II\nC. Both plans use random samples and so will produce equivalent results.\nD. Neither plan will give an accurate estimate.\n"

This means that it may not accurately represent the stock market investment behavior of the students who do invest, as it could potentially underrepresent or overrepresent their investment levels depending on how the 1650-student population is distributed between those who invest and those who don't.\n\nOn the other hand, Plan B specifically targets those who have invested in the stock market by sampling from this subset of 132 students. This approach ensures that the sample more accurately reflects the characteristics of the group whose behavior we're interested in studying (\u2014the students who have invested in the stock market. By calculating the average investment within this group and estimating the total investment based on this average, Plan B provides a more precise estimate of the total investment made by students who invest in the stock market.\n\nTherefore, Plan B is more likely to yield an accurate estimate of the total stock market investment by students in this school compared to Plan A."
