Branched-chain amino acids (Leucine, Isoleucine, and Valine when deaminated in muscle produce ammonia. This ammonia is then converted into Alanine through a process called transamination. Alanine is then transported out of the muscle cells via the bloodstream. Similarly, some ammonia can also be converted into Glutamine for transport out of the muscle cells. This process helps in maintaining the balance of nitrogen and pH within the muscle cells."
