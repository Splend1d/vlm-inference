Near the end of the flight, the pilot saw a cloud of fog ahead but decided that he could navigate through it. He got lost in the fog and crashed the plane into the side of a mountain. The pilot and his passenger were both killed instantly in the crash. If the passenger's family brings a wrongful death action against the pilot's estate, the most likely result is that the plaintiffs will\n\nA. recover under strict liability, because the pilot engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\nB. recover under negligence, because the pilot failed to exercise reasonable care in the operation of his airplane.\nC. not recover, because the passenger did not pay to go on the flight.\nD. not recover, because the passenger unreasonably exposed himself to a known danger.\n"

This breach led to the fatal accident, which would be considered negligence. Negligence claims focus on the defendant's failure to meet the standard of care expected of someone acting reasonably under similar circumstances.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\nA. Strict liability typically applies when there's a known risk associated with the defendant's actions, such as owning a dangerous animal or engaging in an inherently risky activity. The scenario does not clearly indicate any such conditions.\nC. The payment status of the passenger doesn't affect the validity of the lawsuit. The passenger's family has a right to seek compensation for damages regardless of whether they paid for the flight.\nD. While the passenger's presence might suggest a voluntary exposure to risk, this factor alone would not bar recovery. The key consideration is whether the pilot's actions were unreasonable, not the passenger's decision to board the flight."
