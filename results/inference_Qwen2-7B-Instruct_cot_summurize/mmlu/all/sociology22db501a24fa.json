These crimes may not be immediately apparent, especially when they involve complex financial dealings or are carried out by trusted insiders. As a result, they can go unnoticed until significant losses have occurred or until there is an internal audit, regulatory investigation, or other triggering event.\n\nWhile some white-collar crimes might involve substantial sums of money (eliminating option A, and while law enforcement and regulatory bodies do investigate various forms of white-collar crime (eliminating option C, it's important to note that the police and regulatory agencies actively work to prevent and detect these crimes), the complexity and subtlety of these offenses often make them difficult to detect, even for experienced professionals. This lack of detection contributes to their low visibility in society.\n\nOption B, \"the proletariat can outsmart the bourgeoisie,\" is not a standard reason given for the visibility of white-collar crimes, although social dynamics and power structures within organizations can influence who is more likely to commit or benefit from such crimes."
