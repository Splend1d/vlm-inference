However, they should not replace the professional judgment of a licensed psychologist. It's important for a psychologist to interpret the results in the context of the client's overall situation, considering factors such as the client's history, current functioning, and any other relevant information. Therefore, while computerized tools can offer valuable insights, they should always be interpreted within the broader framework provided by the psychologist's clinical expertise."
