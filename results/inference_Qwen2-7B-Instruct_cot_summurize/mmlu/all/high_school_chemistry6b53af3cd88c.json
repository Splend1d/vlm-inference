The value for nitrogen is less than that of phosphorus because nitrogen is larger, but greater than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a greater effective nuclear charge.\n\nElectronegativity generally increases across a period ( from left to right in the periodic table due to an increase in effective nuclear charge attracting valence electrons more strongly. Nitrogen (N is in the second period and group 15, phosphorus P is also in the second period but in group 15, and oxygen O is in the second period but in group 16. Oxygen typically has a higher electronegativity than nitrogen because it is in a higher group ( having more protons in its nucleus which leads to a stronger pull on its valence electrons. Phosphorus has a slightly higher atomic number than nitrogen, which means it has a slightly larger atomic radius and thus a slightly weaker effective nuclear charge compared to nitrogen, but still, it attracts its valence electrons more effectively than nitrogen due to its higher atomic number. Therefore, nitrogen's electronegativity falls between that of phosphorus and oxygen based on these principles."
