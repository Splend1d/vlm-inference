II and III only\n\nExplanation:\n- Statement I is false: The number of time steps required by programs does not inherently depend on whether they are designed for horizontal or vertical microarchitectures. Instead, it depends on factors such as the complexity of the instructions being executed and the specific design of the processor's instruction pipeline.\n- Statement II is true: In a horizontal microarchitecture, each microinstruction typically performs a single operation, which means that the microinstructions are unencoded. Each microinstruction corresponds to a single step in the execution of an instruction.\n- Statement III is true: In a horizontal microarchitecture, microinstructions often contain a single opcode followed by multiple operand specifiers. This allows for more flexibility in specifying the exact operation and operands needed for a given instruction, as opposed to a vertical microarchitecture where the same microinstruction can perform different operations based on encoded fields within the microinstruction itself.\n\nTherefore, statements II and III are correct, making option D the right choice."
