The period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk\n\nIn a solid disk rotating about its axis, all points on the disk complete one full rotation in the same amount of time. This means that regardless of how close or far a point is from the axis of rotation, all points have the same period of rotation. The period is defined as the time it takes for an object to complete one full cycle of motion, and in this case, the cycle is one full rotation.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The velocity ( specifically linear velocity, is not the same on every point on the disk. Points farther from the axis of rotation have a greater linear velocity than those closer to the axis.\n\nB. The part closer to the axis does not have a longer period. In fact, the period is the same for all points on the disk.\n\nD. Similarly, the part closer to the axis does not have a shorter period; all points on the disk have the same period."
