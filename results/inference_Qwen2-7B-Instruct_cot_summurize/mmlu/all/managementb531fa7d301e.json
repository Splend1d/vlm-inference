Micro-managing the workforce\n\nMicro-managing the workforce is not considered one of the recognized challenges for modern managers in the sense that it is generally viewed as a negative practice. It refers to a management style where supervisors closely oversee and control the work of their employees, often due to mistrust or lack of confidence in their team's abilities. Modern management theory emphasizes empowering employees, fostering autonomy, and promoting collaboration, rather than micromanagement. The other options listed ( managing communications, manage change, and managing the learning organization\u2014are all recognized challenges for contemporary managers."
