H \u2192 He \u2192 C \u2192 N \u2192 O \u2192 Si \u2192 Fe\n\nThis sequence represents the order of nucleosynthesis that occurs within stars, starting with hydrogen (H) fusing into helium (He) in the star's core, and then progressing through heavier elements up to iron (Fe). \n\nThe creation of these elements happens through a process called nuclear fusion. In stars, the core temperature and pressure are high enough for nuclei to fuse together. Hydrogen fuses into helium in the first stage of stellar evolution. As the star evolves and becomes more massive, the core temperature increases, allowing for the fusion of helium into carbon (C), followed by oxygen (O), neon (Ne), silicon (Si), and finally iron (Fe).\n\nAfter reaching iron, the star cannot produce energy by fusing heavier elements, leading to the star's eventual fate such as a supernova or white dwarf depending on its mass. The elements created in stars are then dispersed into space when the star dies, enriching future generations of stars and planetary systems."
