However, this could be debated since Elton John is a public figure and such activities are might not always be legally actionable unless they reach certain thresholds of intensity or frequency.\n\nIn Scenario 2, reporting someone involved in illegal drug trafficking, particularly within a sensitive environment like a prison, is clearly morally right and ethically responsible. It supports the rule of law, protects the safety of individuals, and upholds the integrity of institutions functions."
