They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1750\u20131900 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The development that most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph, which describe a scenario where Portuguese traders carried luxury goods like silk, musk, and porcelain from China to Japan in exchange for silver, and vice versa with goods from India, is:\n\nC. The Industrial Revolution\n\nThe Industrial Revolution brought significant advancements in manufacturing processes, leading to increased production efficiency and the ability to mass-produce goods. This resulted in a shift towards standardized products that could be easily replicated and traded on a global scale. European countries, including Portugal, began to produce goods such as textiles, machinery, and manufactured items that were in high demand in Asia, particularly in China and Japan. This led to a decrease in the demand for luxury goods like silk and porcelain, which were traditionally traded in these regions-to acquire silver.\n\nAs a result, the trade patterns described in the passage changed significantly. Instead of relying on unique, handcrafted goods for trade, European powers started exporting goods that could be produced more cheaply and efficiently, thus altering the balance of trade and reducing the need for silver as a medium of exchange. This shift was facilitated by improvements in transportation infrastructure, such as the development of steamships, which allowed for faster and more reliable long-distance shipping.\n\nThe other options do not directly address the trade dynamics described in the passage:\n\nA. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants could have initially sparked interest in trade, but it does not explain the shift away from traditional trade patterns over time.\n\nB. Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas primarily influenced political and philosophical changes rather than directly impacting trade patterns in the same way that the Industrial Revolution did.\n\nD. The colonization of Africa contributed to the expansion of European trade networks and the acquisition of resources, but it did not fundamentally alter the trade dynamics between Asia and Europe as described in the passage."
