Nursing a patient at home. \n\nEbola is primarily transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person when they are sick (bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea, sweat, semen, and vaginal secretions. This includes caring for someone who is sick without appropriate protective equipment. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with surfaces or materials that have been contaminated with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nWorking in a Category IV laboratory (A) involves handling pathogens that pose a very high risk of causing serious or lethal disease in humans, but this typically does not involve the general public and the risk is mitigated by safety protocols and training.\n\nAttending a funeral of a victim outside ( (B) may pose a risk if there are are inadequate practices to prevent the spread of the virus, such as proper burial procedures, personal protective equipment use, and hygiene practices.\n\nAttending football matches or large gatherings (D) might increase the risk of spreading other infectious diseases, but specifically regarding Ebola, it would depend on whether any participants are are infected and how well health guidelines are are followed, such as social distancing and wearing masks."
