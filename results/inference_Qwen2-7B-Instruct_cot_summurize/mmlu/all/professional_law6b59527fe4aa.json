The article was false, and was printed without adequate research. The doctor sued the newspaper company, claiming damages per se. The paper defended on the basis that this was a public interest article, that the paper was not reckless or malicious in its investigation and reporting, and that the doctor could not prove any special damages. Will the court adopt the defense reasoning and dismiss the case for failure to state a claim?\n\nA. Yes, the doctor is a professional figure in the community and he must accept the risk of false reporting, especially where he cannot prove any special damages.\nB. Yes, the newspaper is allowed to make mistakes as long as there is no malice, and the case must be dismissed as a matter of law.\nC. No, this fits the requirements for slander per se and there is a valid claim of malice stated against the paper.\nD. No, this fits the requirements for libel per se, which is so inflammatory that the doctor does not have to prove special damages.\n"

No, this fits the requirements for slander per se and there is a valid claim of malice stated against the paper.\n\nSlander per se refers to statements that are inherently damaging and do not require proof of special damages ( such as harm to reputation, loss of business, etc., to establish a cause of action. In this case, the false article about the doctor being afflicted with a venereal disease and volunteering for a program studying cures is inherently damaging to his reputation, regardless of whether he can prove specific instances of harm. \n\nThe fact that the newspaper claims it was acting in the public interest does not automatically shield them from liability. Whether they acted with malice, recklessness, or negligence in their reporting would need to be determined by the court. If the court finds that the newspaper did not exercise reasonable care in verifying the information before publishing, or that they published the information knowing it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth, then the defense might not hold.\n\nTherefore, the doctor's case could proceed if he can demonstrate that the statements made were false and that the newspaper acted with at least negligence or malice, without the necessity of proving specific damages beyond the inherent damage to reputation."
