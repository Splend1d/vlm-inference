However, according to the World Bank's own historical data and global population statistics, it's important to note that in 2018, about 76% of the world's population lived in lower and middle-income economies ( (defined by the World Bank as those with a GDP per capita between $1,035 and $12,735). \n\nGiven that the world economy has likely continued to grow since 1997, it's reasonable to assume that the proportion of the world's population living in low and lower-middle income countries would have decreased over time due to economic development and growth in these regions. Therefore, the fraction of the world's population in these countries in 1997 was likely higher than what it is now.\n\nWithout the exact percentage for 1997, we can't definitively choose an answer from the options provided (A. 25%, B. 40%, C. 55%, D. 75%. However, based on the trend of economic development and the general decrease in the number of people living in low and lower-middle income countries, option C. 55% seems like a plausible estimate if we were to make an educated guess. It would be advisable to cross-reference any specific historical data points with the most reliable sources or direct data from the World Bank for the most accurate information."
