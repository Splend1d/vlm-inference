Inquiry and other procedures such as observation.\n\nWhen written documentation does not provide sufficient evidence of operating effectiveness, auditors typically turn to alternative methods such as inquiry and observation to assess control procedures. Inquiry involves asking relevant individuals about the operation and effectiveness of controls. Observation may involve watching how controls are implemented or functioning in real-time. These methods can help gather information on whether the controls are being designed and operated effectively to achieve their intended objectives."
