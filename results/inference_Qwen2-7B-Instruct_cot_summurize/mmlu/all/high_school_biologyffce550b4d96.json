In this context, if one sex is in a minority, it may be advantageous for them to receive more care and resources to increase their chances of survival and reproduction, thus balancing the sex ratio. This type of selection helps maintain a stable sex ratio by favoring traits that allow the minority sex to compensate for their lower numbers."
