While some people might argue that adopting pets without considering the responsibilities involved could be seen as irresponsible, it is not necessarily morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It depends on the circumstances and whether the person can provide a suitable environment for the kittens.\n\nScenario 2 involves querying a security guard's whereabouts when they have left their post. This action could potentially be considered disrespectful or even threatening, depending on how it was presented and received. It could also compromise safety if the guard was supposed to be present for security reasons. Thus, this scenario seems to involve a morally questionable action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
