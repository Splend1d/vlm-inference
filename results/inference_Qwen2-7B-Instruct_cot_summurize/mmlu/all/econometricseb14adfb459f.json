The roots of an MA(q) model are related to its invertibility conditions, which ensure that the model can be transformed into an equivalent AR form.\n\nHowever, if we're looking at the characteristic equation associated with this particular MA(2) model:\n\n\\[y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t\\]\n\nWe can re-write it as:\n\n\\[y_t = u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}\\]\n\nWhich is generally represented as:\n\n\\[y_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\theta_i u_{t-i}\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\theta_i\\) are are the parameters of the MA model. In this case, the parameters are \\(\\theta_1 = 3\\) and \\(\\theta_2 = -1\\). \n\nTo find the characteristic roots (for an MA model, you would look at the roots of the polynomial that corresponds to these parameters in the context of an equivalent AR representation. However, since the direct interpretation of \"roots\" for an MA model isn't straightforward like in an AR model, the concept might not directly apply here in the traditional sense.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 1 and 2\nB. 1 and 0.5\nC. 2 and -0.5\nD. 1 and -3\n\nNone of these options seem to directly correspond to a typical characteristic root of an MA model based on standard time series analysis principles. The question might be misstated or misunderstood, given the nature of characteristic roots in the context of MA processes. If the question aims to ask about the parameters of the model, then option D (1 and -3 might be a misinterpretation of the coefficients of the model.\n\nIf the aim was to clarify the concept of 'roots' in an MA model, it's important to note that the roots concept doesn't directly translate from AR models to MA models. Therefore, without additional context or clarification on what is meant by 'roots' in this specific scenario, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. \n\nIn conclusion, the question might need some clarification to provide an accurate response."
