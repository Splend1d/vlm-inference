The woman explained that her car was being serviced and would not be ready for a couple of days. The woman told her neighbor that she had a doctor's appointment that afternoon and would return the car immediately afterwards. The neighbor agreed and gave the woman permission to use her car. As the woman was driving to her doctor's office, she collided with another car. As a result of the accident, the other driver brought suit against the woman and the neighbor to recover for her personal injuries. The other driver asserted a claim against the neighbor for negligent entrustment of an automobile and charged the woman with negligent operation of a motor vehicle. In her case-in-chief, the other driver called a witness to testify to three incidents of careless driving on the woman's part during the past six months. The trial judge should rule the testimony\n\nA. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the woman was negligent on this occasion.\nB. admissible, because the witness had personal knowledge of the woman's poor driving record.\nC. admissible against the neighbor as evidence of the woman's lack of fitness.\nD. inadmissible, because specific acts are not admissible except to rebut evidence of good character.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Inadmissible, because specific acts are are not admissible except to rebut evidence of good character.\n\nIn the context of the law, specific instances of a person's conduct (or \"specific acts\") are generally not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion they acted in a certain way. This is known as the \"rule against character evidence.\" This rule exists to prevent unfair prejudice or misleading the jury by suggesting a pattern of behavior without sufficient probative value.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which allow specific instances of conduct to be admitted for purposes other than proving character, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. In this case, the other driver may attempt to use the specific acts of careless driving to prove negligence or intent on the part of the woman at the time of the accident.\n\nThe testimony about the three incidents of careless driving would likely be considered inadmissible under the general rule against character evidence unless it falls within one of these exceptions. Therefore, the trial judge should rule the testimony inadmissible unless the other driver can show how these specific acts are relevant to a matter at issue other than the woman's character.\n\nThe judge should consider the relevance of the specific acts to the claims made in the case and whether their admission would serve a legitimate purpose beyond suggesting a propensity for the woman to drive carelessly. If the judge determines that the specific acts are relevant to showing the woman's negligence or state of mind at the time of the accident, then the testimony might be allowed under the appropriate exception to the general rule against character evidence."
