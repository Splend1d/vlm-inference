The prime factorization of 50 is \\(2 \\times 5^2\\). The factors of 50 can be \\(1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50\\). We need to find combinations of three factors (since each represents the sum of two variables (like \\(a+b\\), \\(b+c\\), or \\(c+a\\)) such that their sums are positive integers and add up to \\(a+b+c\\).\n\nGiven that \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) are are positive integers, we look for combinations where each pair of numbers (when added) results in another positive integer. Also, considering the constraint of the sum being relatively small (as we are looking for \\(a+b+c\\), we consider that the sum of these pairs should not exceed a reasonable limit based on the factorization.\n\nThe most straightforward way to achieve a product of 50 with three factors (where each factor is a sum of two positive integers) would be to use the factors directly as sums:\n\n- \\(5+10=15\\)\n- \\(2+25=27\\)\n- \\(50=50\\)\n\nThese pairs do not directly give us a unique solution because we have more factors than necessary. However, since \\(a+b+c\\) needs to be found, and given the context, we aim for a combination that directly adds up to a simple number without needing further decomposition.\n\nConsidering the simplicity and the options provided, let's evaluate if any of the factor combinations naturally lead to a sum that matches one of the options directly.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem, it seems there might have been an oversight in the interpretation of the question's direct application of the algebraic manipulation leading to a straightforward solution path. Instead, let's directly approach the problem with a focus on the final goal: finding \\(a+b+c\\).\n\nGiven the complexity introduced by the algebraic simplification and the potential misinterpretation in the explanation, let's reconsider the direct approach to the problem statement, aiming for clarity and simplicity:\n\nGiven:\n\\[ ( (a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 150 \\]\n\nWe aim to find \\(a+b+c\\). Let's re-examine the equation and its implications more carefully.\n\nGiven the equation structure and the options, it's clear that direct algebraic simplification led us astray in terms of finding a direct path to \\(a+b+c\\). Instead, let's think about the problem more intuitively:\n\nGiven the equation, we're dealing with a cubic relationship involving sums and differences of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\). Without delving too deeply into complex algebraic manipulations that initially led us astray, let's reflect on the nature of the problem and the options provided:\n\nGiven the options A. 16, B. 6, C. 12, D. 150, we are looking for a straightforward, intuitive approach rather than a detailed algebraic derivation that doesn't immediately yield the solution.\n\nUpon reviewing the equation and the options, the correct approach involves recognizing that the problem setup and the given equation suggest a specific pattern or relationship that might align more directly with the answer choices through a different line of reasoning.\n\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the problem, the correct interpretation should involve recognizing the structure of the equation and how it relates directly to the sum \\(a+b+c\\) without requiring extensive algebraic manipulation beyond the initial setup.\n\nRevisiting the problem with the goal of finding \\(a+b+c\\) directly:\n\nGiven the equation and the nature of the problem, a direct calculation or a more straightforward algebraic insight was sought but was not immediately apparent in the detailed explanation provided. The correct approach involves recognizing the equation's implications more directly towards the sum \\(a+b+c\\) without the initial misstep in"
