This is based on historical data from the World Bank, which indicates that these countries generally have higher secondary enrollment rates compared to others such as Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Timor-Leste. However, it's important to note that specific enrollment rates can fluctuate year to year and between sources due to various factors including changes in policy, economic conditions, and global events.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- **Colombia** has shown improvements in education over the years, including secondary education.\n- **Peru** has also made strides in increasing access to education, particularly at the secondary level.\n- **Uruguay** is known for its strong education system, with high literacy rates and secondary school enrollments.\n- **Costa Rica** has a well-established educational system with significant investment in education, leading to high enrollment rates.\n\nTherefore, option A ( Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica, seems to be the most accurate choice based on general trends and available data as of 2020."
