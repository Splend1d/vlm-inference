                    "text": "The correct answer is B. 2/3 V.\n\nThis problem can be solved using the continuity equation, which states that the mass flow rate must be constant throughout the system. For an incompressible fluid (like water or air, the continuity equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ A_1 \\cdot v_1 = A_2 \\cdot v_2 = A_3 \\cdot v_3 \\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) represents the cross-sectional area of the pipe and \\(v\\) represents the velocity of the fluid. The areas are related to the radii by the formula for the area of a circle, \\(A = \\pi r^2\\).\n\nGiven that the original pipe has radius \\(Q\\), its area is:\n\\[ A_1 = \\pi Q^2 \\]\n\nEach of the smaller pipes has radius \\(Q/2\\), so their combined area is:\n\\[ A_2 + A_3 = 2 \\cdot \\pi ((\\frac{Q}{2})^2 = 2 \\cdot \\pi \\frac{Q^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi Q^2 \\]\n\nSince \\(A_1 = A_2 + A_3\\), we have:\n\\[ \\pi Q^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi Q^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\pi Q^2 \\]\n\nUsing the continuity equation \\(A_1 \\cdot v_1 = A_2 \\cdot v_2 + A_3 \\cdot v_3\\), and knowing \\(A_1 = \\pi Q^2\\), we can solve for \\(v_2\\) and \\(v_3\\):\n\\[ \\pi Q^2 \\cdot v_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi Q^2 \\cdot v_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\pi Q^2 \\cdot v_3 \\]\n\nGiven that \\(v_1 = V\\), we substitute and solve for \\(v_2\\) and \\(v_3\\). Since the total area is now divided among two smaller areas, the velocities must increase to maintain the same mass flow rate. To find the relationship between the velocities, consider that the total area is halved, implying the flow needs to be distributed over this reduced area, necessitating an increase in velocity to compensate.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume \\(v_2 = v_3 = x\\), then:\n\\[ \\pi Q^2 \\cdot V = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi Q^2 \\cdot x + \\frac{1}{2} \\pi Q^2 \\cdot x \\]\n\\[ \\pi Q^2 \\cdot V = \\pi Q^2 \\cdot x \\]\n\\[ V = 2x \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{V}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the flow speed through each of the paths is \\(2/3 V\\), considering the total flow rate is conserved. This makes choice B the correct answer."
