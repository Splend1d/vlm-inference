                    "text": "The statement \"an actually infinite number of things\" refers to the concept of infinity in mathematics and philosophy. This concept has been widely discussed and explored, leading to various interpretations and applications. In modern mathematics, particularly in set theory, the idea of infinity is well-defined and plays a crucial role. Therefore, the answer to whether an actually infinite number of things can exist depends on the context and the specific interpretation of infinity one adopts.\n\nGiven this background:\n\nA. Is possible - This answer aligns with mathematical theories that allow for the existence of infinite sets, such as the set of all natural numbers, which has no end and is considered an actual infinity.\n\nB. Is meaningless - This perspective suggests that the concept of infinity does not have any real-world or conceptual significance, which is a more philosophical stance and not universally accepted.\n\nC. Exists somewhere - This answer implies that infinity could be found or realized in some form or context, but it's important to clarify what is meant by \"exists.\" In mathematics, certain infinities do exist within formal systems, whereas in other contexts, the notion of existence might be more nuanced.\n\nD. Cannot exist - This view holds that infinity is merely a conceptual tool and does not correspond to anything tangible or realizable in the physical world or logical discourse.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the most accurate answer would likely depend on the specific context or framework one is operating within. However, among the options provided, \"is possible\" ( (Option A) is supported by mathematical theories and concepts, making it the most appropriate choice if considering the mathematical reality of infinity."
