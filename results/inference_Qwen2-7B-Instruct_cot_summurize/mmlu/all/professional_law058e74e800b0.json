This was the first action taken, and the creditor did not have a judgment. It served the notice of garnishment on the garnishee, the woman's employer. The employer honored the notice by holding all of the woman's earnings in escrow pending the creditor's lawsuit and entrance of final judgment against the woman. The state where defendant lived and worked had a provision for pre-judgment garnishment, as long as the money was held and not distributed until a judgment was entered. The money would be paid to the woman if a judgment was not entered with the next 120 days. The woman sued the employer and the creditor, demanding release of her earnings. Will the court order the garnishee to release the funds to the woman?\n\nA. No, because the state procedure for protecting the woman's money until a judgment is entered is a fair one that comports with procedural due process.\nB. No, because the state has an interest in protecting the rights of creditors to collect debts through the garnishment procedure.\nC. Yes, because the only party that has garnishment rights in the United States is the Internal Revenue Service.\nD. Yes, because the interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violates procedural due process.\n"

Yes, because the interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violates procedural due process.\n\nExplanation: The court would likely order the garnishee (the employer in this case - to release the funds to the woman if it is determined that her rights were violated under procedural due process. Procedural due process requires that before the government can deprive someone of a significant right, such as property or liberty, they must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard. In this scenario, the woman was not given a chance to contest the garnishment before her earnings were frozen. Therefore, the court might rule that the employer should release the funds to the woman since she was denied her due process rights. \n\nOptions A, B, and C do not accurately reflect the legal principles at play here. Option A incorrectly states that the state's procedure is fair, which does not automatically justify the violation of individual rights. Option B focuses on the state's interest in protecting creditors, but it does not address the specific issue of due process. Option C incorrectly limits the ability to garnish wages to the Internal Revenue Service, when in fact, various entities can initiate garnishments based on their respective legal authority."
