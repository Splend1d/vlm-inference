A negative value suggests that high volatility periods are associated with lower (or negative) average returns (vice versa for positive values. However, this parameter's exact value cannot be determined without actual data or specific model fitting results.\n\nHowever, in general, if the market is efficient and all available information is already reflected in the price, one might expect a close to zero or insignificant GARCH-in-mean effect, as extreme price movements (high volatility) should not have a systematic effect on the expected return. \n\nSo, given the options:\n\nA. Less than -1: This would suggest that higher volatility leads to disproportionately low returns, which might be expected in a market where high volatility periods are followed by periods of lower returns due to risk aversion or profit-taking.\n\nB. Between -1 and 0: This could represent a situation where high volatility leads to lower than average returns, but not to an extent that it would be described by a value less than -1.\n\nC. Between 0 and 1: This would suggest a positive but not excessively strong relationship between volatility and returns.\n\nD. Bigger than 1: This seems unlikely, as it would imply that the higher the volatility, the more the returns increase, which contradicts typical expectations under efficient markets.\n\nWithout specifics, it's hard to pick the most likely answer, but option B might seem the most plausible if we consider typical market behaviors."
