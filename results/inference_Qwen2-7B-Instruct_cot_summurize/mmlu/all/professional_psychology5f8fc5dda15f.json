In the context of psychology, this can arise when a psychologist, such as a supervisor, is held liable for the actions of their supervisees or trainees. For example, if a supervisee under a supervisor's guidance commits an ethical violation or malpractice, the supervisor might face vicarious liability. This is particularly relevant in roles where supervision and oversight are expected, such as clinical supervisors in a psychological practice. \n\nOptions B ( advocate, C faculty member, and D talk show host typically do not involve the same level of direct supervision or responsibility for the actions of others that could lead to vicarious liability. Advocates may have some level of accountability for their clients' outcomes, but they usually aren't supervising or training others. Faculty members and talk show hosts may occasionally provide guidance or mentorship, but their roles generally don't involve the same degree of direct supervision as a professional supervisor in a psychological setting."
