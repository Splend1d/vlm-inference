This means encoding any special characters in the input data so that they are treated as literal text rather than part of a command or query.\n\nOption B, \"Interrupt requests,\" is not a standard method for preventing SQL injection. This might be interpreted to mean stopping or blocking requests from certain sources, but it's not a specific technique for preventing SQL injection.\n\nOption C, \"Merge tables,\" is also not a method for preventing SQL injection. While managing table structures and relationships can help with data integrity and security, it does not directly address the risk of SQL injection.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Escaping queries is one of the key strategies to prevent SQL injection by ensuring that user inputs do not affect the SQL logic."
