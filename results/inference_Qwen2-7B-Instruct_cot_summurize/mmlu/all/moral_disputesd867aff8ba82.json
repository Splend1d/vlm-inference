He believes that the threat of the death penalty can prevent some murders, even if it may not deter every murderer.\n\nB. He holds that the purpose of criminal law is to protect the innocent, which justifies the use of severe punishments like the death penalty for serious crimes such as murder.\n\nC. He argues that the death penalty's severity and finality are fitting for the gravity of murder, suggesting that the punishment should match the crime.\n\nD. Therefore, combining all three points, van den Haag supports the idea that the death penalty serves as a deterrent, is justified by the need to protect the innocent, and appropriately reflects the seriousness of murder."
