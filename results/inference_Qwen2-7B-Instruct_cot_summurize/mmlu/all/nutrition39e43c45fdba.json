Here's what each option means:\n\nA. This statement is not entirely accurate. Food allergies are not avoidable simply by limiting the amount of the allergen. The immune system's reaction is not determined by the amount of the food consumed, but rather by the presence of the specific allergen. Allergens can be present in very small quantities and still cause an allergic reaction.\n\nB. Food allergies are not the same as food intolerance. While both conditions involve adverse reactions to food, food allergies involve the immune system reacting to specific proteins in the food, while food intolerances typically involve issues with digesting certain components of the food (like lactose in dairy products for lactose intolerance.\n\nC. This statement is true. Food allergies usually occur only after an individual has been sensitized by prior exposure to the allergen. This sensitization process involves the immune system recognizing the food protein as harmful and creating antibodies against it.\n\nD. This statement is false. Food allergies are not just uncomfortable; they can be quite serious and require immediate medical attention in the case of anaphylaxis, which is a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction. Even mild reactions can lead to more serious complications if not properly managed.\n\nIn summary, food allergies cannot be avoided by limiting intake, they are distinct from food intolerances, typically occur after sensitization, and should not be considered of little medical concern due to their potential severity."
