The witness denied ever having heard the defendant make such threats, even though she had testified to that effect before the grand jury. The prosecutor now seeks to admit the witness\u00d5s grand jury testimony. How should the court rule with regard to the grand jury testimony?\n\nA. Admit the testimony, because it contains a statement by a party-opponent.\nB. Admit the testimony, both for impeachment and for substantive use, because the witness made the inconsistent statement under oath at a formal proceeding.\nC. Admit the testimony under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. Exclude the testimony for substantive use, because it is a testimonial statement.\n"

Admit the testimony under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nThe Federal Rules of Evidence include an exception to the hearsay rule known as the \"former testimony\" exception. This exception allows for the admission of a witness's prior testimony given in a previous legal proceeding when the witness is unavailable and the testimony was given under oath in a prior proceeding where the party had full opportunity to cross-examine the witness. In this case, the witness testified under oath before the grand jury, which is a formal proceeding, and the defendant (as the opposing party) had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness. Therefore, the grand jury testimony can be admitted into evidence under the former testimony exception."
