As he drove down a small hill toward an intersection with a stop sign, he applied the brakes, but they failed to work, and the truck did not slow down. The farmer could not stop for the stop sign. He saw a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection and tried to steer around him, but was unable to do so. The pickup truck struck the pedestrian and seriously injured him. If the injured pedestrian asserts a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer, and if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the car, will the pedestrian prevail?\n\nA. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.\nB. No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.\nC. Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\nD. Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.\n"

Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\n\nIn this scenario, the injured pedestrian has a strong case against the auto dealership. The key legal principle here is product liability, which holds manufacturers and sellers responsible for defects in their products that cause harm to consumers. The fact that the brake failure was due to a manufacturing defect means that the truck, when sold by the dealership, was not fit for its intended use.\n\nThe injured pedestrian would likely argue that the dealership negligently sold a vehicle with a known defect (the brake failure caused by the manufacturing defect. This negligence could be established if the dealership knew or should have known about the defect but failed to address it or warn potential buyers about the risk.\n\nThe other options don't apply as well:\n\nA. The pedestrian's status as a non-purchaser or user of the truck does not negate the dealership's responsibility for selling a defective product.\nB. The farmer's actions are not relevant to the claim against the dealership unless there is evidence that the dealership was aware of the brake issue and failed to inform the farmer or took steps to fix the problem.\nD. While the dealership potentially had a duty to ensure the vehicle was safe before selling it, the critical issue here is the existence of the defect, not necessarily whether the dealership exercised reasonable care in detecting it. If the defect was not known to the dealership, they might not be liable under this theory.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer based on the given information is C, assuming the proof of the manufacturing defect stands."
