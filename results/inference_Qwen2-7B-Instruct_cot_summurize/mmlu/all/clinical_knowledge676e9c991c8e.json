An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone.\n\nAn ultrasound can help differentiate between different types of nodules based on their texture, size, and other characteristics. It can also sometimes provide information about whether the nodule is actively secreting hormones or not. However, it's important to note that while an ultrasound can provide useful information, it may not always definitively determine if a nodule is actively secreting hormones. Further tests such as fine needle aspiration biopsy or more specialized imaging like radioactive iodine uptake scan might be needed for confirmation. \n\nThe other options are generally incorrect:\n\nA. It's not accurate to say that all thyroid swellings elevate on swallowing. Some swellings, especially those caused by benign conditions like goiter, might not move significantly with swallowing.\n\nB. Lymph node enlargement is not necessarily a good prognostic sign in the context of thyroid swelling. While it could indicate inflammation or infection, it could also suggest the presence of cancer, particularly if it's associated with a hard, fixed mass or if there's evidence of cancer elsewhere in the body.\n\nD. While it's less common, a functioning nodule (one that takes up radioactive iodine in a scan) can still be due to cancer. This is known as a \"hot nodule\" in thyroid cancer, which typically indicates malignancy. Therefore, a positive result from a thyroid scan should not automatically rule out cancer."
