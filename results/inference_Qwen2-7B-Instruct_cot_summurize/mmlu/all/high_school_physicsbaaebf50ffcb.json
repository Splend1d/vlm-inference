                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.\n\nWhen a small meteor collides with the satellite and increases its speed, the satellite gains kinetic energy. However, since the collision does not change the instantaneous direction of the satellite's velocity vector, the total angular momentum of the satellite about the center of mass of Earth remains constant. Angular momentum is given by \\(L = mv\\sin(\\theta)\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the satellite, \\(v\\) is its velocity, and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the position vector and the velocity vector. Since the direction of velocity doesn't change (only its magnitude, \\(\\theta\\) stays the same, keeping \\(L\\) constant.\n\nThe increase in speed means that the satellite must travel further to maintain the same angular momentum, which results in a larger radius for its circular orbit. This is because for a given angular momentum, the orbital radius \\(r\\) can be calculated using Kepler's laws or conservation of angular momentum principles. Specifically, the relationship between angular momentum \\(L\\) and orbital radius \\(r\\) for a circular orbit is given by \\(L^2 = m^2\\), where \\(o\\) is the orbital speed. Since increasing \\(L\\) while keeping \\(o\\) constant requires a larger \\(r\\), the satellite's orbit expands outward.\n\nOptions A and B suggest an elliptical orbit, but the information provided indicates a circular orbit due to the constant speed condition post-collision. Option D is incorrect because it suggests the orbit shrinks, which contradicts the conservation of angular momentum and the increase in kinetic energy leading to an expansion of the orbit."
