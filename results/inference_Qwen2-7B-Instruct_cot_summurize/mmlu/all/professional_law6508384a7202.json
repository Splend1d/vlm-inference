The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent such violence, the state legislature passes a statute prohibiting all gambling at privately owned casinos in the state. Is this law likely to be held constitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state?\n\nA. Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature.\nB. Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.\nC. No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.\nD. No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos.\n"

No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.\n\nThe Constitution's Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) grants Congress the power \"To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" Generally, states cannot enact laws that discriminate against or excessively burden interstate commerce. In the context of your question, if the state legislature passes a statute that specifically targets gambling at privately owned casinos, including those owned by individuals or companies from outside the state, it could potentially be seen as an attempt to regulate interstate commerce. This might lead to a legal challenge on the grounds that the law discriminates against out-of-state businesses, which would likely result in the law being struck down as unconstitutional.\n\nIt is important to note that the specifics of how the courts would rule would depend on the precise language of the statute, the extent of the regulation, and other relevant factors. Additionally, the exact interpretation of the Commerce Clause can vary between different courts and over time. However, based on the information provided, option C seems the most plausible answer."
