Obesity occurs because gut hormone secretion becomes deranged and PYY secretion fails to give a satiety signal.\nB. The gut/brain signalling pathway controls energy intake to within 2% of requirements, even in people who are morbidly obese\nC. The problem is one of greed and gluttony, whereby people override strong satiety signals on a regular basis\nD. Flavour signals from tasty, processed food will override satiety signals even after a large meal\n"

Obesity occurs because gut hormone secretion becomes deranged and PYY secretion fails to give a satiety signal.\n\nThe intestines play a crucial role in obesity through their interactions with the gut-brain signaling pathway. This pathway helps regulate energy intake and expenditure. Gut hormones, such as PYY ( (Peptide YY), are released by the gut after meals and help signal satiety or fullness to the brain, which can then help control food intake. When the secretion of these hormones is deranged or disrupted, it can lead to an inability to properly sense when enough food has been consumed, potentially leading to overeating and weight gain.\n\nWhile options B, C, and D describe behaviors that can contribute to obesity, they do not directly address the physiological mechanisms involving the intestines. Option B suggests that the body's regulation of energy intake is too precise, which contradicts what we understand about obesity. Option C focuses on behavioral aspects rather than biological ones. Option D addresses the influence of flavor on eating behavior but does not specifically highlight the role of gut hormones."
