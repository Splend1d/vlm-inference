We should use a single metric, like the NPV or the IRR, to have a coherent comparison.\n\nWhile each of the metrics you've mentioned (NPV (Net Present Value), IRR (Internal Rate of Return), and the concept that rankings can change under different metrics have their own merits and applications, they also have limitations and potential for inconsistency when used independently.\n\nA. The ranking of projects by NPV is not necessarily invariant to changes in the market rate. NPV calculations rely on discount rates which can change based on market conditions, affecting project rankings.\n\nB. The IRR will not always agree with the NPV metric. While both metrics evaluate the profitability of an investment, they do so differently. The IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV equals zero, but it may not align perfectly with the actual NPV profile of a project, especially if there are are non-conventional cash flows (cash flows that do not occur at regular intervals).\n\nC. The IRR does not always preserve the ranking of projects. When comparing two projects, it's possible for one to have a higher IRR but lower NPV than another, leading to inconsistent rankings depending on which metric is used.\n\nD. Using a single metric for comparison can provide clarity and consistency, but it's important to understand its limitations. NPV is generally considered more reliable because it directly measures the increase in value that an investment generates, taking into account the time value of money. However, it might not be suitable for all types of investments, particularly those with unconventional cash flow patterns. In contrast, IRR can be useful as a measure of return but might lead to incorrect decisions in certain scenarios due to its sensitivity to the timing and size of cash flows.\n\nIn practice, a combination of metrics might be used alongside qualitative factors to make investment decisions. For instance, NPV is often preferred for its robustness in evaluating the net benefit of an investment over its entire life span, while IRR can provide insights into the expected growth rate of returns. However, decision-makers must be aware of the specific circumstances and limitations associated with each metric."
