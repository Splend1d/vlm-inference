Caribou are adapted to cold climates and are commonly found in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. The fact that their bones have been discovered in this location indicates that the climate was suitable for them to inhabit, which would mean it was colder than the present conditions in the same region. \n\nOptions A, C, and D do not necessarily follow from the information provided. The diet of ancient inhabitants cannot be conclusively determined by the presence of caribou bones alone. The importation of animals or the dietary habits of the people who lived there cannot be inferred without additional context. Similarly, the cholesterol levels of the inhabitants cannot be deduced from the presence of caribou bones."
