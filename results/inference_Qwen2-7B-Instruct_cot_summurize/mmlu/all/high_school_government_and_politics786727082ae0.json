Specifically, the decision falls to the House of Representatives, where each state delegation has one vote. The candidate who wins the majority of these votes (at least 26 of the 50 states' votes, which equals more than half of the total votes cast in the House, becomes the President. Therefore, the correct answer is not explicitly listed among your options as provided, but it alignses with:\n\nD. The candidate who wins the majority of votes in the House.\n\nIt's important to note that under this scenario, the Vice President does not become President, nor does the decision fall to the Supreme Court or the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide."
