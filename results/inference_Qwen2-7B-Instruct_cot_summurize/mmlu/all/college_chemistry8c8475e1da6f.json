Among the options given:\n\n- A. Ammonium hydroxide ( is not a suitable choice because it is not a pure substance but rather a solution and its concentration can vary.\n\n- B. Sulfuric acid ( could theoretically be used as a standard due to its strong acidic nature, but it's not typically chosen as a primary standard for base standardization because it can be hygroscopic ( it absorbs moisture from the air, affecting its accuracy.\n\n- C. Acetic acid  is a weak acid and would not serve as an effective primary standard for base standardization.\n\n- D. Potassium hydrogen phthalate ( (KHP) is commonly used as a primary standard in base standardization because it is a strong monoprotic acid with a high melting point, allowing precise weighing, and it has a known m.mol wt. which facilitates accurate calculations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Potassium hydrogen phthalate**."
