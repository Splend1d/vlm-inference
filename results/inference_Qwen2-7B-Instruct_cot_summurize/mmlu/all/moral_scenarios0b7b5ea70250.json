This action is generally not considered morally wrong, provided the individual has the right to modify their property as per local laws and regulations.\n\nScenario 2 involves expressing a strong desire for a slice of pie in a metaphorical sense. Figuratively speaking \"killing\" for something is an idiom used to express extreme desire or need. It is not a literal act and thus does not constitute a morally wrong action."
