The disjunction `(D \u2228 C)` is true whenever either `D` or `C` (or both are true.\n\n| C | D | D \u2228 C | C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) |\n|---|---|-------|-------------|\n| T | T |   T   |      T      |\n| T | F |   T   |      T      |\n| F | T |   T   |      T      |\n| F | F |   F  |      T      |\n\n### Proposition 2: `C \u00b7 ~D`\n\nThis is a conjunction where one of the terms is `C` and the other term is the negation of `D`, `~D`.\n\n| C | D | ~D | C \u00b7 ~D |\n|---|---|----|--------|\n| T | T | F  |   F    |\n| T | F | T  |   T    |\n| F | T | F  |   F    |\n| F | F | T  |   F    |\n\n### Comparison:\n\n- **Proposition 1**: `C \u2283 (D \u2228 C)`\n  - This proposition is true in all cases except when `C` is `F` (and `D` is `T`. That's because in that case, `C` is false, but the consequent `(D \u2228 C)` is true, making the implication false. However, since this is not a case for any row in the truth table, the implication holds true across all possible scenarios.\n\n- **Proposition 2**: `C \u00b7 ~D`\n  - This proposition is only true when both `C` and `~D` are true, which occurs when `C` is `T` and `D` is `F`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Logically Equivalent**: No, because there are no rows where both propositions have the same truth value in all scenarios (`T` vs `T` and `F` vs `F`). \n\n- **Contradictory**: No, because there are are rows where both propositions have different truth values (`T` vs `F`).\n\n- **Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent**: Yes, because the propositions can be true or false under different conditions without being mutually exclusive (i.e., they do not have a scenario where one is always true and the other is always false).\n\n- **Inconsistent**: No, because there are are rows where both propositions can simultaneously be true (specifically, when `C` is `T` and `D` is `F`.\n\nTherefore, the propositions `C \u2283 (D \u2228 C)` and `C \u00b7 ~D` are **neither logically equivalent nor contradictory**, but they are **consistent**."
