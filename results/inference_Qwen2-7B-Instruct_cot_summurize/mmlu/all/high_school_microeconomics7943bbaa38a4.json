The good is normal and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.\n\nIn economics, the demand for a good can be influenced by both the substitution effect and the income effect when the price changes. For a normal good, as the price decreases, the real income of consumers increases (the income effect. This leads to an increase in the quantity demanded because the good becomes more affordable, allowing consumers to buy more of it. However, at the same time, the lower price makes the good relatively cheaper compared to other goods (the substitution effect), which also encourages consumers to buy more of this good. \n\nIf the income effect is stronger in this scenario, meaning that the increase in purchasing power due to the price drop allows consumers to buy significantly more of the good than they would substitute with other goods, then we might see an upward-sloping demand curve. This is counterintuitive, but it's possible under specific circumstances where the income effect dominates the substitution effect, especially if the good is not very substitutable with other goods or if the income increase is substantial enough to overcome any substitution effects.\n\nFor an inferior good ((option A), a decrease in price would typically lead to a decrease in quantity demanded because consumers switch to higher-quality goods as their purchasing power increases, despite the price decrease. \n\nOption C suggests the opposite situation where the substitution effect is stronger than the income effect for a normal good, which is less likely given the typical behavior of normal goods.\n\nOption D refers to the good being a luxury, which isn't directly related to explaining why a decrease in price might cause a decrease in quantity demanded, as luxury goods are generally expected to see an increase in demand with a price decrease."
