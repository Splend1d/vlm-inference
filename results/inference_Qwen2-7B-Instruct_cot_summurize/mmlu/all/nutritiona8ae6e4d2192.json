Methylation involves adding a methyl group to cytosine, usually within CpG dinucleotides sequences. This can lead to gene silencing by affecting how the DNA is packaged and read by transcription machinery.\n\n3. **Modifying gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence** is a core function of epigenetics. This allows for the same genetic information to be expressed differently in various cell types or under different environmental conditions, which is crucial for development and adaptation.\n\n4. **Enabling one genotype to result in different phenotypes** is directly related to the concept of epigenetics. Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, while phenotype refers to the observable characteristics. Epigenetics shows that environmental factors, including experiences, can influence which traits (phenotypes) are expressed from a given set of genes (genotype), thus contributing to the complexity of genetic expression and disease risk."
