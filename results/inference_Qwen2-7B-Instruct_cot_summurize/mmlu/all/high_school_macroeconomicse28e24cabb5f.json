More investment in capital infrastructure and less consumption of nondurable goods and services\n\nInvesting in capital infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, public transportation systems, and digital networks, can lead to significant long-term economic growth by improving productivity and efficiency. This type of investment enhances the physical and technological capabilities of an economy, making it more productive and capable of generating more output per unit of input.\n\nOn the other hand, increasing tariffs (option A) could lead to trade disputes, higher prices for consumers, and reduced competitiveness of domestic industries. Eliminating mandatory school attendance laws (option C) would likely decrease the skill level and education of the workforce, which is detrimental to economic growth. Setting annual limits on immigration (option D) could reduce the labor force and innovation, potentially slowing economic growth."
