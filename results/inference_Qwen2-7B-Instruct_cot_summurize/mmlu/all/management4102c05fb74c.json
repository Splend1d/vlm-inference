Two unequal partners become one after a buyout.\n\nAn acquisition is when one company (the acquirer) buys another company (the target) in a transaction where the target company ceases to exist as a separate legal entity and becomes a division or subsidiary of the acquiring company. This typically involves a financial transaction where the acquiring company pays for the target company, often with cash or stock. The result is that two unequal partners join together, with one becoming the dominant entity."
