These states will essentially keep track of the \"count modulo \\(k\\)\" of 0's encountered so far.\n\n### Tracking the Parity of the Number of 1's:\nThe parity of the number of 1's being odd requires an additional mechanism beyond just counting the 0's. We can think of this as needing two states: one representing that the number of 1's is even (and another representing that it's odd. This allows us to transition between these states with each occurrence of a 1.\n\n### Combining Both Requirements:\n- **States for Divisibility of 0's**: \\(k\\) states\n- **States for Parity of 1's**: 2 states\n\nThus, the total number of states required is \\(k + 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\(k + 2\\)"
