Bipedal Locomotion - This is considered one of the earliest significant developments in hominid evolution. The ability to walk upright freed the hands for other tasks, likely leading to tool use and other advancements.\n\nB. Language - While language is essential for complex social structures and knowledge sharing, its exact emergence in the evolutionary timeline is more difficult to pinpoint. It likely developed after other cognitive and physical abilities that enabled it, such as the ability to understand and use symbols, and larger brain capacity.\n\nC. A Larger Cranium and Brain Size Larger than 1000 cc - This refers to an increase in brain size, which is generally associated with more advanced cognitive functions. While larger brains would have facilitated language and other complex behaviors, they did not evolve in isolation. The development of larger brains was influenced by the evolution of other features like bipedalism.\n\nD. Oldowan Stone Tools - Oldowan tools, dating back approximately 2.6 million years ago, are some of the earliest known stone tools. They suggest that hominids had developed the ability to create and use simple tools, which is a significant milestone in human evolution.\n\nGiven these points, the development of **bipedal locomotion** ( is considered to have occurred earlier among hominids compared to the other options listed."
