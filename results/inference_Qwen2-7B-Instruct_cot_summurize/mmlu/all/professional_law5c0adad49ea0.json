The professor made a conveyance thereof in these words, \"I hereby convey my 30-acre tract to both my friend and my co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. \"Two years after making the conveyance to the friend and the co-worker, the friend executed a mortgage on the 30-acre tract of land to a bank to secure a loan. One year after executing the mortgage, the friend died intestate, leaving his uncle as his only heir. At the time of the friend's death, the indebtedness had not been paid to the bank. The jurisdiction in which the 30-acre tract of land is located recognizes a title theory of mortgages. In an appropriate action, the court should determine that title to the 30-acre tract of land is vested\n\nA. in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.\nB. in the co-worker, free and clear of the mortgage.\nC. half in the co-worker and half in the uncle, with both subject to the mortgage.\nD. half in the co-worker, free of the mortgage, and half in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n"

This means that upon the death of one joint tenant (the friend), their interest in the property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) - in this case, the co-worker.\n\nHowever, the friend then executed a mortgage on the property to secure a loan, creating a lien on the property for the benefit of the bank. When the friend dies intestate, leaving the uncle as his only heir, the uncle does not automatically gain any interest in the property under the joint tenancy with right of survivorship agreement.\n\nThe question is about the title to the 30-acre tract of land at the time of the friend's death. Since the friend held an undivided half interest in the property through the joint tenancy with the co-worker, the co-worker retains their interest in the full property. The mortgage on the property does not affect the co-worker's interest because it is collateral for a debt owed by the friend.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. in the co-worker, free and clear of the mortgage.\n\nThis is because the co-worker holds the property in full as per the joint tenancy agreement, and the mortgage is on the friend's portion of the property only. The uncle, as the friend's heir, would not have any claim to the property through the joint tenancy, but could potentially have rights if the property were to be sold to pay off the mortgage debt or if there were other applicable laws or agreements in place regarding inheritance and property division."
