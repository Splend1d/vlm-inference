It has become more influenced by evangelical Christians.\n\nExplanation: The Republican Party has indeed seen an increase in influence from evangelical Christians since the 1980s. This shift is evident in their policy stances, particularly on social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, where they have tended to align more closely with conservative Christian values. \n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. While there may be some elements within the Republican Party that align with civil libertarian principles, this is not a consistent or defining characteristic of the party as a whole since the 1980s.\nB. Labor unions have traditionally supported Democratic policies over Republican policy, so it's unlikely that the Republican Party would be dominated by them.\nC. The Republican Party has generally had a pro-business stance, so it's inaccurate to say that it has become more antagonistic to business interests. In fact, the party has often positioned itself as the champion of free market principles and business-friendly policies."
