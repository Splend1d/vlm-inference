                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Decrease her consumption of chips and increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn order to maximize utility, a consumer should allocate their budget so that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across all goods. This means that the ratio of marginal utility (MU) to price (P) should be equalized between the two goods. \n\nGiven:\n- Price of potato chips (P_chips = $1\n- Price of onion dip P_dip = $2\n- Marginal utility of chips MU_chips = 12\n- Marginal utility of onion dip MU_dip = 30\n\nThe condition for utility maximization is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{MU_{chips}}{P_{chips}} = \\frac{MU_{dip}}{P_{dip}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{1} = \\frac{30}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ 12 = 15 \\]\n\nThis shows that the current allocation of resources is not maximizing utility since the MU/P ratios are not equal. To maximize utility, Mrs. Johnson needs to adjust her consumption so that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{MU_{chips}}{P_{chips}} = \\frac{MU_{dip}}{P_{dip}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{1} = \\frac{30}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ 12 = 15 \\]\n\nis true. This can only happen if she decreases her consumption of chips (since decreasing chips would reduce its MU/P ratio below 15, making it more efficient to spend more on dip where MU/P is already 15, or increases her consumption of dip to raise its MU/P ratio closer to 12. The optimal solution would involve finding a point where both MU/P ratios are equal, which might involve adjusting her consumption of both goods. Therefore, option D is the correct choice."
