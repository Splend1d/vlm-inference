The pressure increases with depth due to the weight of the water above, but this does not directly affect the buoyant force acting on the balloon. However, the density of water generally decreases with increasing depth due to temperature changes and salinity variations. In most lakes, especially at moderate depths, the density change is minimal and can be considered negligible for this scenario.\n\nThus, the primary factor affecting the buoyant force in this situation would be the volume of water displaced by the balloon, which does not change as the balloon descends. Therefore, the buoyant force acting on the balloon would remain largely unchanged (option C. However, given the context and considering the options provided, the correct choice based on the direct relationship between buoyant force and depth (especially considering the potential for density changes which were initially misstated as decreasing, is actually:\n\nC. remains largely unchanged.\n\nThis is because the decrease in water density with depth would counteract any slight increase in the volume of water displaced if the balloon were to deform significantly under pressure, but in reality, such deformation is unlikely to be significant enough to alter the volume displacement meaningfully, especially in the context of a standard-sized balloon."
