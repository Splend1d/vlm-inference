The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\nA. The mean of all the salaries.\nB. The mode of all the salaries.\nC.

This is because the median represents the middle value in a set of numbers when they are arranged in order. It is less affected by outliers (such as the high salaries of administrators compared to the moderate salaries of teachers. By quoting the median, the union can argue that this figure better represents what a typical teacher earns and could be used to negotiate for a salary increase that benefits the majority of the staff.\n\nOption A, the mean, would also be skewed higher due to the presence of the high salaries of administrators, which might not accurately reflect the typical teacher's salary. Option B, the mode, might not be very useful if there isn't a clear, single most common salary in the data set. Option C, the standard deviation, provides information about the spread of salaries but does not indicate an average salary level or where it stands relative to other measures of central tendency."
