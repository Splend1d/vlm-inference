This happens when any denominator becomes zero.\n\nLet's simplify the function to make it easier to analyze:\n\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{x}}} = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{x}{x+1}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{x+1+x}{x+1}} = \\frac{x+1}{2x+1}\\]\n\nNow, let's identify the points where the function is undefined, which occurs when the denominator is zero:\n\n\\[2x + 1 = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[2x = -1\\]\n\\[x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nThis is one value that makes the function undefined. However, there could be more values depending on the structure of the original function, especially considering the nested fractions. Let's check if there are are more values by examining each part of the function for potential division by zero issues.\n\nThe function can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{x}}}\\]\n\nFor the innermost fraction, \\(1+\\frac{1}{x}\\), to be zero, we solve:\n\n\\[1+\\frac{1}{x} = 0\\]\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x} = -1\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(x\\) (and remembering \\(x \\neq 0\\) since division by zero is undefined, and \\(x\\) cannot be zero due to being part of the denominator in the original function) gives:\n\n\\[1 = -x\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[x = -1\\]\n\nSo, the second value making the function undefined is \\(x = -1\\).\n\nFinally, let's examine the middle fraction, \\(\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{x}}\\). For this fraction to be undefined, its denominator must be zero:\n\n\\[1+\\frac{1}{x} = 0\\]\n\nWe've already solved this equation above, finding \\(x = -1\\). However, let's confirm this fits with our current understanding:\n\nIf \\(1+\\frac{1}{x} = 0\\), then\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x} = -1\\]\n\nThis directly leads us back to \\(x = -1\\), confirming our previous finding.\n\nTherefore, the only distinct values of \\(x\\) that are not in the domain of the given function are \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x = -1\\).\n\nThe sum of these values is:\n\n\\[-\\frac{1}{2} + (-1) = -\\frac{3}{2}\\]\n\nNone of the provided answer choices match this result, suggesting there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or the provided options. Based on the analysis, the correct sum of the three numbers that are not in the domain of the function is \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\), which is not listed among A. 1, B. 0, C. -1.5, D. -1."
