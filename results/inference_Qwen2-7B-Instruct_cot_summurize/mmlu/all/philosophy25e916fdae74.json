It reflects the group's collective sense of right and wrong.\n\nB. **Universally teachable:** The rule should be one that can be taught and learned by members of the group without requiring a significant departure from their existing moral understanding. It should be compatible with the group's educational and socialization processes.\n\nC. **Not merely a taboo:** While taboos are often associated with morality, they typically refer to prohibitions against actions rather than encompassing the full range of moral principles. A rule that belongs to the morality of a group should not just be a prohibition but also include principles about what actions are considered morally good or desirable.\n\nTherefore, for a rule to truly belong to the morality of a group, it must fulfill all these criteria: being part of the group's shared moral beliefs ( be teachable within the group's educational framework, and represent more than just a prohibition."
