It's called \"lithosphere\" because it's composed of solid rock. The lithosphere can vary in thickness from about 50 km under the oceans to over 150 km under the continents.\n\nA. The softer rocky material you refer to is typically found in the mantle, which lies beneath the lithosphere.\nB. Lava is molten rock that erupts from a volcano. It does not make up the lithosphere.\nC. Material between the crust and the mantle refers to the asthenosphere, which is part of the mantle, not the lithosphere."
