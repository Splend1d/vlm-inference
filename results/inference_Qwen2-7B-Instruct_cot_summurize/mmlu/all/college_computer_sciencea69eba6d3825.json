To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined.

True means the word was in the dictionary.** This is correct because when a word from the dictionary is hashed, its corresponding entry in the hash table is set to `true`. When the same hash function is applied to a word in a document, if the resulting hash points to a `true` value in the hash table, it indicates that the word was found in the dictionary.\n\n- **II. False means the word was not in the dictionary.** This is also correct for the same reason as above, but with the opposite outcome. If the hash function applied to a word in the document points to a `false` value in the hash table, it means the word was not found in the dictionary.\n\n- **III. Hash table size should increase with document size.** This statement is incorrect. The hash table size is typically determined during the initialization phase based on the number of words in the dictionary and the expected number of collisions. It does not necessarily need to grow or shrink based on the size of the document being checked against the dictionary. The hash table's purpose is to provide quick lookups, regardless of the document size.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. I and II only."
