Moons contribute to all of the above.\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Stability of particles within rings**: Moons, due to their gravitational pull, help in maintaining the structure and stability of rings around a planet. This is because they can influence the orbits of particles within the rings, preventing them from colliding with each other or escaping the ring system altogether.\n\n2. **Gravitational effects at ring edges as the moons pass by**: As moons move through the rings, their gravity can have significant effects on the particles within the rings. These effects can cause disturbances that might lead to the ejection of particles, particularly at the edges of rings systems where gravitational forces are less stable. This can create patterns such as gaps or waves in the ring structure.\n\n3. **Gaps between rings**: The gravitational influence of moons is often responsible for creating gaps in ring systems. These gaps occur when the gravitational forces of moons are strong enough to perturb the orbits of ring particles, causing them to be pushed away from certain regions, thus forming a gap. This is particularly evident in systems like Saturn's rings, where several gaps have been observed that align with the positions of Saturn's moons."
