The promotional material claimed patented methods and nutritional supplements that were a \"miraculous discovery\" that would work for anyone within 24 months. The cost was $1,000 per month; the woman paid a total of $24,000 for two years but she lost only 6 pounds and remained excessively obese. A former program employee told her that there was no patent, no miraculous discovery, and the supplements were the same as a common vitamin brand. She sued the program for misrepresentation. Will she likely prevail?\n\nA. No, because statements that are mere \"puffing\" or opinions cannot be the basis for misrepresentation.\nB. Yes, because the program had a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure to her of all of the facts.\nC. No, because she did not justifiably rely on the incredible representations that were made.\nD. Yes, because the program knowingly made false factual representations that the customer relied on.\n"

Yes, because the program knowingly made false factual representations that the customer relied on.\n\nMisrepresentation claims typically require showing that one party (the defendant) made a false statement of fact that they knew or should have known was false, which the other party (the plaintiff) relied upon to their detriment. In this case, if it can be proven that the weight loss program made false claims about having patented methods and miraculous supplements, and that these claims influenced the plaintiff's decision to pay a significant amount of money for the program, the plaintiff might have grounds for a successful misrepresentation claim.\n\nThe fact that the former employee revealed the truth about the lack of patent and common nature of the supplements could strengthen the plaintiff's case by showing that the program's claims were knowingly false. If the court finds that the plaintiff reasonably relied on these false statements in making their decision to purchase the program, and suffered harm as a result, the plaintiff may likely prevail in their lawsuit against the weight loss program."
