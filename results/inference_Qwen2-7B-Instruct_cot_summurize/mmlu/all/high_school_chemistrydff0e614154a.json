The numbering of the carbon atoms should start from the end that gives the lowest numbers to the substituents ( Br and Cl. Here, Br is attached to the 2nd carbon and Cl is attached to the 4th carbon. Hence, the correct name for this compound would be 2-bromo-4-chloropentane.\n\nHowever, among the options provided, only option B correctly represents this structure as dibromotrichloropentane, which literally means \"a pentane containing three chlorine atoms and two bromine atoms\". It's not the most precise name since it doesn't specify the positions of the halogen atoms, but it's the closest match to the given compound in the options you've provided."
