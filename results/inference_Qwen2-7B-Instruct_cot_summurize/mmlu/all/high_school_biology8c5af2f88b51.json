Introns are removed and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nThis process is known as RNA splicing.

Then, a 5' cap and a poly-A tail are added at the beginning and end of the resulting mRNA, respectively, before it can leave the nucleus and be translated into protein."
