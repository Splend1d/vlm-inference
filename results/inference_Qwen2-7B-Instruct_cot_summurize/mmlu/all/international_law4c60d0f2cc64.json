Instead, it reformed the procedure for admissibility of applications to the European Court of Human Rights. The Commission of Human Rights was abolished by a different treaty, namely the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force in 2009 and made various changes to the structure and functioning of the European Union institutions, including the removal of the European Commission of Human Rights as an institution."
