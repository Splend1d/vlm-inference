The sum of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is 42:\n\\[x + y = 42\\]\n\n2. \\(x\\) is twice \\(y\\):\n\\[x = 2y\\]\n\nFirst, let's solve these equations to find the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) when their sum is 42 and \\(x\\) is twice \\(y\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 2y\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[2y + y = 42\\]\n\\[3y = 42\\]\n\\[y = 14\\]\n\nThen, substitute \\(y = 14\\) back into \\(x = 2y\\) to find \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x = 2 \\times 14 = 28\\]\n\nSo, when \\(x + y = 42\\) and \\(x\\) is twice \\(y\\), \\(x = 28\\) and \\(y = 14\\).\n\nNow, let's use the information that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are inversely proportional to find the constant \\(k\\):\n\n\\[xy = k\\]\n\\[28 \\times 14 = k\\]\n\\[k = 392\\]\n\nNow, we want to find the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = -8\\). Since \\(xy = 392\\), we have:\n\n\\[-8y = 392\\]\n\\[y = -\\frac{392}{8}\\]\n\\[y = -49\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = -8\\) is \\(-49\\), which corresponds to option A."
