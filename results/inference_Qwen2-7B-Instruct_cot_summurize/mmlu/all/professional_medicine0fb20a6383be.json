Arteriovenous fistula\n\nThe symptoms described, including the buzzing sensation (also known as \"pulsatile tinnitus\" which is a result of blood flow through the fistula, the presence of a thrill (indicative of turbulent blood flow, and the history of injury leading to varicose veins and incompetent valves in the lower leg, all point towards an arteriovenous ( fistula as the most likely diagnosis. An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein, typically caused by trauma, but also can occur spontaneously. It often results in high velocity blood flow, leading to the pulsatile sensation and potentially other symptoms such as swelling or pain. The presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) would be indicated by symptoms like leg swelling, pain, or tenderness rather than a pulsatile sensation. Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery would cause ischemia and not pulsatile tinnitus. And arterial spasm could lead to intermittent claudication, but wouldn't explain the pulsatile sensation and the finding of a fistula."
