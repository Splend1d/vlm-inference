It's a summary offense carrying a $50 fine and no imprisonment. On the third offense, the fine is $500 and there is a 5-day jail sentence. The statute does not mention any requirement of criminal intent. John and his family are coming back from a weekend picnic when his children throw bags of refuse and the remains of their lunch out of the rear window of the moving vehicle. John is stopped and given a $50 ticket. Can he succeed with a defense that he didn't know what his children were doing and that he had no criminal intent to break any laws?\n\nA. No, because this is likely a strict liability law that does not provide for defenses based on mental state.\nB. Yes, because he didn't know what his children were doing in the back seat and he had not participated in the violation nor did he know that they did it or were going to do it.\nC. Yes, because the police have no way of proving who in the car threw the garbage out the window.\nD. No, because his criminal intent is clearly established by the circumstances of the events.\n"

No, because this is likely a strict liability law that does not provide for defenses based on mental state.\n\nIn the United States legal system, strict liability offenses are those crimes for which the defendant is held responsible regardless of intent, negligence, or fault. Anti-littering statutes often fall under this category, as they aim to deter littering behavior without requiring proof of intent. Therefore, in such cases, defenses based on the lack of intent or knowledge of one's actions may not be applicable. John would likely not be able to successfully argue that he had no criminal intent to break the law, especially since the act occurred while the vehicle was in motion and he was presumably aware that his children were passengers."
