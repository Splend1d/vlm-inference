The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\nC. The cell would need to consume another food source other than glucose because it will not be able to make adequate ATP with only glucose.\nD. The cell will begin to divide rapidly because larger cells require more oxygen and glucose than smaller ones.\n"

The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\n\nThe reason for this statement being correct is that aerobic respiration, which occurs in the presence of oxygen, is significantly more efficient at generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate) per glucose molecule compared to anaerobic respiration, which occurs in the absence of oxygen. In aerobic conditions, one glucose molecule can yield up to 38 ATP molecules, whereas in anaerobic conditions, the same glucose molecule typically yields only 2 ATP molecules. Therefore, when moved from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment, the yeast cell would indeed need to consume glucose at a much greater rate to generate sufficient ATP to maintain its metabolic processes and growth."
