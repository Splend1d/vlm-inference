By notifying the issuing attorney of the client's assertion of privilege and requesting for release from the subpoena, Dr. Mayhem is fulfilling his duty to protect client confidentiality while also complying with legal requirements. The attorney can then seek a court order to override the privilege if necessary. Options B, C, and D involve actions that could potentially violate client confidentiality or professional ethics."
