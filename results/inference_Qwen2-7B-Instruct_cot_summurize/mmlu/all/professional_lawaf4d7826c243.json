When the driver could not produce a driver's license, the officer asked him if he minded if they searched the vehicle. The officer did not advise the driver that he had a right to refuse consent or that if he refused his decision would be honored, but there was nothing duplicitous or coercive in the officer's conduct. The driver smiled and said \"of course, no problem.\" The officer found stolen bank checks under the rear seat. In a later suppression motion, the driver claimed that his consent was not voluntary. What will the court most likely decide on that issue?\n\nA. The consent was voluntarily given and was not the result of coercion or duress.\nB. The consent was involuntary because it was the product of implied duress.\nC. The consent was involuntary because the officer did not advise the driver of his right to refuse.\nD. The consent became voluntary as a matter of law when the driver failed to produce a driver's license.\n"

However, in this scenario, the driver willingly agreed to the search without any apparent coercion or duress. The fact that the officer did not inform the driver of their right to refuse consent does not automatically render the consent involuntary, especially since the officer's conduct was not described as coercive or threatening.\n\nThe smile from the driver might suggest a willingness to comply, and the lack of any indication that the officer used any form of force or pressure to elicit the consent indicates that the consent was likely given freely. Therefore, absent any evidence suggesting the contrary, the court would likely conclude that the consent was voluntary based on the actions and statements provided."
