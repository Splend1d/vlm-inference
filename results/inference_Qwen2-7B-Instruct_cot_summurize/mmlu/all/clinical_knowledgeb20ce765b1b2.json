Tension headaches is a common cause of headache.\n\nHeadaches can be caused by many different conditions, and tension headaches are indeed one of the most common types. They are often described as a band-like pressure or tightness around the head.\n\nA. This statement is not always true. Neck stiffness can be associated with meningitis, but it's not exclusive to this condition; other causes include infections, injuries, or even stress.\n\nB. While severe pain can indicate a potentially serious condition, it's not necessarily always life-threatening. The severity of pain doesn't directly correlate with the seriousness of the underlying cause; it depends on the specific cause of the headache.\n\nC. Temporal arteritis is an inflammatory condition that affects the arteries in the head, particularly those near the temples. It is not strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease affecting joints, although both can be part of a larger group of conditions known as systemic inflammatory diseases."
