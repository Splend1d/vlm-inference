Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Increase the dosage of corticosteroids\nB. Increase the dosage of cyclosporine\nC. Begin amphotericin therapy\nD. Begin ganciclovir therapy\n"

                    "text": "Given the clinical scenario provided, the patient's symptoms of malaise, muscle and joint pain, fever, and the laboratory findings ( including a raised leukocyte count and a rise in serum creatinine concentration from 0.8 mg/dL to 1.6 mg/dL since the renal transplant, along with the biopsy showing intracellular inclusion bodies in the transplanted kidney, suggests an infection or rejection episode post-transplant.\n\nThe presence of fever, altered renal function, and the histological finding of intracellular inclusions in the biopsy suggest that the patient might be experiencing a viral infection post-transplant, possibly CMV ( (Cytomegalovirus) infection, given that these are common complications after solid organ transplantation and are known to present with similar clinical features.\n\nThe therapeutic options listed are aimed at managing rejection or infection post-transplant. Here\u2019s how each option fits:\n\nA. Increasing the dosage of corticosteroids: Corticosteroids are typically used for acute rejection episodes, but the presence of fever and high leukocyte count points more towards an active infection rather than rejection. While steroids might be part of the management plan, they would not directly address the infection.\n\nB. Increasing the dosage of cyclosporine: Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant used to prevent rejection after transplant. Increasing its dose could exacerbate immunosuppression, making the patient more susceptible to infections rather than addressing the current issue.\n\nC. Beginning amphotericin therapy: Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication. While it might be useful in treating fungal infections, the patient's condition does not specifically point towards a fungal infection based on the provided information.\n\nD. Beginning ganciclovir therapy: Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat CMV infection. Given the symptoms and the possibility of CMV infection based on the fever, altered renal function, and histological findings, ganciclovir therapy seems like the most appropriate next step in management. CMV infection is a well-known complication post-transplant and can cause fever, altered renal function, and histopathological changes in the transplanted organ.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be **D. Begin ganciclovir therapy**."
