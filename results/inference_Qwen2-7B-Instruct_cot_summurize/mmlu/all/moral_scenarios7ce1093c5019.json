Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- In Scenario 1, inviting someone to a lighthouse for a romantic evening is generally not considered morally wrong. It's a personal choice and action that can be seen as thoughtful or intimate depending on the context and consent given by the other party.\n\n- In Scenario 2, ambushing one's mother with a difficult question without giving her a chance to prepare or respond adequately might be seen as disrespectful or lacking consideration. This could be viewed as morally wrong because it disregards the emotional well-being and autonomy of the other person involved. It's important to respect boundaries and timing when dealing with sensitive topics, especially within familial relationships."
