Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, putting a blindfold over someone's eyes without their consent can be considered morally wrong because it involves deception and potentially causing distress or discomfort to the other person, especially if they explicitly stated they did not want to see a particular scene.\nIn Scenario 2, scratching your dog's head is generally seen as a positive interaction and can be considered caring for the animal. It is not typically viewed as morally wrong."
