The key ethical concern here is maintaining professional boundaries and ensuring the client receives appropriate care.\n\nGiven this context, the most appropriate course of action for Dr. Lykowski would be:\n\nD. consult with another psychologist to determine whether or not to continue seeing the client in therapy.\n\nThis approach allows for an unbiased evaluation of the situation and ensures that the client's needs are prioritized over Dr. Lykowski's personal feelings. Consulting with another psychologist can provide guidance on managing countertransference, ensuring that the therapeutic relationship remains professional and effective."
