Situation ethics, also known as situational ethics or relativistic ethics, was proposed by philosopher Joseph Fletcher in his 1966 book \" Situation Ethics: The New Morality.\" It argues for a flexible approach to morality based on the principle of love. The central idea is that one should do what will promote the greatest good and love for all involved in a given situation.\n\nA. Anything goes - This idea suggests that any action can be justified under certain circumstances, which alignss with the flexible and context-dependent nature of situation ethics.\n\nB. Principled relativism - This concept refers to the idea that moral principles can be relative to specific situations or contexts. Situation ethics supports this view by suggesting that moral rules should be adapted according to the unique circumstances of each case.\n\nC. The end justifies the means - This idea is often associated with utilitarianism, a form of consequentialism that focuses on the outcomes of actions rather than adherence to fixed rules. Situation ethics shares this perspective, arguing that the outcome (in this case, promoting love and the greatest good - justifies the means taken.\n\nD. No choice - This statement contradicts the fundamental tenet of situation ethics, which emphasizes making choices based on ethical considerations and the pursuit of love and the greatest good in specific situations. Therefore, it is not associated with the stance of situation ethics."
