For an isothermal process involving an ideal gas, we can use the formula \\(P_1V_1 = P_2V_2\\), where \\(P_1\\) and \\(V_1\\) are the initial conditions ( pressure and volume, respectively, and \\(P_2\\) and \\(V_2\\) are the final conditions.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial Pressure (\\(P_1\\)) = 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n- Initial Volume (\\(V_1\\)) = 20 cm\u00b3 = 0.020 m\u00b3 ( (converting cubic centimeters to cubic meters for consistency)\n- Final Volume (\\(V_2\\)) = 5 cm\u00b3 = 0.005 m\u00b3\n\nWe need to find the final pressure (\\(P_2\\)).\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[P_1V_1 = P_2V_2\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(P_2\\):\n\n\\[P_2 = \\frac{P_1V_1}{V_2}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[P_2 = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^5 \\text{ Pa})(0.020 \\text{ m}^3)}{0.005 \\text{ m}^3}\\]\n\n\\[P_2 = \\frac{2000 \\text{ Pa\u00b7m}^3}{0.005 \\text{ m}^3}\\]\n\n\\[P_2 = 4 \\times 10^5 \\text{ Pa}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa."
