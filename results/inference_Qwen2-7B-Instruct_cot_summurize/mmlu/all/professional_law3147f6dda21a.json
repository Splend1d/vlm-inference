The man intended to take back some tools that he believed were his and that the neighbor was keeping unlawfully. The woman believed that the tools were the man's, and she intended to help the man take them. When the son learned that the man and the woman were going to break into the neighbor's home, he decided to accompany them. The son planned to find some items inside that might be worth taking. Arriving at the neighbor's home, the man opened the front door, which was closed but unlocked. Upon entering, the son went to the neighbor's upstairs bedroom and found a watch, which he took. In the meantime, the man and the woman went to the garage and began rummaging through the neighbor's tools. The man found the tools, which he seized. The three of them then left the neighbor's home. In this jurisdiction, burglary is defined as the breaking and entering of any structure with the intent to commit a felony therein. Which, if any, individuals should be found guilty of conspiracy?\n\nA. The man, the woman, and the son.\nB. The man and the woman.\nC. The woman and the son.\nD. None.\n"

Given that all three individuals had the intent to break into the neighbor's house ( the man intending to retrieve his tools, the woman believing they were rightfully his, and the son planning to take additional items, it can be argued that they all agreed to the plan. Even though the son's specific intent may have been different ( to steal additional items rather than just retrieve the man's property, the act of conspiring to break into the house for the purpose of committing a crime would include him. Therefore, all three should be considered potentially guilty of conspiracy under this definition. However, the specifics of their individual roles and the legal nuances of conspiracy laws could vary by jurisdiction, potentially affecting the final legal determination."
