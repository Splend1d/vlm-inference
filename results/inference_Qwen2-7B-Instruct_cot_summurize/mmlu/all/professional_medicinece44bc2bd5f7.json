In this context, informing the patient's wife about his HIV status would serve to protect her health and prevent potential transmission, thus promoting her well-being. This action prioritizes the duty to act in the patient's best interest (beneficence) over the patient's personal choice (autonomy). It's important to note that while autonomy (the patient's right to make decisions about their own health) is a fundamental ethical principle, in certain circumstances, such as when it poses significant risk to others, beneficence (the duty to act for the benefit of others) may take precedence."
