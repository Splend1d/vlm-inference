When they got there, they saw a high-ticket group, apparently high-society people, attending an air history video. They took over the meeting room, waving their guns menacingly, and demanded their watches, wallets and jewelry. When they took inventory of their bounty, they found that the customers were actually from a university history club and that they had little real jewelry, watches or wallets, they became enraged and struck several of the participants, killing one and badly injuring another. Which of the following is the most accurate list of common law crimes that they may likely be convicted of? Do not select attempted crimes if they were consummated.\n\nA. Attempted burglary, robbery and attempted murder.\nB. False imprisonment, attempted murder and murder.\nC. False imprisonment, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder.\nD. False imprisonment, attempted robbery and first degree murder.\n"

False imprisonment, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why each crime fits into the scenario:\n\n1. **False Imprisonment**: The individuals confined the history club members against their will by taking over the meeting room and demanding items through the use of guns, which can be considered false imprisonment.\n\n2. **Robbery**: By forcefully taking the watches, wallets, and jewelry from the attendees who were essentially hostages due to the threat of violence (guns), this constitutes robbery.\n\n3. **Aggravated Assault**: Striking several of the participants and causing serious injuries (one death and another being badly injured) categorizes the assaults as aggravated, given the severity of the injuries and the intent to cause harm.\n\n4. **Murder**: The intentional killing of one participant directly qualifies as murder under common law.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific laws and terminology might vary slightly depending on jurisdiction, but these crimes generally align with what occurred in the described scenario."
