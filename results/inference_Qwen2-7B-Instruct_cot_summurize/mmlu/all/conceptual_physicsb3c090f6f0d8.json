This is because an alpha particle is essentially a helium nucleus, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\nWhen the product of this emission decays further by emitting 2 beta particles, we need to understand what a beta particle is. A beta particle is either an electron (\u03b2^- or a positron \u03b2^+. Since we're dealing with a decay process, we'll consider it as an electron for simplicity here.\n\nEach beta particle emission changes the atomic number by +1 ( (since it's an electron being added to the atom, effectively adding a proton). \n\nGiven that the atom first loses 1 from its atomic number due to the alpha particle emission, and then gains 2 from the subsequent beta particle emissions, the net change in atomic number would be:\n\nInitial change: -1 ( (due to alpha particle)\nSubsequent change: +2 (due to two beta particles)\n\nNet change = -1 + 2 = +1\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. plus 1."
