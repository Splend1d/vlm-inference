Brushes - These are typically used for gently removing loose soil and debris from surfaces without causing damage.\n\nB. Trowels - Often used for scraping away soil in controlled layers, especially when excavating features like pits or trenches.\n\nC. Dental picks - These are specialized tools that can get into tight spaces and remove small amounts of soil with precision, which is useful when delicate artifacts are present.\n\nIt's important to note that while these tools might be used in practice, they are not specifically designed for removal of soil and their use would depend on the specific needs and conditions of the excavation."
