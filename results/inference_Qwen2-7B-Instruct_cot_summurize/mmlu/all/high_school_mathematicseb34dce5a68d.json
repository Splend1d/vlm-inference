                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Prime and Composite Numbers on a 6-sided Die\n\n- **Prime Numbers**: \\(2, 3, 5\\)\n- **Composite Numbers**: \\(1, 4, 6\\) ( Note: \\(6\\) is mistakenly listed twice; it should only be counted once.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes When Rolling Six Dice\n\nEach die has 6 sides, so for six dice, the total number of outcomes is:\n\\[6^6 = 7776\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Favorable Outcomes\n\nWe want exactly 3 dice to show prime numbers and 3 dice to show composite numbers.\n\n#### Selecting Which Dice Show Primes or Composites\n\n- We need to choose which 3 out of the 6 dice will show prime numbers. This can be done in \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) ways. The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), so:\n\\[ \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20 \\]\n\n#### Arranging Primes and Composites Among the Dice\n\nFor each selection of which 3 dice show primes, we then need to arrange those 3 dice among the 3 dice showing composites. This can be done in \\(3!\\) ways for the primes and \\(3!\\) ways for the composites, since both groups have 3 dice. So, for each selection of dice showing primes, there are \\(3! \\times 3!\\) ways to arrange them:\n\\[ 3! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\]\n\n#### Calculating the Total Number of Favorable Outcomes\n\nMultiplying the number of ways to select which dice show primes by the number of ways to arrange them gives us the total number of favorable outcomes:\n\\[ 20 \\times 36 = 640 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\n\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\\[ P = \\frac{640}{7776} \\]\n\n### Simplify the Fraction\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we look for common factors in the numerator and the denominator. However, in this case, \\(640 = 2^7 \\times 5 \\) and \\( 7776 = 2^5 \\times 3^3 \\times 11 \\), so they don't share any common factors other than 1. Thus, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ P = \\frac{640}{7776} \\]\n\nThis doesn't directly match any of the provided options as stated, suggesting a potential error in transcription or interpretation of the options. Given the calculation and simplification process, the correct simplified form matches none of A. \\(\\frac{125}{2916}\\), B. \\(\\frac{5}{16}\\), C. \\(\\frac{5}{54}\\), D. \\(\\frac{5}{55}\\). \n\nHowever, based on the detailed calculation, the correct approach to finding the probability involves understanding the combination of selecting dice to show specific numbers and arranging them accordingly. The provided options might need reconsideration or clarification regarding their intended values or equivalences under the given problem constraints."
