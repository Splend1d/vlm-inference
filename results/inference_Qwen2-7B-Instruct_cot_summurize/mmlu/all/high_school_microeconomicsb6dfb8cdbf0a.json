This means that you would sum up the quantity supplied by each individual firm at every given price level. \n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Aggregating the firm marginal revenue curves horizontally would not give you the market supply curve. Marginal revenue (MR) is related to the total revenue and the change in total revenue from selling one additional unit, whereas the supply curve reflects the quantity of a good that firms are willing to supply at various prices.\n\nB. Aggregating the firm supply curves vertically would imply adding the supply quantities along the vertical axis, which doesn't make sense in this context because the supply curve is typically plotted with quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis.\n\nC. Aggregating the firm marginal cost curves vertically also doesn't make sense in this context, as marginal cost (MC) is related to the cost of producing one more unit of output, not the quantity supplied in the market."
