These nodes are part of the deep inguinal/ pelvic chain of lymph nodes and are commonly involved when there is spread from anal cancer. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nA. Internal Iliac Lymph Nodes: These are not typically involved by anal cancer as they drain primarily from the lower abdomen, pelvis, and reproductive organs rather than the anus.\n\nB. Popliteal Lymph Nodes: These are located behind the knee and typically drain the lower leg and foot. They are not usually involved by anal cancer unless the disease has spread extensively through the body.\n\nC. Sacral Lymph Nodes: These are located near the sacrum (a part of the spine. They are part of the group of lymph nodes that drain the lower back and buttocks, but they are not commonly involved in the spread of anal cancer compared to the superficial inguinal nodes.\n\nTherefore, the superficial inguinal lymph nodes are the most appropriate to evaluate when considering possible metastasis from an anal mass."
