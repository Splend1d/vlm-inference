A woman cannot remember how she got to the hospital or other events that occurred during the 24 hours after she was sexually assaulted**.\n\nAnterograde amnesia is a type of memory disorder characterized by the loss of ability to form new memories after the onset of the condition. This means that individuals with anterograde amnesia have difficulty remembering new information, facts, and experiences that occur after the onset of their condition. \n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are not examples of anterograde amnesia:\n\n- **Option A**: The man's inability to remember where he was going before the car accident is not necessarily indicative of anterograde amnesia. This could be a symptom of retrograde amnesia, which refers to the loss of memory for events that occurred before the onset of the condition. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if this is specifically retrograde amnesia or another type of memory impairment.\n\n- **Option C**: The high school junior struggling to learn French due to confusion with Spanish words suggests a problem with language acquisition or interference between languages. This could be a symptom of foreign language syndrome or interference in learning, rather than anterograde amnesia.\n\n- **Option D**: The college student being able to remember information related to an important event but not how he acquired that information does not fit the definition of anterograde amnesia. Anterograde amnesia involves difficulties in forming new memories, not retaining existing ones. The issue described here might be related to retrieval issues or memory consolidation, but it does not specifically pertain to the inability to form new memories characteristic of anterograde amnesia."
