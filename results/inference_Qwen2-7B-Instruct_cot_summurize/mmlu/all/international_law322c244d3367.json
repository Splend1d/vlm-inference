This doctrine serves as a form of sovereign immunity for foreign states, allowing them to avoid scrutiny in domestic courts for certain acts performed within their own territory.\n\nOption D is correct: The Act of State doctrine is indeed a legal mechanism that allows the courts to provide immunity to public acts of foreign states, particularly when those acts occur within the foreign state's own territory and are not directly related to commercial transactions. This means that disputes involving such acts typically fall outside the jurisdiction of US courts, unless there is a clear exception or the act involves commercial activities or has direct implications on private interests within the United States."
