Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, letting your husband sleep while you know that the bedroom is on fire is considered morally wrong because it involves failing to protect someone from harm, which is a clear violation of basic ethical responsibilities towards others.\nIn Scenario 2, planning to meet up after a heist (assuming this refers to a theft or similar illegal activity, would also generally be considered morally wrong since it involves participation in an illegal act. However, the specific context and details matter significantly. If the meeting is for the purpose of discussing the illegal activity and making amends or reporting it to authorities, it could potentially be seen differently. But under ordinary moral standards without such context, planning to meet after committing an illegal act is typically viewed as morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to the given options, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 might not necessarily be wrong depending on the circumstances involved."
