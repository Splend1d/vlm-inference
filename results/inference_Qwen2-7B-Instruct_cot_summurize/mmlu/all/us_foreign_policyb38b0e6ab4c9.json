This term specifically refers to:\n\nD. The never-ending domination of the United States\n\nIn his view, the collapse of the Soviet Union created a period where the U.S. held unparalleled military, economic, and ideological influence over the global stage. This was seen as a unique historical opportunity for the U.S. to shape international relations according to its values and strategic interests. However, it's important to note that this perspective has been subject to debate, with some arguing that the post-Cold War era was not as unipolar as Krauthammer suggested, given the rise of other powers like China and the ongoing importance of alliances and international institutions."
