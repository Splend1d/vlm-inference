The lease contains the following provisions:\"(1) The tenant covenants not to assign the leased premises without the consent of the landlord. \"After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant, without the consent of the landlord, assigned the entire balance of the lease period to a dance instructor, who took immediate possession of the leased property. The landlord accepted rental payments from the dance instructor. Then in 2005, the dance instructor assigned his leasehold interest to a yoga instructor who went into possession. Assume for the purposes of this question only that the landlord, after learning of the dance instructor's assignment to the yoga instructor, brings suit against the dance instructor to have the assignment declaredvoid. The landlord will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the original leasehold agreement prohibited assignments.\nB. succeed, because the covenant prohibiting assignments did not run with the land.\nC. not succeed, because in accordance with the Rule in Dumpor's Case, where the landlord consents to one transfer, he waives his right to avoid future transfers.\nD. not succeed, because the privity of estate between the dance instructor and the landlord terminated when he assigned the leasehold to the yoga instructor.\n"

Since the tenant assigned the lease to the dance instructor without the landlord's consent, this would be a breach of the lease agreement. Therefore, the landlord would most likely succeed in having the assignment declared void if they brought suit against the dance instructor.\n\nThe other options either misinterpret the situation or present legal principles that do not apply here:\n\nB. The covenant prohibiting assignments ran with the land, meaning it bound all subsequent tenants and the landlord's successors. However, since the landlord has not yet given consent for any subsequent assignments by the dance instructor, this option does not correctly address the situation as described.\n\nC. The Rule in Dumpor's Case refers to the doctrine that a landlord's consent to one assignment of a lease creates a presumption that the landlord will not unreasonably refuse consent to future assignments. However, this rule applies only if the landlord has already given consent to an assignment, which is not the case here.\n\nD. The privity of estate typically refers to the direct contractual relationship between the landlord and tenant. When the dance instructor assigns their leasehold interest to the yoga instructor, the yoga instructor becomes the new tenant under the lease terms, but this does not automatically resolve the landlord's rights regarding the initial assignment made by the dance instructor. The landlord's ability to enforce the no-assignment clause remains intact until the landlord consents to the subsequent assignment or otherwise waives the right to do so."
