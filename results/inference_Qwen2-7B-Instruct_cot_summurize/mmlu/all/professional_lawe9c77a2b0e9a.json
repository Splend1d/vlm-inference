In this scenario, the son has a life estate in the property, meaning he owns the property for his lifetime, and then it passes to his heirs upon his death. Since the son cannot convey the entire fee simple interest (only his life estate - he does not have the legal right to transfer the remainder interest to his friend. Therefore, the friend cannot rely on the real estate agreement for specific performance, as the son cannot convey a marketable title to the property that includes the remainder interest held by the son's heirs."
