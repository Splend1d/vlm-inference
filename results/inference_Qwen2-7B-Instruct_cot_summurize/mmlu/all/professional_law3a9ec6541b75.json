The objection will be overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross examination.\n\nIn legal proceedings, particularly in trials, it is common for attorneys to ask leading questions during cross-examination to probe the witness's testimony and to elicit specific information. Leading questions are those that suggest the answer or contain the answer within the question itself. However, they are generally permitted during cross-examination to test the credibility of the witness or the accuracy of their statements, provided they do not mislead the witness into giving a particular response. The court typically allows such questions unless they are overly suggestive or designed to trap the witness into an incorrect statement. Therefore, if the question \"At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?\" is clear and does not suggest a specific answer, the court would likely overrule the defense's objection, allowing the question to be asked."
