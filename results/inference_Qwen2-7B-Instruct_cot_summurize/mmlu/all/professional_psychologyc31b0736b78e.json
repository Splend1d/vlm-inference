The law implies that the just noticeable difference (JND), or the smallest change in a stimulus that can be detected, is perceived as a constant ratio regardless of the original stimulus level. This means that, for example, detecting a small increase in brightness might be similar in psychological terms to detecting a large increase in brightness, suggesting that these changes are psychologically equal intervals."
