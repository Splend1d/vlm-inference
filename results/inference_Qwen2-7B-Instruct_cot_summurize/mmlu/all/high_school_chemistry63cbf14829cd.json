The addition of one nonbonding (or lone pair of electrons increases the electron domain count to six. \n\nThe geometry that accommodates six electron domains (five bonding pairs and one lone pair is square pyramid. In this geometry, the central atom would have four bonding atoms at the base of the pyramid and one additional atom or lone pair at the apex.\n\nA. Tetrahedron corresponds to 4 electron domains (3 bonding pairs and 1 lone pair.\nB. Square planar corresponds to 6 electron domains but all as bonding pairs.\nC. Octahedron corresponds to 8 electron domains but with all being bonding pairs.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct."
