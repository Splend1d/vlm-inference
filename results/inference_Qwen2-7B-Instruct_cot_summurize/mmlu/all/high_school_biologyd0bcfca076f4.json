This process leads to organisms developing similar features that serve the same function, even though they are not closely related.\n\nThe best example of convergent evolution from your options would be:\n\nC. The wings of an insect and the wings of a bird\n\nBoth insect wings and bird wings allow for flight, but they evolved independently in different lineages (insects evolved winged flight as a means of escaping predators, while birds developed wings for both flight and thermoregulation. This showcases how unrelated species can evolve similar features to solve similar problems in their environment."
