                    "text": "To address these statements, let's analyze each one individually:\n\n**Statement 1**: \"If A is connected, the closure of A must be connected.\"\n\nThis statement is **True**. In topology, a set is considered connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint non-empty open subsets. The closure of a set \\(A\\), denoted \\(\\overline{A}\\), includes all points in \\(A\\) and all limit points of \\(A\\). Since the operation of taking the closure does not introduce any new separation that wasn't already present in \\(A\\), if \\(A\\) is connected, then adding its limit points to form \\(\\overline{A}\\) does not disconnect it. Therefore, \\(\\overline{A}\\) must also be connected.\n\n**Statement 2**: \"Every continuous function \\(f : (0, 1) \\rightarrow: 0, 1)\\) has a fixed point.\"\n\nThis statement is **False**. This is a common misconception related to the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) which applies specifically to continuous functions on closed intervals [a, b]. However, when dealing with open intervals like (0, 1), the IVT doesn't apply directly because endpoints are crucial for the theorem's conclusion. A classic counterexample to this statement is the function \\(f(x) = x + \\frac{1}{2}\\) on the open interval (0, 1). This function is continuous everywhere in its domain, but it never intersects the line \\(y = x\\) within the interval (0, 1), meaning there is no fixed point. \n\nGiven the analysis above, the correct answer choice is:\n\nC. False, True"
