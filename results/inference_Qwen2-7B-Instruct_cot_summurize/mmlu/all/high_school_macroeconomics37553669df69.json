This is based on the quantity theory of money, which suggests that changes in the money supply directly affect the price level, holding other factors constant. \n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. A proportional increase in the quantity of output: In the short run, Classical economists might argue that an increase in the money supply could lead to more output due to increased spending and demand. However, in the long run, they believe that the economy adjusts to maintain full employment and the natural rate of output, so increases in the money supply would not lead to a proportional increase in output.\n\nB. Stagflation: This term refers to a situation where there is both high inflation and high unemployment or stagnant growth, typically not associated with Classical economic analysis. Classical economists would suggest that an increase in the money supply should only lead to higher prices, not both high inflation and high unemployment.\n\nC. An increase in the real rate of interest: Contrary to this, Classical economists believe that an increase in the money supply will decrease the nominal interest rate, as there is more money chasing the same amount of goods and services. The real interest rate, adjusted for inflation, might also be affected, but it would not necessarily increase with an increase in the money supply."
