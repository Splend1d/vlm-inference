All reach the base at the same time.\n\nIn this scenario, since the surface is extremely slick and there is no friction, the motion of each object will be determined by their center of mass dynamics and not by any rotational or translational resistance. Given that they all have the same mass, the only factors affecting their movement down the incline would be their shapes and how these shapes affect their moment of inertia (which in turn affects their acceleration down an incline.\n\n- **Sphere**: Has the lowest moment of inertia relative to its mass distribution, which means it accelerates faster than other objects with higher moments of inertia for the same mass.\n- **Cube**: Has a higher moment of inertia than a sphere due to its mass being more distributed away from the center of gravity.\n- **Cylinder**: Depending on whether it's a solid cylinder or a hollow cylinder, its moment of inertia can vary, but generally, it has a higher moment of inertia than a sphere.\n\nHowever, because the incline is short and the frictionless condition means all objects experience the same gravitational force component along the incline, their acceleration down the incline will be the same regardless of their moment of inertia. Thus, they will reach the bottom of the incline simultaneously. The shape does not impact their ability to accelerate down the incline under these conditions."
