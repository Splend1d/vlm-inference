The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.\nIndonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955\nThe passage above is most associated with which of the following developments?\n\nA.

This conference laid the groundwork for the Non-Aligned Movement, but the direct focus of the passage is on using the collective power of these nations to support peace, which alignss with the mobilization of a pan-Asian ideology.\n\nOption A (The formation of the non-aligned movement, is indeed related to this period as the Bandung Conference was a precursor to the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement. However, the passage specifically mentions the mobilization of \"all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace,\" which directly ties to the mobilization of pan-Asian ideology.\n\nOptions B ( Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, and C.
