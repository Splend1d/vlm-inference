Since the coin is on a horizontal turntable, the normal force is equal to the weight of the coin, \\( mg \\), where \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity ( approximately \\( 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ F_f = \\mu mg \\]\n\nFor the coin not to slide off, the frictional force must provide enough centripetal force to keep it moving in a circular path:\n\n\\[ F_f = F_c \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( F_f \\) and \\( F_c \\):\n\n\\[ \\mu mg = \\frac{mv^2}{r} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{v^2}{\\mu g} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity \\( v \\). We know that the turntable rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute ( (rpm). Let's convert this to revolutions per second (rps):\n\n\\[ 33.3 \\, \\text{rev/min} = \\frac{33.3}{60} \\, \\text{rev/s} \\approx 0.555 \\, \\text{rev/s} \\]\n\nSince one revolution corresponds to \\( 2\\pi \\) radians, the angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\omega = 0.555 \\times 2\\pi \\, \\text{rad/s} \\approx 3.46 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\]\n\nThe linear velocity \\( v \\) is related to the angular velocity by:\n\n\\[ v = \\omega r \\]\n\nWe rearrange this to find \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{v}{\\omega} \\]\n\nBut since \\( v = \\omega r \\), we substitute \\( v \\) in the equation for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\omega^2 r}{\\mu g} \\]\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2 r}{\\mu g} \\]\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\mu g} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{(3.46)^2}{(0.3 \\times 9.81)} \\]\n\n\\[ r \\approx \\frac{11.88}{2.943} \\]\n\n\\[ r \\approx 4.04 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNone of the given answer choices match this calculation directly. However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting the question or the answer choices, as they seem to be presented in terms of \"a\" without specifying its value. Assuming the answer choices are meant to represent some fraction or multiple of a unit length \"a\", let's re-examine them in relation to our calculation:\n\nGiven the calculation results in a value close to 4.04 meters, none of the provided options (A through D) directly match this result. However, option C (0.121 \"a\") could potentially fit if \"a\" were a unit representing a specific scale or context not directly given in the problem statement. Without additional context or clarification regarding the units or scaling factor \"a\", it's challenging to definitively match the calculated value to one of the provided options. \n\nGiven the nature of the problem and common unit conversions in physics problems, it's possible there was an intended simplification or scaling in the answer choices. If we interpret \"a\" as a unit of length that scales the final answer, option C being the closest choice to a scaled-down version of our calculated result when considering the potential for a misinterpretation or simplification in the answer choices. \n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that based on the direct calculation, none of the provided options precisely matches the derived answer, indicating a potential discrepancy or misunderstanding in the presentation or interpretation of the answer choices."
