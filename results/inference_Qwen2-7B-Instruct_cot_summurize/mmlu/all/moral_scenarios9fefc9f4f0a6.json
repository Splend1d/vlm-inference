Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, the act of picking up a spider knowing that someone is phobic of them and then showing it to them can be considered morally wrong. This action could cause significant distress or fear to the other person, which is not typically acceptable without their consent.\n\nIn Scenario 2, praying for rain on crops is generally not viewed as a morally wrong action. It is a personal belief or request and does not inherently harm others or infringe upon their rights."
