The probability of a Type II error (\u03b2 does not directly depend on the probability of a Type I error (\u03b1. However, in practical terms, decreasing the probability of a Type I error (making it more stringent) can increase the probability of a Type II error because it becomes harder to reject the null hypothesis, even when it is false.\n\nB. It is indeed possible to make both a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis) and a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) during a hypothesis test. These errors are independent of each other, but they can occur together in the same test.\n\nC. A Type II error occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected. Assuming the data are normally distributed when they are not does not directly lead to a Type II error; it might affect the validity of the test results, potentially increasing the likelihood of making either a Type I or a Type II error.\n\nD. When you choose a significance level \u03b1, you are setting the probability of making a Type I error, not that it will be exactly \u03b1 in every test. The actual probability of making a Type I error can be influenced by factors such as sample size and the true state of the population being tested."
