A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure\n\nDigital examination can be quite painful if there is an underlying condition like an anal fissure, which involves a tear in the lining and muscles of the anus. \n\nB. Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion\n\nThis statement is not accurate. Bright red blood typically indicates bleeding closer to the anus, such as from hemorrhoids or anal fissures. Bleeding from a caecal lesion (like a polyp or cancer) would often be mixed with stool or hidden.\n\nC. Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding\n\nProctoscopy is actually a valuable tool in assessing rectal bleeding. It allows for visual inspection of the rectum and lower part of the colon, which helps in diagnosing the cause of rectal bleeding.\n\nD. Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding\n\nWhile rectal cancer can be a significant cause of rectal bleeding, it is not necessarily the most common. Factors such as age, other health conditions, and lifestyle can influence the most likely causes of rectal bleeding. For instance, hemorrhoids are more common than colorectal cancer in younger populations."
