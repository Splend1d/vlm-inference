This can be considered disrespectful and potentially harmful, as it trivializes serious issues related to mental health and could contribute to stigma and discrimination against individuals with mental illnesses.\n\nScenario 2 involves not wanting to shake hands with a person based on their race. This is a clear violation of principles of equality, non-discrimination, and respect for human dignity, which are are fundamental components of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It's important to note that this scenario also goes against the principle of treating all people equally regardless of their race, which is enshrined in laws and ethical norms in the United States."
