A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions\n\nWhen a person hyperventilates, they breathe in more oxygen and exhale more carbon dioxide than normal. This leads to a decrease in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can trigger a series of physiological responses aimed at restoring the balance. As carbon dioxide levels drop, the concentration of hydrogen ions ( which are produced when carbon dioxide is converted into bicarbonate ions in the blood) also decreases, leading to a condition known as respiratory alkalosis. The body attempts to correct this by increasing carbon dioxide production through breathing or other mechanisms."
