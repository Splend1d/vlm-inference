It stated that:\n\nC. All types of rights are indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent.\n\nThis means that civil and political rights (such as freedom of speech, equality before the law, and the right to a fair trial ( are closely linked with social, cultural, economic, and environmental rights. For example, the right to education is essential for the realization of other rights, such as the right to work and the right to an adequate standard of living. Similarly, the lack of access to healthcare can limit someone's ability to enjoy their civil and political rights.\n\nThe Vienna Declaration did not declare that third-generation rights ( which include social, cultural, economic, and environmental rights\u2014are of primary importance or that social and economic rights are non-enforceable. However, it did recognize the importance of all human rights and the need to address the full spectrum of human rights challenges faced by people around the world."
