                    "text": "D. The results of electoral college voting tend to distort the winner's margin of victory, when compared with the popular vote for president.\n\nExplanation:\n- A is incorrect because each state awards its electoral votes as a whole to the candidate who wins the majority of votes in that state, not splitting them among all candidates.\n- B is incorrect because while each state has a certain number of electoral votes (equal to the sum of their U.S. Senators (2) and U.S. Representatives, this does not mean states are equally represented. For example, California has 55 electoral votes, while Wyoming has only 3.\n- C is incorrect because the Electoral College was established by the Constitution itself, not through an amendment; it is outlined in Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution.\n- D is correct because the Electoral College system can lead to situations where the candidate with the most popular votes does not win the presidency. This occurs when the winning candidate secures enough electoral votes to win without necessarily having the most votes nationwide. This distortion can happen due to the winner-takes-all system in most states and the relative sparsity of electoral votes in certain states."
