For any two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the product of their LCM and GCF is equal to the product of the numbers themselves:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a,b) \\times \\text{GCF}(a,b) = a \\times b \\]\n\nGiven that the LCM is 60 and the GCF is 2, we can substitute these values into our equation:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 2 = a \\times b \\]\n\\[ 120 = a \\times b \\]\n\nWe are also given that each number is less than or equal to 12. So, we need to find two numbers within this range whose product is 120 and have a GCF of 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. 6 and 10: Product = 60, which does not meet our requirement of being 120. Also, their GCF is 2, but they are not both less than or equal to 12.\nB. 5 and 12: Product = 60, which does not meet our requirement of being 120. Also, their GCF is 1, not 2.\nC. 10 and 12: Product = 120, which meets our requirement. Their GCF is 2, meeting our criteria.\nD. 12 and 15: Product = 180, which does not meet our requirement of being 120. Also, their GCF is 3, not 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 10 and 12."
