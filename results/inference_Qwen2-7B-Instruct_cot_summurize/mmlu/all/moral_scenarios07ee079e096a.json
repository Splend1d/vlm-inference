Distracted driving, particularly when it involves paying attention to one's phone, is considered dangerous and irresponsible. It not only endangers the driver but also other road users. According to traffic laws in the US, using a phone while driving can be illegal and is generally regarded as a morally wrong action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is simply making use of their youth to go grocery shopping in the evening. This is not an inherently wrong action. Age should not determine whether someone can perform certain tasks or activities, such as going grocery shopping. There may be concerns about safety at night, especially if the individual is inexperienced or if there are are risks associated with late-night shopping (like increased crime rates, but this would depend on the specific context and location rather than being an age-related issue."
