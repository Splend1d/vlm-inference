Therefore, the equipment would have been eligible for depreciation for one full year (under the first-year rate (of 20%) plus a fraction of the second year's depreciation based on the remaining months in service.\n\nThe first year's depreciation would be 20% of the cost, which is:\n\\[ \\text{Depreciation Year 1} = \\$10,000 \\times 20\\% = \\$2,000 \\]\n\nFor the second year, since the equipment was00entered service in the middle of the year, we need to prorate the second-year depreciation. The full year's depreciation for a five-year property is 32%, so for the second year, it would be:\n\\[ \\text{Depreciation Year 2} = \\$10,000 \\times 32\\% = \\$3,200 \\]\n\nSince the equipment was00was sold on March 1 of the current year, it remained in service for 11 months of the second year. To find the prorated amount for the second year, we calculate the monthly depreciation rate for the full year and then apply it to the 11 months:\n\\[ \\text{Monthly Depreciation Rate Year 2} = \\frac{\\$3,200}{12} \\approx \\$262.22 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Prorated Depreciationation Year 2} = \\$222.22 \\times 11 \\approx \\$2,444.44 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total depreciation for the current year (which includes the first year and the prorated second year depreciation) would be:\n\\[ \\text{Total Depreciationation Current Year} = \\$2,000 + \\$2,444.44 = \\$4,444.44 \\]\n\nNone of the provided options A through D match this calculation exactly. It seems there might have been an oversight in the options given or the question's specifics. Based on the information provided and the standard MACRS depreciation rates, the correct answer is not listed among the choices."
