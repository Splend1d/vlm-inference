This principle allows us to find the total number of items in at least one of the groups by adding the number of items in each group and then subtracting the number of items that are in both groups ( because those are counted twice when you add the individual counts.\n\nLet's denote:\n- The total number of boxes as \\(T = 20\\).\n- The number of boxes with pencils as \\(P = 13\\).\n- The number of boxes with pens as \\(E = 9\\).\n- The number of boxes with neither pens nor pencils as \\(N = 3\\).\n\nThe number of boxes with either pens or pencils (or both) is given by \\(T - N\\), because the boxes with neither are been subtracted from the total.\n\nSo, the number of boxes with either pens or pencils (or both) is \\(20 - 3 = 17\\).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\n\\[P + E - \\text{(Boxes with both pens and pencils)} = \\text{Boxes with either pens or pencils}\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[13 + 9 - \\text{(Boxes with both pens and pencils)} = 17\\]\n\n\\[22 - \\text{(Boxes with both pens and pencils)} = 17\\]\n\nS o,\n\n\\[ \\text{(Boxes with both pens and pencils)} = 22 - 17 = 5\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is **A. 5**."
