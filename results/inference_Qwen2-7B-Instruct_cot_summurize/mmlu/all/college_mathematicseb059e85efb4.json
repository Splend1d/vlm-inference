                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's first understand the dimensions involved.\n\n**Dimension of V:**\n\nThe vector space \\(V\\) consists of all real polynomials of degree at most 3. A general polynomial in this form can be written as:\n\\[p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\\]\n\nSince there are four coefficients (\\(a, b, c, d\\)), the dimension of \\(V\\) is 4.\n\n**Dimension of W:**\n\nThe subspace \\(W\\) contains all polynomials in \\(V\\) that satisfy the conditions \\(p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0\\). \n\nLet's consider a polynomial \\(p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\\). The given conditions yield:\n\n1. \\(p(0) = d = 0\\)\n2. \\(p(1) = a + b + c + d = 0\\)\n3. \\(p(-1) = -a + b - c + d = 0\\)\n\nFrom condition 1, we immediately know that \\(d = 0\\). This means any polynomial in \\(W\\) can be written in the form:\n\\[p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx\\]\n\nNow, using conditions 2 and 3 with \\(d = 0\\), we get:\n- \\(a + b + c = 0\\)\n- \\(-a + b - c = 0\\)\n\nThese two equations imply that \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are can be expressed in terms of \\(b\\):\n- \\(a = -b - c\\)\n- \\(c = b - a\\)\n\nSince \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) are are independent variables (given by the equation \\(a + b + c = 0\\), the dimension of \\(W\\) is 3.\n\n**Finding Dimension of \\(V + W\\):**\n\nThe sum of two subspaces \\(V + W\\) would contain all possible sums of vectors from \\(V\\) and \\(W\\). Since \\(V\\) has dimension 4 and \\(W\\) has dimension 3, the dimension of their direct sum \\(V \\oplus W\\) would be the sum of their dimensions, which is \\(4 + 3 = 7\\).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in this case, \\(W\\) is not necessarily a strict subset of \\(V\\), and thus, \\(V + W\\) might not be equal to \\(V\\) itself unless \\(W\\) is specifically designed to be disjoint from \\(V\\), which isn't the case here since \\(W\\) is defined within \\(V\\). The direct sum \\(V \\oplus W\\) actually represents the total space spanned by both \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) without redundancy.\n\nGiven the context of the question, asking for \\(dim V + dim W\\) directly provides us with an answer without needing to delve deeper into the specifics of how \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) interact beyond their dimensions. Thus,\n\n\\[dim V + dim W = 4 + 3 = 7\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 7**."
