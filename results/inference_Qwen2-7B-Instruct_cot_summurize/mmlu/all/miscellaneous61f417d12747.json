Identifying attributes of objects.\n\nBefore teaching a lesson on categorizing geometric objects by type of shape, it's essential that the children can identify attributes of objects. This includes recognizing and understanding the properties of different shapes such as the number of sides, angles, and whether they are are open or closed. This foundational skill will help them effectively engage with the new material and categorize shapes based on these attributes during the lesson. \n\nWhile skills like recognizing positions of numbers (B), creating sets of objects using counters (C), and matching values with their numerical representatives (D) are important for other mathematical concepts, they are not directly related to the task of categorizing geometric objects by type of shape."
