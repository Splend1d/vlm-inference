A depletion of energy yielding substrates\n\nDe novo fatty acid synthesis refers to the process by which the body generates new fatty acids from non-fatty acid precursors, such as carbohydrates and amino acids, when energy is low. This process is typically activated in times of carbohydrate or glucose scarcity, leading to an increase in fatty acid synthesis."
