Density is mass per unit volume, and it affects how high a column of fluid can rise under the force of gravity without leaking. Since mercury is much denser than water, a column of mercury can be much taller before it leaks compared to a column of water. Therefore, to measure atmospheric pressure with the same accuracy as a mercury barometer, a barometer using water would need to be taller."
