At the point where the mass is displaced 0.030 meters from its equilibrium position, all of its energy is potential energy ( due to gravity and the spring force. As it passes through the equilibrium position, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n\nThe potential energy stored in a spring when it is displaced by \\(x\\) from its equilibrium position is given by:\n\n\\[ PE = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the spring constant and \\(x\\) is the displacement from equilibrium.\n\nThe kinetic energy of an object with mass \\(m\\) moving at velocity \\(v\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nSince there is no loss of energy due to friction, the initial potential energy equals the final kinetic energy.\n\nGiven:\n- Mass (\\(m\\)) = 0.30 kg\n- Displacement (\\(x\\)) = 0.030 m\n- Velocity (\\(v\\)) = 0.040 m/s\n\nFirst, calculate the potential energy when the mass is displaced:\n\n\\[ PE = \\frac{1}{2}k(0.030)^2 \\]\n\nHowever, we don't have the spring constant (\\(k\\)). Since we're asked for the total mechanical energy, which is the sum of potential and kinetic energy, we can use the kinetic energy formula instead because the question doesn't require us to find the spring constant. The kinetic energy at the equilibrium position is given directly by:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}(0.30)(0.040)^2 \\]\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}(0.30)(0.0016) \\]\n\\[ KE = 0.30 \\times 0.0008 \\]\n\\[ KE = 0.00024 \\text{ Joules} \\]\n\nConverting Joules to milliJoules ( (since 1 Joule = 1000 milliJoules):\n\n\\[ KE = 0.00024 \\times 1000 \\text{ mJ} \\]\n\\[ KE = 0.24 \\text{ mJ} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is 0.24 milliJoules, making the correct answer:\n\nA. 0.24 lJ"
