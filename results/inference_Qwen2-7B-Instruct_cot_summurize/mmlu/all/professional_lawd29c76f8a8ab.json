                    "text": "A man wearing a jacket and jeans walked along a city street at night in a high crime area known for drug trafficking and gun violence. He saw two police officers walking toward him. The officers were checking on a 911 call from a resident who observed a man in jeans and a jacket apparently selling drugs to people on the street. When the police first saw him, he was walking alone, in the area that the woman identified. As they approached, he suddenly crossed the street by jaywalking. They followed, and approaching from behind, asked him to stop. He started walking faster, away from them. The officers saw what appeared to be a heavy object bulging in his pocket as he moved. The officers, with over 10 years of foot patrol experience, stepped up and stopped him. They patted him down and found a concealed, unlicensed handgun in the jacket pocket. They then made a full search and found 50 packets of heroin. He filed a motion to suppress the gun and drug evidence. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?\n\nA. No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.\nB. No, because the police had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him.\nC. Yes, because they didn't know if this was the same man, they observed nothing illegal except jaywalking, and he had a right to avoid them under the circumstances.\nD. Yes, because the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the man simply because he crossed the street and walked faster away from them.\n"

                    "text": "Option B is the most likely correct answer.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures, and it generally requires law enforcement to have probable cause before making an arrest or conducting a search. However, the police can conduct a stop and frisk ( also known as a Terry stop, named after the Supreme Court case that established the precedent) based on reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. This reasonable suspicion does not need to be as strong as probable cause but must be supported by specific and articulable facts that the person has committed or is committing a crime.\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- The officers had received a 911 call identifying a suspect in the vicinity of the area where the man was walking. This information provides some reasonable suspicion.\n- The man's actions\u2014crossing the street by jaywalking and then walking faster away from the officers\u2014could suggest he is trying to evade them, which might reasonably lead an officer to suspect that he may be involved in criminal activity, especially considering the area's reputation.\n- The observation of an object bulging in his pocket as he moved could also provide additional reasonable suspicion, particularly given the officers' experience and the context of the high-crime area.\n\nThe fact that the officers were able to find a concealed, unlicensed handgun and 50 packets of heroin during a full search conducted after stopping the man suggests that their suspicion was grounded in specific, concrete observations. If these factors collectively support the conclusion that the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop the man and probable cause to arrest him for drug possession, the court is more likely to uphold the evidence obtained as admissible.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most plausible choice, assuming that the officers had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walked even faster as they followed him, which would justify both the stop and the subsequent search based on the discovery of the weapon and drugs."
