Two days ago he developed a moist, nonproductive cough and rapid breathing. He has received all scheduled childhood immunizations. He attends a large day-care center and has three schoolaged siblings. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 38/min, and blood pressure is 85/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows nasal flaring and rhinorrhea. Chest examination shows intercostal retractions along with bilateral, diffuse wheezes and expiratory rhonchi. The infectious agent of this patient's condition most likely has which of the following properties?\n\nA. DNA genome\nB. Double-stranded nucleic acid genome\nC. Mature virion lacking viral polymerase\nD. Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein\n"

Viruses typically have either a DNA or RNA genome ( options A and B could apply depending on whether the virus is DNA or RNA based. However, the question doesn't specify the type of genome. \n\nAmong the options provided, option C \"Mature virion lacking viral polymerase\" does not align well with the typical characteristics of a virus, as a mature virion would usually contain the necessary machinery for replication in host cells, including polymerases.\n\nOption D \"Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein\" is a common mechanism by which many viruses enter host cells, particularly enveloped viruses like influenza or HIV. This mechanism involves a viral protein fusing the viral envelope to the host cell membrane, allowing the virus to enter the cell.\n\nGiven the symptoms described ( fever, cough, nasal discharge, and wheezing, these are are indicative of an upper respiratory tract infection ( potentially leading to bronchiolitis or pneumonia in a young child. The most likely infectious agent in this scenario would be a respiratory virus such as a coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, or adenovirus. These viruses often use a fusion protein to mediate entry into host cells.\n\nTherefore, while none of the options perfectly describe the infectious agent's properties, **Option D** \"Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein\" is the best choice among those given, as it describes a common characteristic of how many viruses, including those that cause respiratory infections, enter host cells."
