                    "text": "Callahan's discussion of the Dutch Commission on Euthanasia in 1990 is primarily aimed at illustrating the complexities and ethical considerations involved in the practice of euthanasia. The Dutch experience, particularly as documented by the commission, provides insights into how euthanasia is regulated within a legal framework, and it addresses issues such as the criteria for determining a patient's eligibility for euthanasia, the role of physicians, and the importance of informed consent.\n\nWhile the Dutch approach does include measures to prevent abuse ( for instance, by requiring two physicians to agree on a patient's case before euthanasia can be performed, and by mandating that the patient's request must be voluntary and well-considered, among other safeguards), it also acknowledges that there have been instances where these regulations were not strictly adhered to or misapplied, leading to abuses. This is an example of how even with robust regulatory frameworks, there is always a risk of misinterpretation or misapplication.\n\nAs for the second option, \"doctors who perform euthanasia may not report doing so,\" this statement is not directly supported by the Dutch experience. The Dutch model actually emphasizes transparency and accountability in the process of euthanasia. The requirement for two physicians to agree on a case and the necessity of maintaining thorough documentation are designed to ensure that euthanasia is reported correctly and that the process is transparent. Moreover, the Dutch system includes mechanisms for monitoring and reporting, which helps in identifying and addressing any potential non-compliance or abuse.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nC. both A and B\n\nThis choice recognizes that the Dutch Commission on Euthanasia highlights both the potential for abuse within the context of euthanasia practices and the importance of maintaining transparency and accountability through reporting requirements and regulatory oversight."
