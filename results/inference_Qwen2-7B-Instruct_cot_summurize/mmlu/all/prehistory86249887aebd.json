Migrating out of Africa into western Europe between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago and then spreading into Asia, Australia, and the Americas.\n\nThis view aligns with the Out of Africa theory which is widely accepted by paleoanthropologists. This theory suggests that anatomically modern humans originated in Africa and later migrated to other parts of the world, replacing or interbreeding with earlier hominid species such as Neanderthals. This theory supports the idea that modern humans first appeared in Africa around 200,000 years ago and began migrating outwards from there. The migration into Europe occurred between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago, followed by migrations into Asia, Australia, and the Americas. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that while this theory is widely accepted, the exact timing and routes of human dispersal from Africa are still subjects of ongoing research and debate among scientists."
