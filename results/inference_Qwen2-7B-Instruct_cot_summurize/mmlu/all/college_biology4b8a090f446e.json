A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate\n\nRetrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that copy themselves by first transcribing their DNA sequence into an RNA copy, which is then used as a template for creating a new DNA copy through a reverse transcription process. This mechanism contrasts with classical transposition, where genetic material moves directly from one location to another without replication."
