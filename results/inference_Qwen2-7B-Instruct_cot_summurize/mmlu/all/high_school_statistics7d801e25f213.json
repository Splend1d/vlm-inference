                    "text": "The correct answer is D. 1 \u2013 P(X = 0).\n\nThe question asks for the probability that at least one child will develop a cavity before turning 10. This is best calculated by finding the probability that none of the children (i.e., P(X = 0) - meaning all 5 children do not develop cavities - and then subtracting this from 1.\n\nGiven that the probability of any one child developing a cavity is \\(p = \\frac{2}{7}\\), the probability of a child not developing a cavity is \\(q = 1 - p = \\frac{5}{7}\\). \n\nFor 5 independent children, the probability that none of them develop a cavity is \\(q^5 = (\\frac{5}{7})^5\\).\n\nThus, the probability that at least one child develops a cavity is \\(1 - q^5 = 1 - (\\frac{5}{7})^5\\).\n\nThis approach avoids directly calculating the probability of specific numbers of cavities occurring (as A suggests, which would be more complex and less directly related to the question asked. Option B calculates the probability of exactly 2 children out of 7 developing cavities, which isn't what the question asks. Option C calculates the probability of exactly 1 child developing a cavity, also not matching the requirement."
