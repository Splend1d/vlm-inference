While the relationship may be a factor in the intensity of the wrongness, the act itself is still considered theft and is not justified by personal relationships.\n\nIn the second scenario, buying something (in this case, a painting - is a legal and ethical act. There is no inherent wrong in purchasing property, assuming it was acquired legally. If Joe, the seller, then decides to take back his painting, this action could be seen as theft, depending on the specifics of their agreement. However, if there was no prior contract or agreement that prevented Joe from reclaiming his painting, it would be more about the legality of the reclamation rather than the morality of the purchase itself. \n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, stealing is generally considered wrong, while purchasing an item is not inherently wrong."
