This type of drainage usually indicates that the body's immune system is actively fighting infection, as white blood cells (which are colorless) and other fluids are being released to help heal the wound. \n\nOptions A, B, and C describe pus, which is a sign of infection and inflammation, not serous drainage. Pus may contain red blood cells, be thick and yellow or green, or contain microorganisms."
