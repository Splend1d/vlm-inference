Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is deliberately spreading misinformation about vaccines causing autism with the intent to sell fake or ineffective remedies (snake oil. This action violates ethical standards by promoting harm and potentially causing real physical damage to others, especially when the information is proven false and potentially harmful.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is intentionally prolonging the repair process of broken games to make more money from customers by making them spend additional quarters. This is also morally wrong because it exploits the situation for personal gain at the expense of the customer's financial well-being without providing adequate service or disclosure of the true intention behind the slow repairs."
