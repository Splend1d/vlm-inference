If this bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water, what would be the expected result?\n\nA. There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.\nB. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\nC. The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.\nD. The solute will flow out of the dialysis bag into the beaker.\n"

There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\n\nIn this scenario, the dialysis bag contains a 0.5 M solution, which is more concentrated than the distilled water (which can be considered as 0 M concentration for practical purposes. According to the principle of osmosis, water will move from an area of lower solute concentration ( (distilled water) to an area of higher solute concentration ( (the dialysis bag) through a semi-permeable membrane (the wall of the dialysis bag) in order to equalize the solute concentrations on both sides. As a result, water will flow into the bag, causing it to swell in size."
