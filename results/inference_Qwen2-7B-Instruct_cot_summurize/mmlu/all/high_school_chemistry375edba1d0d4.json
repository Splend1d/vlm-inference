However, when dealing with phase changes like vaporization, we often use the specific heat of vaporization or the m.m.c ( (molar heat of vaporization) instead of the specific heat capacity to calculate the entropy change directly, because the process is not constant temperature.\n\nGiven that the m.m.c of water is +43.9 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to \\(43900\\) J/mol, and assuming the temperature at which the vaporization occurs is approximately \\(100^\\circ C\\) or \\(373\\) K, we can calculate the entropy change as follows:\n\n\\[ \\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T} = \\frac{43900 \\text{ J/mol}}{373 \\text{ K/mol}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta S = 118 \\text{ J/mol\u00b7K} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 118 J mol-1 K-1."
