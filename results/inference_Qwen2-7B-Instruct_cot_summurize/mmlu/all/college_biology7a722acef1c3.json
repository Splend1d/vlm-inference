Therefore, when you have a DNA strand with the sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032, you can find its complement by pairing each nucleotide as follows:\n\n- C pairs with G, so the first base becomes G.\n- G pairs with C, so the second base becomes C.\n- A pairs with T, so the third base becomes U ( (since it's RNA, not DNA).\n- T pairs with A, so the fourth base becomes A.\n- T pairs with A, so the fifth base becomes A.\n- G pairs with C, so the sixth base becomes C.\n\nTherefore, the complementary sequence is 5\u2032 GCU AAC 3\u2032. However, note that in DNA, Uracil (U) is not present, instead, it's Thymine (T). So the correct DNA complementary sequence would be 5\u2032 GCC ATT 3\u2032. This seems like a small discrepancy between the question's context (RNA vs DNA, and the answer provided, which aligns more closely with DNA rules. Given the context of DNA, the closest correct answer choice based on the DNA rules would be D. 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032, assuming a typographical error in the question or answer choices regarding the presence of Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T)."
