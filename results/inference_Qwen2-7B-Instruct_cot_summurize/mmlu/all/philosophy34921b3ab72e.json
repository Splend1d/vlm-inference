According to Berkeley, objects do not exist independently of perception; they only exist insofar as they are perceived by a mind. This idea is encapsulated in his famous dictum, \"Esse est percipi\" or \"to be is to perceive.\" Therefore, he posits that existing and perceiving are two distinct aspects of reality, with existence being a property of objects only when they are being perceived by a mind."
