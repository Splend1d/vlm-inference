Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nGiving an animal two pain pills when you see it is hurting can be considered morally wrong if you did not consult with a veterinarian first. Pain management for animals should always be done under professional guidance to ensure the dosage is safe and appropriate for the animal's species, size, and health condition. Administering too much medication or the wrong type could cause harm or even be fatal to the animal.\n\nOn the other hand, giving a teething infant a biscuit to chew on is generally not considered a morally wrong action. This is a common practice to help soothe a baby's gums during teething. However, it's important to ensure that the biscuit is safe for consumption, not too hard to avoid choking hazards, and does not contain any harmful substances."
