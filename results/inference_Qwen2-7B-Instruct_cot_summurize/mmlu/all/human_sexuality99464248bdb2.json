This means they have similar structures and developmental origins, even though their functions differ. The ovaries are the female reproductive organ that produces eggs (ova) and secretes estrogen and progesterone. The testes are the male reproductive organ that produces sperm (male gametes) and secretes testosterone.\n\nB. Both ovaries and testes produce gametes. Ovaries produce eggs (ova, while testes produce sperm.\n\nC. Both ovaries and testes produce sex hormones. Ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone, which are essential for the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Testes produce testosterone, which is crucial for male secondary sexual characteristics and sperm production."
