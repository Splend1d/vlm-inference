Organic molecules from decaying matter in the soil that are taken up by the roots\n\nThis is because plants, including oak trees, absorb nutrients from the soil through their roots. These nutrients include organic compounds derived from the breakdown of dead organisms and their wastes, which are essential for plant growth and development. The process of nutrient uptake allows plants to synthesize new organic molecules necessary for their structure and function.\n\nWhile other options play roles in the life cycle of an oak tree:\n\nB. Mineral nutrients dissolved in groundwater that are taken up by the roots contribute to the overall health and growth of the tree but do not directly form part of the organic matter in the same way as the organic molecules from the soil.\n\nC. Water that is taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide from the air are crucial for photosynthesis, which is the primary process by which plants create their own organic matter (primarily glucose and cellulose. However, the water itself does not contribute significantly to the dry mass of the tree's organic matter.\n\nD. Endosperm located in the cotyledons of the acorn is specific to seedling stages of the oak tree and provides initial nutrition to the developing seedling when it germinates. It does not contribute to the long-term organic matter composition of the mature tree.\n\nTherefore, option A is the most accurate answer to your question regarding the source contributing to the dry mass of organic matter in an oak tree."
