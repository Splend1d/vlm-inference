When a preliminary injunction hearing could not be scheduled within the original 14-day period, the court extended the TRO for another 30 days. The lender appealed the court's order extending the TRO. The homeowner has moved to dismiss the appeal. Is the appellate court likely to dismiss the appeal?\n\nA. No, because a TRO is immediately appealable.\nB. No, because the 30-day extension makes the TRO equivalent to a preliminary injunction and therefore appealable.\nC. Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\nD. Yes, because there is no final judgment from which an appeal may be taken.\n"

Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAn interlocutory appeal is a type of appeal taken from a decision that is not a final judgment of the court. Typically, interlocutory decisions are not appealable unless specifically authorized by law. In the United States, one of the main statutes that allows for interlocutory appeals is the collateral order doctrine under Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corporation, which requires that the order must conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an issue completely separate from the merits, and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\n\nTemporary Restraining Orders (TROs) are usually granted ex parte ( without notice to the other party, and they are intended to provide immediate relief pending further proceedings. They are not considered final judgments and thus are generally not directly appealable under the standard interlocutory appeals provisions found in statutes like 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). \n\nGiven this context, if the homeowner moved to dismiss the appeal because the TRO is not immediately appealable, and considering that the lender's appeal would not fall under exceptions like the collateral order doctrine, it is most likely that the appellate court would agree with the homeowner and dismiss the appeal. This is assuming that the court follows the principle that a TRO is not an appealable order under the general rules of interlocutory appeals."
