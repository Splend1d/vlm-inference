This is because with more money circulating in the economy, there's more purchasing power for the same amount of goods and services (Q, thus driving up prices.\n- Conversely, if the money supply decreases, the price level must decrease proportionally to maintain the balance.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly states that changes in the price level must be proportional to changes in the money supply when V and Q are constant."
