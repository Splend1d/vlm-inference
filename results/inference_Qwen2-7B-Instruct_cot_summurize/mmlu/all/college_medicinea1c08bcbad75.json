At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher\u2019s observation?\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.\n"

The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\n\nThis option suggests that the students were already motivated by the desire to perform well on their quizzes, which led to an increase in quiz scores even when there wasn't direct reinforcement for showing up on time. The rewards for high quiz scores (likely being more appealing or satisfying to the students than the immediate reward of a sticker for showing up on time. This indicates that the intrinsic motivation for academic success was a stronger driving force for the students' behavior compared to the extrinsic reward system for punctuality."
