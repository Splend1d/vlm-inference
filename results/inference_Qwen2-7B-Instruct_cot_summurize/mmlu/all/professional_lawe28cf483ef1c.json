One afternoon, a 9-year-old victim was riding her bicycle along the street. As the victim swerved into the southbound lane, her bicycle was struck by a car driven by the defendant. The victim was knocked off her bike and thrown onto the sidewalk adjacent to the street. Although the victim received some minor scrapes and bruises, she was not seriously injured. Following the accident, the car driven by the defendant sped away. Moments later, however, a tractor-trailer crashed into the rear of a car about 30 feet from where the victim was lying. The car almost instantly caught fire as its gas tank exploded. The victim, who was engulfed in the flaming wreckage, was killed. If the defendant is charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of the victim, the defendant should be found\n\nA. guilty, because she unlawfully fled the scene of an accident in violation of her statutory duty.\nB. guilty, because her failure to render aid to the victim would make the defendant criminally responsible for the victim's death.\nC. not guilty, because under the circumstances her failure to aid the victim cannot be a basis for imposing criminal responsibility for the victim's death.\nD. not guilty, because there was not a sufficient causal connection between her actions and the victim's death to impose criminal responsibility.\n"

In this case, the defendant's flight from the scene of the accident could potentially be considered an element of the crime of leaving the scene of an accident, which might carry legal consequences if it can be proven that the defendant had a duty to remain at the scene and failed to do so.\n\nHowever, the defendant's actions do not have a direct causal link to the subsequent death of the victim. The death occurred after the defendant fled the scene when another vehicle crashed into the car behind the victim, causing the fire and leading to her death. This chain of events involves separate incidents with different causes (\u2014the initial accident, the defendant's flight, and the subsequent crash and fire. Therefore, the defendant's flight from the initial accident does not establish a sufficient causal link to the victim's death to charge her with involuntary manslaughter.\n\nThe other options presented either misunderstand the legal principles involved (such as confusing the crime of leaving the scene of an accident with involuntary manslaughter, or incorrectly assume that the defendant's failure to render aid directly imposes criminal responsibility for the victim's death, which is not a standard principle of criminal law."
