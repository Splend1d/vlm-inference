This trend involves the development and expansion of community-based alternatives to incarceration, which can include probation, parole, treatment programs, restorative justice initiatives, and other non-custodial interventions. These approaches are designed to address the underlying issues that contribute to criminal behavior while also promoting rehabilitation and reintegration into society."
