How many programming statements the program contains\n\nThe number of programming statements in the program is not directly related to its ability to process larger data sets. What matters more for handling larger data sets is how efficiently the program utilizes resources such as CPU time (A), memory (C), and storage space (D). More statements might lead to longer execution times or higher memory usage, but the number of statements itself doesn't inherently limit scalability as much as resource management does."
