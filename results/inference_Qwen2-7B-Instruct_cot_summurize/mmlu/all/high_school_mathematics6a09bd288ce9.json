                    "text": "To find the area of the square, we first need to determine the radius of the inscribed circle and then use that information to find the side length of the square. Once we have the side length, we can calculate the area of the square.\n\nGiven the equation of the circle:\n\\[2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\\]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation into a more recognizable form by grouping terms and dividing by the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) or \\(y^2\\), which is 2 in both cases:\n\n\\[x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 10\\]\n\nNext, we complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). To do this, we take half of the coefficients of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) ( (which are -6 and 2, respectively), square them, and add them to both sides of the equation. \n\nFor \\(x\\), half of -6 is -3, and squaring it gives 9. For \\(y\\), half of 2 is 1, and squaring it gives 1. Adding these to both sides:\n\n\\[x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 2y + 1 = 10 + 9 + 1\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n\\[x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 2y + 1 = 20\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20\\]\n\nThis is the standard form of a circle's equation \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center of the circle, and \\(r\\) is the radius. From the equation, we can see that the center of the circle is at \\((3, -1)\\) and the radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nSince the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. The diameter \\(d\\) of the circle is twice the radius:\n\n\\[d = 2r = 2\\sqrt{20}\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the square is given by the formula \\(A = s^2\\), where \\(s\\) is the side length of the square. Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, we have:\n\n\\[s = d = 2\\sqrt{20\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is:\n\n\\[A = (s)^2 = (2\\sqrt{20)^2 = 4*20 = 80\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **A. 80**."
