Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, telling your baby sister to go away when she wants some of the ice cream you're having is not considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action might seem harsh or unkind, but it's not illegal or unethical in most contexts.\n\nIn scenario 2, acting as a landlord and intentionally replacing elderly tenants with new ones because they are \"feeble\" would be considered morally wrong. This could involve age discrimination, which is illegal under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ( (ADEA), and is widely viewed as unethical. It's important to respect the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their age.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong."
