While it's possible that some people might consider gloating or being upset about losing a game, there isn't necessarily anything morally wrong with feeling happy about winninging a game. It's a competitive activity, and winning is often celebrated by the winner.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is simply taking a shower and then walking around in public. This doesn't typically involve any harm or wrongdoing unless there's more context that suggests otherwise. For example, if the person was not supposed to be nude in public, then this could be considered morally wrong depending on local laws and societal norms. However, assuming there's no specific reason given why this would be wrong (such as a legal prohibition or public decency concerns - it is generally not considered morally wrong."
