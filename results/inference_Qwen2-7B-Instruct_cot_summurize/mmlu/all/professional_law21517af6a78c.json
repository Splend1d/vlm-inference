According to the law, every hospital in the state would receive $5,000 annually for each cancer patient who was admitted to that hospital, and whose period of hospitalization exceeded one week. Although this bill was initially opposed by several churches and other organizations, the state's legislature re-drafted the bill in a compromise effort to appease the opposition. In its final re-draft, the bill provided that the $5,000 annual subsidy \"would not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. \"Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the state statute?\n\nA. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states plenary power over the allocation of their public funds.\nB. Public subsidies in hospitals are privileges rather than rights and, therefore, are not entitlements protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.\nD. The statute promotes a compelling state interest in advancing the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry.\n"

It argues that the state has has the authority to allocate its funds in a manner that serves its legitimate interests, which could include promoting the health care of cancer patients without funding activities it deems inappropriate.\n\nOption A, the Tenth Amendment argument, may not be as strong because while it supports state sovereignty, it doesn't necessarily address the constitutional validity of the statute's specific conditions or funding limitations.\n\nOption B, regarding subsidies being privileges rather than rights, is a weaker argument because even if subsidies are considered privileges, they can still be subject to reasonable regulation by the government.\n\nOption D, promoting a compelling state interest, might also be relevant but it does not specifically address the constitutional concerns about funding limitations and their relation to individual rights.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the strongest argument supporting the statute's constitutionality, as it addresses both the rational basis for the funding limitations and the lack of direct infringement on fundamental rights."
