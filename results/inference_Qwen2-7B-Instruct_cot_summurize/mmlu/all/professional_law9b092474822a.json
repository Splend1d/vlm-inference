The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\nA. inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\nB. inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\nC. inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\nD. admissible as an admission.\n"

An admission is a statement made by a party that is against their interest and can be used against them in court. In this case, the taxpayer allowed the accountant to prepare a financial statement based on information provided by the taxpayer, which could include statements that are detrimental to their case.\n\nOptions A, B, and C refer to different legal doctrines that may protect certain communications or evidence from being admitted in court:\n\n- Option A refers to the attorney-client privilege, which generally prevents communications between a client and their attorney from being disclosed in court without the client's consent.\n- Option B refers to the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination, which protects individuals from being compelled to provide self-incriminating evidence against themselves.\n- Option C refers to the work-product doctrine, which protects materials prepared by an attorney in anticipation of litigation from being disclosed to the opposing party without the attorney's consent.\n\nHowever, in this context, the accountant's testimony about statements made by the taxpayer to prepare the financial statement is more appropriately classified as an admission, rather than protected by any of these privileges or doctrines."
