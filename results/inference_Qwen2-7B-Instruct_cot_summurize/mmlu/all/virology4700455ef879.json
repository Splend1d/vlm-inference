Attention to handwashing and hygiene\n\nNorovirus, also known as the \"stomach flu,\" is highly contagious and spreads easily through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, food, or water. It's not currently possible to get a vaccine against norovirus, and there are no specific antiviral medications approved for treating norovirus infections. \n\nThe most effective way to control the spread of norovirus is through good hygiene practices, particularly frequent hand washing with soap and water. This helps prevent the virus from spreading from person to person and reduces the risk of infection. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that may be contaminated can also help prevent outbreaks in areas such as schools, nursing homes, cruise ships, and other group settings. \n\nQuarantine may be used as a measure in certain situations to prevent the spread of illness, but it is not typically the primary method for controlling norovirus outbreaks because it can be difficult to isolate infected individuals effectively and for long enough periods. Instead, quarantine might be used when an outbreak is identified, and efforts are made to separate those who are ill from others until they recover and it is safe for them to return to their normal activities."
