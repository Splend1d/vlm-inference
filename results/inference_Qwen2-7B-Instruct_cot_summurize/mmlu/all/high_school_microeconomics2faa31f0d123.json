                    "text": "To determine Jason's optimal decision, we need to compare his total revenue (TR) and total costs (TC). The total revenue comes from the price per pool multiplied by the number of pools cleaned, while the total cost is the sum of total variable costs (TVC) and total fixed costs (TFC).\n\nGiven:\n- Price per pool = $10\n- Number of pools cleaned per day = 9\n- Total variable costs for cleaning 9 pools = $80\n- Total fixed costs = $20\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total revenue:\n\\[ TR = Price \\times Quantity = \\$10 \\times 9 = \\$90 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost:\n\\[ TC = TVC + TFC = \\$80 + \\$20 = \\$100 \\]\n\nSince the total revenue ($90) is less than the total cost ($100), Jason incurs economic losses. To decide whether to continue operating in the short run or shut down, we look at whether covering variable costs is possible.\n\nThe shutdown point occurs when the price equals the minimum average variable cost (AVC). However, in this scenario, we can directly compare total revenue to total costs to make the decision since we're dealing with a profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive market. \n\nJason should only continue operating if he can cover his variable costs, as covering fixed costs is not a concern for the shutdown decision (the firm will incur losses regardless of whether it shuts down or continues operating in the short run due to fixed costs being sunk costs at that point.\n\nGiven that his total revenue ($90) is less than his total variable costs ($80), he is not covering his variable costs and thus should consider shutting down in the short run to minimize losses. The total losses would be the difference between total revenue and total variable costs, which in this case is $10 ($90 - $80).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $10."
