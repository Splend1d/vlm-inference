At trial, the insurer called as an expert witness an engineer, who testified that the pipe had burst because of age rather than freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that five years earlier, he had been convicted of tax fraud, even though he had asserted that it was his accountant's error. In response, the insurer calls a witness, who is well acquainted with the engineer and his reputation, to testify that (1) in the witness's opinion, the engineer is a truthful person, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person. How much, if any, of the witness's testimony is admissible?\n\nA. All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.\nB. Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\nC. Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.\nD. None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.\n"

Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 608(b), opinion testimony regarding a person's character for truthfulness is admissible to attack or support the credibility of a witness. This includes opinions formed by someone who knows the witness personally and has observed their demeanor and behavior. Therefore, the testimony about the engineer being described as truthful by his neighbors would be admissible under this rule, as it provides an opinion based on personal observation.\n\nHowever, the testimony regarding the neighbors' direct statements about the engineer's truthfulness would be inadmissible as hearsay. Hearsay is defined as out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Since the neighbors' statements are not being made by them in court but are instead relayed by the witness, they would fall under the definition of hearsay and thus be inadmissible unless there is an exception that applies.\n\nIn conclusion, while the witness's personal opinion about the engineer's truthfulness can be used to bolster the engineer's credibility, the witness's recounting of what the neighbors said about the engineer's truthfulness cannot be admitted because it constitutes hearsay."
