It tends to produce sparse solutions by shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection.\n\n- **L2 Norm (Option C)**: Also known as Ridge Regression, uses the L2 norm as its penalty term. While it doesn't typically produce coefficients exactly equal to zero, it can shrink them towards zero, reducing model complexity and improving prediction accuracy by penalizing large coefficients.\n\nTherefore, both options A and B could be correct depending on the specific context or implementation details of the regularization method used."
