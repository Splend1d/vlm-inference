                    "text": "The correct answer is D. arbitrary inference.\n\nIn cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), developed by Albert Ellis and further expanded upon by Aaron T. Beck, cognitive distortions are irrational or maladaptive patterns of thinking that contribute to psychological distress. An arbitrary inference involves making a conclusion without sufficient evidence, often based on a small amount of information.\n\nIn Samuel's case, he is drawing a negative conclusion about his job security despite receiving a bonus, which is an example of an arbitrary inference. He is likely inferring that receiving a bonus implies the company is in financial trouble and thus considering layoffs, even if there is no actual evidence for this conclusion. \n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. Mustabatory thinking: This refers to the belief that one must achieve perfection or that one must control outcomes, which can lead to feelings of failure and guilt when perfection is not reached.\n\nB. Polarized thinking: This involves viewing things as either all good or all bad with no middle ground. It can lead to black-and-white thinking where everything is seen in extremes.\n\nC. Personalization: This is the tendency to attribute events to oneself, especially when the events are actually caused by external factors. It involves taking responsibility for events that are not under one's control.\n\nTherefore, given the context provided, the most fitting description for Samuel's thoughts would be D. arbitrary inference."
