The sympathetic trunk originates at the level of T1 and extends caudally down to the lumbar region. The specific segment that innervates the colon is generally considered to be T10 to T12, but since the question mentions \"viscera\" which includes multiple organs, it could encompass a slightly broader range, thus covering T7 to L2. \n\nIn this case, however, it would be important to note that the patient's symptoms do not necessarily suggest a specific spinal cord segment issue, as they could be related to a variety of gastrointestinal conditions. The location of the sympathetic innervation given in the question seems more relevant to the general organization of the sympathetic nervous system rather than a direct diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms. For an accurate diagnosis, additional clinical information and possibly diagnostic tests would be required."
