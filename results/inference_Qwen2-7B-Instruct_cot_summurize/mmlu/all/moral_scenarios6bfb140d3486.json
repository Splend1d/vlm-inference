It demonstrates consideration for others, especially if the person has enough to spare.\n\nRelaxing naked in one's own home's yard is typically not considered morally wrong, assuming that the individual has privacy and there is no intention to cause offense or embarrassment. In the context of one's own property and with no expectation of public visibility, this behavior is usually within acceptable boundaries."
