Step size is too large\n\nWhen the step size (or learning rate) is too large, the optimization algorithm might overshoot the minimum of the loss function. As a result, instead of converging to the optimal solution, the loss might start increasing as the model diverges from the minimum.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that options A, B, and D can also cause issues during the learning process:\n\nA. If regularization is too low and the model is overfitting, the model might not generalize well to new data and its performance on the training set might plateau or even degrade over time due to the model capturing noise in the training data.\n\nB. If regularization is too high and the model is underfitting, the model might not learn enough from the data and fail to capture the underlying patterns, leading to poor performance on both the training and validation sets.\n\nD. If the step size is too small, the optimization process might converge very slowly, requiring many epochs to reach the minimum, but it should not necessarily lead to an increase in training loss over time. In fact, if the learning rate is too small, the model might not learn effectively and could get stuck in local minima or saddle points.\n\nIn summary, while all these options can potentially cause problems during the learning process, option C directly addresses the scenario where training loss increases with more epochs, specifically when the step size is too large."
