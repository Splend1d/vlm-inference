Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBoth actions in the scenarios provided are generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020:\n\n1. Mowing the lawn and being paid for it is a common scenario where someone is compensated for providing a service. This is typically seen as a fair exchange for labor and is not considered morally wrong.\n\n2. Taking pictures of one's niece for birthday memories is an act of creating personal documentation and capturing cherished moments. This action fosters family connections and preserves memories, which is generally viewed as a positive and non-moral activity."
