For a cube with a side length of \\(2\\) feet:\n\n\\[ \\text{Surface Area} = 6 \\times (2^2 = 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\, \\text{square feet} \\]\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of paint required per square foot.\n\nSince \\(16\\) quarts of paint cover \\(24\\) square feet:\n\n\\[ \\text{Paint per square foot} = \\frac{16 \\, \\text{quarts}}{24 \\, \\text{sq ft}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\, \\text{quarts/sq ft} \\]\n\nStep 3: Calculate the surface area that can be covered with \\(169\\) quarts of paint.\n\nGiven the paint requirement per square foot, the total surface area that can be covered with \\(169\\) quarts is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Surface Area} = 169 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 253.5 \\, \\text{sq ft} \\]\n\nStep 4: Find the edge length of the larger cube.\n\nTo find the edge length (\\(s'\\)) of the cube that can be covered with this surface area, we use the formula for the surface area of a cube:\n\n\\[ 6s'^2 = 253.5 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(s'\\):\n\n\\[ s'^2 = \\frac{253.5}{6} = 42.25 \\]\n\n\\[ s' = \\sqrt{42.25} = 6.5 \\]\n\nThus, the edge length of the cube that can be covered with \\(169\\) quarts of paint is \\(6.5\\) feet. However, since this option is not listed in your provided choices and assuming there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question's formulation or answer choices, the correct interpretation based on the calculations aligns with finding an equivalent option if considering the closest match to \\(6.5\\) feet among the given choices in terms of how they might represent the solution conceptually.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. \\( \\frac{13}{4} = 3.25 \\)\nB. 8\nC. \\( \\frac{13}{2} = 6.5 \\)\nD. 13\n\nThe correct answer, considering the direct calculation and aiming for the most accurate representation, would be **C. \\( \\frac{13}{2} \\)**, as it directly matches the calculated edge length of \\(6.5\\) feet."
