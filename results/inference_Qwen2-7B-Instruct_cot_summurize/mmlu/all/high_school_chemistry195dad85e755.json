Since HBr and KOH react in a 1:1 ratio, the limiting reactant is KOH, and there will be an excess of H+ ions:\n\nExcess moles of H+ = 0.000125 - 0.000115 = 0.000010 mol\n\nThe total volume of the solution after mixing is:\n\nTotal volume = 50.0 mL + 50.0 mL = 100.0 mL = 0.100 L\n\nNow, we calculate the concentration of H+ ions:\n\n\\[ [H^+] = \\frac{0.000010 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.100 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.0001 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the pH:\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log[H^+] = -\\log(0.0001 = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting mixture is 4.\n\nCorrect answer: B. 4"
