The plaintiff claims that while he was cleaning the machine, two wires came into contact with each other and caused the machine to turn on. At trial, the manufacturer has offered evidence that it was unreasonably expensive to design the machine so that the wires could not come into contact. In rebuttal, the plaintiff offers evidence that after this action was filed, the manufacturer redesigned the machine to prevent the wires from redesigned the machine to prevent the wires from coming into contact. Is evidence of this change in design admissible?\n\nA. No, because the change in design may have been unrelated to this type of accident.\nB. No, under the rule regarding remedial measures that encourages manufacturers to make their products safer.\nC. Yes, as evidence tending to show that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact.\nD. Yes, as evidence tending to show that the manufacturer was negligent because its initial design failed to prevent the wires from coming into contact.\n"

Yes, as evidence tending to show that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact.\n\nThe evidence of the manufacturer redesigning the machine to prevent the wires from coming into contact is relevant to the issue of whether the original design was reasonably safe or negligently defective. This is known as the \"state-of-the-art\" defense, which considers whether the defendant took reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the product given the technology and knowledge available at the time of manufacture. By offering evidence of the redesign, the plaintiff can argue that the machine could have been designed more safely than it was, thus supporting their claim of negligence."
