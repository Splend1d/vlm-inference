Free sugars refer to all forms of sugar added to foods during processing or cooking, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices, and fruit concentrates. Cows' milk contains lactose, which is a type of sugar found naturally in milk, while natural unsweetened orange juice only contains naturally sugars from the fruit. Honey and agave nectar are specifically mentioned as containing sugars that would be considered 'free sugars'."
