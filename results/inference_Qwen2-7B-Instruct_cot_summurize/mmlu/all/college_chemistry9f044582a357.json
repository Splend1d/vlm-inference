This is because each additional component can potentially add one more phase (such as a liquid, solid, gas, or vapor phase) to the system without destabilizing it. So, for three components, you could have a maximum of four phases in equilibrium: three different liquid phases and one gas phase, or any combination thereof, depending on conditions like temperature and pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 4"
