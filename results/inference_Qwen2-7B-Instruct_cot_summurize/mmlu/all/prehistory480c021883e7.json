It indicates a tradition dating back 250,000 years of hand axe production and use, which supports option A. Additionally, the findings also suggest adaptations to hunting in colder environments, supporting option C. However, it does not specifically evidence the 71,000-year-old complex sequence of microblade production and use ( which would correspond to option B. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the information provided would be D: both A and C."
