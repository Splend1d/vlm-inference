These muscles are primarily responsible for the flexion and rotation of the neck. If there's damage to the accessory nerve, it may lead to weakness or paralysis of these muscles.\n\nWhen testing for accessory nerve function, you would ask the patient to extend their neck against resistance. This action involves the use of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which is innervated by the accessory nerve. If the patient has damage to the accessory nerve, they may not be able to extend their neck effectively against resistance due to weakened or paralyzed sternocleidomastoid muscle."
