During the past week, she has had six large watery stools daily. She is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. She is employed as a flight attendant and works regularly on domestic flights throughout the USA. She also flies to Asia at least once monthly. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 112/64 mm Hg. The abdomen is scaphoid. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 400/mm3 (Normal\u2265500). Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?\n\nA. Cryptosporidium parvum\nB. Cytomegalovirus\nC. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex\nD. Salmonella enteritidis\n"

Cryptosporidium parvum\n\nCryptosporidiosis is a common cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals like those with AIDS. It is highly contagious and can be transmitted through contaminated food or water, especially in areas where sanitation is poor. Travelers, particularly those visiting developing countries, are at increased risk for this infection. The other options may also contribute to diarrhea in immunocompromised patients but are less directly associated with the symptoms and travel history provided here."
