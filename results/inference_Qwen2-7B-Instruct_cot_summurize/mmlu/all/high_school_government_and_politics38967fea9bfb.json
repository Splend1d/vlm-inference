Educational levels might affect views on other issues but the direct correlation with supporting or opposing public prayer in schools is not consistently supported by data.\n\nThe other options ( A, B, and D are generally considered plausible outcomes where higher education might correlate with certain voting patterns:\n\nA. Voters with higher education levels may be more supportive of government-enforced affirmative action programs, as they might perceive such policies as necessary for addressing historical injustices and promoting social equity.\n\nB. Voters with higher education levels may be more inclined to support environmental protection efforts, given the greater awareness and understanding of environmental science and the potential long-term impacts of climate change.\n\nD. Voters with higher education levels might be less likely to support restrictions on abortion rights, as they may have a better understanding of reproductive rights, medical ethics, and the complexities involved in abortion cases."
