In this case, the true concentration of the solution is 0.100 M, and the measured mean concentration is 0.110 M. This means the measurements are not accurate because they are not close to the true value.\n\nPrecision refers to how close repeated measurements are to each other. The standard deviation here is 0.001 M, which indicates that the student's measurements were very consistent with each other ( they were precise. \n\nSo, the results are precise ( because all the values are close to each other, but they are not accurate because they are not close to the true value."
