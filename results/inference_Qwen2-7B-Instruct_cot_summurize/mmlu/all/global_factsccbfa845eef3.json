In recent decades, the greatest population growth rate has taken place in Asia, particularly in countries like India and China, which have experienced both rapid population growth and steady economic growth. While these countries do face poverty, they also have seen significant economic development that has supported higher birth rates. It's important to note that population growth and economic growth are complexly intertwined and influenced by various factors including policy, healthcare, education, and cultural norms.\n\nOptions A and D incorrectly state that Africa is the region with the highest population growth rate, which is not accurate based on current trends. Option C repeats an incorrect premise about Asia's economic status and growth trajectory."
