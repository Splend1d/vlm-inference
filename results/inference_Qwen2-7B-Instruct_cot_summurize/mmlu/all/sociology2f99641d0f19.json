African-Americans who felt excluded from the 'ethnic melting pot' in the USA\n\nThe Nation of Islam (NOI), founded by Elijah Muhammad, primarily appealed to African-American communities in the United States during its early and mid-20th century. The organization emphasized racial pride and self-improvement among African-Americans, providing a sense of identity and community for those who felt marginalized within the broader American society. The NOI's teachings often criticized mainstream Christianity for its perceived association with white supremacy and advocated for a separate black nation. This message resonated with many African-Americans who sought a distinct cultural and religious identity amidst the racial tensions and discrimination prevalent in the U.S."
