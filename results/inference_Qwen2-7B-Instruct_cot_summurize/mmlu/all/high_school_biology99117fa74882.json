None of the individual insects should have possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT.\n\nThe success of pest eradication efforts in the long run would depend on preventing the development of resistance in the insect population to the pesticide being used. If some insects naturally possess genomes that allow them to resist DDT (or if they develop such resistance over time due to exposure to the pesticide, then the effectiveness of DDT as an eradication tool will diminish. This is a key concept in evolutionary biology and ecology, where the selective pressures of using a particular pesticide can lead to the evolution of resistance in target species.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are not necessarily requirements for long-term success in pest eradication efforts with DDT. Increasing the dose, applying it uniformly across all habitats, or increasing the frequency of application might help manage pest populations temporarily, but they do not address the fundamental issue of resistance development. Moreover, such approaches could also lead to other negative environmental impacts, such as pollution and harm to non-target organisms."
