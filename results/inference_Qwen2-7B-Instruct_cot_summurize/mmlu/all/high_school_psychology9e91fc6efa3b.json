These waves cause hair cells to bend, initiating an electrical signal.\n5. **Auditory Nerve**: The electrical signals generated by the hair cells are transmitted along the auditory nerve to the brain.\n\nThese steps collectively form the auditory pathway, which allows us to perceive and interpret sounds."
