We know that:\n\n- Rowena paints a room in 14 hours, so her rate is \\(\\frac{1}{14}\\) rooms per hour.\n- Ruby paints a room in 6 hours, so her rate is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) rooms per hour.\n\nThe total work done when Rowena paints for \\(x\\) hours and Ruby paints for \\(y\\) hours is half a room, so we have:\n\\[Rx + ry = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nAnd when Rowena paints for \\(y\\) hours and Ruby paints for \\(x\\) hours, they paint the whole room, so:\n\\[Ry + rx = 1\\]\n\nSubstituting the rates into these equations gives us:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{14} + \\frac{y}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{y}{14} + \\frac{x}{6} = 1 \\]\n\nLet's simplify these equations further by finding a common denominator and simplifying them:\n\nFor the first equation:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{14} + \\frac{y}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\nMultiplying through by \\(14*6 = 84\\) to clear the denominators:\n\\[ 6x + 14y = 42 \\]\n\\[ 3x + 7y = 21 \\]  ( (Equation 1)\n\nFor the second equation:\n\\[ \\frac{y}{14} + \\frac{x}{6} = 1 \\]\nMultiplying through by \\(14*6 = 84\\) to clear the denominators:\n\\[ 6y + 14x = 84 \\]\n\\[ 3y + 7x = 42 \\]  ( (Equation 2)\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations:\n\\[ 3x + 7y = 21 \\]\n\\[ 3y + 7x = 42 \\]\n\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination by multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by -7 to eliminate \\(y\\):\n\n\\[ 9x + 21y = 63 \\]\n\\[ -21y - 49x = -294 \\]\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\\[ -40x = -231 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{231}{40} \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(x\\) back into one of the original equations to find \\(y\\). Using \\(3x + 7y = 21\\):\n\\[ 3\\left(\\frac{231}{40}\\right) + 7y = 21 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{693}{40} + 7y = 21 \\]\n\\[ 7y = 21 - \\frac{693}{40} \\]\n\\[ 7y = \\frac{840 - 693}{40} \\]\n\\[ 7y = \\frac{147}{40} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{147}{280} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{21}{40} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) is \\(\\(\\left(\\frac{231}{40}, \\frac{21}{40}\\right)\\), which corresponds to option C."
