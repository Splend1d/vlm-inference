On June 1, 2007, two tenants took possession of a three- bedroom apartment in the landlord's building under a three-year lease at a rental of $1,200 per month. Their lease (as all other leases given by the landlord) contained the following provisions:\"The term of this lease shall be three years from the date hereof as long as all the agreements herein shall be faithfully performed. \"The two tenants lived in the apartment for two years. On June 10, 2009, however, a fire destroyed the apartment building. As a result, all the apartments in the building were rendered uninhabitable. After the two tenants were dispossessed from their apartment, the landlord brought suit against them to recover the rent due for the balance of the lease. The two tenants claim that they are no longer liable for rent or any other obligations under the lease. The landlord \u0080\u0094 tenants leasehold contract contained no provision regarding liability for fire. If the decision is in favor of the two tenants, it will most likely be because\n\nA. there was nothing in the lease regarding liability for fire.\nB. the two tenants did not own an interest in the property.\nC. the jurisdiction has rejected the common law view on the tenant's duty to pay rent.\nD. the landlord did not contract to convey the property to the two tenants.\n"

There was nothing in the lease regarding liability for fire.\n\nIn the context of a lease agreement, if there are are no specific provisions addressing what happens when the property becomes uninhabitable due to events like fires, the typical legal principle that would apply is the \"impossibility of performance\" doctrine. This principle holds that a party does not have to fulfill their contractual obligations when doing so would be impossible due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control. In this case, since the fire made the property uninhabitable, the tenants could argue that they were not legally obligated to continue paying rent.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific outcome would depend on the laws and case precedents of the jurisdiction where the landlord and tenant are located. Some jurisdictions may have different rules or interpretations of lease agreements and the tenant's responsibilities in such scenarios."
