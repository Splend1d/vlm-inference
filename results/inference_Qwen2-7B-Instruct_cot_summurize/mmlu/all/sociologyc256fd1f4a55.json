Bureaucracies are characterized by formal rules, division of labor, specialization of tasks, hierarchical structure, and impersonal relationships between employees. In a government setting, these features are typically present with departments, roles, rules, regulations, and a clear chain of command.\n\nA. An extended or consanguine family does not fit the criteria for a bureaucracy because it is based on personal relationships rather than formal rules and roles.\nC. A book club operates more on consensus and personal preferences rather than formal hierarchy and rules.\nD. The annual gathering of volunteers to clean the neighborhood might have some organizational structure, but it lacks the formal, rule-bound nature of a bureaucracy."
