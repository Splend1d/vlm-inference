This is because TNF\u03b1 inhibitors have proven effective in managing symptoms and reducing inflammation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, particularly when conventional therapies like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and sulfasalazine do not provide adequate relief. These medications, such as adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, golimumab, or certolizumab, work by blocking TNF\u03b1, a protein that plays a significant role in the inflammatory process."
