Here's a general guideline:\n\n- **350ml**: This is a smaller bag which might not be ideal for long periods as it can fill up quickly.\n- **500ml**: This size offers more capacity than the 350ml option but might still need to be emptied several times during the night, depending on the person's urine output.\n- **1L (1000ml**: This is a larger bag, providing ample space for urine collection. It could potentially last through the night without needing to be emptied, especially if the person has a lower urine output.\n- **2L (2000ml**: This is an even larger capacity, suitable for individuals with higher urine output or those who prefer not to empty their catheter bag frequently.\n\nIn deciding the appropriate size, it's important to consider the specific needs of the individual using the catheter bag. For instance, someone with nocturia (frequent urination at night) might require a larger capacity bag to minimize nighttime disruptions. Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances."
