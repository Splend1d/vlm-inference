To him I shall come when I go beyond this life, and to him will come he who has faith and doubts not.\n\u2014The Upanishads, India, c. 1000 BCE\nBased on the quotation, which statement is true of the speaker's religion?\n\nA.

There is an expectation of an afterlife.\n\nThe quote suggests that there is a belief in an afterlife, as the speaker mentions coming \"when I go beyond this life\" and states that \"he who has faith and doubts not\" will come to Brahman (or the divine spirit). The other options do not align with the information provided:\n\nA. Salvation is based on the correct completion of rituals - The quote does not mention any specific rituals for salvation; it focuses more on faith, devotion, and the nature of the divine spirit.\n\nC. Right actions and right speech earn favor with the gods - The text does not discuss karma or actions leading to divine favor; instead, it emphasizes faith and the belief in a single, all-encompassing divine spirit.\n\nD. It is a polytheistic religion - The quote refers to Brahman as \"the Spirit that is in my heart,\" suggesting a monotheistic understanding of the divine rather than multiple gods."
