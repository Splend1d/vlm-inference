One evening around closing time, the woman took a diamond necklace from a cabinetin the jewelry section of the department store and wrapped it in tissue paper. The woman then surreptitiously stuffed the necklace in a shopping bag, intending to remove it when she left the store. Moments later, the store owner approached the woman and told her she needed to stay late in order to do inventory. While the woman was completing inventory, the owner discovered the necklace and called the police.

In this scenario, the woman took a diamond necklace with the intention of removing it from the store, which meets the criteria for larceny.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. **Attempted larceny** involves the intent to steal but without the completion of the theft (e.g., the thief was caught before they could take the item. Here, the necklace has been taken, so it's not an attempt.\n\nC. **False pretenses** involves making false statements or promises to gain possession of someone else's property, typically involving a transaction.\n\nD. **Embezzlement** refers to the fraudulent conversion of money or property by someone to whom it was entrusted, usually within an organization. This scenario does not fit the description of embezzlement because there is no indication that the woman had lawful possession or trust over the necklace prior to her actions."
