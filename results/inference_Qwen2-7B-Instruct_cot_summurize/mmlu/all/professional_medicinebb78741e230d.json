He has mild hypertension. Other medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg. During the examination, he is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions. Neurologic examination shows tremulousness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?\n\nA. Adverse effect of medication\nB. Alcohol withdrawal\nC. Fat emboli\nD. Sepsis\n"

Fat emboli\n\nThe patient's history of a recent motor vehicle collision and current symptoms of agitation, confusion, and tremulousness suggest that fat emboli could be the most likely cause of these findings. Fat emboli syndrome occurs when fat particles from a fracture enter the bloodstream and travel to the lungs and brain, causing symptoms such as confusion, agitation, and tremors. The CT scan of the head showing no abnormalities supports this diagnosis, as it rules out other potential causes like sepsis or brain injury.\n\nWhile adverse effects of medication (A) could also be a consideration, the patient's symptoms do not specifically align with known side effects of the medications listed (acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. Alcohol withdrawal (B) would typically present with a different set of symptoms, often including anxiety, agitation, tremors, and possibly seizures, but without a history of alcohol use or withdrawal, this is less likely. Sepsis (D) could potentially cause similar symptoms, but given the absence of fever (a hallmark symptom of sepsis), and the fact that the patient had an open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture, fat emboli is the more plausible diagnosis."
