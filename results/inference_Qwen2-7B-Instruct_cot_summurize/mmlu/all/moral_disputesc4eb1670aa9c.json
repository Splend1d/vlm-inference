Kantianism\n\nKantian ethics, derived from the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, places significant emphasis on the intrinsic value of individuals and the moral law that governs actions. Central to Kantianism is the concept of treating individuals as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end. Using someone as a mere means would violate this principle, as it disregards their autonomy and inherent worth. Therefore, such an action would be morally impermissible according to Kantian ethical theory."
