No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.\n\nExplanation: Dr. Ramchandran's finding indicates a statistical relationship between brushing teeth after lunch and the number of cavities. However, this does not necessarily imply causation. The statement \"brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities\" cannot be universally justified based solely on correlation because there could be other factors involved or variables that were not controlled in the study. Without further evidence, such as a randomized controlled trial that can account for confounding variables, it would be inappropriate to conclude that brushing teeth after lunch directly prevents cavities. Therefore, no matter how many participants were studied, without additional proof of causality, the statement is not justified."
