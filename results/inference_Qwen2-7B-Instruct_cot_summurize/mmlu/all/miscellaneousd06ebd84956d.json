Apply a small amount of nail polish remover to a clean cloth and gently blot the stain. Avoid rubbing the stain, as this can spread the ink further into the fabric. After treating the stain, wash the item according to its care instructions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that ink stains can be stubborn and may not come out completely with just one treatment. You might need to repeat the process several times or try other stain removal methods if the nail polish remover does not work effectively. Additionally, test any treatment on an inconspicuous area of the fabric first to ensure it doesn't damage or discolor the material."
