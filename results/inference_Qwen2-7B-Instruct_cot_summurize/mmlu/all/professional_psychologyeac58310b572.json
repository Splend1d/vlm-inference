Inviting the wife into therapy without her full understanding or explicit consent could potentially lead to feelings of pressure or obligation, especially given the context of a marital relationship where power dynamics might play a role. This could undermine her autonomy and lead to decisions made out of necessity rather than genuine desire for help.\n\nIt's important to ensure that any participation in therapy is voluntary and fully informed by all parties involved. The therapist should also consider the potential impact of involving one partner in therapy without the other, which could include issues like bias, fairness, and the risk of causing further distress or unintended consequences within the relationship. Therefore, it's crucial to obtain clear, informed consent from both partners before proceeding with joint therapy sessions."
