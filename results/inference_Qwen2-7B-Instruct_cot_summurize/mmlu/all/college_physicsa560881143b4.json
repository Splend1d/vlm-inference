This means each electron must have a unique combination of properties such as its spin, energy level, and orbital. \n\nIn the case of helium, when both electrons have parallel spins (forming an 'ortho' state, they adhere to the Pauli exclusion principle more strictly compared to when their spins are antiparallel ('para' state). This strict adherence to the exclusion principle in the 'ortho' state results in a lower overall energy for the system, hence making it energetically favorable."
