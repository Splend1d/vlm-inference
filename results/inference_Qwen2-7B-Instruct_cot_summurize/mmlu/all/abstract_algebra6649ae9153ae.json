A polynomial \\(f(x)\\) over a field \\(F\\) is considered irreducible if it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials with coefficients in \\(F\\).\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate \\(f(x) = x^3 + cx^2 + 1\\) for each choice of \\(c\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\)\n\nWe will evaluate \\(f(x)\\) at each possible value of \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(0, 1, 2\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\)) and check if the resulting polynomial has any roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\n#### For \\(c = 0\\):\n\\[f(x) = x^3 + 1\\]\n\nChecking for roots:\n- \\(f(0) = 1\\)\n- \\(f(1) = 1^3 + 1 = 2\\)\n- \\(f(2) = 2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\)\n\nSince \\(f(2) = 0\\), \\(x^3 + 1\\) is not irreducible when \\(c = 0\\), because it has a root in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\n#### For \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 1\\]\n\nChecking for roots:\n- \\(f(0) = 1\\)\n- \\(f(1) = 1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\)\n- \\(f(2) = 2^3 + 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\)\n\nSince \\(f(1) = 0\\), \\(x^3 + x^2 + 1\\) is not irreducible when \\(c = 1\\), because it has a root in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\n#### For \\(c = 2\\):\n\\[f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 1\\]\n\nChecking for roots:\n- \\(f(0) = 1\\)\n- \\(f(1) = 1^3 + 2\\cdot1^2 + 1 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\)\n- \\(f(2) = 2^3 + 2\\cdot2^2 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\\)\n\nSince there are are no roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), \\(x^3 + 2x^2 + 1\\) might be irreducible. To confirm, we would typically use more advanced techniques like Eisenstein's criterion or directly test for factors, but given the context and simplicity, we can hypothesize based on the lack of obvious roots.\n\n#### For \\(c = 3\\), which is equivalent to \\(c = 0\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\):\nAs previously determined, this case does not yield an irreducible polynomial due to having a root at \\(x = 2\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the evaluation above, only when \\(c = 2\\), does the polynomial \\(x^3 + cx^2 + 1\\) potentially not have any roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), suggesting it could be irreducible. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. 2**."
