The frictional force \\(F_f\\) acting up the slope is given by \\(F_f = \\mu N = \\mu mg \\cos \\theta\\).\n\nThe net force \\(F_{\\text{net}}\\) acting down the slope is the difference between the gravitational force down the slope and the frictional force: \\(F_{\\text{net}} = F_{\\text{down-slope}} - F_f = mg \\sin \\theta - \\mu mg \\cos \\theta\\).\n\nAccording to Newton's second law, \\(F = ma \\), so the acceleration \\(a\\) can be found by dividing the net force by the mass \\(m\\): \\(a = \\frac{F_{\\text{net}} }{ m } = \\frac{ mg \\sin \\theta - \\mu mg \\cos \\theta }{ m } = g (\\sin \\theta - \\mu \\cos \\theta)\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \\(a = g (\\cos \\theta - \\mu \\sin \\theta)\\)."
