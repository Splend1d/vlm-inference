                    "text": "A consumer purchased a new station wagon from a car dealer. The car dealer performed a thorough inspection of the station wagon before the sale was completed. One evening, the consumer was driving along a city street when he saw the traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, he quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed because of a defect in the brake mechanism. The consumer then swerved to avoid hitting a bus that was crossing the intersection at a right angle to him. As a result of the swerve, the consumer's car rode up on the sidewalk and overturned, pinning a pedestrian. Both the consumer and the pedestrian were severely injured. If the consumer asserts a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability in tort, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car.\nB. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\nC. No, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up.\nD. No, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it.\n"

Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\n\nUnder the doctrine of strict liability in tort, a manufacturer or seller can be held liable for injuries caused by a defective product, even if they had no negligence or fault in the production or sale of the product. In this case, the failure of the brake mechanism would likely be considered a manufacturing defect if the issue was present when the car was sold to the consumer. Therefore, the consumer might prevail in their claim against the car dealer, assuming all other legal requirements for a strict liability claim are met, such as proof of the defect causing the harm and that the consumer used the product as intended."
