This is because the monopolist will choose its optimal output level to maximize profits. The price (P) charged by the monopolist will be higher than the marginal cost due to the lack of competition, which allows the firm to charge a premium. The average total cost (ATC) at this level of output will equal the marginal cost (MC, as the firm will operate efficiently at this scale. However, it's important to note that the price (P) will still be greater than the average total cost (ATC), reflecting the profit-maximizing nature of the monopoly."
