It would have involved compromising opposition to slavery\n\nLincoln opposed the southward expansion of the United States because he was strongly opposed to the expansion of slavery. He believed that slavery was morally wrong and that it should not be allowed to spread into new territories as the country expanded westward. Lincoln's stance on this issue was a major factor in the secession of several southern states and ultimately led to the American Civil War."
