At trial the prosecution offered evidence that the man was convicted of two prior sexual assault charges against two other women, both occurring about two years earlier. The allegations and the man's modus operandi in those convictions were almost identical to the instant case. Defense counsel objected to the evidence on the basis that its highly prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. Based on the Federal Rules of Evidence, what will the court most likely rule regarding this issue?\n\nA. The evidence is too prejudicial and must be excluded.\nB. The evidence is inadmissible because it is not relevant to the present charges and has a low probative value.\nC. The evidence is admissible because present public policy strongly favors the apprehension and prosecution of sexual predators.\nD. The evidence is admissible due to the factual similarity with the present charge, which gives the evidence strong probative value.\n"

The evidence is admissible due to the factual similarity with the present charge, which gives the evidence strong probative value.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 404(b) allows for the admission of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts if they are offered to prove something other than the defendant's character ( such as motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. In this scenario, the prosecution may argue that the evidence is relevant to show a pattern of behavior or modus operandi, which could help establish the defendant's guilt in the current case. \n\nThe defense's objection based on the potential for prejudicial effect would typically require balancing under Rule 403, which states that even if relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. However, in cases involving sexual assault, where the nature of the crime often involves significant emotional and moral considerations, courts may be more inclined to admit such evidence if it is deemed highly probative and relevant.\n\nTherefore, the court is most likely to rule that the evidence is admissible due to its strong probative value related to the factual similarity with the present charge, despite the potential for prejudice."
