This is due to the fact that the area of a triangle is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\), and in a right-angled triangle, both the base and height can be considered as sides of the triangle.\n\nSince \\(O\\) is the center of the circle and \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are points on its circumference, \\(OA = OB = 1\\) ( (the radius of the circle). Therefore, \\(\\triangle OAB\\) becomes an isosceles right triangle (or a 45-45-90 triangle) with \\(OA = OB = 1\\).\n\nThe area of such a triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nIn this case, since \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) are perpendicular and equal, they both serve as the base and height:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible area of a triangular region with one vertex at the center of a circle of radius 1 and the other two vertices on the circle is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **A. 1/2**."
