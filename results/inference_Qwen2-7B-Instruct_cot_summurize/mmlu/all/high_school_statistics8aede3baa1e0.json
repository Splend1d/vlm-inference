                    "text": "To find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles, we can use the properties of the normal distribution.\n\nFirst, let's standardize the values by calculating the z-scores for both 100,000 miles and 80,000 miles.\n\nThe formula for the z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the value from the dataset, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the dataset, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFor 100,000 miles:\n\\[ z_{100,000} = \\frac{(100,000 - 75,000)}{12,000} = \\frac{25,000}{12,000} = 2.083 \\]\n\nFor 80,000 miles:\n\\[ z_{80,000} = \\frac{(80,000 - 75,000)}{12,000} = \\frac{5,000}{12,000} = 0.417 \\]\n\nWe want to find the probability that a cab driven over 80,000 miles ( is driven less than 100,000 miles. This means we need to find the probability that a cab driven more than 80,000 miles is driven less than 100,000 miles.\n\nSince we're looking at the portion of the distribution above 80,000 miles, we consider the z-score for 100,000 miles as the boundary. We're interested in the area under the curve to the left of this z-score within the range of interest (i.e., from \\(z = 0.417\\) to \\(z = 2.083\\).\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n\n- The probability of being below \\(z = 2.083\\) is approximately 0.9812.\n- The probability of being below \\(z = 0.417\\) is approximately 0.6617.\n\nThe probability we seek is the difference between these two probabilities, which represents the area under the curve between \\(z = 0.417\\) and \\(z = 2.083\\). This gives us:\n\n\\[ P(0.417 < Z < 2.083) = P(Z < 2.083) - P(Z < 0.417) \\]\n\\[ P(0.417 < Z < 2.083) = 0.9812 - 0.6617 \\]\n\\[ P(0.417 < Z < 2.083) = 0.3195 \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice to 0.3195 is:\n\nB. 0.34"
