The ID3 algorithm constructs a decision tree by selecting the attribute that provides the highest information gain at each step. However, this greedy approach does not guarantee an optimal tree; it only aims to maximize the information gain at each split. There might be other splits that could lead to a better overall tree structure.\n\n**Statement 2**: Consider a continuous probability distribution with density \\(f()\\), that is nonzero everywhere. The probability of a value \\(x\\) is equal to \\(f(x)\\).\n\nThis statement is **False**. In a continuous probability distribution, the probability of a specific value \\(x\\) occurring is actually zero because there are infinitely many possible values in any interval. Instead, probabilities are calculated over intervals or ranges using the integral of the probability density function \\(f(x)\\) over that range. Thus, the probability of \\(x\\) is given by \\(\\int_{x} f(t) dt\\), which represents the area under the curve from some lower limit to \\(x\\), not simply \\(f(x)\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. False, False**."
