As the hiker came around a bend in the trail, he suddenly saw a hunter standing next to the trail, looking in the other direction. The hunter was holding a rifle. The hunter turned, causing the rifle to be pointed at the hiker. The hiker felt sure that he was going to get shot, but the gun did not go off. The hiker asserts a claim for assault against the hunter. In his action, the most likely result is that the hiker will\n\nA. recover, because the hunter's rifle was pointed directly at him.\nB. recover, because the hunter's decision to carry the gun was voluntary.\nC. not recover, unless the hunter intended to scare the hiker.\nD. not recover, if the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker.\n"

For a successful claim of assault, it must be shown that the defendant intended to cause fear in the plaintiff and that the plaintiff was indeed put in fear as a result of the defendant's actions. \n\nIn this scenario, since the gun did not go off and there's no indication that the hunter intended to shoot the hiker, the hiker would likely not recover damages for assault. The fact that the rifle was pointed at the hiker does not necessarily mean that an assault occurred if the hunter had no intention to use the weapon against the hiker."
