Assuming the correct value for \\( E(X) \\) is indeed 312, and considering \\( E(Y) \\) is not directly given but can be inferred as the second value mentioned (307, we calculate:\n\n\\[ E(X + Y) = 312 + 307 = 619 \\]\n\nFor the variance of the sum of two independent random variables, the formula is:\n\n\\[ Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) \\]\n\nGiven \\( Var(X) = 6 \\) and \\( Var(Y) = 8 \\), then:\n\n\\[ Var(X + Y) = 6 + 8 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
