These disorders cause a loss of recall of learned information = anterograde amnesia.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it oversimplifies the nature of amnesic disorders. While anterograde amnesia specifically refers to the inability to form new memories after the onset of the disorder, amnesic disorders can also involve retrograde amnesia (where the individual cannot recall events or information before the onset of the condition), or both types of amnesia simultaneously. Additionally, the term \"anterograde amnesia\" does not encompass all possible symptoms or types of memory impairment that may occur in amnesic disorders."
