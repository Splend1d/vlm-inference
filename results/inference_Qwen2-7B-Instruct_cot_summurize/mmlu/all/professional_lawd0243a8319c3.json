The man's friend is the owner of parcel \"B,\" which is situated lower than \"A\" on the mountainside. The man's cousin owns parcel \"C,\" which lies below parcels \"A\" and \"B\" on the mountain slope. In 2000, the man who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the man sold parcel \"B\" to his friend. The following year, the cousin purchased parcel \"C\" from the man. The deeds to the friend and the cousin did not contain any mention of the man's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. From the standpoint of the friend and the cousin, thedrainage system would most likely be defined as a(an)\n\nA. easement appurtenant.\nB. easement by implication.\nC. prescriptive easement.\nD. express easement.\n"

In this case, the drainage system allows the use of the land of parcels B and C for the purpose of draining sewage water. Since the system was constructed by the original owner and extends across all three parcels, it is likely that it was intended to benefit all three properties. Therefore, from the standpoint of the friend (owner of parcel B and cousin who owns parcel C, the drainage system would most likely be considered an easement appurtenant.\n\nOption B, easement by implication, might also seem plausible, but in this scenario, there is no evidence that the existence of the drainage system was necessary or implied when the parcels B and C were sold. The lack of mention in the deeds further supports the argument against an easement by implication.\n\nOptions C, prescriptive easement, and D, express easement, do not fit the context here. A prescriptive easement requires continuous, open, notorious, and uninterrupted use over someone else's property for a statutory period, without permission. There is no indication that such conditions were met in this scenario. An express easement, on the other hand, would typically be explicitly stated in a written agreement or deed, which does not appear to be the case based on the information provided."
