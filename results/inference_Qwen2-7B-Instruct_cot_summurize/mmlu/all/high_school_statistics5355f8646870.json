This study was an experiment in which the subjects were used as their own controls.\n\nThis is a correct statement because the study involves manipulating the variable (consumption of alcohol or not, and observing the effect on the outcome (reaction time. Moreover, by measuring the reaction times both before and after consuming the alcohol, each subject acts as their own control, allowing for a direct comparison within the same individual. \n\nA. This statement is incorrect because the study involves manipulation of variables and comparison of outcomes, characteristics of experimental studies rather than observational studies.\n\nB. Lack of blocking might be considered a criticism of the study design, but it's not necessarily a flaw that makes the study poorly designed. Blocking would involve grouping similar subjects together to control for variability. In this case, random selection might have already controlled for many potential confounding variables.\n\nC. The placebo effect could still be relevant even in this type of study. If subjects expect that consuming alcohol will affect their reaction times, they might behave differently (either consciously or unconsciously) when consuming alcohol compared to when they're not, potentially affecting the results."
