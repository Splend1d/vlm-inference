He felt that the Crown needed to control trade and raise revenue.\nB. He felt that the colonists should help pay the debt incurred by the war.\nC. He felt that Parliament had the right to increase taxes on the colonies.\nD. He wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of \"salutary neglect.\"\n"

                    "text": "D. He wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of \"salutary neglect.\"\n\nThe excerpt reflects the views of the British government after the French and Indian War, emphasizing the need to establish revenue measures, improve navigation and commerce, and secure the defense and protection of the American colonies. It indicates a desire to tax the colonies to cover the costs associated with maintaining these territories.\n\nOption D contradicts the sentiments expressed in the excerpt. \"Salutary neglect\" was a policy that allowed the colonies considerable autonomy and minimal interference from Britain during the 18th century. This period saw relatively low taxation on the colonies compared to what they would experience later in the century. The passage suggests a shift towards more direct involvement and fiscal responsibility from the British crown to the colonies, not the opposite."
