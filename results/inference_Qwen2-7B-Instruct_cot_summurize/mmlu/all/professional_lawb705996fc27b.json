                    "text": "A national distributor of windows selected a retailer to sell its windows in a specified geographic area. The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor \"only when expressly accepted by the distributor.\" For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.\nB. No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.\nC. Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.\nD. Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.\n"

The course of dealing between the distributor and the retailer, where the distributor consistently filled the retailer's orders without exception, can create a binding custom or understanding between the parties. This means that even though the written contract states that orders must be \"expressly accepted\" by the distributor, the consistent past behavior of the distributor may imply a duty to accept and fulfill orders placed by the retailer, despite the formal wording of the contract. Therefore, if the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, it is likely to prevail based on the established course of dealing."
