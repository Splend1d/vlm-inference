Depreciation.\n\nIn the indirect method of preparing a statement of cash flows, adjustments are made to net income to reconcile it to net cash provided by operating activities. One of these adjustments involves adding back non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, because these items reduce net income but do not involve an actual outflow of cash. \n\nA. Purchase of equipment is a cash outflow related to investing activities, not operating activities.\nB. Payment on long-term debt is typically classified under financing activities, not operating activities.\nD. Decrease in accounts payable is usually added back to net income when calculating cash flow from operating activities, as it represents a source of cash that has not yet been recorded as an expense in the income statement. However, it's not typically listed as an adjustment to add back along with depreciation, which is more commonly mentioned in this context."
