If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then siblings reared together are more likely to share it than are identical or fraternal twins who are reared apart.\nC.

If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then identical twins are more likely to share this attribute than are fraternal twins and other siblings.\n\nThis statement correctly reflects the concept that identical (or monozygotic, MZ) twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal (or dizygotic, DZ) twins share approximately 50% of their segregating genes, similar to any siblings. Therefore, if a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, identical twins would be expected to show higher similarity for that trait compared to fraternal twins and non-twin siblings."
