This theory suggests that Homo erectus migrated to Flores and adapted to a smaller body size over time due to the island's insular environment, a phenomenon known as island dwarfism. However, it's important to note that this relationship is still debated among scientists, with other theories suggesting it could be a separate species or an extinct lineage of Homo."
