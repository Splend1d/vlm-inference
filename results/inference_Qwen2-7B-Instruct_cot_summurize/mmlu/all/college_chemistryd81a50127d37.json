These metals typically have at least two stable oxidation states. The group of metals you listed in option A ( Copper (Cu, Iron Fe, Cobalt Co, all fit this description. For example, copper can exist in oxidation states +1 and +2, iron can exist in +2 and +3, and cobalt can exist in +2 and +3.\n\nOn the other hand, the metals in options B, C, and D do not typically exhibit more than one stable oxidation state:\n\n- Zinc (Zn usually exists in +2.\n- Calcium Ca usually exists in +2.\n- Gallium Ga usually exists in +3.\n- Strontium Sr usually exists in +2.\n- Magnesium Mg usually exists in +2.\n- Gallium Ga usually exists in +3.\n- Sodium Na usually exists in +1.\n- Barium Ba usually exists in +2.\n- Aluminum Al usually exists in +3.\n\nTherefore, only the metals from option A can potentially be found at the active site of redox enzymes based on their ability to exhibit multiple oxidation states."
