Social constructivism employs theories of causality in the study of international relations, in addition to prioritizing the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. In contrast, realism regards state of actor behavior in the international system to follow an 'action-response' pattern.\n\nLet's break down why this is the right choice and why the other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option A** correctly distinguishes between the two theories. Social constructivism indeed places significant emphasis on causality, examining how social interactions, norms, and ideas shape identities and thus influence state behavior. Realism, on the other hand, focuses more on the anarchic nature of the international system and the pursuit of power, security, and survival, with state behavior seen as a response to the distribution of power and the threat posed by other states.\n\n- **Option B** is incorrect because realism does not consider identity as a crucial point for consideration in international relations. Realism tends to focus on material capabilities and interests rather than on identity.\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect because it suggests that realism relies on theories of identity based on intersubjective meanings, while realism actually emphasizes material power and the distribution of capabilities, not identity formation.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect because it misrepresents both theories. Social constructivism does not view states as \"independent units\" shaped solely by their interaction with the international system; instead, it posits that states are actively construct and negotiate their identities through discourse and social interactions. Realists do not necessarily see state interaction as the natural progression of identity formulation; rather, they see states acting based on their self-interests within a competitive international system."
