Not independent and, therefore, may not issue a compilation report.\n\nIn a compilation engagement, the accountant is engaged to compile information provided by the client into a financial statement format, but does not provide any assurance on the information presented. For a nonissuer, if an accountant has an immaterial direct financial interest in the entity, this could still potentially impair their objectivity and independence, especially since the financial statements might influence the financial interest of the accountant.\n\nThe AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS) state that an accountant who has a direct financial interest in the entity being reported on should not issue a compilation or review report. This is because such an interest could create a conflict of interest, affecting the accountant's objectivity, and thus, the integrity of the financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the accountant in this scenario would not be able to issue a compilation report due to the potential impairment of independence, even though the financial interest is immaterial."
