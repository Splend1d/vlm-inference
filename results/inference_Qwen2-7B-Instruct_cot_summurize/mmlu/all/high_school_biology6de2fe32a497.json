For example, skeletal muscle cells convert pyruvate into lactic acid when no oxygen is present. Yeast cells can produce alcohol and carbon dioxide under the same circumstances. However, regardless of the specific reactions, the purpose of glycolysis is an important one. Which statement best describes the importance of glycolysis?\n\nA. It produces large amounts of ATP by substrate level phosphorylation.\nB. It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue.\nC. It produces pyruvate, which is the raw material for oxidative phosphorylation.\nD. It occurs in the cytoplasm.\n"

It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue.\n\nGlycolysis is a crucial metabolic pathway because it allows cells to generate energy in the form of ATP from glucose even in the absence of oxygen. The process involves the conversion of one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, with the production of a net yield of 2 ATP molecules (plus 2 additional ATPs derived from the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate). However, during glycolysis, many NADH molecules are produced. Since glycolysis cannot produce enough ATP to re-oxidize all these NADH back to NAD+, the excess NADH needs to be reoxidized before glycolysis can continue. This is typically done through the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) or the pentose phosphate pathway, depending on the cell's energy requirements and the presence of oxygen. Thus, reoxidizing NADH allows glycolysis to proceed continuously, ensuring a steady supply of ATP."
