This action could cause serious harm or even death to your mother-in-law, which goes against the principle of not causing harm to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wiping the doors when your grandparents are sleeping might be considered disrespectful or inconsiderate since it involves some form of interference with their personal space and potentially waking them up without a reason. However, if no damage was caused and the intention was not malicious, it could be argued that this action is not necessarily morally wrong, though it could still be seen as rude or thoughtless. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong."
