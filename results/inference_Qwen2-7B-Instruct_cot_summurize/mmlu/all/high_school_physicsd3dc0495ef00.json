                    "text": "The rate of change of kinetic energy is related to the power dissipated in the system, which can also be described by the work-energy theorem and Newton's second law.\n\nThe kinetic energy \\( K \\) of an object with mass \\( m \\) moving at velocity \\( v \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nGiven that the kinetic energy is changing at a rate of -6.0 J/s ( and the velocity \\( v \\) is 3.0 m/s, we can find the mass \\( m \\) using the derivative of kinetic energy with respect to time, which represents the power or rate of change of kinetic energy:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dK}{dt} = -6.0 \\text{ J/s} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\right) = -6.0 \\text{ J/s} \\]\n\nDifferentiating the kinetic energy equation with respect to time:\n\n\\[ mv\\frac{dv}{dt} = -6.0 \\]\n\nGiven \\( v = 3.0 \\text{ m/s} \\), we have:\n\n\\[ m \\cdot 3.0 \\cdot \\frac{dv}{dt} = -6.0 \\]\n\nNow we need to solve for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{-6.0}{3.0 \\cdot m} \\]\n\nWe know that \\( \\frac{dv}{dt} \\) is actually the acceleration \\( a \\). We can rearrange the above equation to solve for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{-6.0}{3.0 \\cdot a} \\]\n\nHowever, without knowing the actual value of \\( a \\), we cannot directly solve for \\( m \\). But, we do not need to find the mass \\( m \\) to determine the force. The force \\( F \\) acting on the particle can be found using Newton's second law, \\( F = ma \\), where \\( a \\) is the acceleration.\n\nSince we are given the rate of change of kinetic energy ( \\( \\frac{dK}{dt} = -6.0 \\text{ J/s} \\) and the velocity \\( v = 3.0 \\text{ m/s} \\), we can use the relationship between power, kinetic energy, and velocity:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{dK}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2}mv\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\frac{dv}{dt} \\]\n\nGiven \\( \\frac{dK}{dt} = -6.0 \\text{ J/s} \\), we substitute \\( v = 3.0 \\text{ m/s} \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ -6.0 = \\frac{1}{2}m(3.0^2\\frac{dv}{dt} \\]\n\nWe don't have \\( \\frac{dv}{dt} \\) yet, but since it's the acceleration, we can use the given \\( \\frac{dK}{dt} \\) to relate it back to force:\n\n\\[ -6.0 = \\frac{1}{2}ma^2 \\]\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = \\sqrt{\\frac{-6.0 \\times 2}{m}} \\]\n\nHowever, we're interested in finding the force \\( F \\), not the acceleration \\( a \\). Recall that \\( F = ma \\).\n\nWe can express the force as:\n\n\\[ F = m\\sqrt{\\frac{-6.0 \\times 2}{m}} \\]\n\nTo simplify, let's assume the negative sign is just indicating direction rather than a mathematical operation, since forces and energies are positive quantities. We'll proceed under this assumption:\n\n\\[ F = m\\sqrt{\\frac{6.0 \\times 2}{m}} \\]\n\n\\[ F = \\sqrt{2 \\times (-6.0) \\times m^2} \\]\n\n\\[ F = \\sqrt{2 \\times 6.0 \\times m^2} \\]\n\nBut we don't have \\( m \\), so we can't calculate the exact value of \\( F \\) from the information provided. However, the correct answer should be derived from the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. Since we have the rate of change of kinetic energy, we can relate it to the power being exerted by the force:\n\n\\[ P = Fv \\]\n\nGiven \\( P = -6.0 \\text{ J/s} \\) and \\( v = 3.0 \\text{ m/s} \\):\n\n\\[ -6.0 = F \\times 3.0 \\]\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{-6.0}{3.0} \\]\n\n\\[ F = -2.0 \\text{ N} \\]\n\nThe magnitude"
