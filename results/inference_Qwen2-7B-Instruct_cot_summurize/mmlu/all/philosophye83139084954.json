This concept implies that participants in the original position are making decisions without knowing their place in society\u2014whether they will be rich or poor, powerful or powerless, etc.\n\nThe reason Rawls gives for why parties would not choose utilitarianism is encapsulated in option D: they would be behind the veil of ignorance. Under this condition, individuals do not know their future social status, capabilities, or life circumstances. This anonymity and equal consideration of interests lead to a set of principles that protect the least advantaged members of society, aiming for a just society where everyone's basic liberties are are protected. Utilitarianism, however, focuses on maximizing overall happiness, potentially at the expense of the worst-off, which goes against the fairness and equality Rawls advocates for in his theory.\n\nTherefore, while all the options you've provided have some relevance to Rawlsian thought, option D is the most accurate in terms of aligning with Rawls' argument against utilitarianism within the context of the original position."
