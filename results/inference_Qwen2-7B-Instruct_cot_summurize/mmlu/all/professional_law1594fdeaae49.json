Immediately after the accident, the man ran over to the woman and said, \"I know I was driving fast, but you weren't paying attention where you were walking. Anyhow, I'm willing to pay all your medical expenses. \"At trial, the woman calls an eyewitness to the accident. The eyewitness proposes to testify that he heard the man tell the woman, \"I know I was driving fast. \" The man's attorney objects. If the eyewitness's testimony is admitted, it will most likely be because the proffered evidence is\n\nA. admissible as an opinion.\nB. admissible as an admission.\nC. admissible as a present sense impression.\nD. admissible as a declaration against interest.\n"

This is because admissions can provide strong evidence of a party's state of mind or intent, and they can help establish facts that support the case being presented. The fact that the statement was made immediately after the incident and directly to the victim also supports its admissibility under the doctrine of immediate declarations.\n\nOption A ( \"admissible as an opinion\" does not apply here, as opinions are not generally admissible unless they fall within certain exceptions, and this statement is not an opinion about a matter of fact.\n\nOption C \"admissible as a present sense impression\" usually refers to statements made by a person while perceiving a situation that reflects their current awareness of events. While the man's statement could reflect his awareness at the time, it is more appropriately classified as an admission rather than a present sense impression.\n\nOption D \"admissible as a declaration against interest\" might apply if the statement were self-incriminating or harmful to the declarant's interests, but it does not specifically capture the context or nature of the statement as effectively as \"admission\" does in this scenario."
