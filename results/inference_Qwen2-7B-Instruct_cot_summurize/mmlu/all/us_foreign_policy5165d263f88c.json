Roosevelt's early stance on foreign policy was largely influenced by the Great Depression, which was taking a heavy toll on the American economy. He focused on domestic issues and believed that addressing the economic hardships at home was more pressing than engaging in international conflicts or negotiations. This is often referred to as \"isolationism,\" which generally means avoiding involvement in foreign wars and conflicts. However, it's important to note that Roosevelt's views evolved over time, particularly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, which led him to support the U.S. entering World War II."
