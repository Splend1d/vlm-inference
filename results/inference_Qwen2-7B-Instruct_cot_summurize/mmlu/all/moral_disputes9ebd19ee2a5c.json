Velleman argues that euthanasia can be justified from a consequentialist perspective. A consequentialist approach to ethics suggests that an action is morally right if it leads to the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In the context of euthanasia, this could mean that ending someone's suffering ( even if that person cannot consent to it - could be considered a morally justifiable act because it prevents further harm and suffering. However, it's important to note that different philosophers might have different views on this topic based on their own ethical theories."
