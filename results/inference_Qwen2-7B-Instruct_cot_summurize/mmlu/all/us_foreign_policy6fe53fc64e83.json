This involved acquiring new land through treaties, wars, and purchases like the Louisiana Purchase and the Gadsden Purchase.\n\nPost-1865, the U.S. continued to expand economically and politically, but it shifted its focus from territorial growth to market expansion. This period saw the U.S. engage more actively in international trade and investment, particularly in Europe and Asia. The U.S. also began to assert its influence in the Pacific region, leading to the establishment of overseas territories such as Hawaii and Puerto Rico. \n\nThis shift in focus from territory to markets reflects a broader trend in global history towards economic imperialism and the creation of global economic systems."
