Evolved into a more sophisticated technology.\n\nDuring the Paleolithic era, specifically in the Oldowan and Acheulian tool cultures, hand axe technology underwent significant development. Initially, these early stone tools were simple, crude, and mass-produced with minimal skill required for their creation. However, over time, the techniques and sophistication of these tools improved. Hand axes became more symmetrical, balanced, and precisely crafted, indicating a gradual evolution in human cognitive abilities and manual dexterity.\n\nHand axes were not just functional tools; they also served as indicators of the technological and cultural advancements of early humans. The transition from earlier, simpler tools-making techniques to the more refined hand axe production suggests an evolutionary progression in human societies. This period laid the groundwork for further technological innovations and the development of more complex stone tools technologies, such as the Levallois technique and blade technologies."
