                    "text": "According to John Stuart Mill's principles on free speech, particularly as articulated in his essay \"On Liberty,\" the act of censoring speech that is possibly true involves a complex balance between individual rights and societal well-being. Let's analyze each option in light of Mill's philosophy:\n\nA. **Violates human dignity.** This statement aligns with Mill's view that censorship undermines the autonomy and self-respect of individuals. By suppressing potentially truthful speech, society deprives people of the right to express their thoughts freely, which is a fundamental aspect of human dignity.\n\nB. **Fails a prima facie duty of honesty.** While this statement might seem intuitively correct, it does not directly capture Mill's perspective. Mill argues that the truth must be sought through open discussion and debate, not necessarily by avoiding speech that could potentially challenge prevailing views or expose errors. Thus, censoring speech for fear of dishonesty does not necessarily fail a \"prima facie\" duty of honesty in the Millian sense.\n\nC. **Is tantamount to asserting that you are infallible.** This statement resonates with Mill's argument that censorship often arises from a belief in the infallibility of certain opinions or authorities. By suppressing differing viewpoints, those who do so assert that they have absolute knowledge or that their views are beyond question, which contradicts the spirit of inquiry and skepticism that Mill advocates.\n\nD. **Is a risk worth taking if the speech is dangerous enough.** This statement touches upon a nuanced aspect of Mill's thought. Mill acknowledges that there can be circumstances where restrictions on speech might be justified, such as when speech incites violence or poses an immediate threat to public safety. However, he also argues that such restrictions should be the exception rather than the rule, and that the default position should be one of openness and free exchange of ideas. Thus, while there might be situations where censorship can be seen as a risk worth taking, it should not be a blanket policy but rather an exception based on clear criteria.\n\nIn summary, while options A and C directly align with Mill's critique of censorship, option D captures a specific case under which Mill would consider limitations on free speech acceptable, albeit reluctantly. Option B does not directly fit into Mill's framework regarding censorship and free speech."
