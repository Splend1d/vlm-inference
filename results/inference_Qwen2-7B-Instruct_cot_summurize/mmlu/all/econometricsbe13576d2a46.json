Biased and inconsistent coefficient estimates\n\nIncluding relevant lagged values of the dependent variable in a regression model typically leads to issues with autocorrelation, especially if there is feedback (i.e., the dependent variable influences its own past values. This can result in biased and inconsistent coefficient estimates. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator loses its efficiency and might also be biased due to the violation of the assumption of no autocorrelation. To address this issue, one might need to use models that account for time-series characteristics, such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA models or models with Generalized Method of Moments estimation techniques that allow for more complex dynamics in the data."
