This is because experiments allow researchers to manipulate one variable (the independent variable - and observe the effect on another variable, the dependent variable. By controlling other potential influencing factors, or confounding variables, through random assignment, experimental designs can more reliably infer causality.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are not as useful for establishing cause-and-effect relationships:\n\nA. A complete census provides a snapshot of all members of a population at a specific time, but it does not necessarily establish cause-and-effect relationships between variables.\n\nB. A least squares regression line showing high correlation indicates that there is a strong linear relationship between two variables, but correlation does not imply causation. Other factors could contribute to this relationship, or it could be coincidental.\n\nC. A simple random sample (SRS) helps ensure that the sample is representative of the population, but it doesn't establish cause-and-effect relationships. SRS is used to make statistical inferences about the population based on the sample data, but it doesn't control for external factors that might influence the results."
