Pete is incensed because it will probably take years to use up the inventory of so many toilets and seeks your advice. The best advice is\n\nA. Bill can bind the partnership by his act.\nB. silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership.\nC. unless his name is in the partnership name, third persons are \"on notice\" that he is unauthorized to contract for the partnership.\nD. Bill, as a silent partner, is not authorized to purchase and, therefore, the sale may be set aside.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. Bill can bind the partnership by his act.\n\nUnder the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA), a silent partner (also known as a dormant partner) typically has the authority to bind the partnership in transactions related to the partnership's business, provided those transactions are within the ordinary course of the partnership's business. This is because silent partners, despite their lack of involvement in the day-to-day management, are considered to have contributed capital and thus have an interest in the partnership's profits and losses.\n\nIn this case, since Bill is a silent partner and he purchased 100 toilets for the partnership's business, which is presumably within the scope of plumbing services, his act could be binding on the partnership. However, it's important to note that the specifics might vary depending on the partnership agreement, local laws, and other factors.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect based on the standard principles of partnership law. Option B suggests that silent partners cannot bind the partnership, which is not accurate according to partnership law. Option C refers to a legal concept of notice to third parties, but it does not specifically address whether a silent partner can bind the partnership. Option D incorrectly states that a silent partner is not authorized to make such a purchase, which contradicts the principle that silent partners generally can bind the partnership under certain conditions."
