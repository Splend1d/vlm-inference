This condition is known as alexia with agraphia. However, none of the provided options exactly match this description. \n\nGiven the options you've provided, the closest answer would be:\n\nB. Alexia without agraphia\n\nThis option doesn't accurately reflect the typical outcome described, but it's the one that comes closest to matching the scenario where only reading difficulties (alexia, occur and writing ability (agraphia) is not mentioned or affected. In reality, alexia with agraphia would be the correct term to use for this condition.\n\nPlease note that the question seems to be missing an option that would correctly describe \"Alexia with agraphia,\" which is the more accurate term for the described neurological condition."
