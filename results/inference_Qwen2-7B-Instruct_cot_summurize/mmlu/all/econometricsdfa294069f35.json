The estimates will converge upon the true values as the sample size increases\n\nConsistency in the context of estimators refers to the property that as the sample size grows indefinitely, the estimator converges in probability towards the true value of the parameter being estimated. This means that with a sufficiently large sample size, the estimator's value will get arbitrarily close to the true parameter value.\n\nTo clarify why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. While consistency implies that the estimator's expected value approaches the true parameter value as the sample size grows, it does not necessarily mean that on average, the estimated coefficients will equal the true values for any given sample size. This is because consistency pertains to the behavior of the estimator as the sample size approaches infinity, not just its average behavior over many samples.\n\nB. Unbiasedness ensures that the expected value of the estimator equals the true parameter value ( on average across all possible samples. However, while an unbiased estimator can be consistent, consistency does not guarantee that no other unbiased estimator has a smaller variance. In fact, there may exist biased estimators with lower variance than any consistent unbiased estimator.\n\nD. This statement is not accurate because it suggests that the estimator will be as close to its true value as possible regardless of sample size, which contradicts the definition of consistency. Consistency specifically refers to the estimator's performance as the sample size increases without bound, not its behavior in finite samples."
