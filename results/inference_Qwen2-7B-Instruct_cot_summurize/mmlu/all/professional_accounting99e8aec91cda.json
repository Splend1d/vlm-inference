So, there's no additional expense for this employee for the current year. However, this amount ($1200) would be considered a liability if the company hasn't paid out the vacation days yet.\n\nFor the employee earning $800 per week:\n- 2 weeks of vacation = $800 * 2 = $1600\nSince this employee did not take any vacation during the year, Elan has not recognized any expense for their vacation time yet. However, this amount ($1600) is considered a liability because the company will have to pay this amount in the future when the employee takes their vacation.\n\nSo, the total liability for vacation is $1200 + $1600 = $2800.\nThe total expense for vacation is just the amount already recognized for the first employee, which is $1200.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $1600 $2800."
