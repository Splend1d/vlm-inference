Social constructivists tend to focus on the population rather than military as an area for study, thus regarding the process of militarization largely in terms of its impact on human security.\nC. Social constructivists assert that the process follows a popular recognition of empirically definable threats; when it is recognized that an issue poses a real and valid threat, it warrants militarization.\nD. In their uniform advocacy of human security and adoption of a human-centric approach to security studies, social constructivists regard militarization as a process that is detrimental to achieving wider security goals and actively encourage the demilitarization of the security system.\n"

By regarding security as a socially constructed concept, constructivists assert that militarization is the result of governmental decisions based on shared values and cultural norms that underpin their conception of what constitutes a security risk. Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways.\n\nExplanation:\nSocial constructivism in security studies emphasizes how ideas, beliefs, and values shape perceptions of security threats and responses to them. This perspective argues that security is not an objective, universally agreed-upon state but rather a product of social interactions, cultural narratives, and power dynamics. Therefore, the process of militarization is seen as a reflection of societal constructs, such as the way states perceive and define their interests, threats, and the appropriate means to respond to those threats.\n\nIn this framework, different governments might identify different issues as security risks based on their own historical experiences, cultural contexts, and the prevailing international environment. For example, one government might prioritize economic stability as a security concern, while another might emphasize territorial integrity or ideological competition. These differing perspectives can lead to distinct policies choices, including varying levels of reliance on military power.\n\nThus, social constructivism accounts for militarization by highlighting the role of social, cultural, and political factors in shaping state behavior and decision-making processes related to security. It suggests that militarization is not an inevitable outcome of objective threats but a consequence of subjective interpretations of those threats within a specific societal context."
