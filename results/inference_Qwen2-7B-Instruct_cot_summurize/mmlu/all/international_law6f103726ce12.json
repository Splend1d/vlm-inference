                    "text": "The concept of proportionality in international law, particularly in the context of self-defense or response to aggression, refers to the appropriateness of the response in terms of the means and intensity of force used by the victim state relative to the aggression faced. This principle ensures that the response does not exceed what is necessary and is not disproportionate to the threat posed.\n\nGiven your options:\n\nA. The victim State may use the same means and intensity of force as the aggressor - This option is too simplistic and does not account for the need for proportionality in terms of necessity and reasonableness.\n\nB. The victim State may use any means to defeat and incapacitate the aggressor - This option suggests unlimited capability to respond, which could potentially lead to excessive force if not guided by the principle of proportionality.\n\nC. The victim State may only use such means and force as it is necessary to defeat the aggressor - This option correctly reflects the principle of proportionality in international law. It implies that the response must be appropriate, necessary, and not excessive in relation to the aggression suffered.\n\nD. The victim State can do nothing without Security Council approval - This option is incorrect because under the UN Charter, a state has the inherent right to self-defense and does not necessarily require Security Council approval to respond to an act of aggression immediately.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer according to the principle of proportionality in international law is **C. The victim State may only use such means and force as it is necessary to defeat the aggressor**."
