Pure price bundling.\n\nPure price bundling refers to the practice of offering two or more products or services together at a single, combined price. This strategy can be particularly effective when the products complement each other well, as it allows customers to purchase multiple items for less than they would cost if bought separately. It's a way to leverage the value that arises from the combination of the products, making the overall offer more attractive to potential buyers.\n\nExamples of pure price bundling include:\n\n1. **Software Suites**: Companies often bundle software applications into suites (like Microsoft Office, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, sold at a lower price than purchasing them individually.\n\n2. **Phone Plans with Devices**: Mobile phone companies frequently offer devices like smartphones or tablets along with their phone plans at a discounted rate.\n\n3. **Gym Memberships with Personal Training Sessions**: Fitness centers may offer gym memberships in conjunction with personal training sessions at a bundled price.\n\n4. **Travel Packages**: Airlines and hotels may offer vacation packages where the flight and accommodation are bundled together at a lower price than booking them separately.\n\n5. **Online Subscription Services**: Streaming services like Netflix might offer additional features or extra members at an added fee but at a discounted rate compared to buying those features separately.\n\nIn essence, pure price bundling aims to increase sales volume by making the total package more appealing to consumers than the individual components."
