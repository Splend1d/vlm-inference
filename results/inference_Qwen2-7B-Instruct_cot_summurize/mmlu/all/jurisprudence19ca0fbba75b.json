The social contract cannot be entered into unless there is peace.\n\nHobbes believed that in the state of nature, without a government or laws, humans lived in a \"war of all against all,\" where each person was in constant fear for their own life and had the right to do whatever was necessary to protect themselves. He argued that this state was \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" Peace, as established by a social contract and a sovereign authority, allows for the creation of laws and order, which protects individuals from the constant threat of violence and ensures a more stable and cooperative society."
