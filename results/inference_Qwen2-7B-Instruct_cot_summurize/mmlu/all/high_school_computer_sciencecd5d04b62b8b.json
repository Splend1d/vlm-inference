When you perform `x << 3`, it shifts the bits of the binary representation of `x` to the left by 3 positions.\n\nGiven that `x = 1`, the binary representation of `1` is `0b01`.\n\nShifting this left by 3 positions gives us:\n\n```\n0b01 -> 0b0100\n```\n\nConverting this back to decimal gives us `4`. However, this option is not available in your provided choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the options or the question itself since based on the given information and Python's bitwise left shift operation, the correct answer isn't listed among A, B, C, or D."
