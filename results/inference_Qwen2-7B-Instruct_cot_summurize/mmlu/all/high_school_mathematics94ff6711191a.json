Since each slice is a square, its area will be equal to the side length squared.\n\nThe side length of the square can be found by looking at the distance between the two points where the curve \\(x^2 = 4y\\) intersects with the line \\(y = 2\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(y = 2\\) into \\(x^2 = 4y\\) to find the x-coordinates:\n\n\\[x^2 = 4(2)\\]\n\\[x^2 = 8\\]\n\\[x = \\pm\\sqrt{8}\\]\n\\[x = \\pm2\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSo, the side length of the square (s) is the distance between \\(x = -2\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(x = 2\\sqrt{2}\\), which is:\n\n\\[s = 2\\sqrt{2} - (-2\\sqrt{2}) = 4\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nNow, the area of one square slice is:\n\n\\[Area = s^2 = ( (4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 * 2 = 32\\]\n\nSince the volume of the solid is the sum of the areas of all these square slices, and given that the height of each slice is dy ( (since we're integrating along the y-axis), the volume V can be found by integrating the area of the squares from y=0 to y=2:\n\n\\[V = \\int_{0}^{2} 32 \\, dy\\]\n\n\\[V = 32y \\Big|_{0}^{2}\\]\n\n\\[V = 32(2) - 32(0\\]\n\n\\[V = 64\\]\n\nNone of the provided options (A. 8, B. 16, C. 20, D. 32 match the calculated volume of 64. It seems there might have been an error in the options or the interpretation of the problem. Based on the calculations, the correct volume is 64 cubic units."
