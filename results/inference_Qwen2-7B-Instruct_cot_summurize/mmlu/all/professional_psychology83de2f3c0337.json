This theory, proposed by Herzberg, suggests that factors such as wages and bonuses (also known as 'hygiene' or 'external' factors, do not motivate workers but can prevent dissatisfaction. True motivation comes from 'motivator' factors like achievement, recognition, responsibility, and advancement. Thus, when these motivator factors are lacking, employees may become dissatisfied, but when they are present, it does not necessarily lead to increased motivation. The company's experience suggests that despite implementing financial incentives, underlying motivator factors were not addressed, explaining why job motivation and satisfaction did not increase."
