The land conveyed to the woman fronted on a public highway. The land retained by the man was landlocked. One year later, the man died intestate, leaving a cousin as his only heir. The cousin visited the man's land for the first time and discovered that it had no access to a public highway. A neighbor who owned adjoining land fronting on the public highway offered to sell the cousin a right to cross the neighbor's land for access to the highway. Although the neighbor's price was reasonable, the cousin rejected the offer. The woman has refused to allow the cousin to cross her land for access to the public highway even though the woman's land is still vacant. The cousin has sued the woman, seeking access across the woman's land to the public highway. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The cousin, based on necessity.\nB. The cousin, because the woman's land is still vacant.\nC. The woman, because the cousin could obtain an alternative access to the highway from the neighbor.\nD. The woman, because the man failed to reserve an easement in his deed to the woman.\n"

The cousin, based on necessity.\n\nThe cousin is likely to prevail based on the principle of \"necessity.\" When a property owner has no reasonable means of access to a public road, they may seek to establish an easement over another's land to gain such access. This principle is often invoked when the lack of access poses a significant hardship or impediment to the use and enjoyment of the property. In this case, since the cousin's land is landlocked and there is no other practical way to access the public highway except through the woman's land, the cousin might be able to argue that they have a need for access that cannot be reasonably satisfied by any other means.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific laws governing easements can vary significantly between jurisdictions, and additional factors such as the terms of the original deed, local zoning laws, and the fairness of the situation (including whether the cousin could afford the neighbor's offer, would also be considered in court. However, given the information provided, the principle of necessity suggests that the cousin is more likely to prevail in their claim for access across the woman's land."
