She delivered her first child spontaneously at 34 weeks' gestation; pregnancy was complicated by iron deficiency anemia. She has no other history of serious illness. Her blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a dichorionic-diamniotic twin intrauterine pregnancy consistent in size with an 8-week gestation. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?\n\nA. Abruptio placentae\nB. Fetal chromosome abnormality\nC. Hyperthyroidism\nD. Preterm labor and delivery\n"

The specific complications that might be more prevalent include:\n\n- **Preterm labor and delivery**: Twin pregnancies often lead to preterm birth due to various factors including uterine overactivity, placental insufficiency, and space constraints within the uterus. The risk of preterm birth increases as the pregnancy progresses.\n\n- **Fetal chromosome abnormalities**: Although this can occur in any pregnancy, twins have a slightly higher risk due to the possibility of multiple sperm fertilizing multiple eggs (known as dizygotic or fraternal twins), which could result in one or both babies having an abnormal number of chromosomes.\n\n- **Abruptio placentae**: This occurs when the placenta separates from the uterine wall before the baby is born. While it can happen in any pregnancy, the risk is slightly higher in multiple pregnancies due to the increased pressure on the uterus and the potential for complications with the placental attachment.\n\n- **Hyperthyroidism**: While thyroid issues can affect pregnant women, the risk is not specifically increased in twin pregnancies. However, monitoring thyroid function is important during pregnancy due to the hormonal changes.\n\nGiven the context provided, the patient's history and current situation suggest an increased risk for **preterm labor and delivery** due to the nature of her twin pregnancy."
