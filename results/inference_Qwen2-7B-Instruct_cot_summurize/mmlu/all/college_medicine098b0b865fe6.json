When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child.

This theory emphasizes the role of the unconscious mind in influencing our thoughts, feelings, and actions. According to psychoanalysis, the officer's behavior might be driven by unconscious conflicts and desires from his childhood experiences, such as the abusive relationship with his father. The officer's tendency to stop and ticket middle-aged white males with similar physical characteristics to his father could be seen as a manifestation of these unresolved issues. The unconscious bias, in this case, is rooted in the officer's psychological development and is not something he is consciously aware of or can control on his own. Therefore, understanding and addressing these unconscious biases would likely require therapeutic intervention informed by the psychoanalytic perspective."
