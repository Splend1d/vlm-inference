This is because social interaction and support from coworkers can significantly impact an employee's overall job satisfaction. \n\nWhen employees feel isolated, they might lack the necessary support systems, which can lead to feelings of loneliness, reduced motivation, and decreased job satisfaction. This effect can be particularly pronounced in remote or solitary work environments.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. The relationship between these factors can be complex, and other variables might also influence job satisfaction."
