On each of the Model 1 A snowmobiles produced, the manufacturer installed a speed-regulating device that prevented the snowmobiles from exceeding 50 m. p. h. The manufacturer distributed the snowmobile through wholesalers and retailers across the country. In its sales brochures and advertising materials, the manufacturer advises all of its distributors against making any modifications on snowmobiles without first conferring with the manufacturer's staff of engineers. The operator of a shop in a mountain community had the exclusive right to distribute Model 1A snowmobiles in the area. Amid complaints from previous buyers regarding Model lA's speed limitations, the operator removed the speed regulators from all the Model 1A snowmobiles in stock. A buyer purchased from the operator one of the Model 1A snowmobiles that had the speed regulator removed. One day, the buyer was driving the Model 1A snowmobile through a snow-covered field, at speeds in excess of 70 m. p. h. The snowmobile hit a snow-covered rock, causing the buyer to lose control of the snowmobile, crash into a tree, and suffer serious injuries. If the buyer institutes a strict liability in tort action, he will most likely recover against\n\nA. the manufacturer only.\nB. the manufacturer, even though it was unaware of the removal of the speed regulator.\nC. the operator only.\nD. both the manufacturer and the operator.\n"

In this case, the snowmobile itself has a known defect due to the missing speed-regulating device, which allows it to exceed its designed maximum speed of 50 mph. This defect could lead to accidents and injuries if the snowmobile is driven faster than intended.\n\nThe operator, by removing the speed regulator without the manufacturer's consent, contributed to the creation of this defect. By modifying the product, the operator made it unsafe for use as originally designed, potentially leading to the accident that caused the buyer's injuries.\n\nTherefore, both the manufacturer ( for producing a product with an inherent design flaw that allowed for modifications leading to increased risk, and the operator, for modifying the product in a way that created an additional defect, would be liable under the doctrine of strict liability in tort."
