An individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than an individual who has only a high school diploma.\n\nResearch has shown that education level and voting behavior are positively correlated, meaning that generally, those with higher levels of education are more likely to vote than those with lower levels of education. This is because educated individuals may be more aware of political issues and have a greater interest in participating in the democratic process. However, it's important to note that this correlation does not mean that all individuals with higher education will vote, nor does it account for other factors that can influence voting behavior, such as party affiliation, ideology, and personal interest in specific candidates or issues."
