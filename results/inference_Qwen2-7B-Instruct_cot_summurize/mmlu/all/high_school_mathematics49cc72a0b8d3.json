First derivative:\n\\[y' = \\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}/3 = \\frac{2}{9}x^{-1/3}\\]\n\n2. Second derivative:\n\\[y'' = -\\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}x^{-4/3} = -\\frac{2}{27}x^{-4/3}\\]\n\nNow, evaluate the second derivative at \\(x=8\\):\n\\[y''(8) = -\\frac{2}{27} \\cdot 8^{-4/3} = -\\frac{2}{27} \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} = -\\frac{2}{432} = -\\frac{1}{216}\\]\n\nHowever, this value corresponds to the coefficient of the \\((x-8)^2\\) term divided by \\(2!\\) because of the general formula for Taylor series coefficients: \\[a_n = \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\\], where \\(f^{(n)}(a)\\) is the \\(n\\)th derivative evaluated at \\(a\\).\n\nSince we're looking for the coefficient of the \\((x-8)^2\\) term, and knowing that \\(n=2\\) in this case, we multiply our result by \\(2!\\) to find the actual coefficient:\n\nCoefficient = \\(-\\frac{1}{216} \\times 2! = -\\frac{1}{216} \\times 2 = -\\frac{1}{108}\\)\n\nIt seems there might have been a misunderstanding or a typo in the options provided since none of them match \\(-\\frac{1}{108}\\). Given the correct calculation process, the closest answer to our derived coefficient is:\n\nB. -1/72\n\nThis choice comes from the closest possible mathematical manipulation to our result considering typical options in such contexts. However, based on the precise calculation, the correct coefficient should be \\(-\\frac{1}{108}\\), which is not listed among the provided choices."
