He argues that actions should be judged based on their consequences. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. Need not be performed before each action, but should always be kept in mind.\n\nThis reflects Bentham's view that while utilitarian principles don't require immediate calculation for every decision (because often we can rely on general principles and past experiences), they should inform our thoughts and decisions continuously. The idea is to aim for the greatest good for the greatest number over time, rather than focusing on individual decisions in isolation."
