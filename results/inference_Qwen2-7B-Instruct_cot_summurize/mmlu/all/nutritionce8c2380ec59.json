Result in bone mineral loss from the skeleton\n\nDuring pregnancy and lactation, there is an increased demand for calcium to support the growth and development of the fetus and the milk production for the baby. This increased demand can lead to bone mineral loss if not enough calcium is consumed or absorbed through the diet. Therefore, it's crucial for pregnant and lactating women to have an adequate intake of calcium to meet this increased demand without compromising their own bone health."
