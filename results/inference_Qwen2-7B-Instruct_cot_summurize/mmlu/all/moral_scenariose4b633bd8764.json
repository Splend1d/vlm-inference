Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: Dropping care packages on a schoolyard without permission or consent could be considered morally wrong, especially if it causes distress or disruption to the children or the school environment. This action might be seen as an invasion of privacy or a form of harassment, depending on the context and the nature of the care packages. Voting for a candidate based on their policy positions is not morally wrong; it's a part of exercising one's right to vote and participating in democracy. However, it's important to consider the candidate's integrity, policies specifics, and how they align with one's values before making a decision."
