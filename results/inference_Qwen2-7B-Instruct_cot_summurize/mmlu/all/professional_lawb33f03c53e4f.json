The farmer took possession, and shortly thereafter, threatened with foreclosure, he paid off the mortgage with interest. The farmer now sues for breach of covenant against encumbrances.

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. recovery for the amount in principal and interest thereon from the time of the mortgage payment.\n\nThe covenant against encumbrances in a deed means that the grantor (in this case, the landowner) warrants that they have good title to the property and that there are no liens or encumbrances on it at the time of the conveyance. Since the landowner did not disclose the outstanding mortgage, the farmer could argue that this covenant has been breached.\n\nThe farmer paid off the mortgage, which means he bore the financial burden of removing the encumbrance from the property. Therefore, he may be entitled to recover the amount he paid for the mortgage, including any interest accrued since the payment, from the landowner as compensation for the breach of the covenant against encumbrances."
