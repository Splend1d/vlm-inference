At trial, the plaintiff is prepared to testify that a janitor at the company told her that he had heard her supervisor say to other male coworkers about her, \"Make it hard for her. Maybe she'll go home where she belongs.\" Is the plaintiff's proposed testimony admissible?\n\nA. No, because the janitor's statement is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, because the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement is a statement of his then-existing state of mind.\nD. Yes, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are statements janitor and the supervisor are statements concerning a matter within the scope of their employment.\n"

Yes, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are statements concerning a matter within the scope of their employment.\n\nIn the context of legal proceedings, a statement made by an individual in the course and scope of their employment can often be admitted as evidence, even if it would otherwise fall under the category of hearsay. Hearsay refers to out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule, such as when the statement is made by a co-conspirator during and in furtherance of a conspiracy, a statement against interest, or a statement made by a party-opponent.\n\nIn this scenario, the janitor's statement, while potentially hearsay, might be admissible if it falls under an exception, particularly if the statement was made spontaneously and reflects the janitor's direct observation or immediate reaction, which could qualify as a present sense impression. This is a type of exception to the hearsay rule, allowing such statements to be admitted if they describe or explain an event while the declarant has the capacity to perceive it.\n\nSimilarly, the supervisor's statement could potentially be admissible under the exception for statements of then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition. This allows a person to communicate information about their current state of mind, emotion, or physical condition, which can be relevant to the case.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the exact admissibility of these statements would depend on the specific rules of evidence in the jurisdiction where the trial is taking place, including how the court interprets the applicability of these exceptions and whether the statements meet the criteria necessary for each exception to apply. The defense may also challenge the admissibility of these statements on various grounds, such as relevance, reliability, or the potential for undue prejudice."
