The contractor, in turn, hired a subcontractor to dig the hole and plaster the pooi area. After the subcontractor completed his job, the contractor then hired an electrician to install the heater and wiring for the pool. While the electrician was performing his work, the wiring became disjointed and had to be replaced at a substantial expense to the homeowner. If the homeowner sues the electrician in tort to recover the damages she suffered because of this occurrence, will the homeowner prevail?\n\nA.

Yes, if the wiring became disjointed because the electrician's plans departed from established standards in the electrical industry.\n\nIn tort law, particularly when dealing with negligence claims against professionals like contractors or electricians, the plaintiff must typically prove that the defendant (1) owed them a duty of care, 2) breached that duty, and 3) as a result of the breach, the plaintiff suffered damages. \n\nIn this scenario, the homeowner could potentially argue that the electrician breached their duty of care by deviatinging from established electrical industry standards, which would constitute negligence. If the electrician's actions led to the need for substantial additional expenses to repair the wiring, the homeowner could argue they suffered damages as a direct result of this negligence.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of tort law can vary significantly between jurisdictions, and additional factors such as whether there was a contract in place specifying the standard of care expected of the electrician, or any specific laws regarding electrical work in the homeowner's location, could also impact the outcome."
