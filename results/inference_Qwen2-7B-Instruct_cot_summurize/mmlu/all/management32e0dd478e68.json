Lorsch, suggests that organizations make decisions in a chaotic environment where multiple individuals or departments (referred to as \"agents\") have their own goals, information, and perspectives. The agents interact in an unstructured way, leading to a \"garbage can\" scenario where information, problems, and solutions are flow in and out of the decision-making process without clear boundaries or rules. This process often leads to complex and sometimes unpredictable outcomes due to the limited knowledge and uncertainty involved."
