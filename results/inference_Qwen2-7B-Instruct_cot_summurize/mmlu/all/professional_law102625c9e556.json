The results of the exam are sent to a government data information center for the purpose of keeping information about men who may be drafted into the military. A 25-year-old law school graduate has herpes. He has recently sent resumes to many governmental agencies. Fearful that the information about his herpes condition will become available, he seeks a declaratory judgment that would forbid the government from requiring him to take a physical examination. Which of the following is the best constitutional basis in support of the federal law?\n\nA. The commerce clause.\nB. The dormant commerce clause.\nC. To raise and support an army and navy.\nD.

To raise and support an army and navy.\n\nThis is because the power to regulate the armed forces and maintain national defense falls under the federal government's enumerated powers as provided by the Constitution, specifically in Article I, Section 8, Clause 12 which grants Congress the power \"To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years.\" Additionally, Congress also has the power to \"make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\"\n\nThe requirement for a physical examination could be seen as part of the process of maintaining and supporting the armed forces, including potential military conscription. This is a legitimate exercise of the federal government's authority over national defense and military affairs. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of this law would need to be evaluated based on other constitutional principles such as privacy rights, equal protection, and due process. If the law is challenged in court, these factors would also play a significant role in determining its constitutionality."
