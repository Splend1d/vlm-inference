Incomplete dominance describes the interaction of two alleles on one gene; epistasis describes the interaction of two genes and their respective alleles.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Incomplete Dominance**: This refers to a situation in genetics where neither allele is completely dominant over the other. Instead, the heterozygous phenotype ( (an individual with two different alleles for a particular gene) is intermediate between the phenotypes produced by the homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive individuals. For example, in snapdragons, the color red ( (R) is incompletely dominant over white ( (r), resulting in pink flowers in the heterozygous genotype (Rr.\n\n- **Epistasis**: This term refers to a situation where the expression of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more specific alleles of another gene. In other words, the effect of one gene is masked by the presence of another gene's allele. This can be either complete (where the effect of the first gene is entirely blocked) or incomplete (where the effect is reduced but not completely blocked. For example, in the case of flower color in some plants, the presence of a yellow allele might completely mask the effect of a red allele, resulting in yellow flowers regardless of the red allele being present or not.\n\nTherefore, while both terms involve interactions between genes and alleles, they differ in the nature of these interactions and the specific context in which they apply."
