These consequences are intended to discourage or punish the behavior in question.\n\nOption D is not an example of punishment. It can be seen as a passive or retaliatory action taken by an individual (in this case, the employee) in response to perceived unfairness or dissatisfaction, such as not receiving a raise. However, it does not necessarily have a punitive intent towards another person. The primary motivation might be self-protection, retaliation, or seeking justice rather than punishment."
