                    "text": "To find out how many bricks Zoey can use to cover her patio with a thickness of one brick, we need to calculate the volume of the patio and divide it by the volume of one brick.\n\nFirst, convert the dimensions of the patio from feet to inches since the dimensions of the brick are given in inches:\n\n- Patio dimensions: \\(12 \\text{ feet} \\times 10 \\text{ feet}\\)\n- Convert to inches: \\(12 \\times 12 = 144 \\text{ inches}\\) ( (for length) and \\(10 \\times 12 = 120 \\text{ inches}\\) ( (for width)\n\nThe thickness of the brick layer will be equal to the height of the brick, which is 2 inches.\n\nNow, calculate the volume of the patio and the volume of one brick:\n\n- Volume of patio = Length \\(\\times\\) Width \\(\\times\\) Thickness = \\(144 \\text{ inches} \\times 120 \\text{ inches} \\times 2 \\text{ inches}\\)\n- Volume of patio = \\(34,560 \\text{ cubic inches}\\)\n\n- Volume of one brick = Length \\(\\times\\) Width \\(\\times\\) Height = \\(4 \\text{ inches} \\times 6 \\text{ inches} \\times 2 \\text{ inches}\\)\n- Volume of one brick = \\(48 \\text{ cubic inches}\\)\n\nNext, divide the volume of the patio by the volume of one brick to find out how many bricks can fit:\n\n- Number of bricks = \\(34,560 \\div 48 = 720\\)\n\nTherefore, the salesman could sell Zoey 720 bricks to meet her criteria. However, this option is not listed among your choices. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the calculation or the options provided. Based on the calculations:\n\n- A. 5,760  \n- B. 2,880  \n- C. 2,160  \n- D. 1,440\n\nThe correct answer based on our calculations should be closest to 720, but none of the provided options match. It's important to double-check the dimensions and calculations, but based on the provided information and calculations, the correct answer isn't listed."
