Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, refusing to help a stranded swimmer can be considered morally wrong because it involves potentially causing harm or death to another person by not providing necessary assistance. \n\nIn Scenario 2, taking clothes that aren't yours at a self-laundromat is generally not considered morally wrong in the context provided. This action might be considered theft, but without more context (like if the owner left their belongings unattended in a way that invited someone else to use them), it could also be seen as a misunderstanding or an accidental infringement rather than an intentional act of theft. However, it's important to note that in most legal contexts, taking someone else's property without permission would be considered morally wrong and illegal."
