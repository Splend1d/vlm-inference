This energy is not primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the products (the alpha particle and the neutron. Instead, much of it is emitted as gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation, similar to light, but with much higher energy.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the alpha particle and neutron do carry some of this energy away, but they are relatively small compared to the total energy released in the form of gamma rays. The exact distribution can depend on the specifics of the reaction and the system involved, but in general, the majority of the energy is in the form of gamma radiation."
