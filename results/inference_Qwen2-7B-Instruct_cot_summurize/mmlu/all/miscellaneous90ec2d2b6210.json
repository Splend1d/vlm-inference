So, in total, a square-based pyramid has:\n\nBase: 4 sides\nTriangular Faces: 4 sides in total ( one for each side of the square base\n\nAdding these together gives us \\(4 + 4 = 8\\) sides in total.\n\nHowever, since the question seems to be asking about the number of polygonal sides specifically, considering the base and the sides without counting the edges as separate entities ( would make the answer \\(5\\), including the square base and the 4 triangular faces' edges as a single count for the sides.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choice based on the interpretation considering the base and the lateral faces collectively as 'sides' is:\n\nC. five"
