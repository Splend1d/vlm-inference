According to de Broglie's hypothesis, the wavelength (\u03bb) and linear momentum (p) of a particle are related by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} \\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is Planck's constant. This equation shows that the wavelength of a particle is inversely proportional to its momentum, and it is this relationship that forms the basis for the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics."
