Either of above.\n\nBoth coreless furnaces and indirect arc furnaces can be suitable for intermittent work, depending on the specific needs of the application. \n\nA coreless furnace uses an electric arc to melt metal without needing a separate core material, which makes it flexible and adaptable to various materials and melting processes. This type of furnace can easily be started and stopped, making it suitable for intermittent workloads.\n\nAn indirect arc furnace also allows for flexibility in operation and can handle intermittent loads by heating refractory linings with electric arcs, which then transfer heat to the metal charge through a hearth or slag layer. This setup can efficiently manage varying amounts of production.\n\nThe choice between the two would depend on factors such as the specific metal being processed, the required temperature and energy efficiency, and the specific operational conditions."
