For any square matrix \\(A\\), the trace of \\(A^2\\) (is equal to the sum of the squares of all entries in \\(A\\). Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, it follows that the trace of \\(A^2\\) is indeed nonnegative. So, statement I is true.\n\n**II. If \\(A^2 = A\\), then the trace of \\(A\\) is nonnegative.**\n\nIf \\(A^2 = A\\), this means \\(A\\) is idempotent. For an idempotent matrix, if we consider the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) of \\(A\\), since \\(A^2 = A\\), it follows that \\(\\lambda^2 = \\lambda\\), implying \\(\\lambda = 0\\) or \\(\\lambda = 1\\). The trace of \\(A\\) is the sum of its eigenvalues, so the trace can be either 0 (if there are are some 0 eigenvalues and others 1s) or a positive number (if all eigenvalues are 1. Hence, the trace of \\(A\\) can be zero (which is nonnegative), positive, or negative. Therefore, statement II is not necessarily true for all cases.\n\n**III. The trace of \\(AB\\) is the product of the traces of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).**\n\nThis statement is generally false. The trace of the product of two matrices \\(AB\\) does not necessarily equal the product of their individual traces. This property would only hold under very specific conditions, such as when both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) commute (\\(AB = BA\\)). Without commutativity, the statement is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- Statement I is true.\n- Statement II is not necessarily true for all cases.\n- Statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. II only**."
