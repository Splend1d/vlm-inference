The surgeon moved to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion and set discovery cutoff and trial dates. The surgeon has appealed the denial of the motion. Should the appellate court hear the merits of the surgeon's appeal?\n\nA. No, because the appellate court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.\nB. No, because the district court's decision on jurisdiction is final.\nC. Yes, because a contrary appellate decision could terminate the action.\nD. Yes, because the surgeon's personal- jurisdiction challenge raises a constitutional question.\n"

Yes, because the surgeon's personal-jurisdiction challenge raises a constitutional question.\n\nWhen an appeal involves questions related to personal jurisdiction, these are often considered \"constitutional\" in nature under the doctrine of \"pendent jurisdiction.\" This means that the appellate court can address these issues even if they did not explicitly raise them in the lower court. The reason being such questions touch upon fundamental rights and the Constitution, including the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which governs the limits on state power to assert jurisdiction over individuals. Therefore, the appellate court should hear the merits of the surgeon's appeal related to personal jurisdiction."
