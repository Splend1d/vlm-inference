The city, because it does not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.\n\nFirst Amendment rights do protect against government censorship or abridgment of speech, press, religion, and the right to peaceful assembly. However, these rights can be balanced against other considerations such as public safety, morality, and community standards. In the context of zoning laws, courts often apply intermediate scrutiny to determine if the regulation is reasonable and not an undue burden on the protected activity.\n\nIn this case, the city's ordinance requires \"adult\" establishments to be located in industrial zones. This could potentially restrict access for certain segments of the population (such as tourists who may not easily navigate industrial areas, or individuals who prefer visiting these establishments in a more accessible location like a downtown tourist area. However, if the court finds that there are alternative ways for patrons to access adult content, such as online platforms, mail-order services, or other legal brick-and-mortar locations outside of the downtown tourist area, the city's regulation might be deemed reasonable.\n\nTherefore, unless the court determines that the regulation imposes an undue burden on the owner's ability to operate their business due to a lack of alternative avenues for communication and access to adult content, the city would likely prevail based on the principle that it has a right to regulate activities within its jurisdiction in a manner that serves the interests of public welfare and safety."
