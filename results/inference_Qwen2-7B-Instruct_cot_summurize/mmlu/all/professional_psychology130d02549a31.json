In the context of phobias, this typically involves associating a benign object or event (the conditioned stimulus) with a naturally frightening stimulus (the unconditioned stimulus), leading to a fear response (the unconditioned response) to the benign object or event. \n\nFor example, if someone had a bad experience with dogs (a natural unconditioned stimulus for fear) at a young age, they might develop a phobia (an unconditioned response) towards dogs. If later on, they see a fluffy cat (the conditioned stimulus) and feel fear because it reminded them of the dog incident, they have undergone classical conditioning. The fear response to the cat (now a conditioned stimulus) was learned through association with the original fear-inducing stimulus (the dog)."
