For example, if the \"wreck\" refers to a car accident scene where people might be injured or in danger, interfering without authorization could put others' lives at risk or violate privacy laws. However, if there's no immediate danger and it's just a prank, it might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves \"appearing in the noonday sun and laying naked on the ground at the nude beach.\" This action is generally considered disrespectful and inappropriate, especially since the setting is a nude beach where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy and modesty. It can be seen as a violation of personal boundaries and potentially cause distress or embarrassment to others. Therefore, this action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
