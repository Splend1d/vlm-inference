The international system is considered anarchic, meaning there is no overarching authority to enforce rules or agreements among states. This implies that states must rely on their own power and capabilities to ensure their security and interests.\n\nB. In realism, states are primarily concerned with their own survival and power. They assess other states based on their military strength, economic resources, and overall capability to influence the international system. This perspective often leads to a focus on balance of power strategies.\n\nC. Realism posits that states are unitary and rational actors. This means that states have clear, consistent objectives and make decisions based on calculations of self-interest. Each state is seen as a single entity making strategic choices in pursuit of its national interest.\n\nTherefore, all three statements accurately reflect key tenets of realist theory in international relations."
