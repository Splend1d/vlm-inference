There is insufficient information given in the question to draw a conclusion about market efficiency.\n\nWhile finding that 3 out of 100 fund managers significantly outperform the market might suggest some level of inefficiency, this alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the entire market is inefficient. Market efficiency is a complex concept that depends on various factors, including the speed at which information is processed by all market participants, the ability of investors to make rational decisions, and the presence of transaction costs and taxes. \n\nTo assess market efficiency, one would typically look at multiple indicators and tests across different time periods and asset classes. The fact that some fund managers can outperform suggests that there may be opportunities for skill or that the market may not always reflect all available information instantaneously. However, without further analysis and considering other relevant factors, it's premature to label the market as inefficient based solely on this information."
