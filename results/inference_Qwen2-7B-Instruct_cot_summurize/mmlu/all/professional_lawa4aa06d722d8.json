The parties agreed orally on a price of $100,000 for the system, but continued to negotiate over several points. When all matters regarding the air-conditioning system were finally settled, the parties signed a written agreement. It provided that the price for the system, which would be delivered on June 1, would be $110,000. The written agreement, a lengthy form contract, did not contain a merger clause. The seller delivered the system on June 1, but the buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, citing the earlier oral agreement as to price. The seller sued the buyer for the additional $10,000 under the written agreement. Is the court likely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000?\n\nA. No, because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price.\nB. No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.\nC. Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.\nD. Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.\n"

Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.\n\nIn this scenario, the oral agreement regarding the price of $100,000 could potentially be relevant if the court decides to reform the written agreement to reflect the true intent of the parties. A court may consider extrinsic evidence, such as the oral agreement, to determine what the parties actually agreed upon when there is ambiguity or a conflict between the oral and written agreements. If the oral agreement clearly shows that the parties intended for the price to be $100,000, the court might consider reforming the written agreement to match this understanding, especially if the written agreement lacks a merger clause, as stated in option D. This is because the absence of a merger clause suggests that the parties did not intend for the written agreement to be the final and complete integration of their agreement, leaving room for other terms to be considered by the court."
