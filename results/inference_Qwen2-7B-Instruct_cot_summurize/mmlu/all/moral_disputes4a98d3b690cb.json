However, based on Peter Singer's views which are often discussed in relation to animal rights, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. because rights are essentially human\n\nSinger argues that the basis for moral consideration should be sentience and the ability to experience suffering or happiness, rather than species membership. Thus, he advocates for extending rights and protections to animals capable of experiencing these states.\n\nJoshua Cohen, however, is known for his work on rights theory, particularly the concept of \"reasonable pluralism\" which suggests that there can be multiple valid conceptions of justice and rights within a society. Cohen does not necessarily argue against the possibility of animals having rights per se, but rather focuses on the complexities and challenges in defining and implementing rights across different conceptions of the good. His views do not directly address the question of whether animals can be bearers of rights in the same way humans are, but rather the broader philosophical questions about the nature and justification of rights."
