The events that might have prompted the poet to write this piece are most closely associated with C. U.S. involvement in Panama's independence.\n\nIn 1903, the United States facilitated the creation of the Republic of Panama through the Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty, which allowed for the construction of the Panama Canal. This treaty and the subsequent construction of the canal were part of the broader U.S. strategy to increase its influence in Central and South America, particularly in terms of controlling trade routes and establishing military bases.\n\nRub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, a prominent poet and figure in Latin American literature, was likely reacting against what he perceived as the aggressive expansionist policies of the United States, which he saw as a threat to the cultural and national sovereignty of Latin American nations. His poem serves as a critique of U.S. imperialism and a defense of Latin American identity and autonomy."
