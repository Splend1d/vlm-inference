Typically, in physics, positive velocities correspond to movements in the positive direction of the coordinate system, and negative velocities indicate movement in the negative direction. Given that the question asks for the \"upward\" velocity, and assuming \"upward\" refers to the positive y-direction, we should consider the magnitude of the velocity vector as asked.\n\nLet's correct the approach focusing on the magnitude of the velocity vector at \\(t=1\\), which would indeed give us a positive value corresponding to the magnitude of the velocity in the upward direction:\n\nThus, the correct approach to find the magnitude of the velocity at \\(t=1\\) involves calculating the derivative of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(t\\) and then evaluating it at \\(t=1\\), but considering the magnitude of the resulting vector:\n\n\\[\\left|\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right|_{t=1} = |4\\cos(1) + 12\\cos(12)|\\]\n\n\\[= |4 \\times 0.5403 + 12 \\times -0.2079|\\]\n\n\\[= |2.1612 - 2.4948|\\]\n\n\\[= |-0.3336|\\]\n\n\\[= 0.3336\\]\n\nIt appears there was an error in calculation or misinterpretation in the steps leading up to this point, especially in the final answer provided.

The provided options suggest a misunderstanding in the explanation or calculation process, indicating the need for a more precise and detailed explanation to arrive at a correct choice among the provided options, which was not achieved in this response due to errors in the calculation and explanation flow."
