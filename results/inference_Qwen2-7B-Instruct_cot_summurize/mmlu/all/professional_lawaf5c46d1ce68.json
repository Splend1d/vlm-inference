When one of her tenants vacated his apartment, the woman placed an advertisement in the local paper that read as follows: \"Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred.\" The woman's preference was motivated by the fact that she liked to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds in her building, and of the remaining rented units, one was rented to an African American man and the other to a Pacific Islander woman. Based upon these facts, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.\nB.
