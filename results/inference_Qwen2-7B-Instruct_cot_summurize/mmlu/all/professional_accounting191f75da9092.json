Providing factual accounts in testimony explaining positions taken during the performance of any services provided to the client.\n\nAccording to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, an accounting firm can provide certain nonaudit services to an audit client without impairing its independence, as long as these services do not involve advocacy or appearing to advocate on behalf of the client. The provision of factual accounts in testimony related to services already performed for the client falls under this category since it does not involve new advocacy roles or positions.\n\nOptions A and B involve providing expert opinions that could be seen as advocating the client's position, which is generally prohibited under SOX guidelines. Option D involves legal services, which are the accounting firm is specifically prohibited from providing for an audit client due to potential conflicts of interest and independence concerns."
