                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The planets would move in spiral orbits.\n\nWhen the Sun is replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the gravitational field around the black hole changes significantly due to its strong gravitational pull and the singularity at its center. The Schwarzschild radius describes the size of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, which in this case is quite small (3,000 meters for a solar mass black hole. This small radius indicates that the black hole has a very strong gravitational pull, capable of capturing anything within its event horizon.\n\nPlanets orbiting a black hole would experience tidal forces that cause them to spiral inward over time. This is because the gravitational force acting on different parts of a planet would not be uniform; it would be stronger closer to the black hole and weaker farther away. As a result, the planet would stretch longitudinally as it tries to maintain cohesion under the differential gravitational forces. This stretching effect leads to an increase in kinetic energy, causing the planet to speed up and move closer to the black hole, thus spiraling inwards. \n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Planets would not move directly toward the Sun. Instead, they would follow the path dictated by the new gravitational field, which would cause them to spiral inward.\n\nC. Oscillating about their former elliptical orbits is not a direct consequence of the transition from a star to a black hole of the same mass. Planets would instead spiral inwards due to the strong gravitational forces.\n\nD. The orbits would not remain unchanged. The introduction of a black hole with the same mass but vastly different properties would lead to a change in the dynamics of the system, including the orbits of the planets."
