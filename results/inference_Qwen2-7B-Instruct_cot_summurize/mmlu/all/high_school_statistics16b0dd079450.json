The margin of error in a statistical survey like this one indicates the range within which the true value in the population is expected to fall, with a certain level of confidence (often 95%). In this case, a margin of error of 3% means that the true percentage of the population using grocery coupons could be as low as 79% ( (82% - 3%) or as high as 85% ( (82% + 3%). Therefore, it is likely that between 79% and 85% of the population use grocery coupons."
