These elementary processes often involve stoichiometric coefficients that are are directly related to the reactants and products in those specific steps. Therefore, the rate law can be written using these stoichiometric coefficients for elementary processes.\n\nFor other types of reactions like precipitation, acid-base reactions, or solubility reactions, the overall reaction might not necessarily reflect the detailed step-by-step mechanisms, so the stoichiometric coefficients used in the rate law might differ from those in the balanced chemical equation."
