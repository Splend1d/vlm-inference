                    "text": "The correct answer is D: The root value of the knee reflex is L1, L2.\n\nExplanation:\n- A positive Babinski reflex does not equate to a normal flexor response on the plantar reflex ( (Option A is incorrect). A positive Babinski sign (also known as a Babinski reflex) is an abnormal response where the big toe extends upward and the other toes fan out instead of a normal flexor response (curling downward) when the sole of the foot is stimulated.\n- An extensor plantar response does not necessarily indicate a lower motor neuron lesion ( (Option B is incorrect). An extensor plantar response (the big toe extending upwards while the others fan out when the sole of the foot is stimulated) typically indicates a higher motor neuron lesion or a sensory nerve lesion affecting the superficial peroneal nerve.\n- The root value of the ankle reflex is actually S1, S2 ( (Option C is incorrect). This refers to the sacral spinal segments involved in the ankle reflex, which includes both S1 and S2 segments.\n- The root value of the knee reflex is indeed L1, L2 ( (Option D is correct). The knee reflex (patellar reflex) is elicited by tapping the patellar tendon and involves the quadriceps muscles. The motor fibers for this reflex originate from the L1-L2 spinal segments."
