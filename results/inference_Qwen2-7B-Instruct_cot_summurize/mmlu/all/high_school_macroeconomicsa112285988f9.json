This imbalance leads firms to reduce production in order to adjust their inventory levels, which in turn results in a decrease in output. As production decreases, the supply of goods in the market also decreases, potentially leading to price increases if demand remains strong. The relationship between inventories and output is closely tied because inventories serve as a buffer to smooth out fluctuations in demand; when inventories unexpectedly shrink, it signals a need for firms to cut back on production to avoid shortages."
