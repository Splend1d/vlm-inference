Rest and analgesics usually eradicate the pain within 2 weeks. However, the pain seems to recur every 2 to 3 months. Medical history is remarkable for gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies. She takes no medications except for an oral contraceptive. She walks 3 miles daily for exercise and works as a sales representative for a computer software company. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal, and physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Administer an epidural injection of methylprednisolone\nB. Order MRI of the lumbosacral spine\nC. Order x-rays of the lumbosacral spine\nD. Recommend beginning a weight loss program\n"

The recurrence of the pain every 2-3 months, along with her history of gestational diabetes mellitus, and her BMI being above 30 (which classifies her as obese, could all contribute to the development of low back pain. Obese individuals often experience increased stress on their back due to the extra body weight.\n\nGiven her situation, the most appropriate next step would likely be:\n\nD. Recommend beginning a weight loss program\n\nThis is because weight management can significantly alleviate back pain by reducing the load on the back muscles and spinal discs. Before recommending this, it might also be beneficial to order an x-ray of the lumbosacral spine (option C) to rule out any structural issues that might not be directly related to her obesity but could still contribute to her pain. An MRI (option B) might be considered if the x-ray does not provide enough information or if there is suspicion of a more serious condition like herniatedated disc, spinal stenosis, etc., but it is generally reserved for when other tests are inconclusive or when specific findings are needed.\n\nAdministering an epidural injection of methylprednisolone (option A) could be a treatment option after further evaluation, but it should not be the first step without understanding the underlying cause of her pain. Therefore, starting with a weight loss recommendation and an x-ray is the most logical approach."
