According to Jain belief, there have been 24 major Tirthankaras in each of the current and previous cycles of creation, known as \"kalpas\". This cycle, including the current one, is believed to have started with Rishabhanatha, and the 24th Tirthankara is expected to be Parshvanatha.\n\nGiven this, if we consider the current age or cycle of the universe, it is the 24th such cycle. Therefore, the number of Jinas that have appeared during our age should be 24.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 24"
