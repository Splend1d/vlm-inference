Identification of infected individuals: Knowing who is infected can help in isolating them to prevent further spread of the disease.\n\nB. Location of infected individuals: This information is crucial for contact tracing, which helps identify people who may have been exposed to the infection and need to be monitored or quarantined.\n\nC. Rate of infection spread: Monitoring how quickly the infection is spreading provides insights into the effectiveness of current interventions and helps in predicting future trends, allowing for timely adjustments in public health strategies.\n\nTherefore, all three aspects\u2014identification of infected individuals, their location, and the rate of infection spread\u2014are essential components of an effective surveillance system."
