The airline that owned and operated the airplane is incorporated and has its maintenance facilities and principal place of business in State C. One day before the statute of limitations on their claims would have run, the estates of the pilot and each of the passengers filed a wrongful death action against the airline in federal court in State A. The airline was served one week later and wants to prevent the State A federal court from hearing the action. Which of the following motions is most likely to accomplish the airline's goal?\n\nA. A motion to dismiss the action for improper venue.\nB. A motion to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.\nC. A motion to dismiss the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\nD. A motion to transfer the action to a federal court in State C.\n"

A motion to dismiss the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\n\nThe doctrine of forum non conveniens allows a court to decline jurisdiction over a case when there is an alternative forum that is more appropriate for the case. This decision usually involves balancing the convenience of the parties, the interests of justice, and considerations such as the location of evidence and witnesses. In this scenario, the airline might argue that State C is a more appropriate forum because that is where it is incorporated, has its main operations, and likely has more relevant evidence and witnesses than State A. By successfully invoking forum non conveniens, the airline could have the case dismissed and transferred to a federal court in State C."
