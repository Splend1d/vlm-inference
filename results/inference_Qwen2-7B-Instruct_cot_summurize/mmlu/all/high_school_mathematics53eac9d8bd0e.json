                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the positions of the hour and minute hands change over time on a clock.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: At 6:00 PM, the hour hand is exactly at the 6, and the minute hand is at the 12. The initial angle between them is \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Movement of the Hands**:\n   - The minute hand moves \\(360^\\circ\\) in \\(60\\) minutes, or \\(6^\\circ\\) per minute.\n   - The hour hand moves \\(360^\\circ\\) in \\(12\\) hours, or \\(0.5^\\circ\\) per minute.\n\n3. **Change in Angle**: When John left home, the angle between the hands was \\(110^\\circ\\). For him to return to an angle of \\(110^\\circ\\) again, the hands must move past each other once (since they were \\(110^\\circ\\) apart initially, they would have to move closer together, pass each other, and then move further apart to be \\(110^\\circ\\) apart again.\n\n4. **Relative Speed**: The relative speed of the minute hand compared to the hour hand is \\(6^\\circ - 0.5^\\circ = 5.5^\\circ\\) per minute.\n\n5. **Distance Between Hands**: To go from \\(110^\\circ\\) to \\(110^\\circ\\) again, the hands must travel a total distance that allows them to meet and then separate by \\(110^\\circ\\) again. This means they need to cover the \\(110^\\circ\\) gap, meet, and then separate by another \\(110^\\circ\\), totaling \\(220^\\circ\\).\n\n6. **Time Calculation**: Since they move towards each other at a rate of \\(5.5^\\circ\\) per minute, to cover \\(220^\\circ\\), it takes \\(\\frac{220^\\circ}{5.5^\\circ/\\text{minute}} = 40\\) minutes.\n\nTherefore, John was was away for **40 minutes**, making the correct answer **B. 40**."
