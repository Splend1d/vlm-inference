An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos.\n\nThis conclusion aligns with the concept of \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,\" which suggests that the development of an individual organism through its life stages mirrors the evolutionary history of its species. This idea implies that as an organism grows, it goes through stages that resemble the ancestral forms of its species, particularly during the early stages of development. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that while this pattern is observed, it is not always a perfect or complete recapitulation. The complexity and specificity of modern organisms mean that this process can vary significantly. Therefore, option C is more accurate than option A when discussing the development of a vertebrate organism, including humans, as it acknowledges the shared ancestry between different classes, orders, and species."
