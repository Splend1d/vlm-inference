When the cannonball is fired from the cannon, the cannonball exerts a force on the cannon, and the cannon exerts an equal and opposite force back on the cannonball. This means that both the cannonball and the cannon experience equal amounts of force.\n\nAdditionally, both the cannonball and the cannon will experience accelerations due to this force, according to Newton's second law ( F=ma, where F is force, mass, and a is acceleration. The accelerations will be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction because of the action-reaction pair.\n\nSo, both statements A (amounts of force) and B (accelerations) are true."
