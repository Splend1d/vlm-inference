This tilt causes the Sun's energy to be concentrated over one half of Mars' surface at certain times of the year, leading to extreme seasonal variations. The seasons in Mars' southern hemisphere are particularly extreme because when the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, the southern hemisphere experiences a long period of darkness and cold, and vice versa. This is due to Mars' axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane around the Sun."
