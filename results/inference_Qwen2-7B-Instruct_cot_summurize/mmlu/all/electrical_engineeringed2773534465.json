Shunt Capacitors: These are used to provide additional capacitance in parallel with the load. This helps to reduce the overall system's impedance and improve power factor.\n\nB. Series Capacitors: These are used to compensate reactive loads by adding extra capacitance in series with the load. This can help stabilize voltage levels on the electrical grid.\n\nC. Generation Excitation Control: This involves controlling the excitation (or\u52b1\u78c1) of generators to adjust their reactive output. By changing the excitation level, the generator can either supply or absorb reactive power, thus helping to maintain voltage stability.\n\nTherefore, all these methods are indeed used for reactive or voltage compensation."
