Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, the act of a parent banning their child to the basement for an extended period (in this case, 20 years) is considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020. Such actions can lead to severe psychological harm and violate basic human rights related to freedom, safety, and family care.\n\nIn Scenario 2, starting a forest fire that burns twigs and shrubs could be morally questionable depending on the context and the scale of the damage caused. However, without additional information about the environmental impact, potential harm to wildlife, or any legal repercussions, it's generally not considered \"clearly\" morally wrong. The act might be illegal or irresponsible, but it doesn't necessarily fall into the category of clear moral wrongness without further context. For example, if the fire was started negligently or recklessly, causing significant damage, then it would be morally wrong. If it was a controlled burn done legally and with proper precautions, it might not be morally wrong."
