                    "text": "The correct answer is B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\ni) The autocorrelation function (acf) and partial autocorrelation function (pacf) will not always be identical at lag one, regardless of the model. The acf measures the linear dependence between observations at different lags, while the pacf measures the correlation between observations at a particular lag after removing the effect of correlations at all shorter lags. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nii) For an MA(q) model, the partial autocorrelation function (pacf) will indeed be non-zero up to lag q and then zero thereafter. This is because an MA(q) model has non-zero coefficients only up to lag q, so correlations at lags greater than q can be explained by earlier lags within the model. Thus, this statement is true.\n\niii) For an AR(p) model, the partial autocorrelation function (pacf) will indeed be zero beyond lag p. This is because an AR(p) model has non-zero coefficients only up to lag p, meaning that correlations at lags greater than p cannot be explained by the model and hence are expected to be zero. Therefore, this statement is also true.\n\niv) The acf and pacf will not necessarily be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model. An MA(1) model has a single non-zero coefficient at lag 1, which affects the acf and pacf differently. The acf will show a gradual decay or oscillation depending on the model parameters, while the pacf will cut off after lag 1. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B, which includes statements ii) and iii)."
