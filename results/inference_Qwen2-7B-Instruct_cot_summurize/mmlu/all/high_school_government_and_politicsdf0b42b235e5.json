Evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Democratic than are non-religious Americans.\n\nHistorically, evangelical Christians in the United States have tended to vote Republican rather than Democratic. This is partly due to differences in policy preferences, with Republicans often aligning more closely with evangelical values on issues such as abortion, religious freedom, and traditional marriage. However, it's important to note that these voting patterns can vary significantly based on region, specific policy issues, and other factors, and there is considerable diversity within both political parties and religious groups."
