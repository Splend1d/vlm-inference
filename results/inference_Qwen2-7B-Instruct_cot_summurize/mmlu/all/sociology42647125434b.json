This implies that many women may choose or be limited to part-time work due to practical considerations like the cost and availability of childcare, which can be a significant barrier for those trying to balance work and family responsibilities. \n\nWhile other factors like B. making a rational choice to combine employment with home-centered lives, D. full-time work not being available in the kinds of occupations they want to enter, and A. part-time jobs paying relatively high wages could also play a role, the emphasis on structural constraints like childcare costs reflects a broader societal issue affecting women's labor market participation."
