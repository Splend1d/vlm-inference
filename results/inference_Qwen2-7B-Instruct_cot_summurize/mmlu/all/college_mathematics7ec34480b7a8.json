According to the properties of limits for sequences of complex numbers, if two sequences \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) and \\(\\{t_n\\}\\) both converge to limits \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) respectively, then their product sequence \\(\\{s_n t_n\\}\\) converges to the product of their limits, \\(st\\). This follows from the algebraic limit theorem.\n\n**Statement 2**: This statement is also true. It refers to a fundamental result in real analysis known as the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that every bounded sequence of real numbers contains a convergent subsequence. The negation of this statement, however, asserts that there exists at least one bounded sequence of real numbers that does not have a convergent subsequence. This is actually false because, according to the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, every bounded sequence of real numbers must have at least one convergent subsequence. However, the statement itself suggests a counterexample or a misunderstanding of the theorem's direct implications, which is why it is stated as true here in the context of being being the negation of a common misunderstanding."
