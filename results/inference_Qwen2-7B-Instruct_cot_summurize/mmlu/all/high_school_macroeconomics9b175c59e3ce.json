This increased demand for the currency leads to its appreciation. Conversely, when interest rates rise less or not at all in another country, its currency may become less attractive to investors compared to the first country, leading to a decrease in demand and potentially causing the currency to depreciate. Therefore, if interest rates rise relatively more in Country A than in Country B, it suggests that Country A's currency is likely to depreciate relative to Country B's currency."
