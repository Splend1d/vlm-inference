One day, while loading a heavy tractor tire onto a truck by himself, he experienced a sharp and excruciating pain in his lower back. He did not report the incident to his employer, but continued to work. A week later, after work, he went to the doctor for treatment. The man then sues his employer, alleging that the employer failed to provide him with adequate assistance, safety equipment, and training to load heavy tractor tires, thereby contributing to his injury. The employer alleges that the man is merely trying to obtain compensation for an old back injury, unrelated to his employment. At trial, the man's doctor testified that the man told her that his back began hurting while he was loading the tire on the truck. The doctor's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as expert testimony.\nB. admissible as a statement for the purposes of medical diagnosis.\nC. inadmissible as a violation of the physicianpatient privilege.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

This exception allows relevant statements made to a healthcare provider during the course of providing or receiving medical care to be admitted into evidence, provided they are necessary to prove a material fact at issue in the case. In this context, the timing and circumstances of the pain's onset could be crucial to establishing a causal link between the man's job duties and his injury."
