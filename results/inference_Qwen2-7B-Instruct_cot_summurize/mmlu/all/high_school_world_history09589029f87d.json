The use of religion to ponder conceptions of the afterlife\n\nBoth passages from ancient texts\u2014the Epic of Gilgamesh from Sumeria around 2100 BCE and The Maxims of Ptahhotep from Egypt around 2400 BCE\u2014explore themes related to the afterlife, morality, and the consequences of one's actions. They do not focus on justifying gender relations, enforce legal norms, or explain social hierarchy directly, although these concepts may be indirectly addressed within the context of societal values and beliefs. Instead, they delve into deeper philosophical and religious ideas about what happens after death, the importance of truth and righteousness, and the divine guidance and punishment for human actions."
