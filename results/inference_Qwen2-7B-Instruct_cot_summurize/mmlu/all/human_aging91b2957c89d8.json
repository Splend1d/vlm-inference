This concept suggests that people with fewer resources or lower positions might adjust their behaviors more frequently in response to environmental demands.\n\nGiven this explanation, option A aligns best with the docility hypothesis:\n\nA. Those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands\n\nThis choice encapsulates the core idea that individuals who may lack the necessary skills, resources, or power are more susceptible to being influenced by external factors or demands placed upon them."
