Lack of small intestinal lactase\n\nThe individual in question is experiencing symptoms related to consuming dairy products (specifically, abdominal cramps and diarrhea after drinking milk. This is indicative of lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance occurs when an individual lacks sufficient lactase enzyme in their small intestine to digest lactose, which is the primary sugar found in milk and other dairy products. When lactose is not properly digested, it can lead to the symptoms described.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not directly relate to the symptoms presented:\n\n- A. Bacterial and yeast overgrowth in the small intestine could potentially cause similar symptoms but is not the most likely explanation based on the information provided.\n- B. Lack of pancreatic amylase would affect carbohydrate digestion rather than specifically lactose digestion.\n- D. Lack of small intestinal sucrase-isomaltase affects the digestion of disaccharides like sucrose, not lactose.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most likely cause of the student's problem."
