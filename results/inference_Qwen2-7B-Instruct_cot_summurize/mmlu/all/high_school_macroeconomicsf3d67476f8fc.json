Credit cards. \n\nMI stands for \"Money Illusion,\" which refers to the tendency of people to focus on nominal ( or face value amounts of money rather than real or purchasing power values. Credit cards, while they involve transactions that can be measured in monetary terms, do not directly represent a form of money themselves. They are a tool used to facilitate transactions and are backed by the funds deposited into the user's account or credit limit extended by the issuer. Thus, credit cards are not considered a component of the money supply, unlike coins, paper money, and travelers' checks which are all forms of money."
