They were laughing as they pushed and pulled each other, trying to get the ball and keep it away from each other. Just as a car approached on the street, the girl lost her balance and fell off the sidewalk and into the street. The driver of the car tried to swerve to avoid her, but ran over her leg.

However, the question seems to imply that the primary focus is on the driver's potential liability, which raises considerations about the actions leading up to the incident.\n\nThe key factors that could influence the outcome are:\n\n1. **Driver's Responsibility**: If the driver was driving within the speed limit and took reasonable measures to avoid hitting the girl ( e.g., applying brakes, swerving, etc., they might argue that they cannot be held responsible for the accident.\n\n2. **Boy's Negligence**: The question specifically mentions that the girl \"lost her balance and fell off the sidewalk and into the street.\" If it can be proven that the boy negligently pushed or otherwise acted in a way that caused the girl to lose her balance and fall into the street, the boy's actions could potentially shift some or all of the blame onto him rather than the driver.\n\n3. **Contributory Negligence**: Depending on the jurisdiction, the legal principle of contributory negligence could apply, where if the plaintiff (in this case, the girl) is found to have contributed to their own injury, they may not be able to recover any damages. This principle is less common today, as many jurisdictions use modified comparative negligence, where the plaintiff can still recover damages even if they were partially at fault, as long as they are not more than 50% responsible for their injuries.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer choice would be B. The girl's parents would most likely prevail in a lawsuit against the driver unless it can be proven that the girl fell due to the boy's negligent actions, which would then potentially absolve the driver of liability."
