A calcium atom does not contain an equal number of protons and neutrons; the number of neutrons can vary, leading to different isotopes of calcium.\nB. Calcium has 20 protons, but it also has 20 electrons in a neutral atom (since the number of protons determines the number of electrons in a neutral atom). However, the statement incorrectly counts both protons and neutrons as part of the electron count.\nC. This statement accurately describes the basic components of an atom: protons, neutrons, and electrons. In the case of calcium, it has 20 protons, which also determines its atomic number and position on the periodic table. The number of neutrons can vary, leading to different isotopes of calcium, but the electrons will adjust to balance the positive charge of the protons.\nD. The mass of an atom is not simply a constant value like 40.078 u for all calcium atoms. The atomic mass (40.078 u for calcium-40 is an average value that takes into account the different isotopes of calcium and their natural abundance. For example, calcium-40 makes up about 93% of all calcium, while calcium-42 makes up about 1% and calcium-43 makes up about 6%."
