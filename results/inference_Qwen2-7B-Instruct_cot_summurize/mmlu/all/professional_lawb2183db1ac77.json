Involuntary intoxication.\n\nInvoluntary intoxication occurs when a defendant is unknowingly exposed to an intoxicating substance, and as a result, loses control and commits a crime. This defense can be used to argue that the defendant did not intend to commit the act, and should not be held fully responsible for their actions due to being being unable to understand the consequences of their actions because they were unaware of the substance's presence.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that laws regarding involuntary intoxication vary significantly between jurisdictions. Some places require the intoxication to be so strong that it negates the defendant's ability to form any intent ( whereas others might only consider it a mitigating factor in sentencing, but not a complete defense.\n\nOption A, voluntary intoxication, typically does not excuse criminal behavior in most legal systems, although there may be some exceptions in certain jurisdictions where it could be used to argue diminished capacity or lack of intent.\n\nOption B, Irresistible Impulse, is a defense that is used when the defendant claims they had no control over their actions due to a compulsion or irresistible urge. It's often used in cases of sexual offenses, but it's not commonly used for violent crimes like murder.\n\nOption D, Ignorance or Mistake, could potentially apply if the defendant can prove that they were genuinely unaware that the punch contained PCP, and thus, could not have foreseen the potential for violent behavior as a result of consuming it. However, this defense alone may not necessarily exonerate the defendant from all charges, especially in a case involving homicide.\n\nIn conclusion, while each of these defenses has its merits, C. Involuntary Intoxication seems to be the most directly applicable to the given scenario, provided that the defendant can successfully demonstrate that they were unaware of the intoxicant's presence and that it led to their inability to control their actions."
