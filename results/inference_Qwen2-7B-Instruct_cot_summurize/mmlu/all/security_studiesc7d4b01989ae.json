In light of the difficulties Western democracies have - sustaining popular support in conflicts not threatening their vital interests - opponents will regard Western threats to fight a prolonged war in such a scenario as a bluff. In practice this means that the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.\nB. To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient. A deadline of compliance must accompany it. It follows that a failure to set a deadline for compliance will be interrelated as evidence that the coercer lacks the will to implement the threat.\nC. Assurance against new demands must be included to enhance the prospects of success. The incentive to comply will be significantly reduced if fears are justifiably present.\nD. All of these options. To make non-compliance too costly the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary to deny him his objectives quickly and with little costs. The threat is designed to accomplish two things: fear of unacceptable escalation; to make the threat credible.\n"

                    "text": "The Ideal Policy framework, developed by political scientist John M. Owen, provides a comprehensive understanding of the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy actions. This framework emphasizes several key elements that are crucial for the effectiveness of such strategies. Here's how the Ideal Policy framework aligns with each of your options:\n\nA. **Military Superiority and Denial of Opponent\u2019s Agenda**: The Ideal Policy framework underscores the importance of the coercing party having a clear military advantage over the adversary. This superiority allows the coercer to prevent the opponent from realizing its strategic goals and imposing costs that directly threaten its interests. In scenarios where Western democracies might struggle to sustain popular support in conflicts not directly threatening their vital interests, the presence of military superiority becomes even more critical. It ensures that the opponent perceives the threat as credible and serious.\n\nB. **Credibility through Deadlines and Military Capability**: The framework highlights that threats must be accompanied by deadlines for compliance and the requisite military capability to enforce them. This element of urgency and immediacy enhances the credibility of the coercive action. Without a clear deadline, an opponent may interpret the lack of one as a sign of the coercer's unwillingness or inability to follow through with the threat. This can undermine the effectiveness of the diplomatic pressure.\n\nC. **Assurance against New Demands and Fear of Escalation**: The Ideal Policy framework also stresses the importance of providing assurance that the coercer will not impose additional demands or escalate the situation once the initial threat has been addressed. This helps in reducing the opponent's fear of further entanglement or increased costs. By assuring the opponent of the limits of the coercive action, the framework encourages a more willing response from the adversary.\n\nD. **All of These Options**: The Ideal Policy framework indeed supports all the options you've outlined. It posits that for coercive diplomacy to be successful, it must incorporate military superiority, credible threats with clear deadlines, and assurances that the action will not lead to further demands or escalation. Together, these elements work to make the cost of non-compliance prohibitively high, thereby increasing the likelihood of the opponent complying with the desired outcome. The framework's emphasis on these components reflects a holistic approach to ensuring the coercive action is both effective and credible in achieving its strategic objectives."
