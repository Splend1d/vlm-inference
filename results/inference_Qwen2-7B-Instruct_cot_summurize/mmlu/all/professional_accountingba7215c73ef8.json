Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.\n\nThis approach alignss with generally accepted accounting principles ( (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards ( (IFRS), as it recognizes the asset's potential for generating future economic benefits and allocates the cost over the period those benefits are expected to be received. This ensures that the financial statements reflect the economic reality of the asset's usage and the company's investment in research and development."
