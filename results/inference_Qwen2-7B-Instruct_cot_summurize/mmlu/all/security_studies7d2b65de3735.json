The fear that cooperation may be recurring.\n\nThis statement is not a valid reason for a governmental regime to be reluctant to fully join the liberalist camp. Fear of recurrence of cooperation is not a characteristic or a reason specific to liberalism or the liberalist camp. Cooperation, whether it recurs or not, can occur between any two parties regardless of their ideological alignment. \n\nOn the contrary, the liberalist camp generally promotes international cooperation and the rule of law, which could potentially lead to recurring cooperative relationships if all parties abide by agreed-upon rules and norms. This is often seen as a strength rather than a deterrent in the liberalist framework, promoting stability, peace, and mutual benefits among nations.\n\nValid reasons for a governmental regime to be reluctant to fully embrace liberalism might include:\n\nA. The dominance of Western ideologies can indeed be perceived as a form of contemporary imperialism, as liberal values and policies prescriptions might originate from Western countries with their own historical and cultural biases.\n\nB. Liberalism does advocate for the enforcement of certain values, such as democracy, human rights, and free markets, which may not align with all political regimes, especially those with different cultural backgrounds, historical experiences, or governance structures.\n\nD. Adherence to liberalism does not inherently guarantee favorable treatment of state regimes over their citizens or ensure security against threats from other states. However, the liberalist approach often emphasizes the protection of individual liberties and the rule of law, which can indirectly contribute to societal security within a state. The concern about other states' intentions to threaten regime security is more related to geopolitical tensions, power dynamics, and strategic interests, rather than an intrinsic feature of liberalism itself."
