This means the therapist should be authentic, honest, and non-defensive in their approach. They should not hide behind a facade or pretend to be someone they're not. They should be true to themselves, express their thoughts and feelings openly, and accept the client as they are, without judgment or preconceived notions. This authenticity helps create an environment of trust and openness, which is crucial for effective therapy according to Rogers' theory."
