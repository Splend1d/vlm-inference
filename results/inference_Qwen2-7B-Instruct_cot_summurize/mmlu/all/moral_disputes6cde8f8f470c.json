Therefore, if it were known that a policy would wipe out several animal species without negatively affecting human beings, Baxter would most likely say that:\n\nB. this policy is morally problematic because it damages the integrity of the ecosystem.\n\nThis choice reflects an understanding that ecosystems are interconnected and that the loss of any species can have unforeseen consequences for the balance and health of the entire system. Baxter might also argue against policies A, as the environment does not exist for human use alone but has intrinsic value. Choice C is unlikely given his commitment to biodiversity conservation, and choice D is clearly at odds with his ethical perspective on the value of all life."
