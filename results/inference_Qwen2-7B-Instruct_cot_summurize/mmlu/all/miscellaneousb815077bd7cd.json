It primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract causing severe vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and death if not treated promptly. While cats can also be affected by parvovirus, they typically have a better chance of surviving the disease than dogs do. Birds, such as parrots or finches, are not typically vaccinated against parvovirus because it is not a common cause of illness in these species. Hamsters are can also get parvovirus but it's less common than in dogs.\n\nSo, among the options given, dogs are the household pet that should be vaccinated for parvovirus."
