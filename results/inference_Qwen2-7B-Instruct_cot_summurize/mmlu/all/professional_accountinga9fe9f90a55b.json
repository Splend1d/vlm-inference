One.\n\nWhen a taxpayer purchases an insurance policy and names themselves as the insured while designating their beneficiaries, no gift is made for gift tax purposes at the time of purchase since they retain control over the policy.

Since only one gift is made per taxable year for each beneficiary (for each donor, the correct answer is that one gift has been made for gift tax purposes."
