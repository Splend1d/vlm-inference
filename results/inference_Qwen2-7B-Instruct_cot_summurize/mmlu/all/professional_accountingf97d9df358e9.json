                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Salaries Expense**: Lind Co. pays $10,000 every other Friday.\n2. **Work Schedule**: Employees work for 10 days each pay period ( (no work on weekends).\n3. **Last Payroll Date**: Paid on June 18.\n4. **Balance Before Accruals on June 30**: $14,000.\n\nThe first step is to understand how many days are have passed since the last payday (June 18, up until June 30.\n\n- From June 19 to June 30 gives us 12 days ( (including both June 30 and the day after the last payday).\n\nSince the employees work for 10 days per pay period, and we've had 12 working days from the last payday to June 30, it means that the company has accrued for 2 days' worth of salaries ( (since 12 days / 10 days per pay period = 1.2 pay periods, which translates to 2 days of salaries since they pay every other Friday).\n\nGiven that the last payday was was for $10,000, and we need to accrue for an additional 2 days' worth of salaries, we calculate the additional amount as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Additional Salaries Expense} = \\frac{\\$10,000}{10 \\text{ days}} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = \\$2,000 \\]\n\nSo, the total salaries expense for the month of June, considering the balance before accruals and the additional accrual, would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = \\$14,000 + \\$2,000 = \\$16,000 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation does not directly match any of the options provided, indicating there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options given. Given the correct approach to solving the problem based on the information provided, the closest option to our calculated total (\\$16,000) is not listed among A ($24,000), B ($22,000), C ($20,000), and D ($18,000). \n\nIf the goal was was was was was to find the total expenses reported in the income statement for June, considering the accrual and the balance before accruals, the correct answer should be derived from understanding that the question might have intended to ask for the total expenses including the accrual, not just the additional accrual amount. Based on the information provided and the typical accounting practices, the correct interpretation for the total expenses for the month, including the accrual, should align with recalculating the full accrual properly:\n\nGiven the last payday was was for $10,000, and the company accrues for the entire pay period (which is $10,000, regardless of the number of days worked in between paydays, because the question seems to imply that the $14,000 already includes some portion of the current pay period's salary expenses.\n\nTherefore, if the balance before accruals was was was $14,000 and this represents part of the current pay period's salary expenses, plus the full amount due for the next payday ( (which is also $10,000), the total amount to be reported for the month, considering the accrual, would actually be the sum of these two amounts:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Expenses for the Month} = \\$14,000 + \\$10,000 = \\$24,000 \\]\n\nHence, the correct answer, based on this interpretation, is **A. $24,000**."
