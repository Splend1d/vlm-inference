Wrong, Not wrong\n\nPouring water on the stage before a performance is generally considered disrespectful and could cause harm or damage, especially if the dancers are barefoot or if it affects the performance. This action could be seen as morally wrong because it potentially disrupts someone else's work or event without their consent.\n\nAsking for directions to a public facility when there isn't one available nearby is a reasonable request and does not infringe upon anyone else's rights or cause any harm. It is not considered morally wrong in this context."
