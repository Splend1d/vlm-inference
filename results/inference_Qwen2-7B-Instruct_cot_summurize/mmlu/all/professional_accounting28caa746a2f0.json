However, the basis of the stock received is generally limited to the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the property at the time it is contributed to the corporation or (2) the stock's adjusted basis to the transferor.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- The fair market value of the equipment is $20,000.\n- The basis of the equipment is $6,000.\n- There is also $12,000 of liability associated with the equipment.\n\nWhen determining the gain, we consider the liability as part of the contribution since the corporation assumes the liability. Therefore, the basis limitation for the stock received is the lesser of the fair market value ($20,000) minus the liability ($12,000), which equals $8,000.\n\nThus, the shareholder must recognize a gain of $8,000 ($20,000 - $12,000 - $6,000 basis)."
