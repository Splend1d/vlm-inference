There have been several devastating earthquakes that caused significant loss of life, including the 1976 Tangshan earthquake in China, which killed an estimated 240,000 people, and the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake in Indonesia, which triggered a tsunami and resulted in over 230,000 deaths. However, it's important to note that the exact number of deaths attributed to each type of natural disaster can be difficult to determine precisely due to various factors such as reporting difficulties, undercounting, and differences in how data is collected and analyzed."
