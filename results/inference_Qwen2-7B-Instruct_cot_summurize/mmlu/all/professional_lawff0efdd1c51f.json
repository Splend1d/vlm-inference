Which of the following states the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between theparties?\n\nA. There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\nB. There is no enforceable contract, because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake asto a basic assumption.\nC.

There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\n\nIn this scenario, there is a clear disagreement over the price term, which is a crucial element of any contract. The buyer intended to offer $2,000 per acre, while the owner accepted it based on the miscommunication that it was $2,200 per acre. Since they did not agree on the price, there is no binding contract formed under the law, even though both parties believed they were entering into an agreement."
