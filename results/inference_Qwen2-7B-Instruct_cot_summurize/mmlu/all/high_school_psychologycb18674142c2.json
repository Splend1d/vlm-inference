                    "text": "The \"visual cliff\" experiment, developed by psychologist Diana Baumrind and her colleagues, was designed to test infants' perception of depth and their ability to discern between different levels of space based on visual cues. The experiment typically involves placing an infant on a platform above a visually divided space, with one side appearing more shallow (or less deep) than the other. This setup mimics the visual cliff, which is a situation where a person could potentially fall into a void.\n\nThrough this experiment, researchers have found that:\n\nB. Infants, particularly those around 6 months of age, show a reluctance to move towards the deeper side of the visual cliff, even when rewards are offered. This behavior indicates that they can perceive depth and understand the potential risk of falling off the edge, suggesting they are using some form of visual depth cues.\n\nIt's important to note that while the visual cliff primarily tests the infant's ability to perceive depth using visual cues, it doesn't specifically address whether infants use monocular or binocular cues. Monocular cues are information that can be gathered from one eye (such as texture gradient, linear perspective, and relative size, while binocular cues involve information from both eyes, such as disparity and convergence, which help us perceive depth in three dimensions. Infants do have some depth perception abilities before they develop stereoscopic vision ( which relies on binocular cues - usually around 8-9 months of age.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most accurate statement based on the visual cliff experiment."
