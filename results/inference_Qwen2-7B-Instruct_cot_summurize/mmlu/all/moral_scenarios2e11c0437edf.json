However, driving while significantly impaired by sleepiness could be considered dangerous and potentially illegal, depending on local laws regarding drowsy driving. The primary focus here should be on finding a safe way to travel rather than driving when one is too sleepy to do so safely.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it is morally wrong to omit an ingredient (like peanuts) from a meal without informing the person with the allergy or getting explicit consent, especially if the person has a severe allergy and could suffer anaphylaxis or other serious health consequences. This action can be seen as reckless and potentially harmful, violating the duty of care one owes to others, particularly those with known medical conditions that require special attention."
