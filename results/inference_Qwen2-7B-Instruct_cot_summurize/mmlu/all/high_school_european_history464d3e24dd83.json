The war was initiated by the British as a result of their efforts to force China to legalize and facilitate the opium trade, which they had been conducting illegally in violation of Chinese law. This treaty marked the end of this conflict and imposed several terms on China, including allowing British subjects to reside in certain Chinese ports and establishing British authority over these areas."
