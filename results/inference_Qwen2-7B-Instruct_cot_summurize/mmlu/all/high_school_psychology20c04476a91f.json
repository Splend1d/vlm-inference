Cathy Cooper, who is an empathic counselor who encourages clients through unconditional support to find their own path to better health and growth.\n\nCarl Rogers was a key figure in humanistic psychology, known for his client-centered therapy approach. His core principles include empathy ( (the ability to understand and share the feelings of another), congruence ( (the alignment between a person's thoughts, feelings, and actions), and unconditional positive regard ( (the therapist's acceptance of the client, regardless of what the client does or believes). These principles are closely aligned with Cathy Cooper's description, where she provides support, encouragement, and fosters personal growth by allowing clients to find their own path."
