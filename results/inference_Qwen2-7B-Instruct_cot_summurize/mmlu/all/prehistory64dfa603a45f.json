Obsidian tools: Obsidian is a volcanic glass that cannot be found within the Indus Valley but can be found in deposits in the region around Mesopotamia. The presence of these obsidian tools at Indus Valley sites suggests that there was a trade relationship where the Indus Valley civilizations imported this valuable material for tool-making.\n\nB. Glass beads, copper, and gold from Mesopotamia: These materials have been found at archaeological sites in the Indus Valley, indicating that there was a flow of goods from Mesopotamia to the Indus Valley. This trade would have involved the exchange of precious metals like gold, as well as decorative items such as glass beads.\n\nC. Harappan seals found in Mesopotamia and Mesopotamian cylinder seals found in the Indus Valley: Seals were an important part of administrative and trade practices in both regions. The discovery of Harappan seals in Mesopotamia and Mesopotamian cylinder seals in the Indus Valley suggests that there was a direct or indirect exchange of cultural and trade items between the two regions.\n\nTherefore, all of these findings provide strong evidence for the existence of trade and cultural exchange between the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia during their respective periods."
