It established a national origins quota system based on the 1890 census, which allocated\u540d\u989d to immigrants from different regions groups. The act aimed to restrict immigration from southern and eastern Europe and limit the number of immigrants from Asia. However, it did include provisions for family reunification, allowing immigrants to bring their spouses and minor children who were already living in the United States.\n\nThe other options listed do not accurately describe the impact of the 1924 Immigration Act:\n\nA. The act did not specifically suspend further immigration from Latin America; instead, it limited immigration from all regions but had more stringent quotas for certain areas like southern and eastern Europe and Asia.\n\nB. The act did not make it illegal for employers to hire or recruit undocumented workers. It focused on limiting the number of legal immigrants rather than addressing the issue of unauthorized employment.\n\nD. While the act did reduce immigration quotas, leading to a decline in immigration, it was not as dramatic as some other periods in U.S. history, such as during World War II when immigration was further restricted by executive orders."
