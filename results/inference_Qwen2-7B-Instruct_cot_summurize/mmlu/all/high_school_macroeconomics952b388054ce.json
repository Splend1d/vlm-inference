Mary, who quit her job to look for another, is considered unemployed because she is willing and able to work (even though she is in between jobs), which meets the criteria for unemployment.\n\nIII. Diane, who works part-time but would like to work full-time, is also considered unemployed because she is willing and able to work more hours, which means she could potentially be working full-time if the opportunity were available. \n\nII. John, who retired at age 45, is not considered unemployed as retirement typically involves choosing not to work, rather than being unable or unwilling to work.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect based on the standard definitions of unemployment."
