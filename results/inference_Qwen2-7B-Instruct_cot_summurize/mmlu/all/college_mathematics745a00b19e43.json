Let's apply this definition to our function:\n\n\\[f(xy) = a(xy)a^2\\]\n\nBy the associative property of groups, we can rearrange the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[= (axy)a^2\\]\n\nNow, let's apply the function to \\(x\\) and then \\(y\\):\n\n\\[f(x)f(y) = axa^2 \\cdot aya^2\\]\n\n\\[= axa^2aya^2\\]\n\n\\[= a(xy)a^2\\] (by associativity)\n\nThis shows that \\(f(xy) = f(x)f(y)\\), so \\(f\\) is indeed a homomorphism.\n\nNow, let's see which option this leads us to:\n\nA. G is abelian - This isn't necessarily true based on the given condition; homomorphisms don't generally imply that the group is abelian.\n\nB. G = {e} - This is also not necessarily true; a group could be non-trivial and still satisfy the homomorphism condition.\n\nC. \\(a^3 = e\\) - This condition doesn't directly relate to the homomorphism property. While it could be satisfied in some cases where \\(f\\) is a homomorphism, it's not a necessary or sufficient condition for \\(f\\) to be a homomorphism based on the given mapping.\n\nD. \\(a^2 = a\\) - This condition implies that \\(a\\) is an idempotent element under multiplication. When \\(f\\) is applied, since \\(f(x) = axa^2\\), and given \\(a^2 = a\\), we have:\n\n\\[f(x) = axa^2 = axa\\]\n\nThis means that applying \\(f\\) twice to any element \\(x\\) gives the same result as applying it once, which is a direct consequence of \\(a^2 = a\\). This condition ensures that the mapping \\(f\\) behaves consistently across elements of the group, satisfying the homomorphism property without introducing unnecessary complications.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. \\(a^2 = a\\)**."
