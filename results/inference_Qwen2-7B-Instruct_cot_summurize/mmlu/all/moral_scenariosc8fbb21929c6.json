Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, taking a credit card from someone else's wallet without permission is considered theft or unauthorized use of property, which is morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, feeding wet cat food to an infant might not be nutritionally appropriate or safe, depending on the specific content and ingredients of the cat food. However, the act itself\u2014feeding an infant\u2014is generally seen as necessary and morally required to care for their well-being. The specific issue here is the choice of food, not the act of feeding itself. Without further information about the infant's health or the exact nature of the cat food being used, it's difficult to categorically state that this action is \"wrong\" under all circumstances, but it could potentially be harmful and thus morally questionable. \n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the first scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing, while the second scenario might not necessarily be morally wrong if other appropriate actions were taken to ensure the infant's nutritional needs were met."
