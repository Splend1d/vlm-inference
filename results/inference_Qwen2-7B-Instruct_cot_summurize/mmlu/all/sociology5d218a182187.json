This typically involves the child spending a significant amount of time with each parent, although the specific schedule can vary widely depending on the agreement between the parents and any court orders. The goal is for both parents to play an active role in their child's life, making decisions together about important aspects of the child's upbringing.\n\nIt's important to note that while joint parenthood aims for cooperation and shared responsibility, it doesn't necessarily mean that parents must provide for their children in exactly equal measures financially or otherwise. Financial contributions, for example, may depend on each parent's income, living situation, and other factors."
