True, False.\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1: The inequality \\(H[x, y] \\geq H[x] + H[y]\\) is actually related to the concept of mutual information and not directly to the entropy function in the way it's stated. The correct relation involving entropies for two random variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is given by:\n\\[H[x, y] = H[x] + H[y] - I[x; y]\\]\nwhere \\(I[x; y]\\) is the mutual information between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Mutual information is non-negative, which means that \\(I[x; y] \\geq 0\\). Therefore, the original statement is not generally true as written because it incorrectly suggests an inequality in the opposite direction. It should be corrected to reflect the relationship involving mutual information instead.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is false. Moralization of a directed graph ( involves connecting all the parents of each node with undirected edges and then removing the arrowheads from the directed edges. However, this process does not decrease the number of edges in the graph. In fact, it can increase the number of edges if there were no edges between the parents of certain nodes before moralization."
