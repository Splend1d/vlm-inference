Heterozygosity, on the other hand, refers to having two different alleles at a locus.\n\nGiven that 46% of the loci are heterozygous, this means that for each locus, there is a 46% chance of finding an individual with two different alleles (and therefore, a 54% chance of finding an individual with two identical alleles (since 100% - 46% = 54%).\n\nHowever, calculating the overall average homozygosity across all loci requires considering the probability of homozygosity at each locus and summing these probabilities.\n\nThe probability of being homozygous at any locus is 54% or 0.54. Since we're considering an entire species' gene pool and assuming each locus operates independently, we can't simply multiply this by the number of loci because the question asks for the \"average\" or \"overall\" homozygosity.\n\nInstead, let's understand it as follows:\n\n- For any given locus, there's a 54% chance an individual will be homozygous.\n- If we consider the species as a whole, the question implies looking for the average proportion of individuals that are homozygous across all loci. \n\nGiven the information provided, the answer would be:\n\nC. 54%\n\nThis assumes that for every locus, there's a 54% chance of observing a homozygous state, regardless of the number of loci considered."
