Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis.\n\nPsoriatic arthropathy, which is part of psoriatic disease, can affect the joints and lead to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and stiffness. It often presents with asymmetrical joint involvement, meaning that the joints on one side of the body are affected more than those on the other side. \n\nWhile psoriatic disease typically includes skin manifestations such as plaques of psoriasis, the absence of these plaques does not necessarily exclude the diagnosis of psoriatic arthropathy if other symptoms or signs are present ( so option A is incorrect.\n\nThe diagnosis of psoriatic arthropathy is usually made based on clinical findings, including joint symptoms, skin lesions, and nail changes, rather than through a specific blood marker. So option B is also incorrect.\n\nTophi, which are small nodules of calcium deposits, are more commonly associated with gout or rheumatoid arthritis, not psoriatic arthropathy. Thus, option C is not accurate.\n\nNail pitting, where the nails appear to have small indentations or pits, is indeed one of the characteristic features of psoriatic disease, particularly in psoriatic arthropathy. This is because psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis can both affect the nails, leading to specific nail changes like pitting, thickening, or separation from the nail bed. Therefore, option D is correct."
