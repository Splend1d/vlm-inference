                    "text": "A defendant was booked on a commercial airline flight. When the defendant arrived at the airport, two undercover police narcotics agents observed him. His appearance and actions led the police to believe that he fit the description of a predetermined profile of a drug courier. The officers approached the defendant and told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. The defendant asked what for, and the police explained that they were narcotics agents assigned to the airport and that he fit the profile of a drug courier. They then asked the defendant to hand over his overnight bag. The defendant refused. The officers then explained that he wouldn't be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected the contents of his bag. The defendant told the officers that he changed his mind and decided not to fly today after all. The officers still requested that the defendant turn his overnight bag over to them. The defendant did so, and then he was given permission to leave the airport. The next day, the police had a dog sniff the defendant's bag for narcotics. The results of this search gave police suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics. They opened the defendant's bag and found heroin inside. The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. At trial, the defendant's attorney moves to prevent introduction of the heroin into evidence. This motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.\nB. granted, because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.\nC. denied, because the defendant fit the predetermined profile of a narcotics courier.\nD. denied, because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.\n"

                    "text": "D. denied, because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. However, there are various exceptions to this rule, one of which is the \"airport exception.\" This exception allows law enforcement to conduct searches of luggage and persons at airports without probable cause or a warrant, provided the search is reasonable under the circumstances. \n\nIn the scenario presented, the police had reasonable suspicion based on the defendant's appearance and actions, fitting the predetermined profile of a drug courier. This allowed them to detain the defendant for questioning and request the inspection of his bag. The defendant's subsequent refusal to comply with this request led to the police explaining that he would not be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected his bag. This detention and request for the bag's inspection were reasonable under the circumstances and thus constituted a lawful airport detention.\n\nFurthermore, the use of a drug-sniffing dog to further investigate the contents of the bag does not violate the Fourth Amendment as long as it is conducted in a manner consistent with the lawfulness of the initial detention. In this case, the dog's sniff was performed in a public area of the airport, where such searches are typically permitted, and it did not involve any invasion of the defendant's privacy beyond the scope of the lawful detention.\n\nTherefore, the motion to exclude the heroin as evidence is most likely to be denied because the search was conducted within the bounds of a lawful airport detention, and the subsequent use of the dog to sniff the bag was also reasonable."
