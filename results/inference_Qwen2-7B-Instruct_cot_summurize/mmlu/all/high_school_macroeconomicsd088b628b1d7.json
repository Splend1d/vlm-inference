The sale of cucumbers to a pickle manufacturer fits this definition as it involves the production of a good (pickles) which can be sold in the market.\n\nA. The cash you receive from babysitting your neighbor\u2019s kids is not counted in GDP because it is not considered an economic transaction between businesses or entities that contribute to the economy's output.\n\nB. The sale of illegal drugs is not counted in GDP because illegal activities do not contribute to the official economic output recognized by governments.\n\nD. The sale of a pound of tomatoes at a supermarket would typically be included in GDP, but since the question specifies \"the sale\" rather than \"production,\" it might imply only the retail transaction. However, for the sake of completeness, both the production and the retail sale would usually be included in GDP calculations, reflecting the contribution of agriculture and retail sectors respectively."
