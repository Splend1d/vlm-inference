The fee shall be $10 per hour, with a maximum fee of $50;Section 3: Permits shall be issued on a first come basis; provided that the chief of police shall deny any application if, after hearing the applicant, it is his considered judgment that (a) the meeting would create serious traffic congestion, or (b) interfere with public enjoyment of the park, or (c) speakers at the meeting would advocate the commission of crime. \"A religious fundamentalist who believes that other religions should be violently resisted, planned to hold a protest demonstration against other religions at a city park on July 25. Although his previous anti-religion protest rallies attracted fewer than 25 demonstrators, he decided to apply for a permit pursuant to the city's ordinance. After meeting with the fundamentalist, the chief of police denied his permit application because he believed that the demonstration would incite the protestors and threaten imminent violence or serious disorder. On July 25, the fundamentalist and his fellow demonstrators staged their protest at a city park. The rally attracted only about 20 protestors and was conducted peacefully. As he was making his final remarks to the gathering, the city police arrived at the park and arrested him and his fellow demonstrators charging them with violating the city ordinance. If the fundamentalist now brings suit to challenge the constitutionality of Section 3 of the city ordinance, his best argument would be that\n\nA. the section is void for vagueness and overbreadth.\nB. the section is content based.\nC. the section permits the police chief to exercise unbridled discretion in approving or disapproving permits.\nD. the section does not fall within the area of compelling state interest.\n"

Such broad criteria can lead to arbitrary enforcement and may not provide clear guidelines for applicants, potentially leading to overly vague outcomes. Additionally, the term \"interfere with public enjoyment\" is vague and could be interpreted in a wide variety of ways, potentially leading to overbreadth issues where the law applies to a much larger number of cases than intended. The fundamentalist might argue that these vague and broad provisions violate due process rights by not providing sufficient notice or guidance for lawful conduct and by allowing the police chief to exercise discretion in a manner that could be discriminatory or inconsistent."
