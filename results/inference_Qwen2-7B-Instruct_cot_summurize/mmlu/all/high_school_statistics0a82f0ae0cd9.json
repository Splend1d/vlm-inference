                    "text": "To determine which statement is false, let's analyze each set:\n\n**Set X:** {10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90\n\n**Set Y:** :10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90\n\n**Median:**\n- For **Set X**, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th values since it has an odd number of elements. So, the median is ( (45 + 50) / 2 = 47.5.\n- For **Set Y**, the median is also the average of the 3rd and 4th values. So, the median is ( (35 + 50) / 2 = 42.5.\n\nTherefore, **A. The sets have identical medians** is false.\n\n**Mean:**\n- For **Set X**, the mean is ( (10 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90) / 7 = 385 / 7 = 55.\n- For **Set Y**, the mean is ( (10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90) / 7 = 340 / 7 = 48.5714...\n\nTherefore, **B. The sets have identical means** is also false.\n\n**Range:**\n- For **Set X**, the range is the difference between the highest and lowest values, so the range is 90 - 10 = 80.\n- For **Set Y**, the range is also the difference between the highest and lowest values, so the range is 90 - 10 = 80.\n\nTherefore, **C. The sets have identical ranges** is true.\n\nSo, the false statements are A and B. However, since the question asks for a single false statement, and D does not accurately reflect this situation as both A and B are false, there seems to be a misunderstanding in interpreting the answer choices given the analysis. Based on the provided options, the correct interpretation would suggest selecting the option that directly contradicts the analysis, which would be either A or B. Given the direct answer choices:\n\nThe false statement is **A. The sets have identical medians**."
