At this point, further increases in aggregate demand (the total spending in an economy for all final goods and services) will not lead to higher output because resources are already fully utilized. Instead, these additional demands will put more pressure on existing resources, causing firms to raise prices rather than increase production. This leads to inflation as the cost of goods and services rises without a corresponding rise in the quantity of goods and services produced. Therefore, while aggregate demand increases, the unemployment rate remains unchanged because there are no more unemployed workers to hire, and the price level increases due to the scarcity of resources."
