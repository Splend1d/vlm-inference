                    "text": "The correct answer is A. According to Berkowitz's revision of the frustration-aggression hypothesis, frustration leads to aggression when the individual perceives that acting aggressively is likely to produce desirable outcomes. This means that if someone feels frustrated and believes that engaging in aggressive behavior will lead to a favorable result, they may be more inclined to act aggressively. \n\nBerkowitz argued that this perception of causality between aggression and desirable outcomes can increase the likelihood of aggression as a coping mechanism for managing frustration. It's important to note that this perspective is one interpretation within the broader field of psychology, and different theories may offer varying explanations for the relationship between frustration and aggression."
