This disruption might also cause an increase in the price level if the demand for goods and services exceeds their available supply due to the adverse weather conditions, leading to inflation. \n\nLet's briefly look at the other options:\n\nB. A decrease in the money supply typically leads to higher interest rates, which can reduce investment and consumer spending, causing a decrease in real GDP. However, it does not necessarily cause an increase in the price level; instead, it might lead to deflation or lower inflation if the decrease in spending offsets the effect on prices.\n\nC. A decrease in consumer confidence might lead to reduced spending by consumers, which could decrease aggregate demand and potentially lower both real GDP and the price level through a recessionary gap.\n\nD. An increase in consumer confidence generally leads to increased spending, which boosts aggregate demand, increases real GDP, and may contribute to inflation if the economy is already operating near its capacity. So, this option is less likely to result in a decrease in real GDP and an increase in the price level in the short run."
