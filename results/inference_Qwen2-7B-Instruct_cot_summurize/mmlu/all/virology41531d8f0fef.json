Initiate a fusion 'from without' using virus F protein\n\nParamyxoviruses, which include well-known pathogens like measles virus and mumps virus, use a fusion protein (often named the F protein - to initiate membrane fusion at the site of virus entry. This process allows the viral envelope to fuse with the host cell's plasma membrane or endosomal membrane, releasing the viral genome into the cell. This strategy is often referred to as \"fusion from without\" because the F protein is located on the surface of the virus and mediates the fusion event directly upon binding to its cellular receptor."
