Calcium binding to troponin.\n\nIn skeletal muscle, the initiation of the contractile process is triggered by an increase in the concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+). When the muscle cell receives a signal to contract, such as an action potential from the nervous system, calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a specialized endoplasmic reticulum within the muscle cell. This increase in intracellular calcium concentration binds to troponin, a regulatory protein located on the thin filaments (or actin filaments) of the muscle fiber. The binding of calcium to troponin causes a conformational change that allows myosin, the thick filament protein, to bind to and slide along the actin filaments, leading to muscle contraction."
