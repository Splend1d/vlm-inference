The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts.\n\nAshoka, the third emperor of the Maurya Dynasty, played a significant role in spreading Buddhism throughout his vast empire. After witnessing the\u60e8\u72b6 of the Kalinga War, which he won but deeply regrettedted due to its brutality, Ashoka converted to Buddhism. He then embraced a policy of promoting dharma ( (righteousness), which was closely associated with Buddhist teachings. As part of this policy, Ashoka issued numerous rock edicts and pillar edicts throughout his empire, promoting ethical and moral principles derived from Buddhism. These edicts emphasized non-violence ( (ahimsa), respect for all living beings, and the importance of moral conduct in society.\n\nAshoka's efforts in spreading Buddhism were not limited to his own empire. He sent missionaries to various parts of Asia, including Sri Lanka, where Buddhism continues to flourish today. His support for Buddhism helped it gain widespread acceptance and influence in the region, making it one of the most prominent religions during his reign."
