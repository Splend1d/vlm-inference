However, the specific formulation you've mentioned seems to be attributed to the philosopher Jay Taurek. \n\nIn his 1987 paper \"Who Should Benefit from the Shortage of Organs?\", Taurek argues that if there is a shortage of organs and one person needs an arm transplant to survive while another needs a full-body transplant to survive, then the decision should not be based on who is more deserving or who has a greater right to survival. Instead, he argues, it should be based on the consequences of the action. Specifically, he suggests that the person needing the arm transplant (Y, should be given priority because saving their arm would allow them to continue living, whereas saving the life of the other person (X, would require taking away something they already possess (their arm).\n\nTherefore, according to Taurek's argument:\n- Option A is incorrect because Y does not have an obligation to choose to save X's life; the decision is about maximizing the number of lives saved.\n- Option B is also incorrect for the same reason; the decision is not an obligation to choose saving X's life but rather about the most effective use of available resources to save lives.\n- Option C is incorrect for the reasons stated above.\n- Option D is correct, as neither A nor B accurately represents the position that Taurek argues for.\n\nTaurek's argument is a complex one that challenges traditional views on moral obligations and rights, particularly in cases involving scarce resources and life-saving interventions."
