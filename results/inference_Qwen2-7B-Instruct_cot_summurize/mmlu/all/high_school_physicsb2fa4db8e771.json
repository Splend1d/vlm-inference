Increasing the mass of the ball: This does not affect the period of the pendulum because the period depends only on the length of the pendulum and not on its mass.\n\nB. Decreasing the length of the string: Decreasing the length of the string directly increases the value of \\(L\\) in the formula for the period. Since the period is proportional to the square root of \\(L\\), decreasing \\(L\\) will decrease the period.\n\nC. Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released: This doesn't change the period if the angle is small. The period of a pendulum for small angles is essentially independent of the angle. However, for larger angles, the period does increase slightly, but this isn't an option since it's not stated that the angle is large or that the behavior deviates significantly from small angle approximation.\n\nD. Decreasing the mass of the ball: As mentioned earlier, decreasing the mass of the ball does not affect the period of the pendulum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Decreasing the length of the string."
