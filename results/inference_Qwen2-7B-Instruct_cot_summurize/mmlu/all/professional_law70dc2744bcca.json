The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the retiree and begins formulating plans for constructing single- family dwelling units. The original deed between the retiree and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called tract I. Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would be\n\nA. that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.\nB. that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.\nC. that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.\nD. that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\n"

                    "text": "D. that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe key legal principle here involves the concept of restrictive covenants, which are provisions in a property deed that limit how the land can be used or developed. When a property owner sells a piece of land with such restrictions, these restrictions often bind not just the immediate buyer but also all future owners of that land (and sometimes even adjacent properties, depending on the language of the deed. This is because the restrictions are meant to maintain the character and value of the community by preserving certain uses and aesthetics.\n\nIn this case, the development company purchased the land with the understanding that any future subdivisions would have to adhere to the minimum two-acre lot size for single-family dwellings, based on the original deed between the retiree and the development company. This restriction was conveyed to the buyers of the first tract (tract I.\n\nWhen the development company sold the remaining parcel to the contractor without mentioning the restriction, the contractor proceeded to subdivide the land into smaller lots, violating the original agreement's terms. The restriction in the original deed was intended to apply to all subsequent owners of the land, including those who might purchase the land in the future.\n\nTherefore, if the owners of the lots in tract 1 bring an action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots, and the court agrees that tract 2 should be considered part of the same development scheme (option C), the action would likely succeed. The court would enforce the original deed's restrictions because they are binding on all subsequent grantees, heirs, and assigns, including the current owner of the land (the contractor in this case. The action would not fail due to lack of standing (option A) or lack of privity (option B), as the restriction is enforceable against the contractor based on the original agreement's terms."
