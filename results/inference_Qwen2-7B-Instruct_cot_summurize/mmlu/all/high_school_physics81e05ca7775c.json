The magnetic force acting on a charged particle (in this case, a proton (is given by:\n\n\\[ F = qvB\\sin{\\theta} \\]\n\nwhere \\(q\\) is the charge of the particle ( for a proton \\(q = +e\\), \\(v\\) is the velocity of the particle, \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field.\n\nThis force causes the proton to move in a circular path, as per the Lorentz force law. The radius of this circular path \\(r\\) can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{mv}{qB\\sin{\\theta}} \\]\n\nThe period \\(T\\) of this circular motion is given by:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} = \\frac{2\\pi m}{qvB\\sin{\\theta}} = \\frac{2\\pi m}{qB\\sin{\\theta}} \\]\n\nGiven that the proton enters the magnetic field with an initial speed \\(v_0 = 1.5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) and the angle \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) with the magnetic field of strength \\(B = 1.5 \\, \\text{T}\\), we can calculate the radius \\(r\\) and the period \\(T\\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{m(1.5 \\times 10^6)}{e(1.5)(\\sin{30^\\circ})} \\]\n\\[ r = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^6}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 1.5 \\times \\sin{30^\\circ}} \\]\n\\[ r = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^5}{2.403 \\times 10^{-19}} \\]\n\\[ r = 6.24 \\times 10^{23} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThe period \\(T\\) is:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v_0} = \\frac{2\\pi (6.24 \\times 10^{23}}{1.5 \\times 10^6} \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{3.94 \\times 10^{24}}{1.5 \\times 10^6} \\]\n\\[ T = 2.63 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nNow, since the proton completes one full orbit every \\(T\\) seconds, its speed after \\(t = 4 \\, \\text{s}\\) will be the same as its initial speed because it has completed \\(n = t/T\\) orbits. Therefore, the speed remains unchanged.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s"
