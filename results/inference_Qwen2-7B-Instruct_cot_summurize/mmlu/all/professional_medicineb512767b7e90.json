He is physically active and feels well, but he notes that his asthma has been more active during the past month. He says that he has had to use his albuterol inhaler one to two times daily for wheezing and chest tightness. He has not had gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, productive cough, or fever. Medical history is remarkable for atopic allergies, especially to pollen and cats. He has had coldand exercise-induced asthma for the past 14 years. He takes no other medications. He is 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (200 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 70/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 120/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities except for scattered rhonchi and wheezes with forced expiration. Peak expiratory flow rate is 240 L/min. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\nA. Chest x-ray\nB. Fexofenadine therapy\nC. Increased use of the albuterol inhaler\nD. Initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler\n"

                    "text": "The most appropriate management for this patient would be:\n\nD. Initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest that his asthma may have worsened, particularly with increased use of the albuterol inhaler, which indicates potential inadequate control of asthma. The presence of rhonchi and wheezes, as well as a peak expiratory flow rate below normal, also suggests poor asthma control.\n\nFexofenadine ( (option B) is an antihistamine used for allergy relief and would not address the underlying asthma exacerbation. Increasing the use of the albuterol inhaler ( ( option C) might help manage acute symptoms but does not address long-term control of asthma. Corticosteroids, when administered via inhalation, can effectively reduce inflammation in the airways, leading to better control of asthma symptoms and reducing the need for frequent albuterol use. Therefore, initiating a daily corticosteroid inhaler is the most appropriate step in managing this patient's worsening asthma. \n\nA chest x-ray ( ( option A) might be considered if there were signs of pneumonia or other lung pathology, but it is not typically the first line of management for an asthma exacerbation without clear signs of lung disease."
