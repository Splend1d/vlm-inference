Virtually all small-scale producers engage in some self-provisioning and market sales.\n\nIn many developing countries, farming is often a mix of both subsistence and commercial production. While some farmers may primarily focus on producing enough to meet their own needs (subsistence farming), others will produce surplus crops or livestock for sale in local markets (commercial farming). This dual approach allows farmers to not only ensure food security for their families but also contribute to local economies by generating income from agricultural products. The exact percentages can vary widely depending on location, resources, and local market conditions."
