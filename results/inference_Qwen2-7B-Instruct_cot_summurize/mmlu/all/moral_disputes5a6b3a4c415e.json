Sandel (not Kass, who you might be referring to, have towards human reproductive cloning does not necessarily determine the moral status of the practice. This feeling can be based on cultural, ethical, or personal values and does not provide conclusive evidence for or against the morality of cloning.\n\nOption C is correct: \"has nothing to do with the morality of cloning.\" The morality of cloning is determined by a complex interplay of philosophical arguments, scientific considerations, legal frameworks, and societal values, not solely by individual feelings of disgust or repugnance.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest that one's emotional response conclusively determines the rightness or wrongness of an action, which is not the case in moral philosophy. Option D, while it might suggest that there is something problematic about the cloning practice given the negative reaction, does not directly state that this feeling is the definitive marker of its moral wrongness but rather implies that the issue deserves further examination."
