It assumes that all innate desires are good ones.\n\nCorvino's argument implies that because homosexuality is an innate trait, it must be good and natural. However, this overlooks the fact that what is \"good\" or \"natural\" can be subjective and varies across different cultures, ethical systems, and personal beliefs. Just because something is innate does not automatically make it universally good or desirable. For instance, while some people might be born with a taste for certain foods, it would be incorrect to argue that consuming those foods is universally good or natural without considering factors like health, sustainability, and cultural norms. Similarly, in discussing human sexuality, it's important to consider societal values, ethical frameworks, and individual well-being when evaluating the morality or nature of sexual behaviors."
