At the stationhouse, the man told a police officer that he was prepared to make a confession. The police officer then turned on a video recorder and videotaped the man's confession. At trial, the prosecution called the police officer to testify to the incriminating statements that the man made in his confession. Upon objection by the man's attorney, the police officer's proposed testimony is\n\nA. inadmissible, because the videotape is the best evidence of the man's confession.\nB. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nC. admissible, because the police officer had firsthand knowledge of the confession.\nD. admissible, because the man was given his Miranda rights before the confession was elicited.\n"

In this case, the truth being proven would be the fact that the man committed the robbery. However, the confession itself is not admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule, specifically the excited utterance or present sense impression exceptions, because the confession is made while under custodial interrogation, and the defendant does not have the ability to reflect or deliberate before making the statement. Moreover, the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment requires that the defendant has the right to confront the witness who made the statement. Therefore, the police officer's testimony describing the confession would not be admissible. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the video recording of the confession, if properly authenticated, might be admitted as primary evidence rather than the officer's testimony about it. \n\nOption C is incorrect because, even though the police officer may have witnessed the confession, hearsay rules still apply when the officer recounts the confession in court.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, although the defendant was given his Miranda rights, this does not automatically render all statements made after that point admissible. The voluntariness of the confession must also be considered, and the fact that the defendant was read his rights does not preclude a finding that the confession was coerced or not voluntarily made."
