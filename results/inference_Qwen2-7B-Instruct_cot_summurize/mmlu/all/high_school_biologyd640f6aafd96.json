Relationships between DNA sequences among the species did not match relationships between skeletal patterns.\n\nEvolutionary trees, or phylogenetic trees, represent the evolutionary relationships among various biological species based on similarities and differences in their physical and genetic characteristics. These trees are constructed using both morphological (skeletal, anatomical) and molecular data (DNA, RNA sequences). When there is a discrepancy between the relationships inferred from DNA sequences and those from skeletal patterns, it indicates potential issues with the data or the evolutionary interpretations. This could suggest errors in the analysis, biases in the data collection, or genuine evolutionary complexities that are are not straightforward to reconcile. Such discrepancies often require further investigation and can lead to a deeper understanding of evolutionary processes, but they inherently introduce uncertainty into the evolutionary relationships depicted by the tree."
