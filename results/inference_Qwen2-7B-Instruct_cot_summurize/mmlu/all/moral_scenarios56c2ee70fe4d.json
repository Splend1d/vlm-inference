Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn scenario 1, puttinging expired food into the garbage disposal might not be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. While it might not be the most environmentally friendly action, it could be seen as a common mistake or oversight rather than a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nIn scenario 2, clipping someone else's baby's fingernails and toenails without proper parental consent or knowledge can be viewed as a violation of personal autonomy and bodily integrity, which are are considered important moral principles. This action could be seen as wrong if the individual performing the action did not have the right or permission to make such decisions on behalf of the baby's parents. \n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the first scenario is not wrong while the second scenario is wrong."
