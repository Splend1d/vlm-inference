Let's prove this by induction or directly calculate a few more steps to identify the pattern.\n\nNotice that each step \\(T(n+1)\\) adds a term that looks like it could be related to the sum of the first \\(n\\) multiples of 3, plus the initial value of 7. The sum of the first \\(n\\) multiples of 3 can be represented as \\(3(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 3 \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n\nThus, we might suspect that \\(T(n)\\) grows quadratically with \\(n\\), considering how sums of linear sequences grow.\n\nTo verify this, let's try to find a closed form for \\(T(n)\\):\n\n\\[T(n) = 3n + T(n - 1)\\]\n\\[= 3n + [3(n-1) + T(n - 2)]\\]\n\\[= 3n + 3(n-1) + [3(n-2) + T(n - 3)]\\]\n\\[...\\]\n\\[= 3[1 + 2 + ... + (n] + 7\\]\n\nThe sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:\n\n\\[T(n) = 3 \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 7\\]\n\\[= \\frac{3n^2 + 3n}{2} + 7\\]\n\\[= \\frac{3n^2 + 3n + 14}{2}\\]\n\nThis shows that \\(T(n)\\) indeed grows quadratically with \\(n\\), specifically, it grows as \\(O(n^2)\\).
