Here, Q refers to the field of rational numbers, and Z_2 typically denotes the finite field with two elements (0 and 1). The field Q can be considered as an extension of Z_2 if we interpret the question in the context of algebraic extensions. Specifically, any element in Q that is not already in Z_2 ( (i.e., any fraction where the numerator and denominator are no common factors other than 1) can be seen as part of an extension of Z_2.\n\nStatement 2: **True**  \nThis statement is a version of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra adapted for fields theory. It states that every non-constant polynomial over a field has at least one root in some extension field. This is a well-established theorem in abstract algebra, known as the \"Existence of Roots Theorem\" or simply as a consequence of the fact that algebraically closed fields contains all roots of polynomials from its subfields.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
