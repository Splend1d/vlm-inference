Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility. We are at peace. We have no reason for the fears which govern so many other peoples throughout the world; therefore, we have to guard the freedoms of democracy.\n\u2014Eleanor Roosevelt, Address to the American Civil Liberties Union, Chicago, Illinois, March 14, 1940\nRoosevelt's concerns can most directly be compared to those of the people who debated which of the following?\n\nA. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 1964\nB. The Voting Rights Act of 1965\nC. The USA Patriot Act of 2001\nD. The Affordable Care Act of 2010\n"

The USA Patriot Act of 2001\n\nEleanor Roosevelt's concerns about the potential erosion of civil liberties during wartime can be most directly compared to the debates surrounding the passage of the USA Patriot Act of 2001. This act was enacted in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and aimed to provide law enforcement with additional tools to combat terrorism. However, it also raised significant concerns about potential infringements on civil liberties such as privacy rights and freedom of speech.\n\nThe Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (A) was passed in 1964 and related to U.S. involvement in Vietnam, not the broader themes of civil liberties under threat during wartime.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 (B) focused on eliminating racial discrimination in voting, unrelated to Roosevelt's discussion of civil liberties during wartime.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act of 2010, or Obamacare, D) addressed healthcare reform and did not specifically involve issues of civil liberties in the context of wartime or global conflicts."
