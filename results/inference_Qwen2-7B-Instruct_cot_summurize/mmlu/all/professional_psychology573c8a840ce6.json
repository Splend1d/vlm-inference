Specifically, it states that if a minority group is less than 80% of the most favored group in a particular employment practice ( (such as hiring, promotion, or retention rates), then this may indicate that the practice has an adverse impact and could be discriminatory. The purpose of this rule is to identify potential areas of bias or unfair treatment in employment procedures."
