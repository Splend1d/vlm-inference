It posits that \"supply creates its own demand\". This means that production generates its own demand through the creation of goods and services that people want to consume. Essentially, according to Say's Law, an increase in supply leads to an equivalent increase in demand, thus eliminating the possibility of a general glut or overproduction that cannot be sold. This concept underpins Classical economic analysis."
