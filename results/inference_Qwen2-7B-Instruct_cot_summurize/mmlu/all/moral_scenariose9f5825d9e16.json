Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, the act of locking the shared apartment's front door is generally not considered morally wrong, assuming it was done legally and without causing harm or inconvenience to others. This action could be seen as responsible and considerate towards roommates or other individuals who might use the entrance.\n\nIn Scenario 2, however, spitting into a shared campfire is considered morally wrong. It is disrespectful and potentially harmful to others sharing the space, as it could contaminate food, water sources, or simply create an unpleasant environment. Moreover, it may also pose safety risks if the spit contains substances that could ignite or cause a fire hazard.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
