For a firm to successfully carry out price discrimination, several conditions need to be met:\n\nI. **The firm cannot face a downward sloping demand curve.** - Incorrect. Actually, for price discrimination to work, the firm should ideally face different demand curves in each market segment where it discriminates. A downward sloping demand curve is typical and necessary for most firms to determine price elasticity.\n\nII. **The firm must have market power.** - Correct. Without some level of market power, a firm cannot set different prices for different groups of consumers.\n\nIII. **Buyers with differing demand elasticities must be separable.** - Correct. If buyers can be reliably identified as having different price sensitivities ( i.e., demand elasticities), the firm can charge higher prices to those who are less sensitive to price changes.\n\nIV. **The firm must have motives beyond profit maximization.** - Incorrect. The primary motive for price discrimination is indeed profit maximization. By charging different prices to different groups, a firm can capture more consumer surplus and increase its profits.\n\nV. **The firm must be able to prevent the re-sale of its products.** - Correct. If products can be easily resold between different market segments at different prices, the price discrimination strategy would fail, as it would undermine the ability to charge different prices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. II, III, and V only**."
