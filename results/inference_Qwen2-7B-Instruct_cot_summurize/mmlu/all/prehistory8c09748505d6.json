All of the above.\n\nCharles Lyell, a Scottish geologist, proposed the concept of uniformitarianism which posits that the same natural laws and processes observable in the world today have always been in effect. Based on this principle, Lyell argued that the Earth must be extremely old because:\n\nA. Many geological processes, such as erosion, weathering, and sedimentation, occur very slowly over vast periods of time. Lyell believed that the slow pace of these processes could explain the vast range of geological features we see today, suggesting an ancient age for the Earth.\n\nB. Uniformitarianism allows for the explanation of significant geological features, such as mountains, valleys, and sea beds, by considering the gradual effects of these slow processes over long periods. This approach supported the idea that the Earth has existed for billions of years to accommodate such extensive changes.\n\nC. Erosion is indeed a process that operates at a slow pace but cumulatively, it can significantly shape the landscape over millions or even billions of years. Lyell's work highlighted the importance of understanding the slow and continuous nature of geological change to appreciate the Earth's age.\n\nThus, all three points contribute to Lyell's argument that the Earth must be immensely old to have undergone the observed geological transformations through the mechanisms of slow, ongoing processes."
