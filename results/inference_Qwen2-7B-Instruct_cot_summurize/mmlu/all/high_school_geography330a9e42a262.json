Apartheid was practiced in South Africa, ethnic cleansing has been used as a tactic in various conflicts around the world, and integration refers to the process of bringing together people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nC. Integration is not a way to integrate different ethnic populations in neighborhoods; rather, it is the process by which individuals or groups become incorporated into society, often involving the mixing of different ethnic or cultural groups.\n\nD. While they can be related in some contexts ( for example, apartheid and ethnic cleansing both involve systematic discrimination and removal of certain groups, and integration aims to bring together diverse groups, they are not different expressions for the same concept. Each term has its own distinct meaning and implications."
