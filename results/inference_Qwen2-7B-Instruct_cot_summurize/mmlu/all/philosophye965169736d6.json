Here's why each option is relevant in Moore's critique of Sidgwick:\n\nA. **He does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of one\u2019s action.** This criticism refers to Sidgwick's utilitarian approach, where the moral worth of an action is determined by its overall utility. Moore argues that Sidgwick conflates the moral significance of the intended effects with those that are merely foreseeable but not intended. Moore believes that the moral value of an action depends on the intentions behind it, not just on the outcomes.\n\nB. **He endorses the divine law conception of ethics.** Sidgwick was influenced by the ethical thought of his time, which often included a theistic basis for morality. Moore criticized this approach because he believed that ethical principles should be grounded in human reason rather than in divine command. He argued that moral truths can be discovered through human understanding and do not require divine revelation.\n\nC. **He claims that there is a \u201cnatural balance\u201d to the universe.** This criticism pertains to Sidgwick's view of the world as a harmonious system, which might imply that certain actions are morally right because they are part of this natural order. Moore challenges this idea, emphasizing that moral values cannot be derived from a supposed natural balance or equilibrium. Instead, he posits that morality is a separate realm of truth that must be understood through rational inquiry, independent of empirical facts about the world.\n\nThus, Moore's criticisms encompass all three points, highlighting the limitations of Sidgwick's ethical theories in terms of intentionality, divine authority, and the natural balance argument."
