This internal reinforcement helps maintain learned behaviors without the need for external rewards or punishments. Thus, when someone performs a behavior that they find personally rewarding (such as exercise leading to a sense of well-being), they are more likely to continue that behavior even if no external incentives are present. \n\nSo, in the context of your question, option C correctly identifies self-reinforcement as the mechanism by which learned behaviors can be sustained over time, even in the absence of external rewards."
