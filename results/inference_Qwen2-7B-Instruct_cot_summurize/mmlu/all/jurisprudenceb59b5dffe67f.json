                    "text": "John Finnis, a prominent contemporary legal philosopher, critiques David Hume's conception of practical reason, particularly as it pertains to the separation between reason and passion. Finnis argues that Hume\u2019s distinction between 'is' ( (what exists) and 'ought' ( (moral obligations) leads to a problematic disconnection between factual claims and normative judgments. This critique does not directly align with the options provided, but it is most closely related to option D: \"That human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\"\n\nFinnis rejects Hume's notion that practical reason is merely a slave to the passions, suggesting instead that human reason plays an essential role in discerning moral principles and what constitutes a good life. He posits that there are are objective moral principles that can be known through human reason, which is a significant departure from Hume's empiricist skepticism about deriving moral truths from experience alone.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not capture the essence of Finnis's critique against Hume's conception of practical reason. Option A relates more to the concept of natural law, which Finnis discusses in relation to moral principles, but it is not the primary focus of his critique against Hume. Option B refers to Hume's position as a legal positivist, which is not central to Finnis's argument against Hume\u2019s practical reason. Option C mentions syllogistic logic, which is not the main point of contention between Finnis and Hume; rather, it is the nature of practical reason and its relationship to human flourishing that Finnis emphasizes.\n\nIn summary, while all options reflect different aspects of philosophical debate, the most accurate answer to the question of why John Finnis rejects Hume's conception of practical reason would be closest to option D: \"That human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\" This reflects Finnis's emphasis on the rational capacity of humans to discern moral truths and the good life, which contrasts with Hume's view that reason cannot justify moral judgments."
