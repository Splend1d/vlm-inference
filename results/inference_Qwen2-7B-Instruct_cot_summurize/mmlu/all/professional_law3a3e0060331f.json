At trial, the plaintiff was asked questions on direct examination about the days on which she had observed large amounts of dust in the air and how long the condition had lasted. She testified that she could not remember the specific times, but that she maintained a diary in which she had accurately recorded this information on a daily basis. When her attorney sought to refresh her recollection with her diary, she still could not remember. The plaintiff's attorney seeks to have the information in the diary admitted at trial. Is the information admissible?\n\nA. No, because reviewing it did not refresh the plaintiff's recollection.\nB. No, unless it is offered by the defendant.\nC. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.\nD. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence.\n"

Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.\n\nThe rules of evidence generally permit the use of prior writings to refresh a witness's memory during testimony. If the plaintiff cannot recall the specific details from her diary, the diary itself can still be admitted into evidence as a business record or for the truth of the matters stated therein, provided it meets the requirements for admissibility under the relevant jurisdiction's's rules of evidence. This allows the jury to consider the contents of the diary, even if the plaintiff does not personally recall the specifics."
