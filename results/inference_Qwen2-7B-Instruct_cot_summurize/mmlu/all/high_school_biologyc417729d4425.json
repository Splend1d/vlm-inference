                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. Lake B is not alkaline. It is actually acidic, as its pH is below 7.0.\n\nB. This statement incorrectly compares the alkalinity between the two lakes. Alkalinity is typically measured by the total concentration of all bases (OH- and CO32-, which is not directly related to pH values. However, since we're discussing pH, it's important to understand that a lower pH indicates higher acidity. Therefore, Lake B is not 100 times more \"alkaline\" than Lake A; rather, it is more acidic. \n\nC. This statement incorrectly defines the hydrogen ion concentration based on pH. The relationship between pH and hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]) is given by the formula: \n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log_{10}[H^+] \\]\nFor Lake B with a pH of 6.0:\n\\[ 6.0 = -\\log_{10}[H^+] \\]\n\\[ [H^+] = 10^{-6} = 0.001 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nD. The pH of both lakes might decrease in response to acid rain, but this does not automatically mean they will decrease. Acid rain would decrease the pH of both lakes, but without specific information about how much acid rain affects each lake individually, we cannot conclude whether their pH will decrease or remain constant.\n\nGiven the options provided, none of them are entirely correct based on the information given. However, if forced to choose, option C provides the most accurate scientific information regarding the hydrogen ion concentration based on the pH value provided for Lake B. \n\nPlease note that the other options involve misconceptions about the nature of pH and alkalinity."
