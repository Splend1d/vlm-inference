                    "text": "To calculate the target selling price that would result in a 20% contribution margin, we need to first understand what a contribution margin is and how it relates to cost.\n\nThe contribution margin per unit is the difference between the selling price per unit and the variable cost per unit. It essentially represents the amount of money from each sale that contributes to covering fixed costs and generating profit.\n\nGiven:\n- Total manufacturing cost = Variable manufacturing cost + Fixed manufacturing cost = $12 + $8 = $20\n- Total selling and admin cost = Variable selling and admin cost + Fixed selling and admin cost = $3 + $5 = $8\n- Total cost per unit = Manufacturing cost + Selling & admin. costs = $20 + $8 = $28\n\nWe're aiming for a 20% contribution margin. Let \\( P \\) be the target selling price per unit. The contribution margin per unit would then be \\( P - $28 \\).\n\nFor a 20% contribution margin, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{P - 28}{P} = 0.20 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ P - 28 = 0.20 * P \\]\n\\[ P - 0.20 * P = 28 \\]\n\\[ 0.80 * P = 28 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{28}{0.80} \\]\n\\[ P = 35 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation doesn't match any of the provided options because I've directly calculated the total selling price to achieve a 20% contribution margin, which should actually be calculated based on the variable costs only since the contribution margin focuses on variable costs.\n\nLet's correct the approach:\n\nTo find the target selling price that gives a 20% contribution margin, you need to ensure that 80% ( (or 0.8 times) the selling price covers the variable costs. So,\n\n\\[ 0.8 \\times \\text{selling price} = \\text{total variable cost} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.8 \\times \\text{selling price} = $12 (\\text{variable manufacturing cost}) + $3 (\\text{variable selling and admin cost}) \\]\n\n\\[ 0.8 \\times \\text{selling price} = $15 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{selling price} = \\frac{$15}{0.8} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{selling price} = $18.75 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $18.75."
