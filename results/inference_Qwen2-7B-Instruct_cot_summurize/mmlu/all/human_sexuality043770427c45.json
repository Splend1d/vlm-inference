However, some studies suggest that positions that allow the semen to flow back toward the woman's cervix may increase the chances of conception. This is why the \"man-on-top\" (position (B) is often considered one of the better options, because it can help keep the sperm closer to the cervix where the egg is likely to be released. However, this does not guarantee conception, and timing intercourse around the fertile window (usually 5 days before to 1-2 days after ovulation) is more critical for conception. Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice."
