Relict boundaries are typically found in regions where tectonic plate movements have changed over time, leading to remnants of ancient coastlines or rift valleys that no longer exist due to geological processes. Vietnam, the United Kingdom, and Germany do have examples of such relict features, including coastal terraces, ancient river systems, and geological formations that are remnants of their past geologic history."
