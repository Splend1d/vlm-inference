Positive duties towards the global poor.\n\nAccording to Thomas Pogge, philosophers, economists, and policymakers who advocate for wealthy nations to take on responsibilities for global poverty are often discussing \"positive duties.\" These are actions that individuals or nations must take to alleviate suffering or improve conditions in other parts of the world, particularly in poorer regions or communities.\n\nPositive duties typically involve direct action or intervention to provide resources, opportunities, or support to those in need. This could include things like fair trade practices, debt relief, foreign aid, investment in developing countries, or policies changes that address systemic issues causing poverty and exploitation.\n\nLibertarian duties ( refer to the idea that individuals should be free to make their own choices without undue interference from others, including the state. Egalitarian duties would focus on achieving equality among individuals, often through equal distribution of resources or opportunities. Negative duties imply refraining from causing harm or not interfering with others' rights, which is less applicable in discussions about direct interventions in global poverty.\n\nIn essence, Pogge's argument supports the notion that wealthy nations have a moral obligation to act positively towards the global poor by addressing the structural causes of poverty and inequality, rather than simply avoiding contributing to it."
