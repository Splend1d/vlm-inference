The given construction of the MAC function S(k, m) = H(k || m) violates this principle by making it possible to compute a related hash value without knowing the original message m.\n\nSpecifically, option A shows that if an attacker has access to the MAC of some message m, they can easily compute the MAC of a modified message w || k || m || PB by simply appending the known values (k, m, and PB to the message w and hashing them together with the key. This property undermines the security of the MAC since it allows an attacker to forge valid MACs for messages they have not seen before, compromising the integrity and authenticity of the communication."
