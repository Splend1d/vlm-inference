Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nExplanation:\n\nScenario 1 involves the main character forcing other individuals to physically embody and participate in a historical act of oppression (being chained like slaves and singing a slave song. This action can be considered morally wrong because it involves the use of coercion and humiliation to induce feelings of guilt in others, rather than facilitating an educational or empathetic process. It also trivializes the suffering and trauma experienced by real enslaved people and their descendants.\n\nScenario 2 involves addressing a basic human need (the desire to eat) by denying food to a child. This action is morally wrong because it directly causes harm and suffering to the child, potentially leading to serious health consequences or death. Denying food is not a form of discipline or punishment that is acceptable in modern society; it is a violation of basic human rights and dignity.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong in the sense that denying someone food is generally not accepted as a reasonable response to any situation."
