Instead, it is the sole provider of a good or service, and thus, it has the power to set prices without fear of immediate competition. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a monopoly does not face competition from other sellers of the same product.\n\nOption C is incorrect because in a monopoly, marginal revenue (the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit of the product) decreases as output increases due to the downward-sloping demand curve faced by the monopolist.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while a monopolist may engage in practices that could eliminate competition, such as setting prices high enough to deter new entrants or using its market power to exclude competition, it generally does not set a price below average variable cost to drive competitors out of the market. Doing so would lead to losses for the monopolist as well, since the goal is typically to maximize profits rather than eliminate competition at any cost.\n\nTherefore, option B accurately describes a key characteristic of a monopoly: it must lower its price on all units to sell more output, reflecting the fact that it faces a downward-sloping demand curve and must adjust its price to increase sales volume."
