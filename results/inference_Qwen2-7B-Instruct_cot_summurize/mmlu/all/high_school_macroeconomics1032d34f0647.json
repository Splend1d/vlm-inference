The short-run Phillips curve represents the relationship between the unemployment rate and inflation rate. \n\nWith a positive supply shock, the economy can produce more output at any given price level, which means that firms can hire more workers without having to raise wages as much as they would in response to a demand shock. This results in a decrease in the short-run unemployment rate because more people can be employed at the same price level.\n\nHowever, since the long-run Phillips curve is vertical, it indicates that there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the long run. Therefore, a temporary supply shock doesn't affect the long-run unemployment rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Shifts up ( (This option seems to have been misstated, as a supply shock would actually lead to a decrease in the short-run unemployment rate, not an increase. So, let's correct this and proceed with the explanation based on the correct understanding.)\n\nThe short-run Phillips curve shifts down, indicating a decrease in the short-run unemployment rate.\nThe long-run unemployment rate remains unchanged.\nSo, the correct choice considering the explanation is:\nA.
