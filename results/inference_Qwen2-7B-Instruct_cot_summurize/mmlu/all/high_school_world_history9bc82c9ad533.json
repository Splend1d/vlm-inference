The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.\nOf Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone\u2014it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\n*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.\nWhich of the following statements about ancient cities is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph?\n\nA. Ancient cities lacked effective fortifications against attack.\nB. Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.\nC. Ancient cities commonly decorated their temples in modest ways.\nD. Ancient cities featured areas for training their armies.\n"

Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.\n\nThe passage highlights that Uruk was built with an outer wall made of copper and an inner wall, and it mentions the Eanna temple, the dwelling place of Ishtar, which was considered sacred. It also notes that one third of Uruk was designated for the temple of Ishtar. This indicates that ancient cities did feature areas dedicated to worshiping their patron deities, supporting statement B."
