This belief is closely related to his claim that \"the unexamined life is not worth living.\" The reason behind this connection is D. The only way to be a good or worthwhile person is to know how human beings should behave based on universal norms or values.\n\nSocrates believed that true knowledge leads to moral virtue. He argued that ignorance is the root cause of wrongdoing since people act out of desire and lack of knowledge. By examining and questioning our beliefs and actions, we can gain deeper understanding and wisdom, leading us to virtuous behavior. Thus, an unexamined life, where we do not question our beliefs and actions, would not allow us to reach true knowledge or virtue, and hence, would not be worth living."
