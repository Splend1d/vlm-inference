O(log e^N) - This is equivalent to O(N), because the logarithm of an exponential function simplifies to the exponent times the logarithm base of the same number. So, this simplifies to O(N).\n\nB. O(log N) - This represents logarithmic growth. It grows slower than linear functions.\n\nC. O(log log N) - This grows even slower than O(log N). It grows slower than any positive power of logarithms.\n\nD.
