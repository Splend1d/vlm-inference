He is receiving fentanyl via systemic patient-controlled analgesic pump for pain management. Medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease, for which he takes atorvastatin, furosemide, carvedilol, lisinopril, and 81-mg aspirin. Baseline echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 0.20. Vital signs now are temperature 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination discloses no unexpected abnormalities. Which of the following regimens for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis will likely be most beneficial in this patient?\n\nA. Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices\nB. Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value\nC. Oral warfarin\nD. Subcutaneous enoxaparin\n"

                    "text": "Given the patient's medical history and current situation, the most appropriate regimen for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT would be:\n\nD. Subcutaneous enoxaparin\n\nReasoning:\n- The patient has undergone a major orthopedic surgery (left total knee replacement) and is at high risk for DVT due to immobility post-surgery.\n- The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events.\n- Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that can be given subcutaneously, which is convenient for patients who might be immobile or have limited access to healthcare settings.\n- It has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of DVT in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.\n- The use of oral anticoagulants like warfarin requires frequent monitoring of INR, which might not be feasible in the immediate postoperative period.\n\nThe other options:\n- A. Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices: While these devices can help reduce the risk of DVT by promoting blood flow, they do not directly prevent clot formation.\n- B. Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value: This method is less common and typically involves monitoring prothrombin time (PTT) to adjust the dose of unfractionated heparin. It may require more frequent monitoring and adjustments compared to using a pre-determined dose of enoxaparin.\n- C. Oral warfarin: Warfarin requires regular blood tests to monitor its effect and adjust dosage, which might not be practical in the immediate postoperative period when the patient is likely to be closely monitored.\n\nTherefore, considering the patient's condition and the options provided, subcutaneous enoxaparin is the most suitable choice for DVT prophylaxis."
