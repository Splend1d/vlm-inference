Primarily, it was a means for the elite to assert their power, status, and superiority over others. This practice helped in reinforcing social hierarchies and the notion of class distinctions, which were fundamental to the functioning of these societies. By publicly displaying their wealth, the elite could demonstrate their loyalty to the state, their divine or hereditary right to rule, and their ability to maintain or increase their influence and resources. This also acted as a deterrent to potential challengers and a tool for maintaining social order and obedience among the populace."
