When a light source moves towards an observer, the light waves bunch up, causing the light to appear brighter and the frequency to increase. Conversely, when the light source moves away from the observer, the light waves spread out, making the light appear dimmer and the frequency to decrease. This is why you might notice a change in the frequency of a siren's sound as an emergency vehicle approaches and then moves away from you."
