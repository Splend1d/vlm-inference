An effective price ceiling must be at a price below the equilibrium price. \n\nExplanation:\nA price ceiling is a government-imposed maximum price that can be charged for a good or service. For it to be effective, it needs to be set below the equilibrium price where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. If the price ceiling is set above the equilibrium price, it will not have any impact on the market, as the price would naturally settle at the equilibrium level.\n\nIncorrect explanations:\n\nB. A price ceiling does not necessarily increase the quantity supplied; it may decrease it if the price is too low for producers to cover costs.\n\nC. A price ceiling does not cause a shift in the demand curve; it only affects the quantity demanded at the given price by reducing it below the equilibrium quantity.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect because a price ceiling below the equilibrium price will typically lead to a shortage (i.e., the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied."
