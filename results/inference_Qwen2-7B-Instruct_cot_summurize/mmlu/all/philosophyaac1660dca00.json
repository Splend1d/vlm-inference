Beyond sense experience to unchanging ideas (Forms) that are perceived as rationally ordered.\n\nIn his work \"The Republic,\" Plato discusses the concept of the \"Divided Line\" to explain the difference between knowledge and mere opinion. According to Plato, knowledge is a belief that is justified by reasoning that goes beyond the realm of mere sensory perception and delves into the realm of abstract, eternal, and unchanging concepts known as \"Forms\" or \"Ideas.\" These Forms represent the perfect, ultimate reality behind the imperfect, changing appearances of the physical world. Knowledge, therefore, involves understanding these Forms through reason and rational thought, rather than relying solely on the fleeting impressions of the senses."
