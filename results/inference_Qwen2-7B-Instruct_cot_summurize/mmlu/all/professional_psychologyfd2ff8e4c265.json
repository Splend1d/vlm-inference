This information helps in understanding the specific needs of the jobs, identifying the gaps between current employee skills and job requirements, and determining the necessary training content. Once this information is gathered, the group can then proceed to develop training objectives tailored to address these identified gaps, ensuring that the training provided is relevant, effective, and targeted towards the needs of both the outplaced workers and the community organizations."
