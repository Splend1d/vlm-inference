Gravity. \n\nGravity acts on the sphere, creating a net force that not only accelerates the sphere along the incline but also generates a torque about the center of mass of the sphere due to the component of the gravitational force that is perpendicular to the surface of the sphere (and hence parallel to the radius vector at any point on the sphere's surface. This torque is what causes the sphere to rotate.\n\nStatic or kinetic friction might provide the necessary force to prevent slipping between the sphere and the hill, but they do not directly provide the torque for rotation. The normal force, exerted by the hill on the sphere, is perpendicular to the surface of the hill and thus does not contribute to the rotational motion."
