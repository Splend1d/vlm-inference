However, definitions of such a structure often contain declarations of components of the structure (e.g., the header file for a C++ class may contain declarations of its private components). For such a language, an object's name could be bound at run time to stack storage for its component values (direct representation) or to a stack pointer referencing heap storage for its component values (indirect representation). Which of the following statements about comparisons between direct and indirect representations is (are) true?\nI. Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time.\nII. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.\nIII. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.\n\nA. I only\nB.

The increase in compilation time would depend on how frequently the pointers need to be updated and how complex the memory management is in the language or runtime environment.\n\nII. True. Direct representation allows for faster access to components of a variable because the memory address is known directly and can be accessed without additional indirection. This typically means less overhead and thus faster access times.\n\nIII. True. In indirect representation, if the storage size of a private component of a variable changes, it might require updating the pointers that reference the heap storage. However, since the pointers are usually separate from the variable itself, changing the size of the component might not necessitate recompiling the source module where the variable is defined, especially if the compiler supports dynamic allocation and resizing of objects. This can minimize the number of recompilations required when managing variable-sized components dynamically."
