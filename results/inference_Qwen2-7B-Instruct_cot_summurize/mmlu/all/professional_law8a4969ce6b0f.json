The proposed statute's preamble recites that its provisions will ensure: \u0080\u0094 responsible insurance coverage for all those who do business with the state;an increased standard of living for the citizens who comprise the state's labor force; \u0080\u0094 the lowest possible expenditures by the state government; and \u0080\u0094 a beautiful, uniform aesthetic decor for all new state buildings. If the state statute is attacked as violating the commerce clause, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. The statute is a valid exercise of the state's police power to legislate to protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of its citizens.\nB. The statute falls within the reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment.\nC. The statute should be invalidated if there are nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests.\nD. The statute is a valid exercise of state action only if the federal government has not previously \"occupied the field\" in this area.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The statute should be invalidated if there are not nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests.\n\nThe Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power \"To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" However, states also have their own powers under the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to the states \"all powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n\nWhen a state law potentially impacts interstate commerce, courts often apply a balancing test to determine whether the law is constitutional. This test typically involves evaluating whether the state law serves a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable non-discriminatory alternatives, and whether the burden on interstate commerce is outweighed by the state's interest.\n\nIn this case, the state statute appears to have multiple provisions that may impact interstate commerce:\n\n1. **Insurance Requirement**: Requiring companies to purchase insurance from only state-chartered insurers could potentially limit the options available to companies and affect their ability to conduct business across state lines. It would be important to assess whether there are are nondiscriminatory alternatives that could achieve the same goal without unduly burdening interstate commerce.\n\n2. **Hiring Preference**: Preferring state citizens for unskilled labor could exclude qualified non-residents, impacting the flow of labor between states.\n\n3. **Prohibition on Nonresident Aliens**: This provision directly excludes non-resident aliens from participating in state-related business activities, which might be considered discriminatory and could affect interstate commerce.\n\n4. **Building Construction Standards**: Requiring state-funded buildings to use only adobe made from specific clay deposits found only in the state limits materials procurement to within the state, potentially affecting suppliers from other regions.\n\nGiven these considerations, if the state cannot show that there are are reasonable non-discriminatory alternatives to achieve its stated goals without significantly impacting interstate commerce, the statute might be challenged on commerce clause grounds and potentially invalidated. Therefore, option C is the most accurate statement in this context."
