It is actually responsible and demonstrates a commitment to ensuring the well-being and safety of others, which alignss with ethical standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, asking a little girl to come over and cuddle could potentially be seen as inappropriate or invasive depending on context and the relationship between the characters. However, in general terms, assuming there is no power imbalance, harassment, or intent to harm, this action itself might not be considered morally wrong. It's important to consider factors like age-appropriateness, consent, and the overall environment or situation."
