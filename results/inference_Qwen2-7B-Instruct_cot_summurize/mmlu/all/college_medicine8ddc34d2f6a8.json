In this context, it refers to the lowest power level at which any of the mice responded by pressing the lever. Based on the information provided:\n\n- At 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever.\n- At 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever.\n- At 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever.\n\nSince the absolute threshold of hearing would be the lowest power level where any response was observed, and 10 mice responded at 60% power, but no mice responded below 60% power, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 60%\n\nThis is because the absolute threshold of hearing in this experiment corresponds to the lowest power level (60%, at which a response was was observed across some of the mice."
