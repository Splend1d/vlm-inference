Encoding refers to the process of converting information into a form that can be stored in memory. If John has been handling money for 17 years but still cannot recall the images on the coins and bills, it suggests that the information was not effectively encoded into his long-term memory.\n\nOptions A ( confabulation, B failure to reconstruct, and D deep processing do not directly address the issue of encoding information into memory. Confabulation involves creating false memories, failure to reconstruct could refer to difficulty in recalling details after they have been encoded, and deep processing pertains to processing that goes beyond surface-level understanding, potentially aiding in better memory retention. However, these concepts do not specifically address the inability to encode the visual information in the first place."
