However, since the dipole is symmetrically arranged, the electric fields from both charges will have the same magnitude but opposite directions along the line connecting the two charges. This means that at the midpoint, these two fields will cancel each other out.\n\nGiven:\n- Charge magnitude: \\( q = 4.0 \\, \\text{nC} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{C} \\)\n- Separation distance: \\( d = 2.0 \\, \\text{cm} = 0.02 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n\nThe distance from either charge to the midpoint is half of \\( d \\), which is \\( \\frac{d}{2} = 0.01 \\, \\text{m} \\).\n\nThe electric field strength \\( E \\) due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{k|q|}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant, \\( k = 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{C}^2 \\).\n\nFor one of the charges at the midpoint:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{midpoint}} = \\frac{k|q|}{(\\frac{d}{2})^2} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{midpoint}} = \\frac{(8.99 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{C}^2)(4.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{C})}{(0.01 \\, \\text{m})^2} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{midpoint}} = \\frac{(8.99 \\times 10^9)(4.0 \\times 10^{-9})}{0.0001} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{midpoint}} = 3.6 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{N/C} \\]\n\nSince the electric fields from both charges at the midpoint is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they cancel each other out. Thus, the net electric field strength at the midpoint of the dipole is:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{net}} = 0 \\]\n\nSo the correct answer is A. 0."
