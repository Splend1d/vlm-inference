Convolving an image with the identity matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ would indeed not change the image, as this matrix acts as the identity in matrix multiplication, leaving any input unchanged.\n\nB. Convolving an image with the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ would highlight the middle column of the image, while other columns would be suppressed due to the zeros around it. This is because the convolution operation applies the filter (element-wise multiplied by the image patch centered at each pixel and then sums up the result. So, this operation wouldn't leave the image unchanged.\n\nC. Convolving an image with the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ would effectively apply a uniform blur effect across the image, increasing brightness uniformly, but it wouldn't leave the image unchanged; it would alter the intensity values.\n\nD. Convolving an image with the zero matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ would indeed leave the image unchanged, as all operations would yield zero, effectively nullifying any effect on the image.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are would be **A** and **D**."
