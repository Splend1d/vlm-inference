The fatal wound was inflicted by a single shot, and there was no suggestion of a conspiracy among those present. One of the three men was charged with the killing. The prosecution called one of the other men as its first witness. His testimony, if true, established that the defendant fired the shot that killed the victim. The defendant's attorney then called the man's longtime neighbor to impeach him. Which of the following offers of evidence is most likely to be admitted for the impeachment of the man?\n\nA. Testimony that the witness is a cocaine addict.\nB. Testimony that the witness embezzled money from his employer last year.\nC. Testimony that the witness is not, in the neighbor's opinion, worthy of belief.\nD. Testimony that the witness is an atheist.\n"

Testimony that the witness is not, in the neighbor's opinion, worthy of belief.\n\nImpeachment of a witness typically involves evidence that tends to show the witness's untrustworthiness or bias. This could include prior inconsistent statements, character for truthfulness (or untruthfulness), or other evidence suggesting the witness may not be credible. In this context, the neighbor's opinion about the witness's credibility is relevant to the witness's trustworthiness and thus might be admissible to impeach the witness's testimony.\n\nOptions A and B involve personal habits (cocaine addiction and embezzlement, which generally do not relate directly to the witness's truthfulness or reliability unless they can be shown to have affected their ability to perceive, remember, or recount events accurately. Option D, regarding the witness being an atheist, is also unlikely to be relevant to the witness's credibility unless it can be demonstrated that the witness's religious beliefs would affect their testimony in a material way."
