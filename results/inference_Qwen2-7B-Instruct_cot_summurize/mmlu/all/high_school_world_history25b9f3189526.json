Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand\u2014as though speaking in our name\u2014what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory.\"\nInstructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512\nThe two letters best support which of the following conclusions?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The two letters best support conclusion B: Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese. \n\nIn the first letter, King Afonso I of Kongo expresses dissatisfaction with the Portuguese for kidnapping his subjects, including noblemen and freedmen, and selling them as slaves to the Portuguese residing in his kingdom. This clearly indicates a negative aspect of the trade relationship between Portugal and Kongo, specifically the practice of slave-taking by the Portuguese.\n\nIn the second letter, King Manuel of Portugal acknowledges that the expedition to Kongo is costly and suggests that it should not return without any goods, implying that the primary goal of the expedition is to acquire goods like slaves, copper, or ivory. This statement highlights the economic motivations behind the Portuguese presence in Kongo and suggests that they were actively engaged in the slave trade.\n\nConclusion A (Diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo were often cordial, does not align well with the content of these letters. The letters reflect tensions and conflicts rather than cordiality.\n\nConclusion C Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated, cannot be supported by these sources. There is no mention of regulation in either letter.\n\nConclusion D Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties, also does not accurately represent the information provided. While trade did occur, the letters highlight significant issues, particularly the exploitation and enslavement of Kongo's people, suggesting that the trade relationship had problematic aspects on both sides."
