This could be due to various factors such as legal consequences, health concerns, personal growth, or societal influence.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this claim should be evaluated based on the specific details provided by Shapiro or any reliable source he refers to. Different studies might yield varying results, and interpretations can depend on how the data was collected, analyzed, and presented. It's also crucial to consider the broader context of drug use trends, including the impact of public policy, education, and access to treatment options."
