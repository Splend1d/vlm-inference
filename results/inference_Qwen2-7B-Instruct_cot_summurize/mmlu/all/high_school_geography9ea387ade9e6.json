                    "text": "The correct answer is A. limits the marine climate of Europe to coastal areas.\n\nThe east-west orientation of the Alpine mountain system and the northern plains of western and central Europe creates a barrier that often blocks or alters the flow of maritime air masses from the Atlantic Ocean. This means that coastal regions along the western edge of Europe may experience more marine-like climates, characterized by milder temperatures and higher humidity, due to the influence of these oceanic air currents. However, as you move inland, the effect of the mountains and the plains can lead to drier, warmer summers and cooler, more continental winters in countries like Germany and Poland, reducing the extent of marine-like conditions.\n\nB is incorrect because while the mountain ranges do provide some barriers and routes, they don't necessarily create a direct corridor for communication between southern and northern Europe. Instead, they can influence travel patterns and have played roles in historical developments such as the formation of trade routes and cultural exchanges.\n\nC is also incorrect because while the mountain range does affect the distribution of climate conditions, it does not enable marine-like conditions to extend uniformly eastward into Germany and Poland. The climate differences are more pronounced than described here.\n\nD is incorrect because the statement about preventing population movement between parts of the Mediterranean region is not accurate. While geographical barriers can influence migration patterns, they do not effectively prevent people from moving between different regions. In fact, human history is replete with examples of migrations across various geographic barriers, including those in the Mediterranean region."
