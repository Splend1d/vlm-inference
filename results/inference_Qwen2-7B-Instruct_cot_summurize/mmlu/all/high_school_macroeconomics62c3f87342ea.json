According to the AD-AS model:\n\nReal GDP: Increases - As AD increases, the economy moves along the short-run aggregate supply curve from a lower level of output to a higher level, thus increasing real GDP.\nPrice Level: Increases - The increased demand puts upward pressure on prices as the economy operates closer to its full employment level of output. This results in an increase in the price level.\nUnemployment: Decreases - With an increase in real GDP, the economy moves towards or reaches full employment, leading to a decrease in unemployment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Increases, Increases, Decreases"
