This metric takes into account the Gross Domestic Product ( (GDP) of a country and adjusts it for inflation, providing a more accurate picture of the average income per person after accounting for price changes over time. \n\nHere's a brief explanation of each option:\n\nA. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) refers to the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period. While GDP can give an indication of economic activity, it does not directly measure the standard of living because it doesn't consider population size or distribution of income.\n\nB. GDP per capita is calculated by dividing the GDP by the population of a country. It provides a measure of the average income per person but still does not adjust for the cost of living or inflation.\n\nD. Actual GDP per capita is essentially the same as GDP per capita; it's the GDP divided by the population. It's used as a measure of the average income per person but lacks the adjustment for inflation that real GDP per capita provides.\n\nC. Real GDP per capita, on the other hand, adjusts GDP per capita for inflation using a price index. This means it reflects the purchasing power of the average person's income, making it a more reliable indicator of the standard of living. By accounting for inflation, it provides a clearer picture of how the standard of living has changed over time without being distorted by price fluctuations."
