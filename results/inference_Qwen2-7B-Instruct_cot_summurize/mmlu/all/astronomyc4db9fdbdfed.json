Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older.\n\nRadioactive dating, also known as radiometric dating, is a method used to determine the age of rocks and other materials by measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes within them. This process allows scientists to calculate the age of lunar rocks with great accuracy, providing evidence that many rocks on the Moon's surface are indeed older than those found on Earth's surface."
