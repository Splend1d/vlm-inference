The molar mass of silver chloride (\\(\\text{AgCl}\\)) is approximately 143.32 g/mol.\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of AgCl} = \\frac{\\text{mass of AgCl}}{\\text{molar mass of AgCl}} = \\frac{0.435 \\text{ g}}{143.32 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 0.00303 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction shows a 1:1 ratio between AgCl and Cl\\(^-\\), this means that 0.00303 moles of Cl\\(^-\\) were present in the original sample.\n\nNext, we calculate the mass of chlorine in the sample. The molar mass of Cl\\(^-\\) is approximately 35.45 g/mol.\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of Cl} = \\text{moles of Cl} \\times \\text{molar mass of Cl} = 0.00303 \\text{ mol} \\times 35.45 \\text{ g/mol} \\approx 0.108 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nFinally, we determine the percentage of chlorine in the original sample:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of Cl} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Mass of Cl}}{\\text{Total mass of sample}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{0.108 \\text{ g}}{2.35 \\text{ g}} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 4.59\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 4.60%."
