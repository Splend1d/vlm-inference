The old computer's speed would then be \\(\\frac{1}{2} S_c\\) since it works half as fast as the current one. Its price was twice as much, so we'll denote it as \\(2P_c\\).\n\nThe speed-to-price ratios for the current and old computers can be represented as:\n\n\\[Ratio_{current} = \\frac{S_c}{P_c}\\]\n\\[Ratio_{old} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} S_c}{2P_c} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{S_c}{P_c} = \\frac{1}{4} Ratio_{current}\\]\n\nThis means the old computer's speed-to-price ratio is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) (or 25% of the current computer's speed-to-price ratio.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the current computer's speed-to-price ratio in relation to the old computer's speed-to-price ratio, which we've found to be \\(4\\) times the old computer's ratio ( (since \\(1 / (1/4) = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed directly among your options, but if we interpret the question asking for how many times larger the current computer's ratio is compared to the old one, the answer is \\(4\\), which is not explicitly given in your options A through D.\n\nGiven the options, none of them directly matches this interpretation because they are presented in terms of percentages or fractions relative to the old computer's ratio. However, understanding the relationship between the two ratios correctly leads us to realize the question might have been aiming for a different interpretation or there could be a misunderstanding in the question's setup or the options provided. \n\nIf we strictly follow the calculations based on the information given and the typical way of presenting such questions, the closest correct interpretation from the options given would be:\n\nSince the question asks for \"the current computer's speed to price ratio is what percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio\", and we calculated that the current computer's ratio is \\(4\\) times the old one's, the answer would imply looking at it as a percentage increase from the old ratio's perspective, which isn't directly represented in the options provided as stated. \n\nHowever, if considering the direct calculation for the current ratio being \\(4\\) times the old, this doesn't directly map to any of the provided options A through D. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in either the question or the options given, as none of the options A (20%, B 400%, C 32, or D \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) accurately reflects the relationship described in the context of the question as posed with the options available."
