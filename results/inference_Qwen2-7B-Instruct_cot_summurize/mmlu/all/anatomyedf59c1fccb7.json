Specifically, they originate from the brainstem and the sacral part of the spinal cord.\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for \"rest and digest\" functions, such as slowing down the heart rate, stimulating digestion, and controlling various bodily processes that occur when a person is relaxed or at rest. The preganglionic fibers travel to ganglia located near the target organs, where they synapse and the postganglionic fibers continue to the effector organs."
