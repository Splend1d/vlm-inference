While it's true that linear regression estimators have desirable properties, such as being unbiased and having minimum variance under certain conditions ( specifically when the errors are normally distributed and the predictors are not perfectly correlated), it is not correct to state that they have the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators. This claim would depend on the specific context and assumptions about the data distribution and the estimators being compared.\n\nStatement 2 is True. In the AdaBoost algorithm, the coefficients (often referred to as weights) assigned to the weak classifiers used in the ensemble are indeed always non-negative. These weights represent the contribution of each classifier to the final decision and are adjusted iteratively based on the performance of the weak classifiers during the boosting process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
