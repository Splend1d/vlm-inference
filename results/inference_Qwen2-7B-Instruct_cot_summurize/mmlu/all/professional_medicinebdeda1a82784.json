She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?\n\nA. Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR\nB. The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier\nC. The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype\nD. The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained\n"

Only one G551D allele is needed in the CFTR gene for the patient to exhibit the clinical phenotype associated with cystic fibrosis.\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR). This protein is involved in the production and regulation of m(secretions, including sweat, saliva, and digestive juices). The CFTR protein regulates the transport of chloride ions (Cl-) across cell membranes, and its malfunction leads to thick, sticky secretions that can block ducts in various organs, particularly the lungs and pancreas.\n\nIn cases of cystic fibrosis, individuals typically have two copies of the mutated CFTR gene (one from each parent. However, some mutations, such as the G551D mutation, may cause a more severe disease phenotype even when only one copy of the mutated gene is present. This is because the single copy of the mutated gene leads to a CFTR protein that is not fully functional, resulting in a significant impact on chloride ion transport and leading to the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Only one G551D allele is needed in the CFTR gene for the patient to exhibit the clinical phenotype associated with cystic fibrosis."
