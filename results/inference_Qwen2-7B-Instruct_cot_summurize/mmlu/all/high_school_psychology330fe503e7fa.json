The patterns of these signals correspond to different states of consciousness, such as wakefulness, relaxation, and sleep.\n\nWhen someone transitions into deep sleep, they typically experience an increase in delta waves, which are slow brain waves (typically 0.5-4 Hz). This pattern is common during the deepest stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.\n\nGiven that Cyrus was awakened from a long nap and felt worse than when he went to bed, it suggests he might have been in a deep sleep stage, possibly the deeper stages of NREM sleep where delta waves dominate. Therefore, an EEG right before he was awoken would most likely show a preponderance of delta waves."
