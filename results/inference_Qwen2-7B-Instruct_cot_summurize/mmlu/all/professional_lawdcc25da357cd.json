According to the policy contract, the insured was required to notify the insurance company within 10 days following any loss due to fire or other catastrophe. The owner sued the insurance company to recover $750,000, which was the face amount that his home was insured for. The insurance company admitted that the owner's house was insured for that amount, though the company denied liability because it claimed that it had not received notice of the fire within the 10-day period as required by the policy. At trial, the owner calls his bookkeeper to testify. The bookkeeper proposes to testify that on March 11, the owner handed her an envelope and told her it contained a notice form for the insurance company, and that she mailed the envelope on his behalf. If the bookkeeper intends to establish that the envelope that the owner handed her contained the notice of fire loss, her proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because the owner's statement to her is non-hearsay.\nB. admissible, because a letter properly mailed is presumed received in due course.\nC. inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.\n"

Instead, the bookkeeper is testifying to what the owner told her: that he gave her an envelope containing a notice form for the insurance company and that she mailed it on his behalf. This statement is not being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that the contents of the envelope were indeed a notice of fire loss, but rather, it serves to establish the chain of events and the intent behind the mailing of the envelope. Therefore, it is not hearsay but rather an admission by the owner, which can be admissible under certain circumstances."
