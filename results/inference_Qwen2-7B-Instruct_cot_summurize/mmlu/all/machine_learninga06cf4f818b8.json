It runs reasonably slow for multiple linear regression.\n\nGrid search involves exhaustively searching through a predefined set of parameter values, which can become computationally expensive as the number of parameters increases and the range of possible values becomes larger. This exhaustive nature of the search makes it less suitable for high-dimensional spaces or problems with a large number of parameters, such as multiple linear regression. In such cases, other optimization methods like Randomized Search or Bayesian Optimization might be more efficient in terms of computational cost while still finding good solutions."
