Option B suggests that the right to life extends to all living creatures, which is a more general claim than the one made by Lee and George regarding embryos. Option C refers to the idea that not all individuals retain their right to life if they commit certain actions, such as murder, which again is a different context from the one addressed in the argument about embryos.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the information provided, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nA. the right to life belongs to a human being at all times that he or she exists."
