The possible orders are \\(1, 2, 4, 8\\).\n2. **\\(Z_{10}\\)**: The elements of this group have orders that divide \\(10\\). The possible orders are \\(1, 2, 5, 10\\).\n3. **\\(Z_{24}\\)**: The elements of this group have orders that divide \\(24\\). The possible orders are \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\\).\n\nThe maximum possible order of an element in \\(Z_8 \\times Z_{10} \\times Z_{24}\\) would be the LCM of the highest orders found in each group:\n\n- From \\(Z_8\\), the highest order is \\(8\\).\n- From \\(Z_{10}\\), the highest order is \\(10\\).\n- From \\(Z_{24}\\), the highest order is \\(24\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the LCM of \\(8\\), \\(10\\), and \\(24\\):\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(8, 10, 24) = \\text{LCM}(\\text{LCM}(8, 10), 24) = \\text{LCM}(40, 24) = 120 \\]\n\nThus, the maximum possible order for some element of \\(Z_8 \\times Z_{10} \\times Z_{24}\\) is \\(120\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 120**."
