As the planet formed from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust, it would have shrunk under its own gravity, converting some of the gravitational potential energy into thermal energy. This process is thought to be the main source of heat for Jupiter, contributing to phenomena such as its active atmosphere and the presence of a liquid metallic hydrogen layer beneath its thick atmosphere. Nuclear fusion occurs in stars like our Sun, not in planets like Jupiter. Internal friction and chemical processes also contribute to heat generation but are not the primary mechanism for a planet as large as Jupiter."
