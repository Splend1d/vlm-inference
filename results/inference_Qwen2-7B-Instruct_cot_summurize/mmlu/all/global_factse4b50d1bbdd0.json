However, it's important to note that \"used the internet in the past three months\" is a slightly different metric than just \"internet access.\" As of my last update, the exact percentage for using the internet within the last three months might not be readily available, but the overall access rate was around 78%. Therefore, if we're considering internet access rather than usage within the past three months specifically, the closest answer would be:\n\nD. 78%\n\nPlease check the most recent statistics for the precise percentage related to internet usage within the last three months, as this information can change over time."
