Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

Trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara.\n\nThe spread of Islam to the lands of the kingdom of Mali was primarily facilitated through trade networks that crossed the Sahara Desert. Muslim traders, scholars, and missionaries traveling along these routes introduced Islamic culture, religion, and knowledge to the region. This process allowed for the gradual integration of Islamic practices into the social, political, and economic structures of the Mali Empire. The interactions between traders and local elites played a crucial role in the diffusion of Islam throughout the kingdom."
