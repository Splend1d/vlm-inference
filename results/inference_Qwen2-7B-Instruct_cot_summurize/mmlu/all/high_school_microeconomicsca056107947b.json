Demand for the monopoly firm's output.\n\nMonopolies have a unique market structure where there is only one seller, and no close substitutes for its product. This means that consumers have little choice but to buy from the monopolist, making the demand relatively inelastic. In other words, changes in price will not significantly affect the quantity demanded because there are are few or no alternatives available.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C involve markets with more competition, which generally lead to more elastic demand. In these cases, if prices change, consumers can easily switch to other products, leading to a larger percentage change in quantity demanded compared to the percentage change in price."
