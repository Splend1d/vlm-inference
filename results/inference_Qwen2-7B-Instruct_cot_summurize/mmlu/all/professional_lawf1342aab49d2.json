A warehouse located in a county handles the distribution of bicycles for several states. The bikes and bike tires are shipped separately to the county warehouse. The tires are mingled, stacked, and stored in the warehouse along with various other tires. The bicycles, on the other hand, arrive completely assembled in their shipping crates and remain on the loading docks. The county imposes an ad valorem property tax on the bikes and tires.

Since the county warehouse is storing both bicycles and tires, it would be reasonable to assess the tax on both items according to their respective values. The fact that the bicycles arrive assembled and remain on the loading docks while the tires are mixed and stored does not change the taxability of the items; they are both considered inventory stored within the warehouse and thus subject to the property tax."
