This is often depicted graphically with a concave production possibility frontier (PPF), where the curve bows outward from the origin. The concavity indicates that as production of one good increases, resources become less efficient for its production due to the need to reallocate resources from other goods, which have diminishing returns. This leads to higher costs for each additional unit produced."
