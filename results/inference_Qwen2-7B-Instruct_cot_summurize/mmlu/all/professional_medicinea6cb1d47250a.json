Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence\n\nWhen you lower the alpha level (from 0.05 to 0.01 in this case - you are setting a stricter criterion for determining statistical significance. This means that any results that show statistical significance under such a stringent test are provide stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. In other words, if the results are deemed significant at an alpha level of 0.01, it's less likely that these results occurred due to random chance alone, thus providing greater confidence in the findings.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. The study will have more power: Power refers to the probability that a study will detect an effect if there truly is one. Lowering the alpha level does not increase the power of the study; in fact, it may decrease it because it becomes harder to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nC. There is a decreased likelihood of a Type II error: A Type II error occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. Decreasing the alpha level does not directly reduce the likelihood of a Type II error. However, in practice, lowering alpha might indirectly lead to fewer Type II errors by making it harder to accept the alternative hypothesis, but this is not a direct relationship.\n\nD. There is an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings: Decreasing the alpha level actually makes it harder to achieve statistical significance. Therefore, this option is incorrect."
