One significant change he highlighted was the shift towards a performance-based model for employment. Under privatization, there was an increased emphasis on managerial accountability and performance metrics. This meant that managers' job security and compensation were more closely tied to the company's financial performance, efficiency improvements, and other measurable outcomes. This system replaced traditional forms of trust and loyalty between employers and employees with a focus on quantifiable results.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not accurately reflect Mulholland's argument about the impact of privatization on the relationship between companies and managers:\n\n- A. Flexibility was not necessarily reduced by the introduction of detailed daily worksheets; in fact, some argue that privatization led to greater flexibility as companies adapted to market demands.\n- B. The state's role actually diminished after privatization, as the focus shifted to private sector management and ownership.\n- C. Ownership was often diversified among various stakeholders, including shareholders, not just concentrated in the hands of senior managers. While it's true that managers might have had more influence over decision-making post-privatization, the shift wasn't solely or exclusively from small shareholders to senior managers."
