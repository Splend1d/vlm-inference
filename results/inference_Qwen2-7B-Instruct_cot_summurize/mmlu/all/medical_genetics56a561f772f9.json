The bacteriophage genome is 5,000 bp long.\n2. The restriction enzyme recognizes a specific 4 base sequence.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the enzyme recognizes a random 4 base sequence. The probability that any 4 consecutive bases form this sequence is 1 in \\(4^4 = 256\\). This means, on average, every 257 base pairs will have a cut site for this enzyme.\n\nGiven the genome is 5,000 bp long, we divide this length by the average distance between cut sites:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5000}{257} \\approx 19.47 \\]\n\nSince you cannot have a fraction of a cut, we round down to the nearest whole number because you can't have a \"partial\" cut. Thus, you'd expect about 20 fragments from cutting a 5,000 bp genome with this enzyme.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. about 20."
