Unaffected until 2006 when the computers are sold and the figure for GDP in 2005 is revised.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period. It does not account for goods that are produced but not sold during that time period. Therefore, the production of 200 computers with a retail value of $100,000 in 2005 would not directly increase the GDP for that year since those computers were not sold and included in the final goods and services count for 2005.\n\nThe value of these computers would be included in the GDP when they are eventually sold in 2006, as it would then represent part of the final goods and services produced in that year."
