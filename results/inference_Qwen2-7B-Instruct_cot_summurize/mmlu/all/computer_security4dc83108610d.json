Message Splash.\n\nMessage Authentication is a cryptographic service that ensures the message being sent is exactly what the sender claims it to be, and it has not been altered or tampered with during transmission. It provides assurance about the origin of the message ( proving 'who sent the message' and its integrity ( ensuring 'what was sent'.\n\nA. Message Confidentiality refers to keeping the content of the message secret from unauthorized recipients. It's achieved through encryption.\n\nB. Message Integrity ensures that the message has not been modified in transit. It uses cryptographic hashes and digital signatures for verification.\n\nD. Message Sending is a general term referring to the act of transmitting a message, which can happen without any additional security measures in place.\n\nTherefore, Message Authentication goes beyond these concepts by providing assurance about both the origin and integrity of the message, but it is not a service related to the act of sending the message itself."
