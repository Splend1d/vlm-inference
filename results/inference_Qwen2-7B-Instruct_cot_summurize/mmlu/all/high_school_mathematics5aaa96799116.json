According to the problem, we have:\n\n\\[RH = 32 - 8i\\]\n\nGiven that Hardy's number is \\(H = 5 + 3i\\), we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[R(5 + 3i) = 32 - 8i\\]\n\nTo find \\(R\\), we need to divide both sides by \\(5 + 3i\\):\n\n\\[R = \\frac{32 - 8i}{5 + 3i}\\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \\(5 - 3i\\), to eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator:\n\n\\[R = \\frac{(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i)}{(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i)}\\]\n\nExpanding both the numerator and the denominator:\n\nNumerator:\n\\[(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i) = 160 - 96i - 40i + 24i^2\\]\nSince \\(i^2 = -1\\), this simplifies to:\n\\[160 - 136i - 24 = 136 - 136i\\]\n\nDenominator:\n\\[(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) = 25 - 9i^2 = 25 + 9 = 34\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[R = \\frac{136 - 136i}{34} = 4 - i\\]\n\nTherefore, the number Ramanujan picked is \\(4 - i\\), which corresponds to option C."
