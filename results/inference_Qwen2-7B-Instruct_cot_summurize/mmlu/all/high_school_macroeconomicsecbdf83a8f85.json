If households are more optimistic about the future, this generally leads to an increase in their expected income and thus, they tend to save less and spend more today. This results in an increase in the consumption function, meaning that at each level of real GDP, households will consume more. \n\nTo understand why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC is the proportion of additional income that is spent on consumption. An increase in optimism might lead to an increase in MPC, but the question specifically asks about the effect on the consumption function, not just the MPC.\n\nB. The consumption function shifts downward when there's a decrease in consumption for a given level of income or real GDP. Optimism leading to increased spending contradicts this scenario.\n\nD. Decreasing the MPC would result in a flatter consumption function, not a steeper one. A flatter consumption function indicates that as income increases, the additional consumption increases at a slower rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that optimism leading to increased spending shifts the entire consumption function upward."
