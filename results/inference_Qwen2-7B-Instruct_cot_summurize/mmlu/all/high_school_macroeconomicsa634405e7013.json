As a result, U.S. consumers will likely buy more copper from foreign suppliers, leading to an increase in the quantity of copper imported and thus making the U.S. a net exporter of copper. \n\nThe other options do not directly follow from this scenario:\n\nB. The U.S. might consider imposing tariffs on imported copper if there is significant concern about domestic industry viability or national security implications, but this is not a direct result of the world price exceeding the domestic price.\n\nC. The demand for U.S. copper could potentially fall if it becomes relatively more expensive compared to imported copper, but this is a result of the relative prices rather than the absolute price of copper in the U.S.\n\nD. A growing trade deficit in goods and services is a broader economic indicator that can be influenced by many factors, including changes in the price of commodities like copper. However, the direct relationship between the world price of copper and a growing trade deficit is not straightforward and depends on many other economic variables."
