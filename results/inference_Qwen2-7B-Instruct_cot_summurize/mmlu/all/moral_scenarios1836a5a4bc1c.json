Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, the act of relaxing naked in the schoolyard is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful to others' privacy and comfort. It can be seen as invading the space of others and potentially causing embarrassment or distress, which is not aligned with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, puttingting trick candles on someone's cake as a joke might seem harmless, but it can also be considered disrespectful or even malicious if the person has dietary restrictions they cannot easily accommodate (e.g., allergies). However, if there are are no underlying issues and the cousin enjoys practical jokes, it could be seen as a playful prank rather than a serious moral wrong. The key here depends on the context and the potential impact on the person receiving the cake. In many cases, especially when the intent is not harmful and the recipient appreciates the humor, this action would not be considered morally wrong under ordinary standards."
