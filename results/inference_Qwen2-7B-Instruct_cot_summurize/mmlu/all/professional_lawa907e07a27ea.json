The case was tried to the court solely on documentary evidence. Immediately after the close of the evidence, the judge announced from the bench, \"Judgment shall be entered for the manufacturer,\" and judgment was so entered. The buyer has appealed the judgment. What is the buyer's best argument for persuading the appellate court to reverse the judgment?\n\nA. The judgment is clearly erroneous because it was based solely on documentary evidence.\nB. The manufacturer was required to file proposed findings and conclusions before the trial court ruled.\nC. The trial court erred because it announced the judgment without giving the parties an opportunity to submit proposed findings and conclusions.\nD. The trial court erred by not providing findings and conclusions.\n"

The trial court erred because it announced the judgment without giving the parties an opportunity to submit proposed findings and conclusions.\n\nThe buyer's best argument for persuading the appellate court to reverse the judgment would likely be option C. This argument focuses on the procedural error made by the trial court. When a court renders a decision based solely on documentary evidence without allowing the parties to submit their own proposed findings and conclusions, it deprives them of the opportunity to present their interpretations of the evidence and the implications for the case. This procedural misstep could potentially affect the fairness and accuracy of the judgment, making it susceptible to reversal on appeal.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they do not address any procedural errors; instead, they focus on the nature of the evidence or the lack of findings and conclusions, which might not necessarily warrant reversal if the evidence supports the judgment. Option B is also incorrect because the requirement for proposed findings and conclusions typically pertains to trials where the court makes findings based on oral testimony, not solely on documentary evidence. In this scenario, the lack of opportunity to submit such proposals is more relevant than the requirement itself."
