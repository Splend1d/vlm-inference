It features well-preserved stonework, temples, and living quarters that suggest it was a comfortable and prestigious place. While it does have elements that could be considered defensive ( such as its remote location and strategic vantage point, its primary function seems to have been as a ceremonial and residential site rather than a fortress. Its precise purpose is still somewhat debated among historians, but the evidence suggests it was more than just an astronomical observatory or a simple shrine."
