The presence of a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line that does not include zero indicates strong evidence of a linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables. If the interval were to include zero, it would suggest that the slope could be zero ( or close enough to zero to not be considered significantly different from zero), which implies no linear relationship. Since the given interval (0.45, 0.80) does not include zero, this suggests a significant linear relationship exists between the variables.\n\nII. A non-zero correlation coefficient (r) can be inferred from a non-zero slope in the regression line. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, with values close to 1 or -1 indicating a strong positive or negative linear relationship, respectively, and values close to 0 indicating little to no linear relationship. Since we have evidence of a linear relationship (as indicated by the non-zero confidence interval for the slope), it's reasonable to conclude that there is a non-zero correlation between the two variables.\n\nIII. The statement \"it is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0\" is incorrect based on the information provided. The confidence interval (0.45, 0.80) for the slope does not include 0, which means the data provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that the true slope is 0. This supports the existence of a linear relationship, not its absence.\n\nTherefore, statements I and II are true, while statement III is false."
