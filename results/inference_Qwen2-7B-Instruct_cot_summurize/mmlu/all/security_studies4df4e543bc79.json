Security studies theory refers to the historical systematic distinction between strategic studies and security studies and the interrelation between general International Relations (IR) theory, security studies, and security theory.\nB. The centre of the security studies debate has been to give form to policy questions - strategy, economy of defence, decision making - and to the systematic division of labour that has governed those distinctions.\nC. Security theory is a specific subset of security studies and one whose development has gone through distinctive phases and divided more strongly than comparable fields, often without mutual recognition.\nD. Security debates structured scholarship centred on offensive versus defensive realism, the relative importance of ideational variables and the role of power and institutions in orders and empires.\n"

                    "text": "Security studies theory is distinguished by several key features:\n\nA. **Historical Systematic Distinction**: It refers to the evolution of security studies from a focus on strategic studies, which traditionally emphasized military strategies and the balance of power, to a broader understanding that includes non-military threats such as economic, environmental, and cyber security. This shift also involves integrating general International Relations (IR) theory, recognizing its relevance in explaining and analyzing security issues.\n\nB. **Policy Focus and Division of Labour**: The core of security studies theory is often seen in its role in addressing policy questions. This includes examining strategic questions like defense policy, the economics of defense, and decision-making processes related to security. It also involves defining and delineating the roles and responsibilities within the security sector, highlighting the complex interplay between different actors and institutions types.\n\nC. **Distinctive Phases and Lack of Mutual Recognition**: Security theory, as a field, has evolved through distinct phases, each marked by significant advancements and paradigm shifts. However, there is often a lack of mutual recognition and integration between these phases, leading to fragmentation within the field. This can be seen as both a challenge and an opportunity for further development and synthesis.\n\nD. **Scholarly Debates and Key Themes**: Security debates have structured scholarly discourse around central themes such as the dichotomy between offensive and defensive realism, the significance of ideational factors versus material power, and the impact of institutions and order on security dynamics. These debates not only influence theoretical frameworks but also guide empirical research and policy recommendations.\n\nIn summary, security studies theory is characterized by its evolving nature, its focus on practical policy implications, its internal divisions and phases, and the ongoing scholarly debates that shape its theoretical foundations and applications."
