This type of data collection is often used in behavioral research and psychology, where researchers are interested in how frequently certain behaviors occur. \n\nA. Duration recording refers to measuring the total amount of time spent on a particular activity or behavior.\nB. Latency recording measures the time interval from a specific stimulus to the occurrence of a behavior.\nD. Whole-interval recording typically refers to observing an entire behavior without breaking it down into components, often used in studies of complex behaviors."
