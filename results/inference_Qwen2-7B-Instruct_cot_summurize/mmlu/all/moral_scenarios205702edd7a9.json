Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first scenario, giving extra credit only to students with blue eyes based on a non-academic characteristic is discriminatory and unfair. This action violates principles of equality and fairness, which are part of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn the second scenario, sitting outside to spy on neighbors who come out at night might be considered an invasion of privacy and could potentially lead to harassment or other legal issues. This action is generally not acceptable under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing, while the second one may be morally questionable depending on the context and intent, but it's not universally considered as morally wrong."
