The strength of this gravitational force depends on the mass of the Earth and the distance from the center of the Earth ( (r). The gravitational force, \\(F\\), can be calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{Mm}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(M\\) is the mass of the Earth, \\(m\\) is the mass of the satellite, and \\(r\\) is the distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nAs the satellite moves further away from the Earth's surface (i.e., increases its altitude), \\(r\\) increases, causing the gravitational force to decrease. This decrease in gravitational force means that the force acting on the satellite along its circular path becomes weaker compared to when it was closer to the Earth's surface. \n\nTo keep the satellite in a circular orbit, its velocity must be adjusted so that the gravitational force provides exactly the necessary centripetal force. This is why satellites in orbit have a constant speed; it's the balance between the gravitational force and the satellite's velocity that keeps it in a stable, circular path."
