Under the terms of its contract with the owner of the apartment building, the company agreed to carry out regular monthly inspections of the elevator and to make all necessary repairs. The elevator was installed in the apartment complex in January. For the next 10 months, the company made regular inspections. However, starting in November, the company began to have some difficulties with its employees and failed to send inspectors out for three successive months. On February 20, a woman went to visit her friend, who was a tenant on the 20th floor of the building. The woman used the intercom to call up to the friend, who buzzed to unlock the front door so that the woman could enter the building. The woman headed to the elevator. When the doors opened, several people were already inside the elevator, apparently having entered the elevator from the parking garage below the building. One of the people in the elevator was a man who acted shifty and nervous. By the 12th floor, only four persons were left, including the woman and the man. At that floor, the other two people left, leaving the woman and the man alone on the elevator. Apprehensive at finding herself alone with such an unkempt stranger, the woman pressed the 13th floor button, intending to step out and hoping to find other persons on that floor. Unfortunately, the elevator stalled, and came to a stop between the 12th and 13th floors. The woman's fears were justified, as the man suddenly grabbed at her purse. When the woman resisted, the man struck her, and she fell unconscious. When the woman recovered consciousness, she found herself in a hospital with a concussion and multiple contusions on her body. She later learned that the elevator had remained stalled for 50 minutes. Thereafter, it moved to the 20th floor, where she was found by her friend, who took her to the hospital. Two weeks later, the police arrested the man and found the woman's purse in his possession. This was the first assault that had occurred in the apartment building. The elevator's stalling was caused by a defective cable that a routine inspection would have discovered. If the woman brings suit against the owner of the apartment building for negligence, she will most likely\n\nA. recover, because she was an invitee of a tenant in the building.\nB. recover, because the owner would be vicariously liable for the company's failure to inspect the elevator.\nC. not recover, because the woman was negligent in failing to exit the elevator on the 12th floor when the other occupants exited the elevator.\nD. not recover, because there had been no previous assaults in the apartment building.\n"

As an invitee, she was lawfully present in the building, and the owner had a responsibility to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition. The elevator malfunctioning due to a defective cable is a clear breach of this duty, especially considering that regular inspections would have identified and prevented the issue. The fact that the elevator company failed to perform inspections is a contributing factor, but under premises liability law, the owner may still be held responsible for the injury sustained within their property, even if the injury is caused by a third party (in this case, the elevator company).\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not directly address the legal principle that the owner of the property has a duty to maintain safety conditions for invitees and may be held liable for injuries resulting from breaches of this duty. Therefore, option A is the most likely correct answer based on the information provided."
