According to this theory, time appears to move slower for an object in motion compared to one at rest, when observed from a stationary frame of reference. In this case, if you were on Earth and observed a spaceship moving away at high speeds, the clocks inside the spaceship would appear to be running slower than the ones on Earth. From the perspective inside the spaceship (option A), time would not seem to be running any slower; it would only be perceived that way from a stationary reference point like Earth."
