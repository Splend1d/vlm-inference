On this day, she negligently \"nodded off\" for just a few seconds on a park bench with the stroller next to her. She felt some movement and snapped awake to see a man taking the baby from the stroller. The man was large and menacing-looking. The babysitter, who is thin and petite, froze and did not put up a struggle as the man stated, \"I will kill you if you move.\" The babysitter did scream and call for help as the kidnapper fled with the child. Within a few yards he tripped and dropped the baby on its head. The baby died at the hospital of massive head injuries. Is it probable that the prosecutor will charge the babysitter with a crime, and if so, what will be the charge?\n\nA. Yes, this is felony murder in that the babysitter's unacceptable behavior was committed during the commission of the kidnapping felony.\nB. No, the babysitter did not commit a criminal act under the circumstances \u0080\u0094 her negligence was not gross enough to rise to the level of criminality and she had no criminal intent.\nC. No, because she did not do anything wrong in dozing off and she had no duty to protect the baby at the expense of her own life.\nD. Yes, she would be charged with negligent homicide because it was foreseeable that if she fell asleep for even just a few seconds, the baby would likely be kidnapped and killed.\n"

No, the babysitter did not commit a criminal act under the circumstances \u0080\u0094 her negligence was not gross enough to rise to the level of criminality and she had no criminal intent.\n\nIn this scenario, the babysitter's actions of nodding off while holding a potentially dangerous situation (a stranger could snatch the baby from the stroller - were negligent, but not criminal. The law typically distinguishes between civil negligence ( which can lead to lawsuits or compensation claims, and criminal negligence, which involves actions or omissions that create a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death or serious bodily harm to others. \n\nFor a crime like murder or manslaughter to be charged, there must be an element of criminal intent or recklessness beyond simple negligence. In this case, the babysitter didn't have any intent to cause harm or death, and her actions were not so reckless as to meet the legal standard for criminal liability. The tragic outcome was caused by the kidnapper's actions rather than the babysitter's negligence. \n\nHowever, this situation does highlight broader issues around the safety and responsibilities of babysitters, and the importance of continuous supervision when children are involved. It also underscores the need for stringent laws and regulations around child safety and the protection of vulnerable individuals."
