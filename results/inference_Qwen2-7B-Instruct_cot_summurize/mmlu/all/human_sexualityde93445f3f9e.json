                    "text": "Kenny's injury likely affects his nervous system, specifically his spinal cord. Quadriplegia, which is what Kenny has, refers to paralysis that affects all four limbs and the torso.\n\nA. Ejaculation - This process involves both motor and sensory functions controlled by the autonomic nervous system, which can be disrupted by spinal cord injuries. However, the exact impact varies from person to person. Some individuals may retain some ability to ejaculate with appropriate sexual stimulation.\n\nB. Erection - The ability to achieve and maintain an erection is also controlled by the autonomic nervous system and can be affected by spinal cord injuries. Erectile dysfunction after a spinal cord injury is common but not guaranteed for everyone.\n\nC. Genital Sensation - Sensory function, including sensations related to touch, temperature, and pain, can also be affected by spinal cord injuries. Depending on the level and completeness of the injury, some or all sensations might be altered or lost.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely answer based on the information provided would be D. both A and C. Kenny could potentially have impairments in both his ability to ejaculate (due to potential disruption of the autonomic nervous system controlling this function) and in genital sensation (due to possible loss of sensory input to the genital area as a result of the spinal cord injury. However, it's important to note that the specific impacts on Kenny's body would depend on the exact location and severity of his spinal cord injury."
