Logical reasoning and systematic planning\n\nFormal operational thinking is a stage in cognitive development, typically occurring during adolescence, characterized by the ability to think abstractly and reason hypothetically. This includes the ability to engage in systematic planning, think through problems logically, and understand complex concepts that may involve hypothetical scenarios or abstract ideas. It contrasts with earlier stages where reasoning might be more concrete or less abstract."
