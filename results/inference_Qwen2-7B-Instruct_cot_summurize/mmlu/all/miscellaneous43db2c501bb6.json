This skill allows a reader to grasp the core message or central theme of a text, which is essential for understanding and interpreting the content effectively. While skills like spelling, decoding, and recognizing rhyming patterns can be useful in various contexts, they do not directly contribute to comprehending the overall meaning of a piece of writing."
