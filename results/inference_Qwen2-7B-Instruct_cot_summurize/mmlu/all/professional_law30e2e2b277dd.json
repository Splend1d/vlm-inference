In that year, the conservationist conveyed the tract \"to my aunt in fee simple, provided, however, that the grantee agrees that neither she nor her heirs or assigns shall ever use the property for any commercial purpose. If any portion of said tract is used for other than residential purposes, then the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate. \" This deed was properly recorded. The applicable recording statute in effect in this jurisdiction provides, in part, \"No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, or any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. \"The aunt developed the tract into a residential subdivision between 1960 and 1969. This 100-acre tract was divided into single acre lots, all of which were sold during the same decade. Single-family residential dwellings were constructed on all of the lots except four, which were sold to an investor in 1968. The deed to the four lots contained the same restriction as stipulated in the deed between the conservationist and the aunt. In 1980, a bank acquired the investor's four lots in a foreclosure proceeding, and in the same year sold the property to a woman. The deed to the woman made no mention of the restriction. If the woman seeks to construct a service station on her parcel of land, which of the following arguments, if true, would offer her the best chance of implementation?\n\nA. The restriction against residential use is void as violative of the Rule against Perpetuities.\nB. The commercial development surrounding the property has made the deed restriction unenforceable.\nC. When the woman purchased the property from the bank, the deed did not contain any mention of the restriction.\nD. The jurisdiction in which the tract is located approved a zoning ordinance permitting the commercial development of the area surrounding the woman's property.\n"

When the woman purchased the property from the bank, the deed did not contain any mention of the restriction.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe key issue here revolves around the enforceability of the deed restriction against commercial use and whether it affects the woman's ability to construct a service station on her parcel of land. \n\nA. The argument that the restriction is void due to the rule against perpetuities might not be successful because the rule against perpetuities does not automatically invalidate restrictive covenants; it merely affects the duration of the covenant's validity. The question would depend on the specific state's interpretation and application of the rule.\n\nB. The argument that the commercial development surrounding the property makes the deed restriction unenforceable is weak because the restriction was placed on the land itself, not just on the grantee or their heirs. The surrounding development does not necessarily nullify the restriction on the specific parcel of land in question.\n\nC. This argument is the strongest because it directly addresses the enforceability of the restriction against the current owner. Since the deed to the woman did not contain any reference to the restriction, there is no legal basis for enforcing the restriction against her. In the absence of notice of the restriction when she purchased the property, she would have no obligation to adhere to the condition subsequent (the restriction).\n\nD. Even if the jurisdiction approved a zoning ordinance permitting commercial development in the area, this might not directly affect the enforceability of the deed restriction. Zoning laws can allow certain uses, but they do not necessarily invalidate existing restrictions placed on property through deeds.\n\nTherefore, option C offers the best chance for the woman to implement her plan to construct a service station on her parcel of land, assuming she had no knowledge of the restriction at the time of purchase."
