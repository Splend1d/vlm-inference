At trial, the mother is then called to testify as to her conversation with the man at the hospital where her son was rushed immediately following the accident. According to the mother, the man told her, \"Don't worry, my insurance company will pay for all of your son's medical expenses. \"If offered into evidence, the court will most likely rule that the mother's statement is\n\nA. admissible, on the issue of the defendant's negligence.\nB. admissible, to show that the defendant is able to pay for the medical expenses.\nC. inadmissible, because the testimony was highly prejudicial.\nD. admissible, only to prove ownership or control of the motorcycle.\n"

This information might be pertinent to the case, especially if it's being used to establish the defendant's financial capability to fulfill any judgment resulting from the lawsuit. However, the admissibility ultimately depends on the specific rules of evidence in the jurisdiction where the trial takes place, including factors such as relevance, prejudice, and whether the statement falls under an exception to the hearsay rule."
