The equation of exchange, often represented as MV = PQ ( where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the quantity of output, assumes the neutrality of money only if the velocity of money supply and the quantity of output are constant. This means that changes in the money supply directly affect the price level without influencing the real output or the velocity of money, under the condition that these other variables remain unchanged.\n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. Money supply and its velocity being equal doesn't necessarily ensure the neutrality of money. What matters is whether these two factors change together or independently, and their effect on the price level.\n\nC. Velocity of money supply equals the speed of transactions does not provide enough information to determine the neutrality of money. The key is how these factors interact with the money supply and output levels, not just their definitions.\n\nD. Inversely related money supply and velocity would imply that as one increases, the other decreases. This relationship doesn't inherently guarantee neutrality of money; it depends on how this dynamic affects the price level and real output in conjunction with the money supply."
