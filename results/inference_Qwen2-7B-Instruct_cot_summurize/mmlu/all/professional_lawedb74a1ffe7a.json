The state charged that selling the video violated its anti-obscenity law. The store owner defended on the ground that the prosecution violated his constitutional right to freedom of speech. Should the store owner prevail in this defense?\n\nA. No, because the store owner is engaged in the commercial sale of the video, which is not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nB. No, because the video consists entirely of portrayals of nudity, appeals to the prurient interest of viewers, and lacks serious social value as a whole.\nC. Yes, because mere portrayals of nudity are insufficient to justify a finding that the video is obscene as a matter of constitutional law.\nD. Yes, because the portrayals of nudity occurred outside the United States, and therefore the state lacks a compelling interest in applying its anti-obscenity law to the sale of the video.\n"

No, because the video consists entirely of portrayals of nudity, appeals to the prurient interest of viewers, and lacks serious social value as a whole.\n\nIn the context of obscenity laws, the Supreme Court has established the Miller test to determine whether material is obscene, which includes three prongs: ((1) whether the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest of the average person, applying with community standards; ( (2) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and ( (3) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. \n\nGiven that the video consists entirely of portrayals of nudity and does not provide any substantial literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, it would likely be found to violate the state's anti-obscenity law under the Miller test. Therefore, the store owner would not prevail in their defense based solely on the constitutional right to freedom of speech, unless there are other constitutional arguments that could be made in addition to this one."
