In his political philosophy, as laid out in \"Leviathan,\" Hobbes argues that in the state of nature, life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" To escape this condition, individuals consent to give up some of their freedoms to a sovereign authority, which then enforces laws and maintains order. Therefore, according to Hobbes, injustice fundamentally involves failing to comply with the laws established by this sovereign, as it disrupts the social contract and the peace it brings. \n\nSo the correct answer would be:\n\nA. disobedience to a sovereign"
