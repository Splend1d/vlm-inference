In an experiment, the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable; in an observational study, he or she simply observes and records the observations.\n\nThis means that during an experiment, the scientist actively changes one factor ( known as the independent variable, to see if it causes a change in another factor, known as the dependent variable. In contrast, in an observational study, the researcher does not manipulate variables; instead, they observe the natural behavior or conditions of subjects without intervention.\n\nThe other options are not accurate differences:\nA. Experiments can involve both human and non-human subjects, so this option is incorrect.\nC. Observational studies may or may not use randomized treatment and control groups, but it's not a defining characteristic that distinguishes them from experiments.\nD. Double-blindingess is not a requirement for an experiment, but rather an ideal design to minimize bias. Both experiments and observational studies can choose to be double-blind or not."
