Two officers testified that they examined \"track\" marks on the defendant's arms and wrists, and that he admitted to past drug usage. The accused testified that he was not an addict and the marks were from an allergic reaction. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find him guilty on proof that he was an addict, without proof of drug usage. The jury did not believe the defendant's denials, and found him guilty based on the observed track marks. The court sentenced him to six months imprisonment. He appealed, claiming cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Will the conviction likely be reversed on appeal?\n\nA. No, because the arrest is based on the regular use of illegal narcotics and is a proper concern of the criminal law.\nB. No, because the state has the power to forbid the use of narcotics within its borders and that's what this statute does.\nC. Yes, because the statute makes it criminal to use illegal drugs, which constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\nD. Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment.\n"

No, because the state has the power to forbid the use of narcotics within its borders and that's what this statute does.\n\nExplanation: The Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" In the context of this case, the statute in question criminalizes being addicted to the use of narcotic drugs. This falls under the state's power to regulate public health and welfare, which includes laws against substance abuse. Therefore, the statute itself is not considered cruel or unusual punishment.\n\nThe defendant's argument that his conviction was based on the mere presence of \"track\" marks and self-identification as an addict without proof of drug usage is a separate legal issue related to the sufficiency of evidence and jury instructions, rather than a constitutional challenge to the legality of the statute itself. Thus, the conviction would not likely be reversed on appeal solely based on the claim of cruel and unusual punishment."
