Orlistat: This is an approved medication for obesity management in Europe. It works by blocking the absorption of dietary fats.\n\n- B. Phentermine/Topiramate: This combination is also approved for use in Europe as a weight loss aid. It combines appetite suppression with other mechanisms to help with weight loss.\n\n- C. Lorcaserin: While Lorcaserin is FDA-approved in the United States for obesity, it is not currently approved for use in Europe.\n\n- D. Naltrexone/Bupropion: Similar to Lorcaserin, Naltrexone/Bupropion is approved in the United States but not yet approved for use in Europe.\n\nPlease note that regulations and approvals can change over time, so for the most current information, it would be best to consult the EMA or a healthcare professional."
