True, True\n\nStatement 1 is true because traditional machine learning algorithms indeed assume that the training set and the test set are independent and identically distributed ( (i.i.d.). This assumption is crucial for the validity of statistical inference in the model's predictions.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. As of 2017, it was common practice in the field of deep learning to pretrain Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models like COCO on large datasets such as ImageNet before fine-tuning them on more specific tasks. This approach leverages the learned features from the large dataset to improve performance on the target task."
