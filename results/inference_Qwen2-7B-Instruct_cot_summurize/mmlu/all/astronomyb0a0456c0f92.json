                    "text": "Orbital resonance occurs when two orbiting bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, typically because their orbital periods are related by an integer ratio. This can lead to interesting phenomena like the gaps in Saturn's rings and the 2:3 periodic ratio of Neptune:Pluto, as well as the breaking of small moons into ring material due to gravitational interactions.\n\nHowever, Kirkwood Gaps are specifically observed in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. These gaps occur at certain distances from the Sun where the orbital periods of asteroids have simple ratios (like 1:2, 2:3, 3:5, etc., with the orbital period of Jupiter. This is not due to orbital resonance with Neptune or Pluto but rather with Jupiter. Therefore, option B, \"Kirkwood Gaps,\" is NOT caused by orbital resonance involving Neptune or Pluto.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nB. Kirkwood Gaps."
