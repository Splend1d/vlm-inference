                    "text": "The correct answer is B. When a wave moves from shallow water to deep water, the frequency remains constant because it is determined by the source of the wave ( not by the medium. However, the wavelength increases as the wave moves into deeper water. This is because the depth of the water affects the wave's behavior; in shallower water, waves tend to be more influenced by the seabed, which can cause them to behave differently compared to waves in deeper water. As a result of this, the speed of the wave also increases in deep water because the wave can propagate without being significantly slowed down by the seabed. \n\nSo, the correct sequence is: frequency stays the same, wavelength increases, and speed increases."
