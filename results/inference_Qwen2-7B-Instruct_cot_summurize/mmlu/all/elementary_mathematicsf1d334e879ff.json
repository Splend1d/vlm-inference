Given that 1 quart (qt is equivalent to 4 cups, then:\n\n- 3 quarts = \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) cups\n\nSo, the ratio of 2 cups to 3 quarts can be written as 2 cups to 12 cups.\n\nThis ratio can be expressed as a fraction: \\(\\frac{2}{12}\\).\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\div 2}{12 \\div 2} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 1 over 6."
