The selection rules state that:\n\n1. The principal quantum number \\(n\\) ( of the final state must be greater than, equal to, or less than the initial state's \\(n\\). However, if \\(n\\) decreases, the change must be by at least one unit.\n2. The angular momentum quantum number \\(l\\) of the final state can only decrease by 1 or stay the same.\n\nGiven the initial state is \\(n=4, l=1\\):\n\n- We cannot increase \\(n\\) because it would require a decrease in \\(l\\) first, which violates the second rule. So, we cannot go to \\(n=5, l=1\\) or higher \\(n\\) states with the same \\(l\\).\n- Decreasing \\(n\\) requires \\(l\\) to decrease by at least 1. So, going from \\(n=4, l=1\\) to \\(n=3, l=2\\) is not allowed because it would violate the first rule ( decreasing \\(n\\) without decreasing \\(l\\) first.\n- Decreasing \\(l\\) from 1 to 0 is allowed according to the second rule.\n- Staying at the same \\(n\\) but changing \\(l\\) to 0 is also allowed.\n\nSo, the final state that cannot be reached by an allowed transition from \\(n=4, l=1\\) is **A. n = 3, l = 2**."
