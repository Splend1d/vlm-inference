Here's why:\n\nA. Disagreements between the predecessor auditor and management as to significant accounting policy and principles: This is important because it helps the successor auditor understand any contentious issues that may have arisen during the previous audit period.\n\nB. The predecessor auditor\u2019s understanding of the reasons for the change of auditors: Knowing why the company decided to change auditors can provide insights into potential areas of concern or changes in the company's operations that might impact the financial statements.\n\nC. Facts known to the predecessor auditor that might bear on the integrity of management: This information can help the successor auditor assess any risks related to management's actions or decisions that could affect the financial statements.\n\nD. Matters that may facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years: Consistency in financial reporting is crucial for providing reliable information to stakeholders. Understanding how the predecessor auditor approached this aspect can help ensure continuity and reliability in the audit process.\n\nIn practice, a successor auditor would likely request all of these pieces of information to gain a comprehensive understanding of the audit situation and make informed judgments about the work that needs to be done."
