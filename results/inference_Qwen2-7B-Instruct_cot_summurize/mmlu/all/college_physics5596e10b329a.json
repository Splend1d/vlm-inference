Let's assume that the intensity of this partially polarized light is \\(I_1\\). \n\nAfter passing through the first polarizer, the light becomes polarized at an angle of 90 degrees relative to the transmission axis of the first polarizer. When this light then passes through the second polarizer, which is oriented at an angle of 45 degrees to the first polarizer, only the component of the light that is parallel to the second polarizer's transmission axis (will pass through. This component represents \\(\\cos^2(45^\\circ) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\) of the intensity.\n\nTherefore, the intensity of the light after passing through both polarizers is \\(I_2 = I_1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{I_1}{4}\\), meaning the transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is 25% of the incident intensity."
