After exhausting his appeals, he filed for post-conviction relief, alleging that he had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. He established that his counsel had not advised him of the benefits of plea bargaining, and had withheld several offers for guilty pleas from the government. The offers expired for lack of a response. The sentence he received was at least seven to eight years more than if he had entered a guilty plea. Will the court likely decide that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel?\n\nA. Yes, because plea bargaining is a critical stage of a criminal case and an attorney who ignores that process is constitutionally ineffective.\nB. No, because plea bargaining is not a critical necessity in a criminal case and counsel has no duty to discuss such options with the defendant.\nC. When the defendant indicates he wants to fight the charges, there is no need for counsel to relay plea offers or discuss the options with him.\nD. Because this defendant was convicted at a fair trial he didn't lose any rights and was not prejudiced by his lawyer's mistakes.\n"

Yes, because plea bargaining is a critical stage of a criminal case and an attorney who ignores that process is constitutionally ineffective.\n\nIn determining whether a defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel, courts typically apply a two-pronged test: (1) the attorney's performance must be deficient (i.e., significantly below that which would be expected from a reasonably competent attorney; and 2) the deficient performance must have prejudiced the defense, meaning it likely changed the outcome of the case. In this scenario, the attorney's failure to inform the defendant of plea offers(s) that expired due to non-response could meet both prongs of the test.\n\nThe attorney's omission regarding plea bargaining is considered a critical aspect of the criminal justice process, as it affects the defendant's ability to make informed decisions about their case. By not providing information about plea offers(s), the attorney failed to fulfill their duty to advise the defendant of potential outcomes, which is a key component of providing effective representation. This oversight may have led to the defendant receiving a harsher sentence than they would have under they accepted the plea deal, thus potentially meeting the prejudice requirement.\n\nTherefore, a court is likely to find that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel, especially given that the defendant might have accepted a less severe sentence if adequately informed of the plea offer(s)."
