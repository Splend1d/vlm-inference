Correctness. \n\nConfidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are generally recognized as the three core pillars of information security known as the CIA triad ( or the 3Cs. Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. Integrity ensures that data has not been altered or tampered with in an unauthorized manner. Availability ensures that information and services are accessible when needed by authorized users.\n\nCorrectness, on the other hand, pertains more to the accuracy and reliability of the system or process itself rather than a security property per se. It's related to ensuring that systems perform their intended functions correctly and consistently, but it does not specifically address the protection against unauthorized access or modifications, which are are the main focus of cybersecurity."
