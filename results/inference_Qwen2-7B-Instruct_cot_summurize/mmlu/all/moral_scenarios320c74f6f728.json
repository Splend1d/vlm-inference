Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, helping someone cheat on a standardized examination is considered morally wrong because it violates academic integrity and fairness, which are are fundamental principles in educational settings. Cheating undermines the purpose of assessments, which is to evaluate a student's knowledge and skills accurately.\n\nIn Scenario 2, eating the cookies that your mother bought for you is not considered morally wrong. In fact, it is a normal and acceptable action, assuming you were hungry or wanted to eat them. There is no intention to deceive, harm others, or violate any rights in this scenario."
