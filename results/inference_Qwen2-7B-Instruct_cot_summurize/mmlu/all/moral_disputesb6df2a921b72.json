Liberal egalitarians strive to create societies that allow individuals to pursue their own projects (option A), provide equal opportunities (option B), protect free speech (option C), and minimize actual inequalities (option D). Therefore, there is no option listed here that is not considered a concern by Carens or other proponents of liberal egalitarianism."
