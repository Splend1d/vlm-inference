This harm can occur even when the speech does not intend to cause direct harm but contributes to the social and cultural environment that perpetuates discrimination.\n\nIn this context, \"expressive harm\" can be understood as:\n\nA. a causal consequence of hate speech: Hate speech often leads to the creation of an environment that discriminates against certain groups, causing them harm through societal attitudes and behaviors.\n\nB. a harm that derives from the kind of attitude expressed in the act of hate speech: The harmful attitudes expressed can lead to real-world consequences for the targeted individuals or groups, such as increased prejudice, isolation, and difficulty accessing resources.\n\nTherefore, expressive harm can be seen as both a consequence and a result of the attitudes expressed in hate speech, making option C (both A and B - the most accurate choice according to the understanding provided by Tufekci and Goffman's work on stigma and social norms."
