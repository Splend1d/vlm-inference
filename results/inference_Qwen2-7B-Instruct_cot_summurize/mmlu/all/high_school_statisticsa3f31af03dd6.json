                    "text": "To understand this question, you need to know that when discussing correlations and their relation to explaining variance in data, the square of the correlation coefficient ( \\( r^2 \\) or the coefficient of determination is often used. It tells you the proportion of the variance in one variable that can be explained by the other variable.\n\nGiven that you're comparing two correlation coefficients, 0.6 and 0.3, you're essentially looking at the ratio of \\( r^2 \\) for 0.6 to \\( r^2 \\) for 0.3.\n\nFirst, calculate each \\( r^2 \\):\n\n- For \\( r = 0.6 \\), \\( r^2 = 0.6^2 = 0.04 \\)\n- For \\( r = 0.3 \\), \\( r^2 = 0.3^2 = 0.09 \\)\n\nNow, to find out how many times the percentage of variation in \\( y \\) explained by the variation in \\( x \\) is when comparing these two correlation coefficients, you take the ratio of these \\( r^2 \\) values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r^2_{0.6}}{r^2_{0.3}} = \\frac{0.04}{0.09} = \\frac{4}{9} \\]\n\nThis fraction simplifies to approximately 0.444, which means that the percentage of variation in \\( y \\) explained by the variation in \\( x \\) with a correlation of 0.6 is about 0.444 times the percentage explained by a correlation of 0.3.\n\nHowever, the question seems to ask in reverse: how many times greater is the percentage of variation explained by a correlation of 0.6 compared to a correlation of 0.3. This would be the inverse operation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r^2_{0.3}}{r^2_{0.6}} = \\frac{0.09}{0.04} = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of variation in \\( y \\) explained by the variation in \\( x \\) with a correlation of 0.6 is 2.25 times the percentage explained by a correlation of 0.3. \n\nTherefore, none of the options A through D directly match this calculation. However, if interpreting the question as asking how many times more the percentage of variation is explained by a correlation of 0.6 compared to 0.3, the closest option would be:\n\nA. 2\n\nThis choice might be misleadingly correct based on a misinterpretation of the question's intent, given the precise calculation leads to 2.25. The correct interpretation should clarify that the percentage explained by a correlation of 0.6 is not exactly twice that of 0.3 but rather 2.25 times."
