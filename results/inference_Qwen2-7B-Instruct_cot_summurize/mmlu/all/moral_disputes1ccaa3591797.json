He argues that if you have the means to prevent suffering, you should do so, regardless of how small the contribution seems in isolation. This principle considers your ability to help when deciding how much you should contribute to alleviating world hunger and poverty.\n\nThe other options ( A (equality and harm, B rights and the good, C rights and desert \u2013 seem less directly relevant to specific criticisms of Singer's approach to addressing world hunger and poverty. However, these concepts may be indirectly connected to his views, as they often form part of broader ethical frameworks he might engage with. For example, Singer's work frequently discusses the ethical implications of causing harm, which could relate to his principle of equality and harm. Similarly, his focus on the consequences of actions (the 'good' or 'better' outcomes \u2013 alignss with his consideration of rights and the good. \n\nTherefore, without knowing the exact context or content of Arthur's argument, the most plausible answer choice given the information provided would be D: the principles of ability to help and desires."
