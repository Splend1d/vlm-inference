While they were watching the movie, freezing rain fell outside, coating everything with a thin layer of very slippery ice. When the movie ended, one of the man's guests slipped on the ice as soon as he took a step out of the door and onto the front stoop of the man's house. Which of the following would best describe the duty of care owed by the man to his guest?\n\nA. No duty of care.\nB. A duty to inspect the premises for unknown dangers and disclose their existence to others.\nC. A duty to warn of any known dangerous condition on the premises.\nD. An absolute duty of care.\n"

A duty to warn of any known dangerous condition on the premises.\n\nThe host would be expected to have a duty to warn guests of any known hazardous conditions on the property. In this case, given that the freezing rain and icy conditions were likely known or at least foreseeable, the host would have an obligation to inform the guests about these risks to ensure their safety. This could involve things like providing appropriate footwear, using salt or sand to de-ice walkways, or giving warnings about slippery surfaces."
