Circular ds DNA with T antigen coding regions\n\nPolyomaviruses have a double-stranded (DNA genome, which is circular in shape. The viral genome encodes for two types of proteins: large T antigen and small T antigen, which are involved in the viral replication cycle, and a viral capsid protein that helps form the virus particle. \n\nOptions B, C, and D do not accurately describe the genome structure of the polyomavirus family:\n- B. Circular ssDNA describes single-stranded DNA viruses, which is not what polyomaviruses are.\n- C. RNA genome with RT refers to RNA viruses that can use reverse transcriptase (like retroviruses, but not polyomaviruses.\n- D. Segmented RNA genome describes a type of genome found in segmented viruses like influenza, which is also not the case for polyomaviruses."
