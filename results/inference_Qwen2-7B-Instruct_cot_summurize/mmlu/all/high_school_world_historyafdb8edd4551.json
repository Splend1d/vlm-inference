They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire.\n\u2014Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847\nHow did Japan respond to the concerns raised by Lord Ii during this era?\n\nA.

The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry.\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Japan faced significant internal and external pressures that led to a period of significant change known as the Meiji Restoration. In response to the concerns raised by Lord Ii about Japan's lack of modernization and potential vulnerability to foreign powers, Emperor Meiji took decisive action to reform the country.\n\nIn 1853, the American Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in Japan with a fleet of warships, forcing the Japanese to open their ports for trade under the threat of military force. This event, known as the \"Perry Expedition,\" marked the beginning of Japan's isolationist policy coming to an end. It was a wake-up call for Japan to modernize and catch up with the Western powers.\n\nTo address these challenges, the new government embarked on a series of reforms, known collectively as the Meiji Restoration. Key elements of these reforms included:\n\n1. **Westernization**: Japan began to adopt Western technologies, institutions, and ideas. This included learning about modern governance, law, education, and military techniques from European and American models.\n\n2. **Modernization of Industry and Economy**: The government initiated industrialization efforts, focusing on building infrastructure such as roads, railways, and telegraph networks. They also encouraged the development of industries like textiles, iron, and steel.\n\n3. **Reforms in Governance**: The traditional feudal system was replaced with a more centralized bureaucratic system based on meritocracy, similar to the Western civil service system. This helped in creating a more efficient administration capable of managing the country's affairs.\n\n4. **Military Modernization**: The samurai class was transformed into a modern army, equipped with Western weapons and trained in Western military tactics. The navy was also strengthened, acquiring modern ships and submarines.\n\n5. **Education Reforms**: A modern education system was established, emphasizing science, technology, and practical skills alongside traditional studies. This laid the foundation for a well-educated workforce.\n\n6. **Opening of Ports**: Japan opened its ports to international trade, which facilitated economic growth and cultural exchange. It also allowed Japan to engage with the global community and learn from other nations.\n\nThrough these reforms, Japan successfully modernized itself and emerged as a major world power by the end of the 19th century. The country became known as a model of rapid modernization and industrialization, and its actions during this period played a crucial role in shaping its future as a modern nation-state."
