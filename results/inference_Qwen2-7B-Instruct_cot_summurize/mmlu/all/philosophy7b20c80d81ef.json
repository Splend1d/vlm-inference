He encourages individuals to deliberate carefully about their actions and consider how they align with what is within their control (i.e., their own attitudes and reactions) versus what is not within their control (i.e., external events and circumstances). This approach helps individuals to live a virtuous life and achieve inner peace by accepting what cannot be changed and focusing on what can be improved through personal effort and moral discipline."
