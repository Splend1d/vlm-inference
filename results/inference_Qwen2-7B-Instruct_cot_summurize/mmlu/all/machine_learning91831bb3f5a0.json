While it might seem intuitive to increase the complexity of an HMM by adding more hidden states to better fit the data, this approach can lead to overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. In other words, the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Increasing the number of hidden states without proper justification or using techniques like regularization can lead to a model that fits the training data too closely, including its noise and outliers, which does not generalize well to new data.\n\nStatement 2 is true. Collaborative filtering is indeed a popular and effective technique used in modeling users' preferences, especially in scenarios like movie recommendations. This method works by predicting the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users. The underlying assumption is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than the opinion of a randomly chosen person. In the context of movies, collaborative filtering can predict how much a user might like a movie they haven't seen based on how other similar users have rated that movie. It's widely used in recommendation systems to suggest items (like movies, books, or music) to users based on their previous preferences and those of similar users."
