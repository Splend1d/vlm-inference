The effective velocity of the projectile relative to the ground will be greatest when the angle of projection is set to maximize this effect.\n\nGiven:\n- Velocity of the truck (Vx = 5 m/s\n- Muzzle velocity of the cannon (Vy = 50 m/s\n\nThe formula for the maximum range R of a projectile launched from an elevated position (y0) towards a target at the same height can be derived considering both the initial velocity and the velocity imparted by the moving platform. However, for simplicity, we can consider the problem focusing on maximizing the horizontal component of the velocity relative to the ground, which directly impacts the range.\n\nThe maximum range occurs when the angle \u03b8 is such that the horizontal component of the projectile's velocity (Vx' = Vy * cos(\u03b8) plus the velocity of the truck (Vx, is maximized. This happens when \u03b8 = 45\u00b0, because at this angle, the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity are equal, and the horizontal velocity is maximized for a given Vy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 45\u00b0"
