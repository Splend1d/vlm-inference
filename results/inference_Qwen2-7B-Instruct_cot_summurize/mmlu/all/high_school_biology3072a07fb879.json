Biogeography\n\nThe discipline most likely to provide an evolutionary explanation for the difference in tails between monkeys in South and Central America versus those in Africa and Asia is biogeography. Biogeography studies the distribution of species and ecosystems over geographic space and through geological time. It can help explain how environmental factors, such as climate, habitat, and geographic barriers, influenced the evolution of different species in various regions. In this case, it could explain how the specific environments in South and Central America, which may have required better grasping abilities for survival, led to the evolution of prehensile tails in those regions's monkey populations, while different environments in Africa and Asia did not necessitate such adaptations."
