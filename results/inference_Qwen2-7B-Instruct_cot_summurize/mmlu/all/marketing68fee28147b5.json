Convenience sampling involves selecting individuals that are easiest to reach or most convenient to access. Quota sampling, on the other hand, involves dividing the population into mutually exclusive subgroups (like age groups or gender categories, then selecting a sample where the proportion of each subgroup matches the population's proportions. \n\nCluster sampling and stratified sampling, however, are both forms of random sampling. In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters ( which are often geographic areas, and then entire clusters are randomly selected for study. Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups ( strata, based on shared characteristics, then taking a random sample from each stratum. \n\nRandom and cluster samples are actually examples of random sampling, not non-random sampling. Therefore, they would be incorrect in this context."
