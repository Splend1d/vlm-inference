This process leads to the establishment of three primary germ layers: the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Among these, the mesoderm is formed during gastrulation and typically occurs after neurulation, which is the process of forming the neural tube that will develop into the central nervous system. Therefore, option A accurately describes the process and timing of gastrulation in terms of mesoderm formation."
