The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law\n\nThis act was designed to ensure that the laws of the United Kingdom comply with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, making it part of domestic law. \n\nB. is not entirely accurate because while the Human Rights Act does allow courts to interpret and apply human rights principles, it does not directly invalidate primary legislation. It can lead to the invalidation if legislation is found to be incompatible with the Human Rights Act or the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nC. is partially correct in the sense that the Human Rights Act does allow individuals to bring cases to court alleging a breach of their human rights under the Act, but it's not limited to \"any person\" without criteria. The individual must have a reasonable case and meet certain conditions set out in the Act.\n\nD. is incorrect because the Human Rights Act 1998 does not incorporate the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK law. Instead, the incorporation was superseded by the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union ( Brexit)."
