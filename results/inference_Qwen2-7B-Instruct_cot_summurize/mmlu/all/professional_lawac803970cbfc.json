Under the applicable statute of limitations, a suit to collect on the promissory note had to have been filed by September 30 of last year. On June 1 of this year, the creditor received a letter from the debtor stating, \"I shall pay you $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of what I owe you. \" However, the debtor failed to make the payment on July 1. If, on August 1, the creditor brings suit against the debtor and the debtor asserts the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense and refuses to pay the creditor anything, which of the following accurately states the creditor's legal rights against the debtor?\n\nA. On June 1 the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\nB. On July 1, not June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\nC.

On July 1, not June 1, the creditor will be entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $12,000.\n\nWhen the debtor sent the letter on June 1, it was an offer to pay $5,000 in full satisfaction of the debt. This is a conditional offer, and the creditor did not accept it until the payment was made on July 1, which the debtor failed to do. Therefore, the offer was not accepted, and the original debt of $12,000 remains intact. When the creditor files suit on August 1, they can seek the full amount of the debt, which is $12,000, not just $5,000."
