Given a quantum efficiency (\u03b7 = 0.1 for this detector, and 100 photons being sent into the detector one after another, we can calculate the expected number of detections as follows:\n\nExpected number of detections = Number of photons * Quantum efficiency\n= 100 * 0.1\n= 10\n\nSo, on average, the detector will detect 10 photons out of 100.\n\nRegarding the standard deviation (\u03c3, it quantifies the spread or variability in the number of detections around the mean value. For a binomial distribution ( which describes the number of successes (in this case, detections) in a fixed number of independent trials ( where each trial has the same probability of success (the quantum efficiency), the variance is given by:\n\nVariance = n * p * (1 - p)\n\nwhere:\nn = number of trials = 100\np = probability of success = 0.1\n\nVariance = 100 * 0.1 * (0.9 = 9\n\nStandard deviation (\u03c3) is the square root of the variance:\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a9 = 3\n\nTherefore, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times with an RMS deviation of about 3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3**."
