                    "text": "C. Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen an electron (negative charge) and a positron (positive charge) interact, they will annihilate each other, releasing pure energy in the form of gamma rays. This is because the total energy and momentum before and after the reaction must remain constant, which is a principle of conservation.\n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Conservation of mass: This statement doesn't apply directly to this scenario. While mass-energy equivalence does imply that mass can be converted to energy, the concept of \"creating\" a particle with a specific mass in this context doesn't align with how annihilation works. Instead, the total mass before and after the annihilation is zero, reflecting the fact that mass has been converted to energy.\n\nB. Conservation of charge: This statement is incorrect because the reaction involves the annihilation of a positive charge (the positron) and a negative charge (the electron), resulting in the creation of photons (which have no electric charge). The net charge is conserved (it's zero), but this doesn't mean that no charge is created.\n\nD. Conservation of energy: This statement is partially correct in a sense that energy is conserved. However, it doesn't specifically describe what happens when a positron and an electron interact. In this case, the annihilation results in the release of gamma rays, which carry away the energy, rather than leaving the electron behind."
