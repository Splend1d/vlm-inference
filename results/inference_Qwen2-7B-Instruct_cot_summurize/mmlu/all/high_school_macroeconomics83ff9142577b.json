According to their theory, a decrease in the money supply would lead to a reduction in inflationary pressures in the economy. This is because when there is less money circulating in the economy, the demand for goods and services decreases, which can lead to lower prices (deflation).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. lower the price level in the economy.\n\nIt's worth noting that while this directly impacts the price level, it might not necessarily lead to a decrease in output if the decrease in money supply is managed carefully and if other factors like demand and productivity remain stable. However, in the context of monetarist theory and its focus on inflation, the primary effect highlighted is on the price level."
