Increased demand    Rising    Appreciates\n\nWhen households increase their demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, it leads to an increased demand for these securities in the money market. This increased demand shifts the demand curve for bonds to the right, leading to a higher equilibrium price (which is the interest rate on these bonds. \n\nIn terms of the foreign exchange market, when there is an increased demand for U.S. Treasury bonds by foreign investors (not just households but also other entities worldwide), it indicates an inflow of capital into the US. This increased inflow of capital strengthens the demand for the US Dollar, causing its value to appreciate in foreign currency markets. However, the direct effect mentioned here is from household demand for US Treasury bonds, which would lead to an appreciation of the dollar as it might attract more foreign investment due to perceived higher yields.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n- Increased demand for bonds in the money market,\n- Leads to a rising interest rate ( because the demand for bonds has increased,\n- Appreciates the value of the dollar in foreign currency markets, as higher demand for US debt can lead to higher demand for USD."
