This condition implies that every element of the group has an order that divides 4, because adding an element to itself four times gives the identity element.\n\nGiven that the order of \\(G\\) is 16, which factors as \\(16 = 2^2 \\times 5\\), we know by Lagrange's theorem that the possible orders of elements in \\(G\\) must divide 16. The conditions given suggest that all non-identity elements have orders dividing 4, which means they could either be of order 2 or 4. \n\nHowever, since \\(16 = 2^2 \\times 5\\), the only cyclic group of order 16 that satisfies our condition is one where every non-identity element has order 4. This is because if there were an element of order 2, it would imply the existence of another element of order 8 ( (since the group would need to contain a subgroup of order 8 generated by this element of order 2, and such a subgroup would include elements of order 2 and 4). But this would violate our condition that every element's order divides 4.\n\nThus, we're looking at a group \\(G\\) where the operation of adding any element to itself four times results in the identity element, implying that the group structure is essentially based on elements of order 4. \n\nIn terms of classification up to isomorphism:\n\n1. **Cyclic Group:** Since we're dealing with an abelian group of order 16, and the condition restricts all non-identity elements to have order 4, the group can be described as \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{16}\\) but with the additional property that all non-identity elements are of order 4. However, due to the specific condition, this essentially collapses into a structure where the group behaves like \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4\\), considering the direct product structure that accommodates elements of order 4.\n\n2. **Structure Analysis:** Considering the group properties, we realize that any group satisfying these conditions must be isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4\\). This is because in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{16}\\), the only elements that can satisfy \\(x + x + x + x = 0\\) are those that, when added to themselves four times, result in zero, which are precisely the elements of order 4. \n\nTherefore, there is only one way to construct such a group, up to isomorphism, that satisfies the given condition. Hence, the answer is **B. 1**."
