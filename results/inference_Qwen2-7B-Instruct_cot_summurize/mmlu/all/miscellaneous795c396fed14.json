Assuming an average efficiency of 50% for EVs compared to gasoline engines ( (which is roughly the average efficiency gain over traditional ICEs), we can estimate the energy required to replace gasoline use with electricity.\n\n   The energy equivalent of gasoline use in a year: \\(146 \\text{ billion gallons} \\times 468,490,000 \\text{ J/gallon} = 66,264,100,000,000,000 \\text{ J}\\)\n\nGiven that EVs are are around 50% efficient compared to gasoline engines, the energy required for the equivalent transportation would be:\n\n\\(\\frac{66,264,100,000,000,000 \\text{ J}}{0.5} = 132,528,200,000,000,000 \\text{ J}\\)\n\nTo convert this into scientific notation:\n\n\\(132,528,200,000,000,000 \\text{ J} = 1.325282 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ J}\\)\n\nThis estimation suggests that the amount of additional electrical energy the United States would need to generate to support all electric car driving would be closest to \\(1.325 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ J}\\), which is not directly listed among your options. However, given the options provided, none of them exactly matches our calculation, indicating there might have been some assumptions or approximations made in this explanation. \n\nIn general terms, option C ( \\(2 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ J}\\) seems to be the closest to our calculated value, but it's important to note that this is an estimation and the actual figure could vary based on different factors such as improvements in vehicle efficiency, changes in energy sources, and other economic and technological developments."
