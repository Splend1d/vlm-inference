This includes dilating the pupils, constricting blood vessels to redirect blood flow to essential organs, and increasing the activity of sweat glands to cool the body. However, it decreases peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract, which is the rhythmic contractions that move food along the digestive system. Instead, it slows down digestion to conserve energy during times of stress or activity."
