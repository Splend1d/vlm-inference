If you were living on Venus and had a telescope that could pierce through its thick clouds, you wouldn't be able to observe the phases of the Earth directly due to the vast distance between the two planets. However, considering the options provided and assuming you could somehow view the Earth from Venus, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous\n\nThis is because from Venus's perspective, the Earth would go through its phases as it orbits around the Sun. The phases would appear as follows: when the Earth is in its waxing gibbous phase (when more than half of the illuminated part is visible), then at full moon (when the entire visible side is lit up), and finally in its waning gibbous phase (when less than half of the illuminated part is visible again)."
