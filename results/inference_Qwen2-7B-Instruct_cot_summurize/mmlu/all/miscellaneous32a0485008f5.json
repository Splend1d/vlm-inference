Large-scale deforestation of the Amazon or Congo basin tropical forests\n\nDeforestation has a significant impact on biodiversity because it destroys habitats, leading to species loss and reduces the overall ecosystem services provided by these forests. Forests like the Amazon and Congo Basin are home to thousands of plant and animal species found nowhere else on Earth. Activities such as logging, agriculture expansion, and urbanization often lead to deforestation, which can result in the extinction of species and alter the balance of ecosystems."
