Its atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (81.5% by volume) with about 15% methane and small amounts of other gases, such as argon and ethane.\n\nD. Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons. While it contains significant amounts of nitrogen and methane, the hydrocarbons are present due to the presence of these gases reacting or being naturally occurring compounds on the moon's surface. For example, methane reacts with nitrogen to form more complex hydrocarbon molecules like ethane and propane, which are found in liquid pools on the surface of Titan.\n\nB. While Titan does have evidence for geologic activity, it is not unique in this regard among the outer solar system moons. Enceladus, another moon of Saturn, has geysers that eject water ice particles into space, indicating ongoing geologic activity beneath its icy surface.\n\nC. Titan's atmosphere is indeed rich in hydrocarbons, but it is not accurate to say that it is \"composed mostly\" of hydrocarbons since nitrogen makes up a significant portion of its atmospheric composition."
