The other conspirators assured him there would be no injuries or killings, but while in the bank they killed two people. Pursuant to the state's felony murder rule, the getaway driver was convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to death. After exhausting his appeals, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear his case. He argued that he did not intend to kill and was not even present. What is the most likely holding of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. It is constitutional for a state to authorize the execution of an individual who participates in a robbery in which another robber takes life.\nB. A conviction of first degree murder justifies the execution as long as aggravating circumstances are found to exist.\nC. The felony murder rule is unconstitutional and the defendant's conviction must be reversed.\nD. The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed.\n"

The felony murder rule is unconstitutional and the defendant's conviction must be reversed.\n\nThe Supreme Court has previously expressed concern about the application of the felony murder rule, particularly when it leads to sentences such as capital punishment without a finding that the defendant had the intent to kill or a substantial role in the killing. In cases where the defendant's involvement is limited to the commission of the underlying felony (like being serving as the getaway driver), the Court may find that the application of the felony murder rule violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nGiven the defendant's argument that he did not intend to kill and was not present at the scene of the crime, and considering the Court's previous stance on the limitations of the felony murder rule, the most likely holding of the Supreme Court would be option C: that the felony murder rule as applied in this case is unconstitutional and the defendant's conviction must be reversed."
