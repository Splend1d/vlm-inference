According to the basic principle of natural law theory, an action is considered right if and only if it does not involve a direct violation of basic moral or ethical values. Natural law theory posits that there are fundamental principles of right and wrong that are inherent in human nature and can be discovered through reason.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the theory does not consider indirect violations as sufficient for an action to be deemed morally right. Option B is also incorrect because while the laws of natural selection might influence human behavior and societal norms, they do not determine what is morally right or wrong according to natural law theory. Option D is incorrect because option C accurately represents the core principle of natural law theory."
