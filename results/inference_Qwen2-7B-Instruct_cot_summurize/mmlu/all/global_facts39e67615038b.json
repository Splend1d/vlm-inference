About $15k.\n\nTo calculate GDP per capita, you would need to divide the Gross Domestic Product ( (GDP) of the United States in 1950 by its population that year. However, to adjust for inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP), we use GDP figures adjusted to 2011 prices. \n\nAccording to data from the World Bank, the nominal GDP of the US in 1950 was approximately $246 billion. Adjusting this figure for inflation to 2011 prices (using the GDP deflator, the real GDP in 2011 dollars for 1950 was about $2.7 trillion. The population of the US in 1950 was roughly 151 million people. \n\nDividing the real GDP in 2011 dollars by the population:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\$2.7 \\text{ trillion}}{151 \\text{ million}} = \\$17,873 \\]\n\nRounding this figure to the nearest thousand gives us about $15,000 per capita, which matches choice C."
