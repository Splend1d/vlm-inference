Since \\(e\\) is approximately \\(2.718\\), \\(f(1) > 0\\).\n\nGiven that \\(f(x)\\) is continuous and changes sign from negative to positive as \\(x\\) moves from 0 to 1, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists at least one real solution in the interval \\([0, 1]\\). Moreover, since \\(f'(x) = e^x + 1 > 0\\) for all \\(x\\), \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing on \\([0, 1]\\), implying there's exactly one solution in this interval.\n\nThus, \\(k = 1\\).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) outside \\([0, 1]\\).**\n\nGiven that \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing and continuous everywhere (and considering its behavior:\n\n- As \\(x \\to -\\infty\\), \\(e^x \\to 0\\), so \\(f(x) \\to -\\infty\\).\n- As \\(x \\to \\infty\\), \\(f(x) \\to \\ininfty\\).\n\nSince \\(f(x)\\) crosses the x-axis exactly once in \\([0, 1]\\) and given its monotonic nature, it will cross the x-axis exactly once more elsewhere. Specifically:\n\n- For \\(x < 0\\), \\(f(x) < 0\\) ( because \\(e^x < 1\\) and thus \\(f(x) = e^x + x - 2 < 0\\).\n- For \\(x > 1\\), \\(f(x) > 0\\) because \\(e^x\\) grows faster than any linear function, making \\(f(x) = e^x + x - 2\\) positive beyond \\(x = 1\\).\n\nHence, there is exactly one solution outside \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nThus, \\(n = 1\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **C. k = n = 1**."
