As a stack-allocated variable, it could have different addresses depending on when its containing function is called\n\nLocal variables in a program are typically stored on the call stack, which is a data structure used by the program's runtime environment to manage the execution of functions and procedures. When a function is called, the runtime allocates space on the call stack for the local variables of that function. The exact location of this space on the stack can change based on the order in which functions are called, as well as other factors like the number of concurrent threads running or the amount of stack space available.\n\nThis means that the same local variable could have different addresses each time its containing function is called, making it impossible for the compiler to determine an absolute address for the variable."
