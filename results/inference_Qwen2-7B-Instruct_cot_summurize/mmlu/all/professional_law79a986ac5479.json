The prosecutor stated that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness to testify that the perpetrator told the witness \"I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in.'' The defense objected to the proposed testimony. Will the court likely sustain the objection?\n\nA. No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish he is lying on cross, if he takes the stand.\nB. No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.\nC. Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.\nD. Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.\n"

No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.\n\nIn this situation, the statement made by the perpetrator to the witness could potentially be used in two ways:\n\n1. **Impeachment**: If the perpetrator decides to take the stand during the trial, the statement can be used to challenge the credibility of the perpetrator's testimony. This is because the statement suggests that the perpetrator might be lying about not intending to harm or deceive the child or their parents.\n\n2. **Party Admission**: The statement can also be admitted as evidence that the perpetrator knew the child personally (since he is looking forward to visiting with them) and that he was aware the child's parents had money (because he mentioned enjoying staying in their \"wonderfully luxurious house.\" This information directly relates to the prosecution's claims about the perpetrator's knowledge and intent.\n\nTherefore, options A and C are incorrect because the statement isn't necessarily being offered for impeachment purposes only, nor does it automatically mean that the prejudice outweighs its probative value without considering the context of the trial. Option D is incorrect because the statement does relate to the issue of guilt or innocence, specifically in establishing the perpetrator's intent and knowledge."
