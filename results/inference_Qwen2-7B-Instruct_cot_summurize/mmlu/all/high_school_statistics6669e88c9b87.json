A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to use systematic sampling on an available list of all AAA members in the city.**\n\nWhile systematic sampling can be efficient and cost-effective, it's not ideal for this scenario because the list of AAA members might not be representative of all drivers in the city. AAA membership demographics could differ significantly from the general population of drivers, potentially introducing bias into the study.\n\n**B. A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to randomly choose families and include all drivers in each of these families in the sample.**\n\nThis approach is flawed because it does not account for the fact that family members often drive different vehicles or have different driving patterns. This could lead to a non-representative sample, especially if the city has a diverse population with varying driving behaviors.\n\n**C. To determine the mean number of years between accidents, randomness in choosing a sample of drivers is not important as long as the sample size is very large.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Randomness in sampling is crucial to ensure that the sample is representative of the entire population. Without random selection, the sample may not accurately reflect the characteristics of the broader population, leading to biased results. Even with a large sample size, systematic biases introduced by non-random sampling can still affect the validity of the conclusions drawn.\n\n**D. None of the above are true statements.**\n\nGiven the explanations above, option D is the correct choice, indicating that none of the proposed methods for selecting a sample would provide a representative and unbiased study of the number of years drivers in a large city go between automobile accidents."
