                    "text": "The philosopher Derek Parfit, not Taurek, is well known for his views on the ethics of individual and collective harm, which have implications for how we might think about the value of lives and the aggregation of harms. Parfit's view challenges some common intuitions about the moral weight of individuals and the aggregation of harm. Let's examine these options in light of Parfit's thought:\n\nA. The death of two people is always worse than the death of one.\n\nThis claim is a strong form of what Parfit calls \"the principle of equal consideration,\" which suggests that all individuals' interests should be considered equally, regardless of how many there are. However, this principle is controversial and has been critiqued by many philosophers, including Parfit himself, who developed alternative ways of thinking about the aggregation of harms.\n\nB. The death of two people is sometimes less bad than the death of one.\n\nThis is a more nuanced position, suggesting that the value or severity of harm depends on context. Parfit does argue that the value of a life is not just in the individual but also in the connections and relationships within society. So, the loss of two people could be less bad if their deaths result in less overall suffering or fewer disruptions to society than the death of one person would.\n\nC. The death of two people is always exactly as bad as the death of one.\n\nThis statement seems to reject the idea of any context-dependent differences in the value of lives. It aligns with a strict form of equal consideration but is less defensible given Parfit's arguments about the complexity of human relationships and the interconnectedness of our lives.\n\nD. The notion of the sum of two people\u2019s losses should be rejected.\n\nParfit argues against the idea that the sum of harms can be meaningfully calculated in a way that respects each individual's unique circumstances and relationships. He suggests that instead of adding up the total amount of suffering, we should consider how lives are connected and valued in society. This critique is part of his broader theory of \"reparative justice,\" which focuses on repairing the social fabric rather than simply compensating for individual losses.\n\nIn summary, while Parfit's views do challenge traditional notions of harm and loss, they do not directly attribute the assertions to Taurek. Parfit's work is more complex and involves detailed arguments about the nature of identity, personal connections, and the moral significance of individual lives within a social context."
