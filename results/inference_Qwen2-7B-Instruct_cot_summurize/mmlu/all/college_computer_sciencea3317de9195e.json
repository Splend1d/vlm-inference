Finding a minimum spanning tree (This is a problem where we want to connect all vertices in a graph with the least total edge weight, without forming any cycles. Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm use a greedy approach to solve this problem, always choosing the next cheapest edge that does not form a cycle.\n\nII. Finding a maximum clique This is an NP-hard problem, which means there is no known efficient greedy algorithm that guarantees finding the maximum clique. The problem involves finding the largest complete subgraph within the graph, and the solution space grows exponentially with the size of the graph.\n\nIII. Finding a maximum flow This problem involves determining the greatest amount of flow that can be sent from a source node to a sink node in a directed graph, given the capacity constraints on the edges. The Ford-Fulkerson method, when using the shortest augmenting path rule, can be considered a greedy algorithm for solving this problem.\n\nTherefore, the problems that can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm are:\n\nA.
