                    "text": "The correct answer is B. H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which results from the hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules.\n\nThis is because in the solid state (H2O(s), the hydrogen bonds create a more ordered and compact structure, leading to a higher density compared to the liquid state (H2O(l). As a result, when the system cools down and moves towards the solid phase, it requires less energy per unit mass, making it energetically favorable to transition from a higher density solid to a lower density liquid. This explains why the equilibrium line slopes downward in a phase diagram for water, indicating that at lower temperatures (and thus higher pressures), the solid phase is favored over the liquid phase."
