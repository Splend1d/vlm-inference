The C2H3O2- ion is the conjugate base of the weak acid acetic acid (CH3COOH. \n\nGiven:\n- Concentration of C2H3O2- = 0.0300 mol / 0.050 L = 0.6 M\n- Ka for CH3COOH = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5\n\nWe can use the expression for the acid dissociation constant (Ka:\n\n\\[ Ka = \\frac{[H^+][CH3COO^-]}{[CH3COOH]} \\]\n\nSince C2H3O2- is the conjugate base of CH3COOH, we have:\n\n\\[ [CH3COO^-] = [H^+] + [CH3COOH] \\]\n\nRearranging for [CH3COOH]:\n\n\\[ [CH3COOH] = [CH3COO^-] - [H^+] \\]\n\nPlugging this back into the Ka equation:\n\n\\[ Ka = \\frac{[H^+]^2}{[CH3COO^-] - [H^+]} \\]\n\nSolving for [H^+] using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ [H^+]^2 + (Ka*[H^+]- Ka*[CH3COO^-]= 0 \\]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n\\[ [H^+]^2 + (1.8*10^{-5}*[H^+]- 1.8*10^{-5}*0.8 = 0 \\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation gives two roots, but only the positive root makes sense as concentration cannot be negative:\n\n\\[ [H^+] = \\sqrt{1.8*10^{-5}*0.8 + ( (1.8*10^{-5})^2/4} \\]\n\n\\[ [H^+] \u2248 4.24*10^{-3} \\, M \\]\n\nNow calculate pH:\n\n\\[ pH = -\\log([H^+]) \\]\n\n\\[ pH = -\\log(4.24*10^{-3}) \\]\n\n\\[ pH \u2248 2.37 \\]\n\nNone of the options provided exactly match this calculation. However, it seems there might have been an error in the calculation or the options provided. Based on the typical pH values and the method used, the closest answer choice would likely be something close to the calculated value, which was not listed among A, B, C, or D. Given the options, the correct answer should be around 2.37, but since this isn't one of your choices, you may want to recheck the question or calculations."
