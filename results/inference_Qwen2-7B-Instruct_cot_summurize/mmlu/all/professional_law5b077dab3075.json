The patient's cancer was diagnosed six months later, based on the same X-ray, when the patient sought a second opinion. In the interim, the cancer had spread. Fact and expert discovery have been completed in the action. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, the hospital has submitted a memorandum identifying facts that it claims are not in dispute. It has also cited and attached supporting exhibits, including a report from the hospital's radiologist, who found no signs of cancer on the X-ray. What is the best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact?\n\nA. Submit a report from the patient's expert radiologist contradicting the findings in the report of the hospital's radiologist.\nB. Submit an affidavit from the patient's attorney detailing his conversations with the patient's expert radiologist.\nC. Submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.\nD. Submit the patient's medical records showing the patient's current cancer diagnosis.\n"

Submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.\n\nThis approach directly addresses the factual dispute by providing an opposing expert opinion, which is a crucial component in challenging the hospital's evidence. The affidavit should include detailed analysis and reasoning supporting the expert's conclusion that cancer was present on the X-ray, despite the hospital's radiologist's findings to the contrary. This direct contradiction is likely to create a genuine dispute of material fact, potentially preventing the hospital from obtaining summary judgment."
