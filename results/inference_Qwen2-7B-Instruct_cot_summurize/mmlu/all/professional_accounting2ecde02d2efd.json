Three years.\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), a taxpayer has three years from the date the tax was due or the date it was filed (whichever is later) to file an amended return and claim a refund. If the tax was paid more than three years ago, the taxpayer generally loses the right to claim a refund for that tax period. \n\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule in certain circumstances, such as fraud, errors by the IRS, or underreporting of income. In these cases, the statute of limitations may be extended. It's always advisable to consult with a tax professional or the IRS directly for specific guidance tailored to the individual's situation."
