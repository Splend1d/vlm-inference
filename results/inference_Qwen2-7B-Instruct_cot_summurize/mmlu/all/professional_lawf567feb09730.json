At the time the contract was signed, the owner orally said to the distributor, \"We do have an understanding that our chef must approve the quality of the heirloom tomatoes before I will pay you. \" The distributor acknowledged the owner's request and responded, \"If you say so. \"Thereafter, the distributor delivered the heirloom tomatoes to the owner. After inspecting the tomatoes, the chef refused to give his approval, because he felt that the tomatoes were not of sufficient quality. As a result, the owner refused to accept and pay for the tomatoes. The distributor brought a breach of contract action against the owner because he refused to pay for the tomatoes. How should the court rule on the owner's offer to prove, over the distributor's objection, that the chef refused to approve the tomatoes that were delivered?\n\nA. The evidence is admissible to show frustration of purpose.\nB. The evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent.\n\nIn this scenario, the oral agreement regarding the chef's approval as a condition precedent to payment is relevant to determining whether there was a breach of the contract. The written contract does not explicitly state that payment is contingent upon the chef's approval; thus, the oral condition is crucial to understanding the full scope of the parties' agreement. The court would consider this evidence to assess if the contract was indeed conditional upon the chef's approval of the heirloom tomatoes' quality. \n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they refer to different legal doctrines: frustration of purpose pertains to circumstances where an unforeseen event undermines the fundamental purpose of the contract, while the integration of a contract refers to the idea that a written document represents the entire agreement between the parties, superseding any prior agreements or understandings. Neither of these doctrines directly applies to the situation described, where the condition for payment was an oral agreement not included in the written contract.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds, which typically requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, the question is not about the enforceability of the oral agreement but rather its relevance to the interpretation of the written contract and the conditions under which it was entered into."
