A quitclaim deed does not guarantee that the grantor (in this case, the investor) has clear title or any rights to convey. It simply transfers whatever interest the grantor has at the time of the deed. Since the friend assumed the mortgage, it implies that the investor transferred the mortgage obligation along with the property. However, the farmer's claim is against the friend as the current owner of the property, not the investor. \n\nThe farmer's in personam action against the friend would be based on the assumption of the mortgage by the friend, which means the friend is now responsible for the debt. If the friend fails to pay, the farmer can enforce the mortgage against the friend. The farmer cannot directly enforce the mortgage against the investor since the investor no longer owns the property. \n\nTherefore, the farmer's ability to recover the amount owed on the mortgage would depend on the terms of the mortgage agreement, the friend's ability to pay, and whether the friend has sufficient assets to satisfy the debt. The farmer would not prevail simply because the investor conveyed the property to the friend."
