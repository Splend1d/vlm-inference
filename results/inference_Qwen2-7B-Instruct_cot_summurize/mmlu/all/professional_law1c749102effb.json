They had just consumed a six-pack of beer when the classmate asked the defendant if there was anything else to drink. The defendant indicated there wasn't and suggested that his classmate drive to the store and buy another six-pack. The classmate told the defendant that his car wasn't working and asked the defendant if he could borrow his. The defendant assented and gave his classmate the keys to his car. The defendant knew that the classmate was drunk when he lent him his car. The classmate was driving to the store at an excessive rate of speed. As he approached an intersection, he was traveling at 70 M. PJ-I. When he came to the intersection, the light turned red. The classmate, who made no effort to stop in time, drove through the red light and collided with another car. The driver of the other car, who had entered the intersection with a green light, was killed in the accident. In the event that the defendant can be convicted of manslaughter, it will most likely be upon the basis of\n\nA. responsibility for the accident as an accomplice.\nB. recklessness in lending his car to his classmate.\nC. joint venture in lending his car to his classmate for a common purpose.\nD. vicarious liability for the conduct of his classmate.\n"

By knowingly lending his car to someone who is visibly intoxicated, the defendant acted recklessly. He should have been aware of the high risk that his classmate would drive under the influence and potentially cause harm, especially given the high speed at which they were driving. This reckless behavior could be considered a contributing factor in the fatal accident, making the defendant liable for manslaughter."
