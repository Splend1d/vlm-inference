They may have difficulty reading the screen.\n\nCareful consideration should indeed be given to providing internet-based information sources for people aged over 65 due to several reasons. Among the options provided, the primary concern is that they may have difficulty reading the screen. This could be due to various factors such as age-related vision problems like presbyopia ( (difficulty seeing close objects), or other health conditions that affect visual acuity. Additionally, the text size and contrast on websites might not be optimal for older users, making it harder for them to read content comfortably.\n\nWhile less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet ( (option B), this highlights another significant barrier to accessing online information. However, the issue here is more about accessibility and usability rather than just availability.\n\nThe statement that \"the internet is aimed at younger people\" ( (option C) is incorrect. The internet was designed for use by anyone with access, regardless of age, and while some websites and platforms may have content tailored to specific demographics, it does not mean the internet itself is aimed exclusively at younger individuals.\n\nLastly, while some older adults might struggle with typing ( (option D), this is not necessarily an obstacle to accessing information online. Most internet-based information can be accessed through voice commands, touch screens, or simplified interfaces that require minimal typing. Therefore, the primary concern regarding internet-based information sources for older adults should focus on ensuring that the content is accessible, readable, and navigable, rather than just ensuring they have access to the internet."
