The statute contains express findings that, when combined, the wages received by dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. These findings are supported by information presented to Congress during committee hearings on the legislation. A small dry cleaning store operates exclusively within a community in the center of a geographically large state. It has no customers from outside the state. It employs three workers, each of whom is paid less than the federal minimum wage. Must this dry cleaning store comply with the statute imposing the federal minimum wage requirements on all dry cleaning stores?\n\nA. No, because the store does no business in interstate commerce.\nB. No, because the wages of the store's three workers do not have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the commerce clause vests Congress with plenary legislative authority over labor relations.\nD. Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n"

                    "text": "D. Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nThe rationale behind this answer lies in the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress the power \"To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" When Congress enacts legislation that impacts interstate commerce, it can extend its regulatory powers beyond direct economic activities involving multiple states or crossing state lines.\n\nIn this case, the federal statute extends the minimum wage requirements to all dry cleaning stores, regardless of their size or location. The statute's findings suggest that the wages received by dry cleaning workers contribute significantly to the national economy and affect the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. This implies that the economic activity of setting and paying minimum wages in the dry cleaning industry has indirect effects on interstate commerce.\n\nEven though the specific dry cleaning store in question operates solely within a community in the center of a geographically large state and has no customers from outside the state, the broader economic implications of the minimum wage policy on the national economy and interstate commerce mean that the store must comply with the federal minimum wage requirements. This conclusion aligns with the principle that Congress has broad authority to legislate in areas that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, even if the individual transactions involved are not themselves interstate in nature."
