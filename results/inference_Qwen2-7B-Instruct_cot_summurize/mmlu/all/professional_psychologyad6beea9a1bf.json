All Performance subtests**\n\nThis pattern characterizes a more significant cognitive decline in the performance-based tasks or subtests compared to verbal-based tasks. The Performance scale in the WAIS-R includes subtests like Block Design, Picture Completion, and Object Assembly, which assess spatial skills, visual perception, and construction abilities, respectively. These tasks often highlight declines associated with aging more prominently than verbal-based assessments such as Vocabulary, Similarities, and Comprehension, which might be relatively preserved or less affected by the aging process."
