For each of these choices, there's only 1 way to distribute them because the boxes are indistinguishable. So, this gives us **4 ways**.\n\n3. **2 balls in one box, and 2 balls in the other.** We need to choose which 2 balls go into one box. This can be done in \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) ways. Again, once we've chosen which balls go into one box, the distribution into the two indistinguishable boxes doesn't matter, so this also gives us **6 ways**.\n\nAdding these possibilities together: \\(1 + 4 + 6 = 7\\) ways.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. 7**."
