Because of a new teachers' contract, the school district needs an extra 10% in funds compared to the previous year. To raise this additional money, the city instructs the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000. What will be the new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city?\n\nA. $23,000\nB. $25,300\nC. $28,000\nD. $30,300\n"

It does not change when you add or subtract a constant value from every data point. This is because the standard deviation is based on the differences between each data point and the mean, and adding or subtracting a constant shifts both the data points and the mean by the same amount without changing these differences.\n\nIn this case, the city decides to increase every house's appraised value by $5,000. Since this is a uniform increase that affects all data points equally, it does not affect the spread of the data around the mean. Therefore, the standard deviation remains unchanged.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $23,000"
