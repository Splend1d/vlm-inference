This can lead to an increase in aggregate demand, which in turn can cause the equilibrium price level to rise. This phenomenon is known as inflation.\n\nOption A ( unemployment will rise is incorrect because fiscal policy is designed to reduce unemployment by stimulating economic activity.\n\nOption B, taxes will have to be raised, and Option D, government spending on important programs will have to be cut, are not necessarily drawbacks of using fiscal policy. In fact, governments may choose to use tax cuts or increased spending to stimulate the economy during a recession. However, these actions could potentially lead to higher budget deficits, which might be addressed by raising taxes or cutting other government spending in the future."
