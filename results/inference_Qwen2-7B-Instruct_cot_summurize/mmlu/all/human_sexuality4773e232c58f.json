Testosterone is a hormone primarily produced by the testicles, and it plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of male characteristics, including the growth of the larynx. The larynx is the part of the throat that contains the vocal cords and is responsible for the pitch of a person's voice. During puberty, as boys grow into men, their larynxes expand, which leads to a deeper voice due to changes in the tension of the vocal cords.\n\nCastration in adulthood would not cause a high-pitched voice because the larynx has already reached its adult size. The voice would not change due to the lack of testosterone, but other effects of castration such as reduced sex drive, breast development, and reduced facial hair growth may occur. However, these do not directly relate to changing the pitch of a voice."
