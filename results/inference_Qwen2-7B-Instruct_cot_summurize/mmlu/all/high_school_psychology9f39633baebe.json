Systems approach\n\nThe systems approach focuses on understanding how various components of a system (in this case, the family system - interact and influence each other. It recognizes that the behavior of one member (the aggressive child, for instance, can be influenced by the interactions within the family, and that changes in one part of the system can affect the whole. Therefore, when a clinical psychologist considers the entire family dynamic while studying the behavior of an individual, they are employing a systems approach.\n\nTo clarify why the other options do not fit:\n\nA. Cognitive social approach: This approach emphasizes the role of thoughts and social interactions in shaping behavior. While it considers the social context, it does not necessarily focus on the systemic interactions between all members of a family.\n\nB. Behavioral approach: This approach focuses on observable behaviors and their consequences, aiming to modify behavior through reinforcement or punishment. It may consider the environment and learning processes but does not necessarily consider the complex interactions between multiple family members as a system.\n\nC. Psychoanalytic approach: This approach, developed by Sigmmund Freud, focuses on unconscious motivations and early childhood experiences. While it considers internal psychological dynamics, it typically does not emphasize the systemic interactions between multiple individuals in a family system as much as the systems approach does."
