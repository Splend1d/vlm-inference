Therefore, when you add TFC to the Total Variable Cost ( (TC) at any level of output, you get the Total Cost ( (TC). \n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. TC = AVC + AFC)Q: This equation suggests that Total Cost ( (TC) is equal to the sum of Average Variable Cost (AVC) multiplied by Quantity (Q) plus Average Fixed Cost ( (AFC) multiplied by Quantity (Q. This is not correct since TC is actually calculated as the sum of Total Variable Cost and Total Fixed Cost.\n\nC. AVC + AFC = TC: This statement implies that the sum of Average Variable Cost and Average Fixed Cost equals Total Cost. However, this is incorrect since Total Cost is the sum of Total Variable Cost and Total Fixed Cost, not the sum of their averages.\n\nD. MC = TC - TFC: This statement incorrectly suggests that Marginal Cost ( (MC) can be calculated by subtracting Total Fixed Cost from Total Cost. The correct formula for calculating Marginal Cost is change in Total Cost divided by change in Quantity."
