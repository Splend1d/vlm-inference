Most women work in agriculture: This statement is not necessarily true. While it's true that historically many women worked in agriculture, especially in developing countries, today women participate in various sectors of the economy around the world.\n\nB. The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide: This statement is incorrect. In recent decades, there has been an overall increase in the labor force participation of women globally.\n\nC. The percentage of women in the total labor force declined: This statement is also incorrect for the same reason as B; there has been an upward trend in the participation of women in the labor force.\n\nD. Women spend more hours per day working than men in all region except Anglo America and Australia: This statement is false. Generally, studies indicate that men tend to work longer hours than women across different regions types, including Anglo America and Australia.\n\nA more accurate statement could be that women have made significant gains in labor force participation rates, though they often face disparities in terms of pay, representation in leadership positions, and work-life balance compared to men."
