Both b and c\n\nThe implications of the Cold War for American exceptionalism were multifaceted and complex, reflecting both enhancements and challenges to this concept. \n\nB. Exceptionalism was indeed enhanced by America's status as the 'leader of the free world.' During the Cold War, the United States positioned itself as the ideological leader in the global struggle against communism. This role bolstered the narrative of American exceptionalism, which had long been based on the idea that the U.S. represented a unique form of government and society that could serve as a model for others. The U.S. supported democratic movements around the world and often portrayed itself as the defender of freedom and democracy against totalitarian threats, further reinforcing its exceptional status.\n\nC. The extension of American power globally did challenge some core assumptions of exceptionalism. While American exceptionalism traditionally emphasized self-sufficiency and isolationism, the Cold War necessitated a more interventionist foreign policy. This expansion of American influence abroad led to the creation of alliances such as NATO and the imposition of economic sanctions, among other actions. These moves sometimes contradicted the notion of American exceptionalism as it required the U.S. to work closely with other nations and engage in international cooperation, rather than relying solely on its own strength.\n\nTherefore, both B and C accurately capture the dual nature of how the Cold War impacted American exceptionalism."
