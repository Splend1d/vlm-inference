Here's why:\n\nA. Confirming with those members of management as to whether they are actually option holders: This is important to ensure that the option holders listed in the financial statements are indeed those who have been granted the options.\n\nB. Verifying the existence of option holders in the issuer's payroll and human resources records: This step ensures that the names and details of the option holders match the records kept by the company, which is crucial for the accuracy of the financial statements.\n\nC. Tracing the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval: This is essential to confirm that the granting of stock options was properly authorized by the board, adhering to corporate governance and internal control standards.\n\nD. Reviewing the public records of the SEC to determine whether the options were properly reported: Ensuring compliance with SEC regulations is critical to avoid any legal or financial repercussions for non-compliance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would depend on the specific context and requirements of the audit. However, typically, an auditor would perform all these actions as part of their comprehensive review process."
