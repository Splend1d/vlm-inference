The two blastomeres were then separated. What is the expected fate of the blastomeres?\n\nA. The blastomere with the gray crescent will grow in size more quickly than the one without the gray crescent.\nB. The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\nC. The blastomere without the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\nD. The blastomere with the gray crescent will stop dividing and die before the second cleavage.\n"

The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\n\nThe gray crescent refers to the polar body (a structure containing genetic material that forms during meiosis. This region contains the yolk supply for the developing embryo, so it's crucial for its development. If the blastomere with the gray crescent is separated, it should still be able to develop into a complete embryo, albeit smaller due to the division. The other blastomere would not have this resource and likely would not develop beyond the single cell stage."
