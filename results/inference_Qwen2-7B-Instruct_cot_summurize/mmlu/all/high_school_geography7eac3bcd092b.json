However, none of the options directly define migration in the most accurate sense. Typically, migration involves the movement of individuals or groups from one place to another, often for an extended period, with the intention of establishing a new residence. \n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. They are crossing another country's borders. - This could be true depending on whether the castle is within the same country they currently reside in or if it's across a border into Scotland.\n\nC. They are moving permanently. - This is a characteristic of migration, as it implies that the intention is to settle in the new location for an extended period, possibly indefinitely.\n\nD. They will be gone more than one year. - This suggests a long-term stay, which is often associated with migration, especially if they plan to renovate the castle.\n\nOption B. They are not taking anything with them. - This doesn't necessarily define migration, as people may move with or without belongings.\n\nTherefore, while none of the options perfectly encapsulates what makes their move a migration, option C (\"They are moving permanently\") comes closest to describing a fundamental aspect of migration."
