He might argue something along these lines:\n\nA. Miscarriages of justice are offset by the moral benefits and usefulness of doing justice.\n\nVan den Haag would likely contend that while it is tragic when an innocent person is convicted (\u2014a miscarriage of justice\u2014such errors are necessary sacrifices for the greater good of ensuring that guilty parties are appropriately punished. He would argue that the moral weight of punishing the guilty outweighs the moral costs of occasional wrongful convictions. This perspective emphasizes the importance of a robust criminal justice system that, despite its imperfections, aims to uphold justice and deter crime.\n\nIt's important to note that Van den Haag's views would be controversial and not universally accepted. Critics would argue against this position, pointing out the human toll of wrongful convictions and the need for a more equitable and error-reducing legal system."
