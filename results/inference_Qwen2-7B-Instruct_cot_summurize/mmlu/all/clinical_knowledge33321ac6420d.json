These neurons, known as lower motor neurons, are located within the spinal cord and brainstem. They send signals from the central nervous system to the muscles, allowing for movement. When a lower motor neuron lesion occurs, it typically results in muscle weakness and atrophy, rather than hypertonia ( increased tone. Fasciculations, or twitching, can be present in cases of lower motor neuron lesions due to the underlying muscle activity. Reflexes tend to be diminished or absent, not brisk, because the signal cannot properly travel from the brain to the muscles. An ulnar nerve palsy is indeed an example of a lower motor neuron lesion because the ulnar nerve provides motor innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the hand, which are controlled by lower motor neurons."
