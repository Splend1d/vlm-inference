Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is not increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space. An x-ray of the chest shows left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?\n\nA. Aortic valve insufficiency\nB. Aortic valve stenosis\nC. Mitral valve insufficiency\nD. Mitral valve stenosis\n"

Mitral valve insufficiency.\n\nThe patient's symptoms such as dyspnea and hemoptysis, along with her history of rheumatic fever as a child which can lead to mitral valve disease, the physical examination findings of an irregularly irregular pulse rate, bilateral crackles at the lung bases (indicative of pulmonary congestion, the presence of an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space which is characteristic of mitral regurgitation, and the chest X-ray showing left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement all point towards mitral valve insufficiency or mitral regurgitation. \n\nMitral valve insufficiency occurs when the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to leak back into the left atrium during each heartbeat, which can lead to symptoms like dyspnea and hemoptysis, as well as the physical exam and imaging findings described in this case."
