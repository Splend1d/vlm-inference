Based on the calculations, none of the options A through D exactly match the calculated values for both the mean and standard deviation. However, if one were to strictly choose from the given options based on the calculations, the closest would be **B. \u03bcx+y = 76, \u03c3x+y = 13**, though technically, the correct standard deviation should be closer to 10.91 rather than 13."
