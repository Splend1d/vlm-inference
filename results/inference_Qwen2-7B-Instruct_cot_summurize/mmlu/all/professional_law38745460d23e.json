The valid treaty always prevails.\n\nIn the United States, treaties have the same force and effect as federal laws under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which grants the President the power to negotiate treaties with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate. This means that treaties take precedence over conflicting federal statutes (including congressional acts) unless they are explicitly unconstitutional or violate the U.S. Constitution. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that this hierarchy can be affected by the nature of the treaty and the specific circumstances of the conflict. For example, if a treaty conflicts with an existing law on matters related to foreign affairs, the treaty might prevail. But if the conflict is more about domestic policy, the congressional act might take precedence.\n\nIn practice, the courts would be involved in determining the constitutionality of any law that contradicts a treaty, and it would ultimately be up to the judiciary to decide whether the treaty prevails based on constitutional principles."
