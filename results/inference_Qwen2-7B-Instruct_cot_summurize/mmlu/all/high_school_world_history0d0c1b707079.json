If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nHow would twentieth-century economist John Maynard Keynes suggest that society address Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany?\n\nA.

Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.\n\nKeynes believed in the role of government in managing the economy, advocating for measures such as fiscal policy ( to stimulate demand when necessary. This could include social insurance programs aimed at addressing the insecurities Bismarck mentioned, such as unemployment, health care, and pensions for the elderly, to provide a safety net for workers. His philosophy was centered around preventing economic fluctuations that could lead to recessions or depressions, which he saw as a failure of market mechanisms without intervention."
