The response variable was the difference in the number of pimples (old formula - new formula). Which is the correct significance test to perform?\n\nA. A two-proportion z-test\nB.

The matched pairs t-test is designed to compare the means of the differences between these paired observations, which is suitable for assessing whether the new cream is more effective than the old one in reducing acne."
