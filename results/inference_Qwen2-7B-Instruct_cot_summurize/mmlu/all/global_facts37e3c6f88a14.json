However, based on historical trends and public opinion polls from the time, it is widely known that public sentiment in the United States regarding the Vietnam War was significantly against the war effort by 1965. Polls conducted during that period showed that a substantial majority of Americans believed that the war was a mistake.\n\nAccording to a poll by the Gallup organization published in April 1965, about 72% of Americans felt that the U.S. involvement in Vietnam was a mistake. This figure is notably higher than the options provided ( A. 25%, B. 45%, C. 65%, D. 85%. Therefore, if we had to choose among the given options, option C. 65% would be the closest to the actual percentage based on historical records, though it's important to note that the exact number can vary depending on which specific poll is referenced. For precise historical data, consulting a reliable source or database that tracks historical public opinion polls would be necessary."
