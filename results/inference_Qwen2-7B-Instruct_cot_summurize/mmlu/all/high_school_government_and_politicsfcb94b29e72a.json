However, based on general trends:\n\nD. Voters aged 18-29 might have the lowest turnout rate among these options. Historically, younger voters tend to have lower turnout rates compared to older age groups, though this trend has been changing in recent years due to increased engagement efforts and changing demographics. Factors such as first-time voting, lack of familiarity with the political process, or feeling that their vote doesn't matter can contribute to lower turnout.\n\nIt's important to note that these are broad generalizations and actual turnout can vary widely from election to election and country to country. Engagement, motivation, and access to information play significant roles in determining voter turnout."
