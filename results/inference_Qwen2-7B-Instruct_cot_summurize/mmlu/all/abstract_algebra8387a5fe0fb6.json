In an abelian group, the operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) in the group, \\(g \\cdot h = h \\cdot g\\). The statement \\( (g \\circ h)^2 = g^2 \\circ h^2 \\) follows directly from this property. \n\nExpanding the left side: \n\\[ (g \\circ h)^2 = ( (g \\circ h) \\circ ( (g \\circ h) \\]\n\\[ = (g \\circ h) \\circ (h \\circ g) \\] (because \\(g \\circ h = h \\circ g\\) in an abelian group)\n\\[ = (g \\circ (h \\circ h) \\circ g \\] (by associativity of the group operation)\n\\[ = g \\circ (h^2) \\circ g \\]\n\\[ = (g \\circ g) \\circ (h^2) \\] (by associativity again)\n\\[ = g^2 \\circ h^2 \\]\n\nSo, \\( (g \\circ h)^2 = g^2 \\circ h^2 \\) is true for every \\(g, h\\) in G.\n\nAs for the other options:\nA. \\( g = g^{-1} \\) for every \\(g\\) in G would mean that every element is its own inverse, which isn't necessarily true for all abelian groups.\nB. \\( g = g^2 \\) for every \\(g\\) in G implies that every element is its own square, which doesn't follow from the abelian property.\nD. G being of finite order means the group has a finite number of elements, which isn't implied by the group being abelian."
