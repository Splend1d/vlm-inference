A monoclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of a single B lymphocyte; a polyclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of different B lymphocytes.\n\nMonoclonal antisera are produced by fusing a single B cell that has specificity for a particular antigen with a myeloma cell, resulting in a hybridoma. This hybridoma then secretes monoclonal antibodies that all react against the same epitope on the antigen. \n\nPolyclonal antisera, on the other hand, are produced by immunizing an animal with an antigen, which leads to the activation and proliferation of multiple B cells that have different specificities. These B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies that recognize different epitopes on the antigen. Therefore, a polyclonal antiserum contains a mixture of antibodies from many different B cells."
