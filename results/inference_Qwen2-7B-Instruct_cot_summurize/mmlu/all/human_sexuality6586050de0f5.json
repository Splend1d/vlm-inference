Here's the breakdown:\n\nA. Underarm hair - This is indeed a secondary sex characteristic, but it is not exclusive to males or females. It typically appears during puberty and is related to the development of the reproductive system, which is shared between males and females.\n\nB. Sweat and oil glands - These are not secondary sex characteristics; rather, they are part of the basic anatomy of humans and are present from birth. They produce sweat and sebum (oil, respectively, and are not influenced by sex hormones in terms of development.\n\nC. Deepening of the voice - This is a secondary sex characteristic specific to males due to the influence of testosterone, which causes the vocal cords to thicken and lengthen, resulting in a deeper pitch. Females do not experience this change as part of their secondary sexual development.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. underarm hair**, as it is a secondary sex characteristic that is present in both males and females."
