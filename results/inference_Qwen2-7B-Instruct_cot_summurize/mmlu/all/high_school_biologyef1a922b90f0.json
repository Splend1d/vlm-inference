Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier.\n\nExplanation:\n- Aristotle: He proposed the concept of \"final causes\" which led to the belief in the fixed nature of species.\n- Linnaeus: Known for his system of binomial nomenclature, he believed in the static nature of species and did not accept the idea of evolution.\n- Cuvier: A proponent of catastrophism, he argued that species remained unchanged over time, supporting the idea of fixed species.\n\nLamarck, on the other hand, proposed the theory of evolution through acquired characteristics, which contradicts the notion of fixed species."
