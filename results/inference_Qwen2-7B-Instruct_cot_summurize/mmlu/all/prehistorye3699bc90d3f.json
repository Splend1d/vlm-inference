This technique compares the elemental signature of an artifact with known signatures from various geological sources. By doing so, it can help determine where the raw materials for that artifact were sourced from, which can provide insights into trade routes, cultural exchanges, and technological capabilities of past societies.\n\nWhile other methods such as petrography, microscopy, and surface analysis might provide information about morphology, wear patterns, and associations, trace element analysis specifically aids in identifying the geographic source of materials."
