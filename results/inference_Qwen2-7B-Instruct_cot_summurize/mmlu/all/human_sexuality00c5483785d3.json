The main options include:\n\nC. Hormones: This is often the first line of treatment for many women with endometriosis. Hormonal contraceptives like birth control pills, patches, or injections can help reduce the symptoms by decreasing estrogen levels, which in turn reduces the growth of endometrial tissue. Progesterone-only medications can also be used.\n\nAdditionally, other hormone therapies might be considered, such as GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) analogues, which temporarily shut down the ovaries's production of estrogen and progesterone, leading to a reduction in endometriosis symptoms. However, these treatments can cause menopausal-like symptoms and are typically used for short-term relief or when combined with other therapies.\n\nIt's important to note that while these treatments can provide symptom relief, they do not cure endometriosis. Lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and stress management, can also complement medical treatments and help manage symptoms."
