The registrar contended that Article I, Section 2 of the U. S. Constitution specifically required a candidate for the House of Representatives \"be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. \" As a consequence, the candidate filed suit in state court against the registrar of elections seeking to have her name placed on the ballot. The state court ruled in her favor and determined that the candidate did, in fact, qualify as a resident of the state. The registrar appealed the decision to the state supreme court which, in turn, affirmed the lower court ruling. Thereafter, the candidate's name was placed on the ballot. After a hotly contested election, the candidate narrowly defeated the incumbent. However, at the time that the candidate was to be seated as a House member, the House of Representatives held hearings on her qualifications and eligibility. By a two-thirds vote, the House determined that the candidate was not a resident of the state at the time of her election and refused to seat her. The candidate then brought suit in federal district court against the Speaker and other officers of the House, seeking back pay and an order that she be seated in the House of Representatives. The defendants demurred, claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer?\n\nA. There is no case or controversy between the candidate and the officers of the House of Representatives.\nB. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nC. The suit should have been brought as an original action in the U. S. Supreme Court.\nD. Under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts are not empowered to render advisory opinions.\n"

                    "text": "B. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\n\nThis argument is the strongest constitutional basis for the defendants' demurrer because it aligns with the principle established by the Supreme Court in cases like Baker v. Carr ( (1962) and Marbury v. Madison (1803). These cases set forth that certain questions are are nonjusticiable political questions, meaning they involve matters that are within the exclusive domain of the political branches of government and are thus not properly decided by the judiciary. In this scenario, the question of whether the candidate is a resident of the state and therefore eligible to sit in the House of Representatives is a political question related to the operation of the legislative branch, specifically the House's authority over its own membership under Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution, which states that each house has \"the sole power of expulsion.\" \n\nTherefore, the federal courts do not have the proper role to decide such questions, as they would be interfering in the internal workings of the legislative branch. The judiciary's role is limited to cases involving actual, concrete disputes between parties with a stake in the outcome, rather than abstract questions about the powers of the political branches."
