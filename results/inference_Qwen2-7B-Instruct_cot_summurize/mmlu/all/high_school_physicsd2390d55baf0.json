We can rewrite the Ideal Gas Law as:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{nRT}{V} \\]\n\nNow, let's apply the given changes to this equation:\n\n- New temperature \\(T' = 2T\\)\n- New volume \\(V' = 8V\\)\n\nSubstituting these into our pressure formula gives:\n\n\\[ P' = \\frac{nR(2T)}{8V} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\n\\[ P' = \\frac{2nRT}{8V} \\]\n\\[ P' = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{nRT}{V} \\]\n\nThis shows that the new pressure \\(P'\\) is one-fourth of the original pressure \\(P\\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. P decreases by a factor of 4."
