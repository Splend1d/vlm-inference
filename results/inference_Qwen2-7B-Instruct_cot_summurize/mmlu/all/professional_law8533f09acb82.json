Under this executive order, federal agents are empowered to prosecute all interstate shippers and sellers of the drug. The President claims that he is acting upon conclusive evidence that the drug causes cervical cancer in laboratory monkeys.

The President cannot unilaterally enact laws or regulations without the backing of Congress. While the President can enforce existing laws and regulations, they cannot create new laws or regulations without legislative approval.\n\nIn this scenario, the President's executive order seems to be attempting to legislate on health matters, which typically falls under the purview of Congress. The claim of causing cervical cancer in laboratory monkeys also suggests that the action is based on scientific evidence, which should ideally be addressed through the regulatory processes set up by Congress, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA for pharmaceuticals.\n\nThus, the executive order appears to be an overreach of executive power, attempting to legislate and regulate directly without the proper legislative framework, making option C the most accurate assessment."
