                    "text": "To determine who is more unusually tall within their respective sexes, we need to calculate how many standard deviations each person's height is from the mean height of their respective group.\n\nFor the man:\n- Mean height = 70 inches\n- Standard deviation = 4 inches\n- Height = 74 inches\n\nWe calculate the number of standard deviations (Z-score) as follows:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{\\text{Height} - \\text{Mean}}{\\text{Standard Deviation}} = \\frac{74 - 70}{4} = 1 \\]\n\nThis means the man's height is 1 standard deviation above the mean height for men.\n\nFor the woman:\n- Mean height = 66 inches\n- Standard deviation = 3 inches\n- Height = 70 inches\n\nAgain, calculating the number of standard deviations (Z-score:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{\\text{Height} - \\text{Mean}}{\\text{Standard Deviation}} = \\frac{70 - 66}{3} = 1.33 \\]\n\nThis means the woman's height is approximately 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height for women.\n\nComparing the two:\n- The man's height is 1 standard deviation above the mean for men.\n- The woman's height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean for women.\n\nTherefore, the woman is more unusually tall within her respective sex compared to the man.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. The woman, because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women, whereas the man\u2019s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men**."
