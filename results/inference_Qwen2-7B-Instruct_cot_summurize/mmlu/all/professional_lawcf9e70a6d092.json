The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, as an administrative entity, to which the residential community lot owners would pay dues, and which would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the restrictions set forth in the Declaration of Covenants provides that the lots be used only for single-family residences, and that no trade, commerce, or business may be conducted in any single-family residence. The Declaration of Covenants gives the community association the right to assign all of its rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to it under the Declaration of Covenants. The community association assigned \"all the rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to or conferred upon it by the Declaration of Covenants\" to a municipal corporation, the city. The community association was then terminated. A chef, the owner of lot 18 in the residential development, proposes to convert his single-family dwelling into a massage parlor. The city asserts an action against the chef to recover money damages. Which of the following is the best argument for the chef?\n\nA. The restraint on alienation of his land is invalid.\nB. The city is not in privity of estate with community association.\nC. The benefit is in gross; hence, the burden cannot run.\nD. The burden is in gross; hence, the benefit cannot run.\n"

                    "text": "The best argument for the chef in this scenario is likely option B: \"The city is not in privity of estate with the community association.\"\n\nPrivity of estate refers to the legal relationship between parties who have a direct interest in a property or estate. In this case, the city is attempting to enforce the restriction against the chef, who owns a lot within the residential development. However, the city is not a party to the original agreement (the Declaration of Covenants) between the housing corporation and the community association.\n\nWhen the community association assigned its rights to the city, it did so without creating a direct contractual relationship with the city. Instead, the assignment created a relationship between the community association and the city. This means that if there was a breach of contract involving the community association's rights, the city could potentially sue the community association, but not directly enforce the restrictions against individual lot owners like the chef.\n\nTherefore, since the city is not in privity of estate with the community association, it does not have a direct legal basis to enforce the restrictions against the chef without first obtaining a legal remedy from the community association."
