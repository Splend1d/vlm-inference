The formula for calculating ionic strength (I is:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i^2 C_i \\]\n\nwhere \\(z_i\\) is the valence of the ion and \\(C_i\\) is its concentration.\n\nLet's calculate the ionic strength for each option:\n\nA. For 0.050 M AlCl3:\n- Aluminum (Al has a charge of +3.\n- Chlorine (Cl) also has a charge of -1. Since there are three Cl atoms per Al atom, we have 3 * (-1)^2 = 3.\n- The total ionic strength contribution from one mole of AlCl3 is \\(3 * 0.050 = 0.15\\).\n\nB. For 0.100 M NaCl:\n- Sodium (Na) has a charge of +1.\n- Chlorine (Cl) has a charge of -1. Together, they contribute \\(1^2 + (-1)^2 = 2\\).\n- The total ionic strength contribution from one mole of NaCl is \\(2 * 0.100 = 0.20\\).\n\nC. For 0.050 M CaCl2:\n- Calcium (Ca) has a charge of +2.\n- Chlorine (Cl) has a charge of -1. Together, they contribute \\(2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5\\).\n- The total ionic strength contribution from one mole of CaCl2 is \\(5 * 0.050 = 0.25\\).\n\nD. For 0.100 M HCl:\n- Hydrogen (H) has a charge of +1.\n- Chlorine (Cl) has a charge of -1. Together, they contribute \\(1^2 + (-1)^2 = 2\\).\n- However, since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates into H+ and Cl-, contributing twice the concentration to the ionic strength. So, the total ionic strength contribution from one mole of HCl is \\(2 * 0.100 = 0.20\\).\n\nComparing these contributions, option C (0.050 M CaCl2, has the highest ionic strength due to the combination of calcium and chloride ions contributing significantly to the ionic strength calculation."
