Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: \n\nShining one's parent's wedding ring is not inherently morally wrong and can be seen as a loving act or a way to care for family members. However, tripping the police officer who is trying to catch a thief would likely be considered morally wrong as it impedes the officer's duty to uphold the law and protect the public. Therefore, the answer is C."
