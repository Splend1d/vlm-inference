However, there is no one else in the community who is more experienced than you are.

Since you acknowledge that you have limited experience working with adolescents and providing crisis intervention services, it would be unethical to offer services without the proper training and qualifications. By informing Mrs. Wang of this, you maintain transparency and allow her to make an informed decision about the best course of action for her daughter's treatment.\n\nOption A ( agreeing to see the girl without disclosing your limitations could potentially harm the client by providing inadequate support. Option C, refusing to help outright, may leave the family in a difficult position without any guidance or resources. Option D suggests a temporary solution that does not address the ongoing need for professional intervention.\n\nTherefore, option B allows you to ethically fulfill your duty to inform while respecting the autonomy of the client and their family in making a decision based on full disclosure of your capabilities."
