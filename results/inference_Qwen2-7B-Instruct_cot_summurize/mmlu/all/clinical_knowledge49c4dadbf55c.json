These proteins act as catalysts for biochemical reactions, transport molecules, and provide structural support, among other functions critical to metabolism. The genetic material ( DNA or RNA, dictates which proteins are produced through the process of transcription and translation. \n\nA. The size of proteins in the cell does not determine metabolism directly; it is the function and activity of these proteins that play this role.\nB. While the availability of amino acids can influence protein synthesis, it is the genetic information that ultimately determines what proteins are synthesized and thus influences metabolism.\nD. The amino acid composition of ribonucleic acids ( RNAs can vary depending on the type of RNA (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA), but it is the genetic code contained within DNA that determines the specific sequence of amino acids in proteins, thereby influencing metabolism."
