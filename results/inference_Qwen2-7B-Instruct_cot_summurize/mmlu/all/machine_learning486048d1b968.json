This typically leads to a model that is simpler and less prone to overfitting the training data. As a result:\n\n- A. Regularization can decrease the training error by simplifying the model, but it won't necessarily never decrease it. It depends on the specific dataset and model complexity.\n- B. Correctly stated, regularization should not increase the training error because it aims to balance fitting the training data well while avoiding overfitting.\n- C. The statement \"will never decrease the testing error\" is not necessarily true. While regularization helps prevent overfitting, there's always a risk of underfitting if the regularization is too high. Thus, increasing \u03bb could potentially increase the testing error if it's set too high.\n- D. Similar to C, regularization might not increase the testing error in all cases, as its main goal is to optimize the generalization performance.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is B: Increasing the value of the regularization parameter \u03bb will never increase the training error."
