The owner told the woman that he was sorry but it was his policy not to cash Social Security checks. Terribly upset, the woman reached into her pocketbook and said, \"Listen, buddy, I've got a bomb in here, and if you don't give me the money, I'm going to blow up this joint. \" Actually, the woman did not have a bomb in her possession. The owner, who was not deceived by her threat, felt sorry for the woman and agreed to cash the check. The woman, who walked with the assistance of a cane, took the money and limped out of the store. After she left, the owner noticed that the woman had not endorsed the check. The woman has committed which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Robbery.\nC. Attempted robbery.\nD. False pretenses.\n"

Attempted robbery.\n\nIn this scenario, the elderly woman attempted to extort money from the convenience store owner by threatening to use a bomb. However, since there was no actual bomb present, the threat was not carried out. This constitutes an attempted crime, specifically attempted robbery, because the intent was to use force or fear to take property from the owner, and the act was immediate and direct, even though the means (the bomb) turned out to be fictitious. \n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the woman did not actually commit robbery since the threat did not result in the taking of property through force or fear at the time. Option D, false pretenses, does not apply because the woman's claim about having a bomb was not a false statement made with the intention to deceive someone into giving up property voluntarily."
