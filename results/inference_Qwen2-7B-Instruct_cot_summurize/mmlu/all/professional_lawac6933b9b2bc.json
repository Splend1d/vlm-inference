A senior partner in the law firm contacted a professor at the law school seeking information about the graduate's qualifications. The professor replied, \"Don't be misled by that \u0080\u0098A' I gave the graduate in entertainment law. I later found out that he had obtained the grade by cheating. \"The graduate soon received a letter from the law firm notifying him that he was not suitable to become a member in the prestigious tradition of the firm. After the graduate received the rejection letter, he phoned the senior partner to inquire why he was not suitable for employment. The senior partner told him what the professor had said and then stated, \"We do not hire cheaters who are dumb enough to get caught. \"The graduate brings suit against the professor for defamation for falsely charging the graduate with being a cheater.

In this context, the professor's statement is not under oath, and it is not clear and convincing evidence that the graduate cheated; it is based on the professor's own knowledge of the student's actions. Introducing such evidence could potentially open up the professor to counterarguments regarding the reliability and accuracy of his recollection and judgment.\n\nB. another professor told him that the graduate had cheated on an admiralty law final examination.\n\nThis evidence may be admissible depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction. Generally, hearsay evidence ( where one person relays information they heard from another source) is not admissible unless it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule. If the other professor's statement meets an exception (such as if the other professor is available to testify or if it falls under an exception like the present sense impression), it could be admitted. However, without knowing the specific rules and exceptions in the relevant jurisdiction, it's difficult to give a definitive answer.\n\nC. the findings of the law school indicated that the graduate had submitted a plagiarized paper in a moot court brief.\n\nThis type of evidence might be admissible if it can be shown that the law school conducted an investigation and reached a conclusion that the graduate plagiarized. This would likely fall under a category of evidence known as prior bad acts, which can be used to show intent or character when it is relevant to the case. Again, the admissibility would depend on the specific rules and exceptions in the jurisdiction governing the case.\n\nD. the reputation among the graduate's fellow classmates was that he frequently cheated on law school examinations.\n\nThis type of evidence might also be admissible, especially if it can be shown that the reputation was widely known and held by multiple people. Reputation evidence can sometimes be admissible under certain exceptions, particularly when it relates to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. However, the admissibility of such evidence would depend on the laws and rules of evidence applicable in the jurisdiction where the case is being heard.\n\nIn summary, the professor should not be permitted to introduce evidence that shows the graduate cheated on an examination in the entertainment law class, but other forms of evidence related to cheating may be more likely to be admitted under certain conditions."
