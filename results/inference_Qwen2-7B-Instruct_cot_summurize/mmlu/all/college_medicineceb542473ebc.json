For an incompressible fluid like water, this means that the product of the cross-sectional area (A and the velocity \\(v\\) must be constant. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ A_1 \\cdot v_1 = A_2 \\cdot v_2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A_1 \\) is the initial cross-sectional area,\n- \\( v_1 \\) is the initial velocity,\n- \\( A_2 \\) is the final cross-sectional area, and\n- \\( v_2 \\) is the final velocity.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A_2 = \\frac{1}{3} A_1 \\),\n- \\( v_1 = 2 \\, \\text{m/s} \\).\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n\n\\[ A_1 \\cdot 2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} A_1\\right) \\cdot v_2 \\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation to find \\(v_2\\):\n\n\\[ 2 = \\frac{1}{3} v_2 \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ 6 = v_2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final velocity of water as it exits the nozzle is 6 m/s.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 6 m/s."
