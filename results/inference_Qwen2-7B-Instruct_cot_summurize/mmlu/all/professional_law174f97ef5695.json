However, such a statement cannot be considered as substantive evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. Therefore, the trial judge should instruct the jury accordingly, allowing the defense to use the prior statement to challenge the bystander's testimony but not as a basis for establishing the fact that the defendant drove through the red light."
