All of the above.\n\nAccording to the understanding provided by West, all three reasons can potentially cause harm to a woman engaging in sex with her male partner:\n\nA. Economic dependence: When a woman feels she needs her partner's financial support, she might feel pressured to have sex with him to maintain his favor or avoid negative consequences like eviction, lack of food, or other hardships. This situation can lead to coercive sexual activity.\n\nB. Emotional blackmail: If refusing sex leads to her partner being in a \"foul mood,\" it can create an environment of emotional manipulation where she feels compelled to comply with his demands to avoid his anger or distress. This can be harmful as it involves emotional coercion.\n\nC. Physical violence: The fear of a violent outburst is a clear form of physical coercion. If a woman believes that refusing sex could provoke violence, she might feel trapped in a cycle of abuse and unable to safely express her own desires or boundaries.\n\nIn each of these scenarios, the woman's autonomy and right to make decisions about her own body and actions are compromised, potentially leading to significant psychological, emotional, or physical harm."
