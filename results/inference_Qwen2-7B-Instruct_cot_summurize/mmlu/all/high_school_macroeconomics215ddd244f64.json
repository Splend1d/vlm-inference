Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.\n\nIn the short run, the economy has some resources that are fixed in the short term (like capital, buildings, and machinery. Nominal wages tend to be sticky and don't adjust as quickly to changes in the price level. This means that when prices rise, firms can produce more output without increasing their labor costs much because they have already hired workers at a certain wage rate. As a result, the short-run aggregate supply curve slopes upward.\n\nIn contrast, the long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical, indicating that in the long run, the economy's potential output doesn't change with the price level. Firms can adjust all their inputs, including labor, so that any increase in the price level leads to a proportional increase in the quantity of goods and services produced, without any change in the overall potential output."
