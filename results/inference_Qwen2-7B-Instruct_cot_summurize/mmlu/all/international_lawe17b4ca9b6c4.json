This includes, but is not limited to, heads of states, heads of governments, ministers of foreign affairs, and heads of diplomatic missions. These individuals are presumed to have the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties on behalf of their respective states due to their official capacities. The United Nations Convention on the Law of Treaties further elaborates on this principle, recognizing that any person authorized by the state has the power to enter into international agreements."
