I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\u2026Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\"\nAlbert J. Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" 1898\nWhich of the following rationales does Beveridge employ in his argument?\n\nA. The closing of the western frontier impels the United States to expand its territory overseas.\nB. Governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations.\nC. Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations.\nD. Racial superiority confers responsibility to the United States and Europe over the affairs of developing nations.\n"

Beveridge argues that the United States has a moral duty to govern territories such as the Philippines because it is a powerful nation and thus holds a form of racial superiority. He believes that the U.S. has a responsibility to take control of these territories, rescue them from what he perceives as \"savage\" rule, and provide them with a \"just, human, civilizing government.\" This rationale implies that the U.S.'s responsibility to govern other nations is based on its perceived racial superiority and the belief that it can offer a better form of governance than existing or potential foreign powers, such as Germany, England, or Japan."
