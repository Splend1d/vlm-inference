This means that therapists increasingly integrate various therapeutic approaches and techniques tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of their clients rather than adhering strictly to one theoretical orientation. This approach allows for greater flexibility and personalization in treatment, which can enhance its effectiveness. The other options do not accurately reflect the trends during this period:\n\nA. More behaviorism: While behaviorism was influential in the past, it did not become more dominant overall, especially as the field moved towards more integrative practices.\n\nB. Dominance of the analytic models: Although analytical psychology ( associated with Carl Jung, maintained its place in the field, it did not dominate the landscape as much as the trend towards eclecticism suggests.\n\nC. Increasing evidence that the theoretical position of the therapist determines effectiveness: While research has shown that the therapeutic alliance is crucial, the emphasis on integrating different methods rather than relying solely on a single theoretical framework alignss with the trend towards eclecticism."
