Population outstripping the productive capacity of the environment: As the Ancestral Puebloans grew in numbers, they placed greater demand on local resources, such as water and arable land. This could have led to overuse and depletion of these resources, making it increasingly difficult to sustain the population.\n\nB. Drought: There is evidence that the region experienced prolonged periods of drought during the 12th century. Drought can severely impact agricultural productivity, which would have been crucial for supporting the community's needs. The lack of reliable water sources would have made farming more challenging, possibly leading to food shortages and famine.\n\nC. A new religion attracting them to the south: While there is some speculation about religious or spiritual motivations for migration, this is not well-supported by historical evidence. The movement of people between regions during prehistoric times can be influenced by a variety of factors, including resource availability, climate change, and cultural shifts. However, without specific evidence linking a major religious movement to the Ancestral Puebloan exodus from Mesa Verde, attributing their departure solely to a new religion is speculative.\n\nIn summary, the abandonment of Mesa Verde was likely the result of a complex interplay of environmental, economic, and possibly social factors, with options A, B, and C each contributing to the overall situation."
