Debates over social justice\n\nPhillis Wheatley's poem reflects the themes of social justice and equality, challenging the prevailing notions of racial inferiority and advocating for the possibility of redemption and refinement among people of African descent. The sentiments expressed in her work resonate with ongoing debates over social justice in U.S. history, particularly those concerning civil rights, equality, and the treatment of minority groups."
