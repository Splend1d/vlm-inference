True, False\n\nExplanation:\n\nStatement 1: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Spectral Clustering indeed both use eigendecomposition, but they operate on different matrices. PCA uses the covariance matrix or the correlation matrix of the data, while Spectral Clustering uses the similarity matrix (often derived from a graph Laplacian matrix. The size of these matrices can indeed be the same if they are constructed from the same set of data points. So, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: Logistic regression is not a special case of linear regression. While both involve regression analysis, their objectives differ fundamentally. Linear regression aims to predict a continuous outcome based on one or more predictors, whereas logistic regression is used for predicting binary outcomes ( or more generally categorical outcomes where the response variable is dichotomous. Logistic regression models the probability of the default class ( in the case of binary classification problems. Therefore, this statement is false."
