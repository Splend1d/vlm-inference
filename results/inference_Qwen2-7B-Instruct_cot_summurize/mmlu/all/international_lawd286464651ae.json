France,\" refers to the idea that in international law, restrictions upon the independence of states cannot be presumed. This means that unless there is a specific prohibition or regulation by an international agreement or treaty, states have the freedom to act as they see fit within their own jurisdictions. The principle essentially translates to \"whatever is not prohibited is permitted\" within the context of international law."
