Monozygotic twins\n\nMonozygotic (or identical) twins, when identified on a prenatal ultrasound, is not typically a finding that raises suspicion for a chromosome abnormality. This is because monozygotic twins form from a single fertilized egg that splits early in development, leading to two genetically identical individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, Duodenal atresia (A), Holoprosencephaly  B), and Hydrops fetalis  C) are all associated with various genetic abnormalities or syndromes, which might suggest a chromosome abnormality."
