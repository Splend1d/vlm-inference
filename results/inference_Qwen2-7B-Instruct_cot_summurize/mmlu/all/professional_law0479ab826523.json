The patent holder believed that a jury would be more sympathetic to his claims than a judge, and asked his lawyer to obtain a jury trial. What should the lawyer do to secure the patent holder's right to a jury trial?\n\nA. File and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand.\nB. File and serve a jury trial demand at the close of discovery.\nC. File and serve a jury trial demand within 30 days after the close of the pleadings.\nD. Make a jury trial demand at the initial pretrial conference.\n"

File and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38(a), a party must include a demand for a jury trial in its complaint or other pleading when it is filed. If a party fails to make a timely demand in the complaint, it may still demand a jury trial by filing a notice of jury trial demand no later than 14 days after serving the last pleading that the party intends to use as a basis for relief. However, in this scenario, since the patent holder wants to ensure a jury trial from the beginning, the best course of action would be to include the jury trial demand in the complaint when it is initially filed."
