A congenital disorder impairing the secretion of leptin typically leads to obesity because the lack of leptin results in an inability to properly signal satiety ( or fullness to the brain. This can lead to excessive food intake even when not hungry. \n\nThe other options either do not match the typical symptoms of leptin deficiency ( (normal body weight, underweight, or hypothyroidism), or have inconsistencies in the symptoms presented ( (for example, hyperthyroidism usually leads to weight loss rather than gain). \n\nHypoinsulinaemia refers to low levels of insulin in the blood, which could potentially contribute to obesity if combined with insulin resistance (a condition where cells don't respond normally to insulin).\n\nPlease note: The actual symptoms may vary depending on the specific genetic mutation involved and individual factors.
