In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.\nB. Theories of Westphalian sovereignty decree that principles of non-intervention are paramount to achieving security; this has been extended into the contemporary global security environment in which international bodies such as the UN condemn humanitarian intervention, regarding it as detrimental to state-centric security.\nC. State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.\nD. The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.\n"

State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.\n\nThis perspective acknowledges that while the original concept of Westphalian sovereignty advocates for non-interference in internal affairs, it also allows for exceptions in cases where the state's actions violate fundamental human rights or lead to mass atrocities. This is often referred to as the Responsibility to Protect ( (R2P) doctrine, which emerged as an extension of traditional notions of sovereignty. According to R2P, states have a responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and the international community has a corresponding responsibility to assist states in fulfilling this duty or to take appropriate action if the state fails to do so.\n\nOptions A, B, and D either misrepresent the principles of Westphalian sovereignty or present overly simplistic views of how sovereignty interacts with humanitarian concerns and international law. While the United Nations Charter does indeed advocate for the peaceful resolution of disputes and the prohibition on the use of force except in self-defense or with UN authorization, these norms are not absolute and can be subject to interpretation and exception in cases involving severe human rights violations."
