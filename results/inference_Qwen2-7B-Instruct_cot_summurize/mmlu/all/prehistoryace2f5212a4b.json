If these isotopic data indicate a shift towards drier conditions over time, it could suggest that the civilization in the Indus Valley collapsed due to climate change and drought. This would align with option B: \"It eventually collapsed due to climate change and drought.\" \n\nSuch shifts in isotopic ratios often reflect changes in the water sources used by organisms, which in turn can be influenced by climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation patterns. In the context of the Indus Valley Civilization, a prolonged period of aridification could have led to reduced agricultural productivity, water scarcity, and societal strain, potentially contributing to the collapse of the civilization.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the exact causes of the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization are not fully understood and involve a complex interplay of environmental, economic, and social factors. The role of climate change, including shifts in monsoon patterns and potential droughts, is one aspect among many considered in historical research."
