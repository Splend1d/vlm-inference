This increased demand for bonds could drive up interest rates, as investors require higher returns to lend money to the government. Higher interest rates might make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, which could slow economic growth and potentially lead to a recession (option A is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, if the government is seen to be reducing its debt, foreign investors might perceive the country as less risky, leading to an influx of foreign investment and potentially causing the nation's currency to appreciate (not depreciate). However, if the government's actions are interpreted as a sign of economic weakness or reduced future spending capabilities, this could lead to a depreciation of the currency instead.\n\nThe risk of inflation (option C) is not directly related to paying down debt with a budget surplus; rather, it is more closely tied to increased aggregate demand outpacing supply. Decreasing interest rates (option D) is also not typically a direct result of paying down debt with a budget surplus, unless it's done in response to a perceived threat to economic stability, which is not suggested by the scenario described."
