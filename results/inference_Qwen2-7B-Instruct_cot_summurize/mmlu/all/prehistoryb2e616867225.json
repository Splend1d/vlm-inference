This means the correct answer is:\n\nC. after 11,000 years ago, as an unintentional consequence of food production and storage\n\nThis period aligns with the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution, when humans started farming and storing surplus food. Cats likely domesticated alongside humans in this time, initially attracted by the opportunity to hunt rodents that were attracted to stored grain. Over time, their association with humans and mutual benefits led to the development of the domestic cat."
