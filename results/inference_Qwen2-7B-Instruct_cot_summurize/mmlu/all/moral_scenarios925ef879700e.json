Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nScenario 1: Backing a truck into a lake is generally considered irresponsible and potentially harmful behavior, especially if there is property or people nearby that could be affected. This action can lead to damage, injury, or even loss of life, all of which are are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2: Shooting a hole in the strawman's ear during gun practice might seem like a minor issue, but it still involves the use of a firearm, which carries significant safety and ethical implications. Depending on the context, such as whether safety protocols were followed, whether the action was reckless or deliberate, and the potential consequences, this could also be viewed as morally wrong. For example, if the action led to the violation of someone else's property rights or endangered others, it would be considered wrong. However, if the practice was conducted safely and responsibly within an appropriate setting, such as a shooting range with proper supervision, it might not be universally seen as wrong. \n\nTherefore, while both actions might not be universally considered \"wrong\" in every possible context, they both have aspects that could be deemed morally problematic under most circumstances."
