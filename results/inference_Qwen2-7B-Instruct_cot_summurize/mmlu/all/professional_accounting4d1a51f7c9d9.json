This finding suggests a higher risk of material misstatement in the financial statements due to ineffective controls.\n\nGiven this scenario, the auditor would likely adjust their audit strategy to mitigate the increased risk identified:\n\n**A. Planned reliance on the prescribed control** - The auditor would reduce their planned reliance on the effectiveness of the existing controls, as the sample results suggest the controls might not be operating as intended.\n\n**B. Assessed level of control risk** - The auditor would increase their assessment of control risk, acknowledging that the controls do not provide adequate assurance over the financial statements.\n\n**C. Planned reliance on substantive tests** - To compensate for the higher assessed level of control risk, the auditor would plan for more extensive substantive testing, such as additional tests of details of transactions and balances, to gather sufficient evidence of the accuracy and completeness of the financial information.\n\n**D. Tolerable rate of deviations** - The auditor might consider adjusting the tolerable rate of deviations downward if they find the initial rate to be too high, reflectingting a stricter standard for acceptable control weaknesses.\n\nAmong these options, **B. Assessed level of control risk** and **C. Planned reliance on substantive tests** are directly related to the auditor's response to finding deviations that exceed the tolerable rate. However, since the question seems to ask for the most direct outcome of the auditor's action, the choice that best represents the immediate adjustment an auditor would make in response to the described situation is **A. Planned reliance on the prescribed control**. This reflects the direct impact on how the auditor plans to proceed with testing given the findings."
