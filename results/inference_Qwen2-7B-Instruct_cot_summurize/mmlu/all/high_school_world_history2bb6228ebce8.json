They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA. The eastward expansion of Russia\nB. The Portuguese conquest of India\nC. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate\nD. The Spanish conquest of Mexico\n"

One of its major policies was \"sakoku\" or national seclusion, which was implemented in the late 17th century. This policy restricted foreign influence and contact with the outside world, including the Portuguese traders. As a result, the trade patterns described by Ralph Fitch were disrupted as Japan closed its doors to international trade for nearly 250 years, effectively ending the direct exchange of goods between Japan and other countries like Portugal through the traditional trade routes.\n\nThe other options do not have a direct impact on reversing the trade patterns mentioned:\n\nA. The eastward expansion of Russia occurred later in history, during the 16th to 18th centuries, and did not significantly affect the trade patterns described in the text.\n\nB. The Portuguese conquest of India took place earlier, from the late 15th to the early 16th century, and while it expanded Portuguese influence and trade routes, it did not undo the trade patterns described; rather, it contributed to them.\n\nD. The Spanish conquest of Mexico occurred much later, in the 16th century, and did not directly impact the trade patterns mentioned in the text, which focused on the relationship between China, Japan, and Portugal."
