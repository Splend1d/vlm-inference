The IQ score of 130 that the boy obtained at age 10 indicates that he has above-average intelligence. However, IQ tests include various subtests that assess different cognitive abilities. When a child is tested again with an alternate form of the same test, it's possible that the subtests selected for the second test might differ from those taken during the first assessment. This could lead to a different set of subtest scores, even though the overall IQ score remains around 130. Therefore, while the overall IQ score might still be 130, the specific strengths and weaknesses indicated by the subtest scores may have changed."
