She is not in pain but is afraid to move her bowels for fear that the problem will worsen. She tells you that she moved away from home more than a year ago and that her parents contribute nothing to her support. She has a 6-month-old child and lives with a 28-year-old female cousin. She has never been married and does not work or attend school. She has no other symptoms. In order to follow the correct procedure for treating a minor, which of the following is the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem?\n\nA. Accept the girl's consent as sufficient\nB. Obtain a court order permitting evaluation\nC. Obtain the written consent of at least two licensed physicians\nD. Obtain written consent from at least one of her parents\n"

Obtain written consent from at least one of her parents.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, minors under a certain age (often 18 years old, but can vary by location and specific circumstances such as medical procedures or emergencies, require parental or guardian consent for medical treatment. Since the patient is 15 years old and has not provided information suggesting she is emancipated ( (meaning she is legally considered an adult), obtaining consent from at least one of her parents would typically be necessary before proceeding with any medical examination or treatment. \n\nOptions A, B, and C are not generally required for routine medical care of minors unless there are specific legal requirements or circumstances, such as emancipation, court-ordered care, or situations involving significant risk to the patient where parental consent cannot be obtained immediately ( in which case a healthcare provider might seek a temporary court order. However, these options do not directly correspond to the standard approach for minors seeking medical care without immediate parental presence."
