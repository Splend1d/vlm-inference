Political policies designed to alter demographic characteristics of a state can lead to social tensions, discrimination, and conflict based on perceived changes in the composition of the population. This can affect societal cohesion and stability.\n\nC. Legislation that criminalizes certain cultural behaviors or practices can lead to violations of human rights and freedoms, especially if the laws are applied disproportionately or unfairly against specific groups. This can undermine trust in institutions, promote social division, and limit the expression of cultural identities.\n\nD. The use of military force to conduct ethnic cleansing through displacement and killing represents a grave violation of international law and human rights. Such actions can result in massive human suffering, displacement, and loss of life, leading to long-term social and political instability within and between nations.\n\nTherefore, all of these options represent legitimate threats to societal security."
