When the price level increases, it leads to higher inflation. This, in turn, causes the real value of money to decrease, which tends to increase the nominal interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can lead to a decrease in investment and consumer spending. As a result, at each price level, the quantity of goods and services demanded by the economy decreases, causing the aggregate demand curve to slope downward."
