The critical Z-score for a two-tailed test at the 5% level is approximately \u00b11.96.\n\nHowever, without the standard errors of these coefficients, it's impossible to directly calculate p-values or compare them against the critical Z-score. Standard errors are essential because they provide a measure of the variability or uncertainty in our coefficient estimates. They're used to calculate t-statistics ( or z-statistics when the sample size is large enough, which then help us determine the statistical significance of the coefficients.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\n- Lag 1: Coefficient = 0.2\n- Lag 2: Coefficient = -0.15\n- Lag 3: Coefficient = -0.1\n\nWithout knowing the standard errors for each coefficient, we cannot determine which, if any, of these coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level. Therefore, the correct answer based on the information given is:\n\nD. It is not possible to determine the statistical significance since no standard errors have been given."
