When the cross-price elasticity is positive ( (which is the case here with an increase in demand for Firm B's service following a price increase for Firm A's service), it indicates that the goods are substitutes. Consumers may switch from the more expensive option (Firm A) to the relatively cheaper alternative (Firm B) when the price of one goes up."
