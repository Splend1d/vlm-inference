The con-sumer claimed that a flaw in the manufacturer's product had resulted in severe injuries to the consumer. In its answer,the manufacturer asserted a third-party complaint againstthe product designer, also incorporated and with its principal place of business in State B. Believing that the consumer had sued the wrong defendant, the manufacturer claimed boththat the designer was solely responsible for the flaw that had led to the consumer's injuries and that the manufacturer was not at fault. 7.After being fired, a woman sued her former employer in federal court, alleging that her supervisor had discriminated against her on the basis of her sex. The woman's complaint included a lengthy description of what the supervisor had said and done over the years, quoting his telephone calls and emails to her and her own emails to the supervisor's manager asking for help. The designer is aware that the manufacturer did not follow all of the designer's specifications when making the product. Which of the following arguments is most likely to achieve the designer's goal of dismissal of the third-party complaint?\n\nA. The court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the third-party complaint, because both the manufacturer and the designer are citizens of State B.\nB.

                    "text": "To determine which argument is most likely to achieve the designer's goal of dismissal of the third-party complaint, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the third-party complaint, because both the manufacturer and the designer are citizens of State B.** This argument hinges on the concept of diversity jurisdiction, where federal courts can hear cases between parties from different states or where there is a diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. If the manufacturer and the designer are indeed citizens of the same state (State B, this could potentially challenge the court's ability to hear the case, as it would lack diversity of citizenship. However, if the consumer (State A, is involved, it might still satisfy the jurisdictional requirements under the diversity of citizenship clause. Thus, this argument might not necessarily lead to dismissal but rather to questioning the court's authority to proceed.\n\nB. **The manufacturer failed to obtain the court's leave to file the third-party complaint.** This argument focuses on procedural rules and whether the manufacturer followed the proper procedures to add the third-party complaint. If the manufacturer did not properly seek permission from the court to file such a complaint, the court may dismiss the complaint for lack of compliance with its procedural rules. This is a strong argument for dismissal if proven true, as it directly violates the court's procedural requirements.\n\nC. **The manufacturer's failure to follow the designer's specifications caused the flaw that resulted in the consumer's injuries.** This argument suggests causation and responsibility. If the court accepts this argument, it could shift the focus away from the designer being solely responsible for the flaw. However, this argument does not necessarily lead to dismissal of the third-party complaint; instead, it could be used to argue that the manufacturer's actions were the primary cause of the consumer's injuries, potentially diminishing the designer's liability.\n\nD. **The manufacturer's third-party complaint failed to state a proper third-party claim.** This argument is about the legal sufficiency of the complaint itself. If the third-party complaint does not meet the legal requirements to assert a claim (e.g., it lacks a clear statement of facts supporting a claim or fails to identify a legal basis for the claim), then the court may dismiss it for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This is a strong argument for dismissal as it directly addresses the merits of the complaint without considering the parties' citizenship or the court's jurisdiction.\n\nGiven these options, **B. The manufacturer failed to obtain the court's leave to file the third-party complaint** appears to be the most likely argument to achieve the designer's goal of dismissal of the third-party complaint. This argument directly addresses a procedural requirement that, if violated, would justify dismissal under the court's rules of procedure."
