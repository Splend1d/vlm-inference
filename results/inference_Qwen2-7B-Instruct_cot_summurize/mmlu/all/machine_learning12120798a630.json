These differences influence how they approach various statistical problems. Here's how each of your options plays into these philosophical differences:\n\nA. **The use of a non-Gaussian noise model in probabilistic regression.** This is more about practical considerations rather than philosophical disagreement between Bayesians and frequentists. Both might agree that using a non-Gaussian (e.g., a Laplace or Student's t-distribution - can be useful when data exhibit heavy tails or outliers, which is not inherently tied to their philosophical stance.\n\nB. **The use of probabilistic modelling for regression.** Both Bayesians and frequentists can use probabilistic models for regression, though their approaches might differ. Frequentists might prefer methods like maximum likelihood estimation, while Bayesians might use Bayesian inference which incorporates prior knowledge through a prior distribution. However, this is not necessarily a point of philosophical disagreement but rather a difference in methodology.\n\nC. **The use of prior distributions on the parameters in a probabilistic model.** This is where the fundamental philosophical disagreement between Bayesians and frequentists becomes clear. Bayesians explicitly use prior distributions to express prior beliefs about the parameters before seeing the data. Frequentists do not incorporate such prior beliefs into their models; instead, they focus on estimating parameters based solely on the observed data and often aim to make statements about the parameters' properties over repeated samples ( i.e., their sampling distributions. Thus, frequentists would disagree with the concept of using prior distributions in their models.\n\nD. **The use of class priors in Gaussian Discriminant Analysis.** In discriminant analysis, class priors refer to the expected proportions of classes in the population. This is a matter of statistical practice rather than a philosophical disagreement. Both Bayesians and frequentists can use class priors in their analyses, although Bayesians might argue that incorporating prior knowledge about the class proportions can lead to more informed predictions. Frequentists might also consider class proportions but typically in terms of how they affect the decision boundaries rather than as part of a formal prior distribution.\n\nIn summary, the point where Bayesians and frequentists would most likely disagree philosophically is **Option C**, regarding the use of prior distributions on the parameters in a probabilistic model."
