This means that for the first three months (January, February, and March, there were 120,000 shares outstanding.

However, none of the options provided match this calculation. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in either the question or the answer choices. Given the calculation and the options provided, there doesn't seem to be a correct choice listed among A ($2.69), B ($2.87), C ($3.00), and D ($3.2). The closest option to our calculated value is not listed, indicating a potential error in the question's answer choices."
