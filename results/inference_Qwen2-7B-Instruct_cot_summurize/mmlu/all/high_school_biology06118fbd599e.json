Homology refers to structures in different species that have a similar evolutionary origin but may have diverged in function over time. In this case, human arms bones, bat wing bones, and dolphin flipper bones are homologous because they have evolved from similar embryonic tissues, even though they serve different functions now (walking for humans, flying for bats, swimming for dolphins.\n\nC. The observation of such similarities supports the idea that humans, bats, and dolphins share a common ancestor. This concept is central to the theory of evolution by natural selection, which explains how species change over time and how similarities between species can be used to infer evolutionary relationships. \n\nSo, the correct answer is D. A and C only."
