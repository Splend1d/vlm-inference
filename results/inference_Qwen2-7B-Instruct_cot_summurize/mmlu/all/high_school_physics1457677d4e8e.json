Images produced by convex lenses can be both real and virtual. \n\nConvex lenses, when used in optical setups, can produce either real or virtual images depending on the object's position relative to the lens. Real images occur when the object is placed beyond the focal point of the convex lens, while virtual images are formed when the object is placed between the focal point and the lens (or closer than the focal point, depending on the specific setup. Therefore, statement C accurately reflects the capability of convex lenses to produce both types of images."
