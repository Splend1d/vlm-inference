The degrees of freedom (df) for this test would be the total number of observations minus the number of parameters being estimated.\n\nGiven that there are 27 quarterly observations and 3 parameters ( ($\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, $\\beta_3$), the degrees of freedom would be:\n\n\\[ df = n - k = 27 - 3 = 24 \\]\n\nFor a two-sided 5% test, you're dividing the 5% into two tails, so each tail gets 2.5%. You'll look up the t-value for 24 degrees of freedom and a cumulative probability of 0.975 ( (since you're looking for the upper 2.5% point). \n\nThe critical value for a two-sided 5% test with 24 degrees of freedom is approximately 2.064. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 2.06**."
