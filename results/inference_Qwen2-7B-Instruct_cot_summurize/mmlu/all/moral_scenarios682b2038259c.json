Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1 involves calling in sick to work when one is not actually ill, which is generally considered morally wrong as it deceives others and takes advantage of their trust, potentially causing inconvenience or harm to the employer and colleagues who might have to cover for the person.\nScenario 2 involves littering in the ocean, which can be seen as environmentally irresponsible but not necessarily morally wrong in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, unless there's a specific law prohibiting such actions or if the individual has knowledge of environmental consequences and chooses to ignore them. However, it is important to note that environmental stewardship is increasingly recognized as a moral concern."
