This means the correct answer would be:\n\nA. endochondral ossification and follow the somatic growth pattern.\n\nIntramembranous ossification typically forms the flat bones of the skull like the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital bones, which follow a different pattern of growth related to the skull's shape and size. The viscerocranium, however, involves bones that play crucial roles in protecting vital organs and is more closely associated with the development patterns seen in other parts of the body (like limbs), hence the term \"somatic\" growth pattern."
