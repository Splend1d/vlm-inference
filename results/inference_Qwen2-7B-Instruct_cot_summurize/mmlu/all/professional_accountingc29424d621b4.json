Higher Lower\n\nIn a period of inflation, when prices are rising over time, using the Last-In, First-Out ( (LIFO) method results in a higher reported cost of goods sold compared to the First-In, First-Out ( (FIFO) method. This is because the most recently purchased items, which have likely been at a higher price due to inflation, are be considered as the first items sold.\n\nSince the cost of goods sold is higher under LIFO, this leads to:\n\n1. **Lower Ending Inventory**: Because more expensive items are considered sold, the remaining inventory ( those bought earlier when prices were lower - has a lower recorded value.\n\n2. **Lower Income Tax Payable**: The lower cost of goods sold means lower taxable income, resulting in lower income tax liability.\n\nTherefore, during inflation, Mast Co.'s ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO would be higher and lower, respectively, compared to FIFO."
