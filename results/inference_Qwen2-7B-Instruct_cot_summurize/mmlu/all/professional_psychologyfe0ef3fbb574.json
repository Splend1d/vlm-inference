This strengthening of connections is thought to underlie the consolidation of memories and the learning processes in the brain. Therefore, LTP plays a critical role in learning and memory.\n\nWhile changes in neural connections can influence behaviors related to emotions, hunger, thirst, and sexual behavior, the direct link to these specific behaviors is not as well-established or as directly associated with LTP as it is with learning and memory."
