A pardon grants a release from legal punishment, while a reprieve postpones the legal punishment for a specified period of time. \n\nIn essence:\n- A pardon forgives a person for a crime they have committed and clears their record, essentially wiping out the conviction.\n- A reprieve, on the other hand, is a temporary suspension or delay of a sentence, typically granted to give more time for consideration of clemency or other legal actions.\n\nIt's worth noting that\u8d66\u514d and \u7f13\u5211 are refer to similar concepts in Chinese legal terms, where \u8d66\u514d translates to \"pardon\" and \u7f13\u5211 translates to \"commutation of sentence\", which is similar to a reprieve but usually refers to changing a harsher sentence to a lighter one."
