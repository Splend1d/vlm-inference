Sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically.\n\nTariffs and quotas are both trade barriers that protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive or limiting the quantity of imports. Their impact on domestic prices and sales volumes can vary:\n\n- Tariffs increase the price of imported goods, which can make them less attractive to consumers compared to domestically produced goods. This could potentially lead to an increase in the sale of domestic products (option D), but it could also lead to higher prices for consumers (option A).\n\n- Quotas limit the amount of a particular good that can be imported into a country. This can reduce competition from foreign producers, potentially allowing domestic producers to charge higher prices (option A). However, if the quota is set too low, it might create shortages and drive up prices domestically. On the other hand, if the quota is set at a level that still allows for a reasonable supply of the product, it might not significantly affect domestic prices or sales volume.\n\nIn summary, both tariffs and quotas can have complex effects on the domestic market, depending on various factors such as the size of the barrier, the elasticity of demand for the product, and the presence of alternative suppliers. They may sometimes raise, sometimes lower, or even not change the amount of the product sold domestically."
