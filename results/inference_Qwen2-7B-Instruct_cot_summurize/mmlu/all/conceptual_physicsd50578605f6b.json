This absorption process is due to the presence of dissolved substances and pigments in the water, such as chlorophyll, which is primarily used by plants and algae for photosynthesis. \n\nWhen sunlight penetrates the ocean, it encounters these substances and is absorbed, especially in the red and orange parts of the spectrum. The remaining light, which includes more blue and green wavelengths, is scattered in all directions and reaches our eyes when we look into the water, giving the ocean its characteristic color."
