Dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins.\n\nCirculatory overload, often seen in conditions like heart failure or severe fluid resuscitation, typically presents with signs and symptoms such as dyspnea ( (shortness of breath), tachycardia ( (rapid heart rate), and distended neck veins ( (visible bulging of the veins in the neck). \n\nA. Hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia would more commonly indicate shock or inadequate perfusion to tissues, not circulatory overload.\n\nB. Hypotension, oliguria ( (low urine output), and urticaria ( (hives) can be signs of various conditions including but not exclusively circulatory overload; these could also be indicative of other pathologies.\n\nC. Shivering, pyrexia ( (fever), and thirst are are more commonly associated with fever or infection rather than circulatory overload."
