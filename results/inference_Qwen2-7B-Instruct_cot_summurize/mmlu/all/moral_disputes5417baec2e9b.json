In reproductive cloning, one seeks to impose one's will on a child's future.\n\nKass's despotism argument against cloning primarily focuses on the idea that reproductive cloning involves a form of control over the life of another person (the cloned individual) that can be seen as unethical or oppressive. It suggests that by creating a clone, one is essentially deciding the life path and characteristics of another being, which can be viewed as imposing one's will on them. This perspective emphasizes the potential misuse or manipulation of cloning technology rather than making a blanket statement about the morality of cloning itself or the dependence of permissibility on parental intent or having a general reason against it."
