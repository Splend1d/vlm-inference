The Supreme Court has recognized a constitutional right to privacy in cases involving contraception (Griswold v. Connecticut ( (1965) and abortion rights (Roe v. Wade (1973). These cases established that individuals have a fundamental right to make certain private medical decisions without undue interference from the state.\n\nIn this hypothetical scenario, Congress' statute prohibiting the sale and use of contraceptive devices to married persons would likely be seen as an infringement on the right to privacy, as it restricts access to methods for family planning and birth control. This restriction could potentially prevent individuals from making informed decisions about their reproductive health, which is considered a protected aspect of privacy under the Constitution.\n\nTherefore, the law would most likely be deemed unconstitutional due to its violation of the right to privacy."
