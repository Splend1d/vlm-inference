The hyperfine coupling constants, which determine the relative intensities of the spectral lines, are influenced by the number of electrons and nuclear spins interacting with the unpaired electron. In this case, the radical has one unpaired electron, which interacts with several types of nuclei:\n\n- Protons (1H: 9 equivalent protons in the methyl group, leading to 9 lines.\n- Carbon atoms from the methyl group: 36 lines.\n- The central carbon atom: 84 lines.\n- The remaining carbons in the butyl chain: 126 lines each (for a total of 2*126 = 244 lines.\n- The hydrogen atoms bonded to these carbons: Another 122 lines.\n- And finally, the terminal methyl groups: 84 lines for each, totaling 168 lines, which we can approximate to 122 lines given the options provided.\n\nThus, the ratio reflects the combinatorial possibilities of these interactions, resulting in the specified sequence of intensities."
