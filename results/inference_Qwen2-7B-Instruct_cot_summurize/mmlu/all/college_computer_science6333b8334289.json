Consider the product of three matrices N_1N_2N_3 that have, respectively, w rows and x columns, x rows and y columns, and y rows and z columns. Under what condition will it take less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 (i.e., multiply the first two matrices first) than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3)?\n\nA. There is no such condition; i.e., they will always take the same time.\nB. 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y\nC. x > y\nD. 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z\n"

When multiplying two matrices, the time complexity is given by the product of the number of rows of the first matrix, the number of columns of the first matrix, times the number of columns of the second matrix for the first operation, and then similarly for the second operation.\n\nFor the product \\((N_1N_2)N_3\\), the time taken would be:\n- First multiplication \\(N_1N_2\\) takes \\(w \\times x \\times y\\) time.\n- Then, multiplying the result with \\(N_3\\) takes \\(y \\times z \\times w\\) time.\n\nSo, total time = \\(wxy + yzw\\).\n\nFor the product \\(N_1(N_2N_3)\\), the time taken would be:\n- First multiplication \\(N_2N_3\\) takes \\(x \\times y \\times z\\) time.\n- Then, multiplying the result with \\(N_1\\) takes \\(w \\times x \\times z\\) time.\n\nSo, total time = \\(xyz + wxz\\).\n\nWe want to find when \\((wxy + yzw) < ( (xyz + wxz)\\).\n\nLet's rearrange this inequality:\n\n\\[wxy + yzw < xyz + wxz\\]\n\n\\[wxy - xyz < wxz - yzw\\]\n\n\\[xy(w - z) < wz(x - y)\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(xyz\\) ( assuming \\(x,y,z,w\\) are all positive ( we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{w - z}{z} < \\frac{x - y}{y}\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(yz\\):\n\n\\[y(w - z) < z(x - y)\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[wy - yz < zx - yz\\]\n\nSuggesting:\n\n\\[wy < zx\\]\n\nOr equivalently,\n\n\\[1/y < 1/x + 1/z\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: \\(1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z\\)."
