Tapering: While tapering is often used in the period before competition to allow the body to recover and optimize performance, it does not directly provide any additional energy source or enhance fuel storage like carbohydrate loading or exogenous carbohydrate ingestion. Its main benefits are more indirect, focusing on reducing fatigue and improving performance by allowing the athlete to peak at the right time.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that all these strategies ( carbohydrate loading, tapering, the classic glycogen loading regime, and exogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise - are generally considered beneficial for enhancing performance in endurance sports. The effectiveness can depend significantly on the individual, the specifics of their training regimen, the event they're participating in, and other factors such as personal nutrition needs and dietary habits."
