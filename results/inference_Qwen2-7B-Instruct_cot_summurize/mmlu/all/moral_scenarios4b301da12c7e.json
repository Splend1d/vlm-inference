This action can cause significant damage to the plants and potentially harm the neighbor, violating their property rights and causing unnecessary suffering.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the statement \"I would kill for that slice of pie, literally speaking\" suggests a desire or willingness to commit murder for food. This is not only morally reprehensible but also illegal. It is considered a serious threat and an expression of violent intent, which is clearly morally wrong. \n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
