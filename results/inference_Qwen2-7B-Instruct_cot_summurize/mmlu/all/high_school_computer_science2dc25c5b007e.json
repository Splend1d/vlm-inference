                    "text": "The most efficient searching algorithm for a sorted list is binary search. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Here's how it would work with a sorted list:\n\n1. Start by examining the middle element of the list.\n2. If the middle element is equal to 100, you've found your target and can stop.\n3. If 100 is less than the middle element, repeat the process on the first half of the list ( (since the list is sorted, all elements after the middle will also be greater).\n4. If 100 is greater than the middle element, repeat the process on the second half of the list.\n5. Continue this process until either the target is found or the search space is reduced to zero.\n\nIn terms of the maximum number of elements examined, you can calculate this using the formula for the maximum number of comparisons in binary search, which is essentially the log base 2 of the number of elements in the list, rounded up. For a list of 120 elements:\n\n\\[ \\text{Maximum comparisons} = \\lceil \\log_2(120) \\rceil \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_2(120) \\approx 6.96 \\]\n\nRounding up, you get 7 as the maximum number of elements that need to be examined before finding the target or concluding it's not in the list.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 7."
