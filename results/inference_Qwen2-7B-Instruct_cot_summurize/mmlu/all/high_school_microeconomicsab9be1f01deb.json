The sources of these differentials include factors such as human capital, discrimination, and immobility. \n\nA. Differences in human capital stock: This includes education, skills, experience, and health, which can lead to differences in wages based on the value employers place on these attributes.\n\nB. Racial or gender discrimination: This refers to unequal treatment of individuals based on their race or gender, leading to disparities in wages despite similar qualifications and performance.\n\nC. Immobility of workers: Workers who cannot easily move to areas with higher demand for their skills or better job opportunities may experience lower wages compared to those who have more mobility.\n\nD. Decrease in the birth rate: While this demographic factor can influence the labor supply over time, it is not a direct source of wage differentials between individuals. It affects the overall size of the workforce but does not create differentials within the workforce based on individual characteristics."
