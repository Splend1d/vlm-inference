The calculation above correctly shows a 5% increase, but since this exact option isn't listed as intended ( or due to a slight error in the options provided, the closest and accurate calculation based on the data provided leads to an understanding that there waswas indeed a 5% increase in real GDP per capita from 1980 to 1990. \n\nGiven the context and the options, the closest and technically correct answer among those provided would be B. 5.0 percent, though it should ideally represent a 5% increase rather than being labeled as such in the question's options setup."
