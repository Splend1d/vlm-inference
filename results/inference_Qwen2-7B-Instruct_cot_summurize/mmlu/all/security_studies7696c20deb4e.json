All of these options.\n\nEach of the mentioned security sectors has intrinsic links with energy security:\n\nA. **Economic and development security** - Energy is crucial for economic growth and development. Reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy sources are necessary for industries, transportation, and daily life, which in turn drives economic activities and supports development.\n\nB. **Regime and international security** - Energy resources can significantly influence geopolitical dynamics and national security. Control over energy-rich territories or dominance in energy markets can provide leverage and strategic advantages, impacting regime stability and international relations.\n\nC. **Environmental and human security** - The transition to cleaner energy sources is critical for environmental sustainability and public health. Energy policies and practices can affect air and water quality, climate change, and thus directly impact human well-being and environmental health.\n\nTherefore, all three sectors are interconnected with energy security."
