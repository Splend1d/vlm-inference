They are often seen as trendsetters and can significantly influence others due to their position within the community.\n\n2. **Early adapters** follow closely behind innovators. They tend to be more cautious than innovators but are still considered leaders within the community. Their adoption of new changes can help legitimize these changes for the rest of the community.\n\nWhile all segments play a role in the diffusion process, innovators and early adapters are crucial in the initial stages of change. Middle adapters and late adapters might not significantly contribute to the early diffusion of a change but can be important in later stages when the change has been widely accepted and needs further reinforcement or adaptation to local contexts.\n\nTherefore, options A (Innovators and B Early adapters are directly involved in achieving effective change in a community, though the effectiveness also depends on how well the change is adapted and accepted across all segments over time."
