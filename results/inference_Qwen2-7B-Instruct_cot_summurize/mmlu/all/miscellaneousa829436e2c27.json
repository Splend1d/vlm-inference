Detect and respond to changes in the environment\n\nAll living organisms have the ability to detect and respond to changes in their environment, whether it's chemical, physical, or biological stimuli. This ability is crucial for survival and is found across all levels of biological organization, from individual cells to entire ecosystems. \n\nWhile some organisms may move from place to place (A, produce sugars through photosynthesis specifically for plants and some algae  C, or maintain a constant internal temperature through various physiological mechanisms such as sweating or shivering  D, these are not universal characteristics shared by all living organisms. For example, not all organisms can move (think of sessile organisms like many corals or plants that cannot walk away from an unfavorable environment, and not all organisms can photosynthesize - this is a specific adaptation of plants, algae, and some bacteria. And while some animals can regulate their body temperature internally, others like reptiles and birds are rely on external sources for thermoregulation."
