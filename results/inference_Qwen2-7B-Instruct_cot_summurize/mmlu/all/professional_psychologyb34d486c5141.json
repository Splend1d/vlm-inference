These models typically include both observed variables (also known as manifest or measured attributes) and latent variables (which are inferred from patterns in the observed variables, often referred to as constructs). \n\nSo, when your causal model involves relationships between both types of variables - both observed attributes and latent traits - LISREL would be the appropriate choice for analysis. It allows for the estimation of complex relationships, including direct and indirect effects, and can handle both measurement error and structural relationships simultaneously."
