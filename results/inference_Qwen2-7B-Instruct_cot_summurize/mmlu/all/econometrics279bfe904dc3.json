(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n(i) The tests will show whether the identified model is either too large or too small: This statement is true. The Box-Jenkins methodology involves an iterative process of identifying, estimating, and checking models. Diagnostic tests help determine if the model is adequately specified, which means it is neither too complex (too large) nor too simple (too small).\n\n(ii) The tests involve checking the model residuals for autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality: This statement is also true. After fitting an ARMA model, it's crucial to check the residuals for these properties. Autocorrelation suggests that the model has not captured all the information in the data, heteroscedasticity indicates that the variance of the errors is not constant across observations, and non-normality implies that the error distribution deviates from normality, both of which can indicate model inadequacies.\n\n(iii) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the acf and pacf for the residuals should show no additional structure: This statement is true as well. When the model is correctly specified, the autoccorrelation function (acf) and partial autoccorrelation function (pacf) of the residuals should not exhibit any significant autoccorrelation patterns. Any remaining structure in these plots suggests that the model might be missing some important dynamics in the data.\n\n(iv) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the coefficients on the additional variables under the overfitting approach will be statistically insignificant: This statement is false. The Box-Jenkins approach does not inherently distinguish between overfitting and appropriate model specification based on the significance of coefficients. Overfitting typically refers to a model with more parameters than necessary, which may lead to coefficients being estimated with high precision but without meaningful contribution to the model's explanatory power. However, statistical insignificance of coefficients could be due to various reasons, including low power in estimation, rather than necessarily indicating an appropriately specified model in the context of Box-Jenkins diagnostics.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and D are incorrect because they either exclude one of the correct statements or include the incorrect statement (iv)."
