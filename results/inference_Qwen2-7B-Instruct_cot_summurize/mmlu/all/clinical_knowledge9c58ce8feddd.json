Increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.\n\nDuring soccer, or any high-intensity physical activity, the body primarily relies on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy when oxygen supply cannot meet the demand. Lactate, also known as pyruvic acid, is a byproduct of this anaerobic metabolism. As the game progresses and the intensity remains high, the production of lactate in muscles increases due to the lack of sufficient oxygen for the complete oxidation of glucose.\n\nBlood lactate concentration typically starts low during the beginning of the game, rises as the game progresses, and peaks at the end of the match when players are often most fatigued. This increase is a reflection of the accumulation of lactate in the muscles and bloodstream due to the increased metabolic demand that outstrips the aerobic capacity of the athlete. Therefore, option D accurately describes how blood lactate concentration behaves during a soccer game."
