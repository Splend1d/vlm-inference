There are 1000 micrograms in a milligram.\n\nSo, if the dose is 1.5 mg, you would calculate it as follows:\n\n\\[1.5 \\, \\text{mg} \\times 1000 = 1500 \\, \\mu g\\]\n\nSince this amount is divided into three doses, you divide the total micrograms by 3:\n\n\\[1500 \\, \\mu g \\div 3 = 500 \\, \\mu g\\]\n\nTherefore, each dose is 500 micrograms, which corresponds to option D."
