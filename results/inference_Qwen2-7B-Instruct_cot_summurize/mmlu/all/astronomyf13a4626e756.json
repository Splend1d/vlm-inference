To measure galactic distances.\n\nCepheid variables are particularly useful to astronomers because their intrinsic luminosities ( or absolute magnitudes can be determined by observing their period-luminosity relationship. This means that if we know the period of a Cepheid variable, we can determine its intrinsic brightness and thus calculate how far away it is. This makes them key tools in measuring the distances to galaxies, as they serve as 'standard candles'\u2014objects with known luminosity that allow us to calculate the distance based on how dim they appear from Earth."
