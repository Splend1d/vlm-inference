The buyer will most likely recover because the manufacturer's failure to deliver the additional 10 widgets resulted in a material breach of the contract. \n\nIn this scenario, the contract specified that the manufacturer was obligated to deliver 500 widgets. Delivering only 490 widgets does not fulfill the contractual obligation, especially since it falls short of the required quantity. This non-delivery constitutes a material breach of contract, entitling the buyer to seek remedies such as damages or specific performance (depending on the specifics of the contract and applicable law.\n\nOptions A and B suggest that the lack of full performance does not lead to recovery because substantial performance occurred or because acceptance of the delivered goods absolves the breaching party. However, these arguments do not hold up when there is a clear breach of a material term of the contract, as in this case.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that the manufacturer did not fail to perform his contractual obligation, which contradicts the facts presented."
