However, given the options you've provided, it seems Ashford might be considering a combination of these factors to assess justice:\n\nA. **They help develop human capabilities.** This alignss with capabilities theory, which focuses on the ability of individuals to lead lives they value. A just system would enable people to achieve their potential.\n\nB. **They minimize the amount of suffering in the world.** This criterion emphasizes the welfare aspect of justice, aiming to reduce pain and misery experienced by individuals within society.\n\nC. **They recognize, enforce, and implement duties not to violate human rights.** This criterion directly addresses the protection of individual freedoms and rights, ensuring that no one is subjected to unjust treatment or infringement upon their basic entitlements.\n\nD. **They are universalizable.** This principle is rooted in Kantian ethics, suggesting that a just system should adhere to principles that could be universally applied without contradiction. It implies that the rules governing the system should be applicable in all similar situations without exception.\n\nIt's important to note that Ashford might prioritize some of these criteria over others based on his broader ethical framework or philosophical beliefs. For instance, if Ashford subscribes to a consequentialist view, he might place more emphasis on minimizing suffering (Option B. If he adheres to a deontological perspective, then Option C (the recognition and enforcement of human rights duties, would likely be paramount. Lastly, if he is a proponent of universal moral principles (akin to Kant, then Option D would be highly significant.\n\nGiven this context, Ashford's evaluation of legal and economic structures for justice would likely involve a comprehensive analysis that considers multiple aspects, including but not limited to the development of human capabilities, reduction of suffering, protection of rights, and adherence to universalizable moral principles."
