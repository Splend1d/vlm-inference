Research has shown that RNA viruses often have higher mutation rates compared to DNA viruses due to their lack of effective proofreading during replication. This high mutation rate can contribute to the rapid evolution of RNA viruses, which is particularly evident in the case of influenza and HIV, as mentioned in option C. These viruses can mutate quickly, leading to the emergence of new strains or variants."
