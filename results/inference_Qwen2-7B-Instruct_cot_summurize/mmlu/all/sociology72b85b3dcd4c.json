In Stage 3, typically associated with high-income countries, the primary causes of illness and death are chronic, degenerative diseases rather than acute, infectious diseases. This shift is due to improvements in sanitation, nutrition, and healthcare leading to reductions in infant mortality and infectious diseases, but also increases in longevity which allows chronic conditions to become more prevalent."
