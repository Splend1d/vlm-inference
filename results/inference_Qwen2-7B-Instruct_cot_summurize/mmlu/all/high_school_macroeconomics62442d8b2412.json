This can stimulate economic growth by creating jobs, increasing production, and encouraging business investments, all of which contribute to higher real GDP.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this approach might lead to inflation if the economy is already near full capacity, as the increased demand could push up prices. The key is moderation and careful timing to ensure the policy is effective and does not cause unwanted inflationary pressures. \n\nOptions A, B, and D are could potentially lead to higher inflation if not managed carefully due to the simultaneous changes in both government spending and taxation, which can significantly impact the overall demand in the economy."
