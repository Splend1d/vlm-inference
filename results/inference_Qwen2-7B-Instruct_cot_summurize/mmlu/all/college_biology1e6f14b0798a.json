However, there are several key differences between the two:\n\nA. Cyanobacteria reduce sulfur compounds: This statement is not accurate. While cyanobacteria can perform various metabolic processes, including the reduction of nitrogen compounds (nitrogen fixation), they do not typically reduce sulfur compounds in the same way that some bacteria can.\n\nB. Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: This statement is false. Both cyanobacteria and green unicellular algae have cell walls. The cell wall in cyanobacteria is made of peptidoglycan, while in green algae, it is primarily composed of cellulose.\n\nC. Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This statement is true. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes, meaning they lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Their genetic material is contained within a region called the nucleoid.\n\nD. Green algae produce cell membranes: This statement is also true. Like all cells, green algae possess a plasma membrane that surrounds their cytoplasm and protects them from the external environment.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer to your question is C: Cyanobacteria have no nuclei."
