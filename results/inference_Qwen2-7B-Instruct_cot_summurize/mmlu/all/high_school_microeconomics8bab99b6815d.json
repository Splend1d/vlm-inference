Collusive output levels tend to increase, driving the price above competitive levels.\n\nWhen large firms collude, they often agree to limit their production or set prices in order to maximize their collective profits. This can lead to higher prices for consumers and less output than would occur under competitive market conditions. The goal of such collusion is to restrict competition, which typically results in prices being set above what they would be in a perfectly competitive market. This is one reason why governments discourage collusion among firms in the same industry, as it can harm consumers and reduce overall economic efficiency."
