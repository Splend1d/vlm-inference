Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nScenario 1: It's generally not morally wrong for an adult to purchase alcohol for another adult, assuming that the person purchasing the alcohol is legally allowed to do so and the other party is of legal drinking age. However, it might be considered irresponsible if the person purchasing the alcohol knows or has reason to believe that the recipient is prone to excessive consumption or underage drinking.\n\nScenario 2: Skateboarding on a sidewalk at high speed can be dangerous and is often against local laws or ordinances, especially in areas where sidewalks are not designated for skateboarding. This action could be considered morally wrong because it poses a risk to others (such as pedestrians who may not expect a skateboarder traveling at high speed) and potentially violates local regulations. It's important to respect the safety of others and to follow local laws and rules."
