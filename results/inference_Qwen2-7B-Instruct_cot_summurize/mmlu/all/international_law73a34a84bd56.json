The recognition of foreign judgments is dependent on the existence of appropriate bilateral or multilateral treaties.\n\nThis means that whether a foreign judgment can be recognized and enforced in another jurisdiction often depends on whether there is a treaty in place that facilitates this process, such as an international convention or agreement. These treaties typically outline the conditions under which judgments from one country will be recognized and enforced in another. Without such a treaty, the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments may be more complex and discretionary, potentially influenced by principles of comity (the respect for the laws and decisions of other states, though this is not a strict legal requirement for recognition.\n\nOptions A and B refer to doctrines related to the incorporation of treaties into domestic law but do not specifically address the recognition of foreign judgments. Option D correctly identifies that in some cases, the courts might have discretion in enforcing foreign judgments based on principles of comity, but this is not a universal rule for all jurisdictions or all cases involving foreign judgments."
