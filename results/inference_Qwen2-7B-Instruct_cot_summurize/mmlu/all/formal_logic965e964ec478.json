This means that both I and ~H have the same truth value in all possible scenarios.\n- **Proposition 2** states that it is not the case that the negation of I being equivalent to H. This means that the scenario where I and H are equivalent after negating I does not occur.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nFrom the truth tables, we can see that there are scenarios where the truth values of the two propositions differ:\n- When I is True and H is True, Proposition 1 yields False while Proposition 2 yields False.\n- When I is True and H is False, Proposition 1 yields True while Proposition 2 yields True.\n- When I is False and H is True, Proposition 1 yields False while Proposition 2 yields True.\n- When I is False and H is False, Proposition 1 yields True while Proposition 2 yields False.\n\nSince there are scenarios where the truth values of the two propositions differ, they cannot be logically equivalent. Also, since there are scenarios where they do not differ ( (when I is True and H is False, or when I is False and H is True), they are not contradictory either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent**"
