However, many surveys indicate that for older adults living together, option B - an alternative to marriage - is often considered. This is because they might have had previous marriages or view cohabitation as a more flexible arrangement without the legal and societal commitments of marriage.\n\nOption A ( \"a first step toward eventual marriage\" might be true for some individuals, but it's not a universal perspective among older adults.\n\nOption C \"a way to save on expenses\" could be one reason for cohabitation, especially for financial reasons, but it doesn't fully capture the emotional or relational aspects that might motivate cohabitation among older adults.\n\nOption D \"their swan song\" suggests that cohabitation might be seen as a final stage in life, which could apply to some individuals, particularly those who have experienced significant life changes such as widowhood or divorce later in life.\n\nIn summary, while all options may resonate with some older adults, the most common perception might align with option B - viewing cohabitation as an alternative to marriage."
