In case individuals, places, or organizations can be harmed through identification or disclosure of personal information.\n\nKeeping personal data about research participants within secure, confidential records is crucial to protect them from potential harm. This could include identity theft, reputational damage, or even physical harm if sensitive information could be used to target individuals. Confidentiality also respects the privacy of the participants and builds trust, which is essential for ethical research practices. Options A, C, and D do not accurately reflect the reasons for maintaining confidentiality; they instead suggest potential negative consequences or uses of such data, rather than the protection and privacy reasons for keeping it secure."
