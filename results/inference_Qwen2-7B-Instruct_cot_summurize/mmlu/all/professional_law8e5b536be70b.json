The detective, who questioned the defendant at the station house after his arrest, testified that the defendant initially declared his innocence. The detective further testified that when given the opportunity to take a lie detector test, the defendant refused. The defendant's attorney did not object to the detective's testimony. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to prison. The defendant, who is now represented by a new attorney, appeals, claiming that it was error to admit the detective's testimony. The appellate court should find\n\nA. plain error, because the trial court should have acted on its own motion to order reference to the lie detector test stricken.\nB. plain error, because admission of the detective's testimony violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\nC. harmless error, because the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by timely objection.\nD. harmless error, because the defendant's statements were admissions.\n"

In this situation, the detective's testimony about the defendant's refusal to take a lie detector test could be seen as implicating the defendant in the crime, as refusing such a test might suggest guilt. This is particularly relevant if the defendant had not been previously informed of their right to refuse the test, which is typically provided under the Miranda rights. Therefore, the appellate court should consider whether the admission of this testimony violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, leading to the finding of a \"plain error.\"\n\nOptions A and C refer to procedural issues regarding the role of the trial judge or the failure to object, respectively, but do not directly address the constitutional violation that is the central issue here. Option D suggests that the defendant's statements were admissions, which is not necessarily true based on the information provided. Admissions are are statements made by the defendant that directly acknowledge guilt, whereas refusing a lie detector test is not necessarily an admission of guilt."
