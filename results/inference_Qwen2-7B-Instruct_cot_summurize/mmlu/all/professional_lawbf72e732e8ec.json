In this case, the woman's testimony about what the witness said regarding the employee shoveling snow could potentially prove that the convenience store owner had some control or responsibility over the sidewalk where the accident took place. This would be relevant to establishing negligence or liability on the part of the store owner.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the admissibility of such evidence can vary based on state laws and specific circumstances, including whether there are are other exceptions to the hearsay rule that might apply. Additionally, the testimony would likely be admitted only for the limited purpose of proving the declarant's state of mind or actions at the time of the incident, not for the truth of the matter asserted ( unless another exception to the hearsay rule applies."
