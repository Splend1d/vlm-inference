The United States became a creditor country and financial center, with European war spending boosting the US economy.\n\nDuring World War I, the United States played a significant role as a financier and supplier of goods to the Allied powers, which primarily consisted of European nations fighting against the Central Powers ( led by Germany. As a result, American industries thrived due to the high demand for military supplies and other resources. Moreover, the U.S. lent large sums of money to the Allies, becoming a creditor nation. This influx of debt and subsequent payments from the victorious Allies helped to strengthen the US dollar and increase the country's wealth. The war also led to technological advancements and industrial growth in the United States, further solidifying its position as a major global economic power.\n\nAdditionally, the post-war period saw the rise of the United States as a leading financial center, especially with the establishment of the New York Stock Exchange as a global hub for financial transactions. This was partly due to the fact that many European countries were in debt to the United States and sought to manage their finances through American institutions, thereby cementing the US's role as a key player in international finance."
