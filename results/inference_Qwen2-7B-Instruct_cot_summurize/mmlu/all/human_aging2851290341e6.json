Interpret the answers you get from people\n\nOpen-ended questions can be very useful for gathering detailed and nuanced responses, but they can also lead to difficulties in interpretation because the answers are not standardized or quantifiable. Respondents may provide answers in different formats, use varying levels of detail, or interpret the question differently, which can make it challenging to compare responses or analyze trends. This is especially true if there are are no predefined options or scales for respondents to choose from."
