In which the subsidiary maintains its accounting records.\n\nWhen preparing consolidated financial statements, each subsidiary's financial statements are first translated into the parent company's reporting currency, usually the US dollar for a US-based parent company. However, the functional currency of the subsidiary is determined based on the economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. This is typically the currency in which the subsidiary generates and expend cash (option D), but importantly, this is also the currency in which the subsidiary maintains its accounting records (option A). \n\nThe functional currency is crucial as it determines how revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities are measured and reported in the subsidiary's financial statements before consolidation. It is chosen to most faithfully represent the economic effects of transactions, events, and conditions that affect the entity. \n\nOptions B and C refer to the location of the subsidiary and the parent company, respectively, but these do not directly determine the functional currency unless they align with where the subsidiary primarily generates and expend cash (option D)."
