Women's increased chances of being in poverty, due to low pay and greater welfare dependency\n\nThe term \"feminization of poverty\" refers to the phenomenon where women, particularly those from marginalized groups, have a higher likelihood of experiencing poverty. This is often attributed to factors such as gender wage gaps, occupational segregation, lack of access to education and training, and greater reliance on welfare systems. It does not refer to the deconstruction of the concept of 'poverty' by feminist theorists ( (option A), nor is it about budget management being a woman's responsibility within the home (option C). Nor is it specifically about the disproportionate number of female sociologists researching poverty (option D)."
