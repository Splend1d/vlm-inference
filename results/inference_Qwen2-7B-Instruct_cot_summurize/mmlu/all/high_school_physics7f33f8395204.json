The normal force acts perpendicular to the surface ( upward in this case, while the friction force acts tangentially, parallel to the surface, downward. Together, they provide the necessary inward force for circular motion. The weight of the car acts vertically downward and does not contribute to the centripetal force needed for circular motion."
