A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.\n\nWhen the fourth cranial nerve (also known as the oculomotor nerve or Cranial Nerve III, is damaged, it can lead to ptosis ( (drooping of the upper eyelid) and an inability to fully dilate the pupil. This condition also causes an inability to move the eye downward and laterally, leading to double vision when looking up because the affected eye does not move with the other eye. \n\nLet's clarify why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Diplopia can occur even if one eye is covered. It typically arises when there is a problem with one eye or with the brain's ability to process visual information from both eyes.\n\nB. Whether the outer image is the false image depends on the specific cause of diplopia. It could be either eye that appears distorted or doubled, depending on the underlying issue.\n\nD. A sixth nerve palsy ( affecting Cranial Nerve VI, which controls the muscles for eye movement, can cause an inward or convergent squint rather than a divergent squint. When the sixth nerve is affected, the eye may turn inward, causing double vision when looking straight ahead."
