Erectus possessed a larger brain. \n\nHomo erectus had a more developed brain compared to Homo habilis, although not as large as those of later hominids like Homo sapiens. They also exhibited significant physical changes, such as a more upright posture and a different facial structure. Homo erectus fossils have been found outside of Africa, in places like Java, China, and Israel, which distinguishes them from Homo habilis in terms of geographical distribution as well."
