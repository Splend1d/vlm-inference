The fact that virtually all known organisms (bacteria, archaea, plants, animals, fungi, and protists share the same set of genetic codes suggests they are all derived from a common ancestor. This similarity in the genetic code is a key piece of evidence for the theory of evolution by natural selection, which posits that all life shares a common evolutionary history."
