                    "text": "Parfit's views on equality are complex and nuanced, and they do not neatly fit into any of the options provided. However, one of his main arguments against equality is found in option A: he argues that an unequal society is inevitable due to various factors such as differences in talents, abilities, and opportunities. Parfit emphasizes that the distribution of goods and resources in society is influenced by many uncontrollable factors, leading to inequalities that cannot be eliminated without significant interference with individual freedom and personal responsibility.\n\nParfit also discusses the concept of \"mere addition\" versus \"subtraction\" in terms of improving lives. He suggests that it is more effective to improve the lives of those who are already relatively well off (thus increasing inequality slightly but significantly improving their situation, rather than reducing inequality by taking from the better off to give to the worse off. This perspective challenges the notion that prioritizing the needs of the poor will necessarily lead to greater overall equality.\n\nOptions B and C do not accurately reflect Parfit's stance. He does not claim that by giving priority to the needs of the poor, we can increase equality, nor does he assert that each person is solely responsible for their poverty. Option D is incorrect because Parfit does not reject the idea of equality altogether; instead, he critiques certain ways of thinking about equality and suggests that focusing too narrowly on equality can sometimes lead to counterproductive policies or moral judgments.\n\nIn summary, while Parfit does argue that an unequal society is often inevitable due to various factors beyond our control, his critique of equality is more about the limitations of our ability to achieve perfect equality and the potential costs of striving for it in certain ways, rather than opposing equality outright."
