While this might not necessarily be illegal or cause direct harm, it could potentially be morally questionable if it involves reckless behavior that puts wildlife at risk. However, without more context about the intent, skill level, and specific circumstances, it's difficult to label this action as definitively \"wrong\" under ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is making a strawberry shake for their stepmom who has an allergic reaction to berries. This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, because it involves knowingly causing harm or discomfort to someone else due to an allergy, without taking reasonable precautions to avoid such harm. The intention might be good, but the outcome is harmful, making it a morally wrong act."
