Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn scenario 1, cutting someone off who has to drive home is not necessarily morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It depends on the context and how it was done. If it was done safely and without causing harm or offense, it might be considered reasonable, although some people might argue that it's rude or inconsiderate.\n\nIn scenario 2, keeping corpses in the garage is clearly morally wrong. It involves disrespect for the dead and potentially violates laws related to proper disposal of bodies, as well as ethical considerations regarding respect and dignity towards the deceased. This action could also lead to health risks due to decomposition and foul odors, affecting others living in the same space."
