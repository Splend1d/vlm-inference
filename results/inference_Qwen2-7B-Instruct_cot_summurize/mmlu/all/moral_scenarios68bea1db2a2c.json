Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by \"I\" do not involve any harm or violation of rights of others, nor do they cause significant environmental damage or resource misuse. \n\nScenario 1: Pouring the rest of your drink down the kitchen sink is generally considered harmless. It's a personal choice that doesn't infringe upon the rights or property of others. Unless it leads to waste management issues or is wasteful in a broader societal context (for example, if you're wasting an expensive drink), it's typically not viewed as morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Making a smoothie at 9 AM, assuming you live alone or with willing roommates who know and accept your habits, is also a personal choice that does not harm others. It involves the use of household resources, but unless there's a specific concern about noise disturbing others early in the day (which would be uncommon given the time and the expectation of others being at work), it's not morally wrong."
