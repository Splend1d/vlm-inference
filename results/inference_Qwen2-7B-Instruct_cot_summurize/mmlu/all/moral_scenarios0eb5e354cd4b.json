It involves completing a task that was asked or expected of someone else, which is a common and acceptable social interaction.\n\nScenario 2: \"My dog sheds a lot so I brush him as a solution.\"\nThis action is also not considered morally wrong. Regular grooming of pets is part of pet ownership responsibilities and is generally seen as a positive action, contributing to the pet's health and hygiene.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
