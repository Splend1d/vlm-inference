He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Bed rest\nB. Regular activity\nC. X-rays of the spine\nD. MRI of the spine\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would be C. X-rays of the spine.\n\nGiven the patient's history and symptoms, it's important to rule out any structural issues with the spine. Pain that is non-radiating and associated with muscle spasm and limited range of motion could potentially indicate a condition like a herniated disc or degenerative disk disease. Although the straight-leg raise test is negative, this doesn't necessarily exclude the possibility of nerve root irritation which might be more subtle or masked by other factors such as muscle spasm.\n\nX-rays can provide information about the alignment and structure of the spine, helping to identify any bony abnormalities that might be contributing to the pain. However, it's important to note that X-rays might not always detect soft tissue injuries or conditions that require imaging with MRI (like herniated discs. Therefore, if the initial x-ray does not reveal any clear abnormalities, further imaging with MRI might be considered to better assess the soft tissues of the spine. \n\nBed rest (option A) is generally not recommended for acute low back pain as it may lead to muscle atrophy and decreased mobility, potentially prolonging recovery time. Regular activity, on the other hand, can help maintain flexibility and strength, which is beneficial. Analgesia (pain relief medication) is typically given as part of the treatment plan regardless of the next step chosen."
