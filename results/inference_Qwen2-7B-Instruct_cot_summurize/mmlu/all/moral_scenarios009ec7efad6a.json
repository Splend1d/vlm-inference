Not wrong, Wrong. \n\nPlanting vegetables in your neighbor's garden without their permission can be seen as a boundary violation or theft, depending on the context, but it might not necessarily be considered morally wrong in every situation. It could depend on factors like the value of the cucumber plants, the reason for planting them, and the relationship with the neighbor. However, in general, it's not considered a morally wrong act.\n\nOn the other hand, spitting in someone else's sink after using their bathroom is clearly disrespectful and unsanitary behavior. This action violates personal hygiene standards and the sanctity of someone else's property, which is widely considered morally wrong."
