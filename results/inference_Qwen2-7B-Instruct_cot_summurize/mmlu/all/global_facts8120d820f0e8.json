US\n\nThe United States has historically had one of the highest rates of homelessness in the world, even when compared to other developed nations. However, it's important to note that specific rankings can vary depending on the data source and the criteria used to measure homelessness. Also, other countries such as Spain and Ireland might have experienced significant spikes in homelessness during economic downturns, like the European debt crisis affecting those regions around that time.\n\nChile is generally known for having lower rates of homelessness compared to these other options. Nonetheless, the specifics can change over time and depend on various factors including economic conditions, housing policies, and social welfare systems.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, it would be best to consult recent reports or databases compiled by organizations such as the United Nations, the World Bank, or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( (HUD) for international comparisons."
