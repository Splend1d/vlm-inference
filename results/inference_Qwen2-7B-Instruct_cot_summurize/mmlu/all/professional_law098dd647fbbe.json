At trial, the manufacturer has called as an expert witness a product safety engineer, who testifies that the manufacturer retained him for a fee to test identical mowers and, if his opinion was helpful, to testify in the case. The expert then testifies that he did test the mowers, and that the blade, as designed and installed by the manufacturer, could not fly off in the manner claimed by the plaintiff. Assume that the expert has used a reliable method for reaching his conclusion. Should the court admit the expert's testimony?\n\nA. No, because it goes to an ultimate issue that only the jury can decide.\nB. No, because the manufacturer paid the expert to render a certain opinion, in violation of rules barring paid testimony. violation of rules barring paid testimony.\nC. Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury.\nD.

Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury.\n\nThe Federal Rules of Evidence generally permit expert testimony if it will help the trier of fact understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue. In this case, the product safety engineer's testimony provides a technical analysis of the mower's design and operation, which can assist the jury in understanding whether the alleged design defect caused the plaintiff's injury. The fact that the expert was hired by the manufacturer does not automatically disqualify their testimony; instead, it may be subject to cross-examination regarding potential bias or conflicts of interest."
