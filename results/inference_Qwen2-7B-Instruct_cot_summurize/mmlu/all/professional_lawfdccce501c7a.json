Thereafter, the skier sued the ski resort alleging negligent maintenance of the ski lift machinery. The ski resort's skier's attorney took a discovery deposition of a witness who was seated behind the skier at the time of the accident. The witness died shortly after the deposition. At trial, the skier offers the witness's deposition testimony into evidence. Upon objection by the ski resort's attorney, the deposition is\n\nA. admissible as former testimony.\nB. admissible, provided that the witness's statements are more probative on the point than any other evidence the skier can procure through reasonable efforts and that the skier has given the ski resort reasonable notice that she would offer the deposition.\nC. inadmissible, because it violates the ski resort's right to confront the witnesses against itself.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Additionally, the testimony must be more probative on the point than any other evidence the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts. The party offering the deposition must also have given the opposing party reasonable notice that they intend to use the deposition at trial.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while \"former testimony\" is a type of hearsay exception, the specific circumstances of this case do not necessarily fit the traditional definition of \"former testimony.\"\n\nOption C is incorrect because although the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to confrontation, this right does not apply to depositions in civil cases as it does to testimonies at criminal trials.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the deposition testimony could potentially qualify for an exception to the hearsay rule, such as Rule 807, if it meets the criteria mentioned above."
