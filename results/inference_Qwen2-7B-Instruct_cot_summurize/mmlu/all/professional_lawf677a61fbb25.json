No, because the defendant may not prove his good character by specific instances of good conduct.\nC.

Yes, because, by accusing the defendant of being a thief, the prosecution has put his character in issue.\n\nIn a criminal trial, the defendant has the right to present evidence that tends to show he is not guilty of the crime charged. This includes evidence of good character or lack of propensity to commit the crime. However, this rule is subject to certain limitations. One such limitation is that the defendant cannot introduce evidence of specific instances of past criminal behavior to prove his innocence. \n\nIn this case, the prosecution has accused the defendant of theft. As a result, the defendant can introduce evidence that goes to his character and reputation to argue that he is not the type of person who would commit theft. The testimony that the defendant turned down opportunities for black marketeering could be relevant to suggest that the defendant does not have a propensity for criminal activity, which is pertinent to the charge of theft. Therefore, under these circumstances, the witness's testimony is likely to be admissible."
