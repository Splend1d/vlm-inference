This scenario describes a form of price leadership, which can occur in an oligopoly where one firm sets the price and others follow, but it doesn't capture the essence of all oligopolistic behavior.\n\nB. This option suggests a situation where firms collude on price increases but not on decreases. While collusion is illegal in many jurisdictions, some oligopolies may engage in tacit agreements, this does not necessarily define an oligopoly.\n\nC. This is a characteristic of oligopoly. When firms fail to match both price increases and decreases by rivals, it often indicates that they are interdependent and consider the reactions of their competitors when making pricing decisions. This behavior reflects the strategic nature of oligopolistic markets.\n\nD. This statement describes a competitive market rather than an oligopoly. In an oligopoly, firms' decisions are influenced by the actions of their competitors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
