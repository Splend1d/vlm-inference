However, the development of larger brains occurred gradually over millions of years, coinciding with the use of stone tools. The first known stone tools, called Oldowan tools, date back approximately 2.6 million years ago, suggesting that the development of these tools was concurrent with the gradual increase in brain size. Therefore, options A, B, and C do not accurately describe the evolution of hominids after 400,000 years ago."
