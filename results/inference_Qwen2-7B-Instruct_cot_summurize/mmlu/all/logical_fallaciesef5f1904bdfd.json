Complex question.\n\nWhen a proposition includes more than one claim, it can lead to a complex question fallacy if the question or statement presented requires someone to choose between two options that seem mutually exclusive but actually are not. This fallacy occurs when someone tries to force a choice between two options without providing enough information to support the dichotomy. For example:\n\n\"Is it better for you to work from home or travel around the world? If you say yes to one, I assume you're saying no to the other.\"\n\nThis type of argument presents a false dilemma by implying that one cannot do both, when in reality, there might be ways to combine both activities or achieve a balance between them."
