They depict various straight lines, geometric shapes, and figures of animals, plants, and mythological creatures. It is widely believed that these lines served as part of religious or ceremonial purposes, possibly related to astronomical events, and were visible from the air.\n\nAs for options A, B, and D:\n\nA. There is no evidence to suggest that the Nazca lines were entrances to subterranean tombs. The structures are more likely to have had spiritual or religious significance rather than practical use.\n\nB. While some of the larger lines might resemble the layout of cities or towns, there is no concrete evidence linking them directly to urban planning. Instead, they seem to be more aligned with natural phenomena or religious practices.\n\nD. The idea that the Nazca lines were landing strips for spaceships is a popular theory among conspiracy theorists but is not supported by mainstream archaeology or scientific research. There is no archaeological or historical evidence to support this notion."
