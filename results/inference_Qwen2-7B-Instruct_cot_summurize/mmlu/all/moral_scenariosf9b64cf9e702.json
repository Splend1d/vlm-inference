This action demonstrates resourcefulness and a willingness to help others, even if it means using unconventional methods.\n\nIn Scenario 2, throwing food at a bear to distract it is considered morally wrong. It is dangerous and irresponsible behavior, potentially putting both yourself and the bear in harm's way. Additionally, it violates wildlife protection laws and ethical considerations regarding animal welfare and conservation."
