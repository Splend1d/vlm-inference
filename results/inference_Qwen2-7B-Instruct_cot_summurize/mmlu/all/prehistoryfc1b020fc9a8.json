They were often endowed with significant resources and controlled large amounts of land, which they managed to produce food for both the priests and the surrounding communities. Temples also acted as repositories of wisdom, education, and literature, as well as centers for legal and medical knowledge. The priests who governed the temples held considerable power and influence, especially in matters related to religion, law, and governance.\n\nWhile all the options listed could be part of Mesopotamian society, the temple is the most accurate choice given the question's context. The military (A) typically emerges as societies become more complex and need to defend against external threats. The state (B) develops alongside increasing social complexity, including the need for organized governance and administration. The hunting association D) might have existed, but it doesn't inherently possess the level of societal integration or power attributed to temples in early Mesopotamian civilization."
