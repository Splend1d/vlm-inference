This means that as long as either `num1` is greater than `num2` or `num1` is greater than `num3`, the loop will continue to execute.\n\nFor the body of the loop to never be executed, we need to ensure that both conditions within the `||` operator are false simultaneously. This can be achieved by setting `num1` to be less than both `num2` and `num3`. Therefore, the condition `num1 < num2 && num1 < num3` ensures that the loop's condition will never evaluate to true, and hence the body of the loop will never be executed."
