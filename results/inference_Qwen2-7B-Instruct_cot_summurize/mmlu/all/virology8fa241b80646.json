Long-term survivors\n\nLong-term survivors (LTS) of HIV infection refer to individuals who have been infected with HIV for many years without progressing to AIDS, despite having detectable HIV viral loads and reduced CD4+ T cell counts over time. The study of LTS can provide insights into the natural history of HIV/AIDS, including how the virus behaves in the body over long periods and how the immune system responds to it. This information is invaluable for understanding the disease progression and developing strategies for treatment and prevention."
