However, it's important to note that while resolution can always produce a proof if one exists, the length of such a proof might not be polynomial in the size of the input formula, especially in worst-case scenarios. Therefore, while resolution is a complete proof system in the sense that it can find a proof for every unsatisfiable formula, it may not necessarily provide succinct proofs (III), as this property does not universally hold for all unsatisfiable formulas."
