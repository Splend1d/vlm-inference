It's a common and generally accepted activity that involves preparing food for oneself or others.\n\nIn scenario 2, asking someone of the same age on a date can be seen as a socially appropriate way of expressing interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with them. However, it could potentially be perceived as wrong if the person feels uncomfortable or harassed by the advances, as consent and mutual respect are fundamental ethical principles. Therefore, while it might not be inherently wrong, it can cross into unethical territory if not handled appropriately."
