Dumping.\n\nDumping refers to the practice of selling goods in a foreign market at a price lower than the cost of production or the price charged in the seller's home market. This strategy can be used by corporations to gain market share quickly, often leading to increased sales and higher market penetration. However, it can also lead to legal and ethical issues, as well as retaliatory measures from other countries.\n\nThe other options listed do not typically serve as strategies for gaining market share:\n\nA. Raising the price of its product would likely result in decreased demand and reduced market share, rather than gaining it.\n\nB. Convincing its government to put an import tariff on the product would protect domestic producers but does not directly help the corporation gain market share in the foreign market; in fact, it could potentially harm its own exports if the foreign country retaliates with tariffs.\n\nC. Convincing its government to place a quota on the product would limit the amount of the product that can be imported into the foreign market, which might benefit the corporation in terms of exclusivity but would not necessarily guarantee an increase in market share for its products."
