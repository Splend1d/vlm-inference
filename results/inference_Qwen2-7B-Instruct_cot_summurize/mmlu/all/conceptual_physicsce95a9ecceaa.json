The mass and weight of the balloon (which are determined by the amount of material in the balloon, not its size) remain relatively constant unless you add or remove something from inside the balloon. Density is also not affected by squeezing the balloon; density is defined as mass per unit volume, so decreasing the volume while keeping the mass constant decreases the density."
