                    "text": "The correct answer is A. T1, unlike T2, is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions.\n\nT1 (or longitudinal relaxation time) refers to the time it takes for a magnetized nuclear spin to return to equilibrium after being disturbed by a pulse of energy. It is more influenced by the interactions between nuclear spins and their environment at lower frequencies, which can lead to longer T1 times.\n\nOn the other hand, T2 (or transverse relaxation time) is related to the decay of the transverse magnetization of a nucleus due to interactions with its environment at higher frequencies, typically associated with dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. These interactions tend to be more significant at higher frequencies, making T2 more sensitive to these types of molecular motions.\n\nTherefore, because T1 is more sensitive to slower, lower-frequency molecular motions, it can indeed be longer than T2, especially in environments where such motions dominate."
