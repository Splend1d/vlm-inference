She has no history of major medical illness. Musculoskeletal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. When told that her examination is normal, the patient becomes tearful and demands an MRI of her back because her mother just died from breast cancer metastatic to bone and she fears that she may also have cancer. The patient already contacted her insurance company, who told her that if she has neurologic abnormalities an MRI may be covered by her plan. The patient asks the physician to order the MRI indicating that she has neurologic findings. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?\n\nA. Advise the patient to change insurance companies as soon as she is able so that she can receive more comprehensive medical care\nB. Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings\nC.

Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings.\n\nThe most appropriate initial action for the physician in this scenario is to clarify the situation with the patient. It's important to reassure her that based on the current examination, there are no indications of neurological abnormalities or other concerning issues. Misrepresenting examination findings could lead to unnecessary testing and potential harm due to exposure to radiation from the MRI. Additionally, discussing the patient's concerns about her family history and fears about cancer can help address her anxiety and provide support without compromising medical integrity."
