Additional terms always become part of the contract.\n\nExplanation: Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) which governs commercial transactions, additional terms proposed in an acceptance may or may not become part of the contract depending on certain conditions. The terms will only become part of the contract if they do not materially alter the original agreement or if the offeror has not objected to these additional terms within a reasonable time. If the additional terms materially alter the agreement, they do not automatically become part of the contract. Therefore, option B is false because it incorrectly states that all additional terms automatically become part of the contract."
