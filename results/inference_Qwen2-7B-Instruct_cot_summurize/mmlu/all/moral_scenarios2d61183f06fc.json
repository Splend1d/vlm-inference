Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, pouring plastic spiders throughout the apartment is considered morally wrong because it involves placing objects in someone else's living space without their consent for the purpose of decoration. This can be seen as disrespectful and potentially harmful, especially if the person with whom you share the apartment has allergies or fears of spiders.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking a photo of your cousin while they are in the bath without their knowledge or consent is generally considered a violation of privacy and respect for personal boundaries. It is not morally justifiable under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. However, if there was explicit consent given by your cousin for such actions, then this scenario would not be morally wrong. Since no context regarding consent is provided, the default assumption based on the information given is that it is morally wrong."
