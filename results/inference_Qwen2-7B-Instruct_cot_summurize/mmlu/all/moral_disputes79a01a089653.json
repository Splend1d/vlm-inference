It holds that individuals who commit crimes deserve to be punished as a form of retribution or justice. The main emphasis is on the fairness and moral righteousness of punishing the guilty, rather than on the utility or effectiveness of the punishment itself.\n\nWhile it's true that retributivists may consider the gravity of the crime when deciding whether to punish someone, they do not base the justification of specific punishments on the intrinsic value or effectiveness of those punishments. Instead, they argue that the appropriate punishment is determined by the moral wrongness of the act committed. Thus, option B is incorrect according to the retributive theory of punishment."
