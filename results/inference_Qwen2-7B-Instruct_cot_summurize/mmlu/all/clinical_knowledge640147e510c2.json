This process occurs primarily during intense or prolonged physical activity when the body needs energy faster than it can deliver oxygen to the muscles through the blood. As a result, the pH of the muscle environment decreases due to the accumulation of hydrogen ions (H+), which can disrupt cellular function if not managed. To counteract this, the body converts some of the lactic acid into lactate, which can then be transported to the liver and converted back into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis, helping to restore the muscle's pH balance and maintain energy homeostasis."
