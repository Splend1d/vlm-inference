When a photon with this energy strikes an electron at rest and creates an electron-positron pair, the total energy of the system before the interaction must equal the total energy after the interaction.\n\nBefore the interaction, the energy is just that of the photon, which we can express as:\n\\[ E_{\\text{photon}} = h\\nu \\]\n\nAfter the interaction, the energy is distributed among the two new particles (an electron and a positron. Given that the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon, their kinetic energies are equal. Let's denote the speed of each particle as \\(v\\), so the total momentum of the system after the interaction is zero ( because the photon is annihilated.\n\nThe total energy of the system after the interaction can be expressed as the sum of the rest masses of the electron and positron plus their kinetic energies:\n\\[ E_{\\text{after}} = m + mv^2/2 + mo + mo + mv^2/2 \\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the electron ( and positron, and \\(o\\) represents their rest mass energy, \\(mc^2\\). Since \\(m = o\\), we have:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{after}} = 2mc^2 + mv^2/2 + mv^2/2 \\]\n\nBut since \\(v^2\\) is non-zero only when considering the kinetic energy in the context of relativistic motion, for simplicity and given the problem setup, we're looking for the total energy without delving into the complexities of relativistic velocities in this context. Thus, we can consider the total energy after the interaction to be essentially \\(2mc^2 + 0\\) ( because the kinetic energy terms are negligible compared to the rest mass energy terms when considering the total energy of the system.\n\nGiven that the total energy of the system before and after the interaction should be conserved ( and assuming the conservation of energy in this simplified context (:\n\n\\[ h\\nu = 2mc^2 \\]\n\nSo the energy of the photon was equivalent to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{photon}} = 2mc^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 2mc^2**."
