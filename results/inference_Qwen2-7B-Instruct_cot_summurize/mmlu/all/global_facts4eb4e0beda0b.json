This means that none of the options A, B, C, or D directly match this figure exactly. However, if we had to choose the closest one, option C (51% would be the furthest from the actual data, and option A, 11%, would be significantly lower. Therefore, without a precise answer among the provided choices, it's best to note that the correct percentage as per the latest available data is closer to 44%, not listed in your options."
