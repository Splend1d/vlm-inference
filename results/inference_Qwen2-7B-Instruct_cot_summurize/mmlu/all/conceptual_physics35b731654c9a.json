An electric field can accelerate an electron if it is directed in the same direction as the electron's motion. When an electron moves through an electric field, it experiences a force that acts along its direction of motion, causing it to accelerate.\n\nB. a magnetic field: This is incorrect. A magnetic field does not directly accelerate an electron or any charged particle; instead, it causes the particle to move in a circular path due to the Lorentz force acting on it. The force is perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field, resulting in a curved trajectory rather than acceleration along the direction of motion.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **A. an electric field**."
