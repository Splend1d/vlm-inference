ALL of the above\n\nThere are several reasons why there is often uncertainty regarding which states possess nuclear weapons:\n\n1. **Leaders have incentives to lie**: This is because possessing nuclear weapons can provide a state with significant strategic advantages and influence on the international stage. By concealinging this information, a leader may deter potential adversaries from taking actions that could lead to conflict or retaliation.\n\n2. **If leaders revealed their programs, they would be more likely to be attacked**: Nations with nuclear capabilities might be targeted by other states or non-state actors who seek to disrupt or destroy these assets. Revealinging such capabilities could make them a more attractive target for preemptive strikes or sabotage.\n\n3. **Leaders will not always grant foreign monitors access to their nuclear programs**: International treaties and agreements often require states with nuclear capabilities to allow inspections and monitoring by international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency ( (IAa). However, some leaders may be reluctant to grant full access due to concerns about security, sovereignty, or the potential for intelligence leaks.\n\nThese factors combined contribute to the complexity and uncertainty in determining which states have nuclear weapons, and why this information remains a closely guarded secret for many nations."
