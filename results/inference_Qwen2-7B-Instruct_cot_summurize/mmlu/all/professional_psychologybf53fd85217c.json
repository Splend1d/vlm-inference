High LPC ( or \"task-oriented\" leaders are more effective when the situation is moderately favorable, meaning there is a good balance between task structure and leader-member relations. In such situations, high LPC leaders can effectively push for task completion without causing dissatisfaction among their team members. On the other hand, in highly favorable or unfavorable situations, the model suggests that low LPC leaders ( who focus more on maintaining good relationships with their team members - might be more effective."
