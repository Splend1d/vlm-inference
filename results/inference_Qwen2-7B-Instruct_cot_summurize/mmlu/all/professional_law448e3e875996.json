In light of the defendant's lengthy juvenile criminal history, which included violent offenses, and the fact that armed robbery is a crime of violence, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Did the life-without-parole sentence violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment?\n\nA. No, because a juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole if release would pose a danger to the community.\nB. No, because the Eighth Amendment does not apply outside the context of capital punishment.\nC. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\nD. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for an adult or juvenile defendant convicted of a nonviolent offense.\n"

Simmons ( 543 U.S. 551 ( (2005) and Graham v. Florida, 566 U.S. 438 ( (2009), the United States Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment prohibits states from imposing a life sentence without the possibility of parole on a juvenile offender who did not commit a homicide. However, the Court has also recognized that juveniles are less culpable than adults and have a greater potential for rehabilitation. Therefore, it allows life sentences without parole for juvenile offenders who commit crimes that do not involve the use or threat of violence or do not result in serious bodily injury or death. \n\nGiven that the defendant in this scenario committed an armed robbery, a crime of violence, and considering his juvenile criminal history which includes violent offenses, the life-without-parole sentence could potentially be justified under the legal precedent established by the Supreme Court, especially if there is evidence that suggests the risk of harm to the community upon his release. Thus, option A is the most appropriate choice based on current legal understanding."
