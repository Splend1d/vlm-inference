Then,\n\n\\[B - 2I = Q^{-1}AQ\\]\n\nThus, \\(A - 2I\\) and \\(B - 2I\\) are indeed similar matrices, as we've found a matrix \\(Q\\) such that \\(B - 2I = Q^{-1}AQ\\). **Statement I is true.**\n\n**II. \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same trace.**\n\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements, and it has the property of being invariant under similarity transformations. That is,\n\n\\[\\text{tr}(B) = \\text{tr}(P^{-1}AP) = \\text{tr}(A)\\]\n\nbecause the trace is cyclic and the trace of a product of matrices is invariant under cyclic permutations. Thus, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are similar, they must have the same trace. **Statement II is true.**\n\n**III. \\(A^{-1}\\) and \\(B^{-1}\\) are similar matrices.**\n\nUsing the fact that \\(B = P^{-1}AP\\), we can find the inverse of \\(B\\) by considering the properties of matrix inverses:\n\n\\[B^{-1} = ( (P^{-1}AP)^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}(P^{-1})^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}P\\]\n\nThis shows that \\(A^{-1}\\) and \\(B^{-1}\\) are similar matrices with the similarity transformation given by \\(P\\). **Statement III is true.**\n\nTherefore, all three statements I, II, and III are true. The correct answer is **D. I, II, and III**."
