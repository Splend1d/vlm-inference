Pheochromocytomas are able to produce high levels of catecholamines ( epinephrine ( and norepinephrine, leading to episodic hypertension. These catecholamines can also be metabolized into vanillylmandelic acid ( (VMA) which can be detected in the urine. Therefore, measurement of VMA levels in the urine would be most helpful in establishing the diagnosis in this case. \n\nThe other options listed do not typically have a direct association with pheochromocytoma or its symptoms:\n\n- A. Cortisol: While cortisol is produced by the adrenal gland, it is not elevated in pheochromocytoma.\n- B. Glucose: Glucose levels are not directly related to pheochromocytoma or its symptoms.\n- C. Sodium: Sodium levels are not typically associated with pheochromocytoma or its symptoms."
