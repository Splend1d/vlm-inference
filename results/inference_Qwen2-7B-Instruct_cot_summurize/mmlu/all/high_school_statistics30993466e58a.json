Change from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups would not necessarily increase the power of the test. The power of a test is influenced by several factors including effect size, sample size, and variability within groups. Changing group sizes can affect the precision of estimating the difference between means, but it doesn't directly impact the power unless it also changes the effect size or reduces variability.\n\nB. Change from a 5% significance level to a 1% significance level would not increase the power of the test. In fact, it would decrease the power because a lower significance level makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis, thus reducing the likelihood of detecting a true effect if one exists.\n\nC. Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response does indeed increase the power of the test. Reducing variability within groups allows for a clearer distinction between the means of the groups, making it easier to detect a true difference if one exists. This is because the standard error of the mean decreases as the variability within each group decreases, which increases the test's sensitivity to detect differences.\n\nD. Increasing the sample size would not reduce the probability of a Type I error. A Type I error occurs when we incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis. The probability of a Type I error is determined by the chosen significance level (\u03b1. Increasing the sample size can make the test more powerful ( i.e., more likely to correctly reject a false null hypothesis, but it does not change the probability of a Type I error, which is fixed by the \u03b1 level set before conducting the test."
