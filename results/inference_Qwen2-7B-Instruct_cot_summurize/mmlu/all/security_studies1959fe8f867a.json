All of these options.\n\nLet's delve into each option to understand why they all contribute to the emergence of environmental security during the 1960s and 1970s:\n\nA. **From the 1970s, a number of scholars attempted to critique orthodox security discourse and practices, highlighting their inability to manage environmental risks to national and international security.** This period saw the rise of critical security studies, which expanded the traditional focus on military threats to include environmental issues. Scholars began to argue that conventional security paradigms were insufficient for addressing global challenges like pollution, resource depletion, and climate change. This critique was instrumental in broadening the concept of security beyond state-centric military threats to include environmental concerns.\n\nB. **There became a growing recognition that environmental changes do not merely pose risks to ecosystems - they also pose risks to human well-being.** This realization was crucial as it shifted the understanding of environmental issues from being solely ecological to having direct impacts on human societies. It acknowledged that environmental degradation could lead to health crises, displacement, economic instability, and conflicts over resources. This shift in perspective was foundational in linking environmental sustainability with broader security concerns.\n\nC. **A shared environmental consciousness emerged in develop countries.** This refers to the growing awareness among citizens in developing countries about environmental issues and their potential impacts on local communities. This consciousness often led to demands for action on environmental protection and sustainable development, influencing national policies and international agreements. It contributed to the global environmental movement and the recognition of environmental justice as a part of security concerns.\n\nTogether, these developments collectively contributed to the emergence of environmental security, emphasizing the interconnectedness of environmental health, societal stability, and national and international security."
