Increased use of fertilizers\n\nThe Green Revolution in the 1960s was characterized by a significant shift towards the use of high-yield, hybrid plant varieties and the increased use of inputs like fertilizers and pesticides to boost agricultural productivity.

Mechanization and pesticide usage also increased during this time, but these were not as directly tied to the Green Revolution's technological advancements as the widespread adoption of fertilizers was."
