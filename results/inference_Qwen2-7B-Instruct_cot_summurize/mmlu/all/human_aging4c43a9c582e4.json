As people grow older, their priorities, goals, and worries tend to shift. For example, younger adults might focus on career development and building relationships, while older adults might be more concerned with health maintenance, retirement planning, and intergenerational relationships. This shift in focus is not typically seen with traits ( which tend to remain relatively stable over time, coping strategies which can evolve but don't necessarily align with age, or identity, which is a more complex construct that can change significantly but is not solely defined by age."
