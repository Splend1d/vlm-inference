When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters gases and particles in the air. These particles scatter the sunlight in all directions. The key point is that shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red).\n\nThis is why the sky appears blue during the day - the blue light from the sun is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the Earth's atmosphere. This scattered light reaches our eyes from many different directions, giving the sky its blue color. \n\nRed light, on the other hand, gets scattered less efficiently and travels relatively straighter distances through the atmosphere. That's why at sunrise and sunset when the light has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere, the sky often appears orange or red as most of the blue light has been scattered away."
