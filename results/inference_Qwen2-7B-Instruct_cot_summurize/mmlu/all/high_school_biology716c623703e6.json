It requires relatively high parental care of offspring.\n\nThis is because the species in question has a single offspring that likely requires significant attention, resources, and protection from predators or environmental hazards to survive. The fact that it has a relatively long life span for its body size suggests that the offspring needs a considerable amount of care over a prolonged period. This type of reproductive strategy is often seen in species where the survival of each individual offspring is critical due to low birth rates or harsh environments."
