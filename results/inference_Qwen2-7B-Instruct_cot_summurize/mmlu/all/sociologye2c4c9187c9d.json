                    "text": "Chodorow's theory in \"The Reproduction of Mothering: Psychoanalysis and the Sociology of Gender\" ( (1978) posits that gender socialization occurs through attachment to primary caregivers. The key idea is that children, regardless of gender, are initially attached to both parents. However, the theory diverges in how it suggests this attachment affects development based on gender.\n\nFor boys, Chodorow argues they are more likely to maintain an attachment to their mothers than their fathers, leading to a sense of \"feminine identification.\" This can result in boys feeling conflicted about their masculinity as they grow older and encounter societal expectations to disengage from their mothers and identify with their fathers.\n\nFor girls, the theory suggests they might feel pressured to disengage from their mothers at some point in development, leading them to identify more strongly with their fathers. This can sometimes create feelings of inadequacy or failure when trying to meet the expectations for femininity.\n\nSo, the correct answer aligning with Chodorow's argument would be a nuanced combination of options presented here, though not exactly matching any of the provided choices directly:\n\n- Boys are more likely to maintain an attachment to their mothers.\n- Girls may feel pressure to disengage from their mothers.\n\nIt's important to note that Chodorow's theory is one perspective among many in the field of gender studies, and it has been subject to criticism and further elaboration by other scholars."
