It opens the door to authoritarianism. \n\nExplanation: \nRonald Dworkin's theory of law as integrity emphasizes the idea that judges should interpret laws in a way that maintains consistency with the overall principles and values of the legal system. This approach is likely to lead to more individual rights and greater liberty, as it encourages judges to interpret laws in a way that alignss with democratic values and principles such as fairness, equality, and human dignity. It also improves the moral justification for the exercise of political power by grounding it in the principles and values of the legal system. However, it is less likely to open the door to authoritarianism because the focus on integrity and consistency with established principles makes it harder for any single individual or group to impose their own arbitrary rules or interpretations on the legal system."
