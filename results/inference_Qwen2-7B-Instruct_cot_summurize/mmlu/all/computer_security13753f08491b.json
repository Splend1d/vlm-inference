This is because they have access to the internal structure and flow of the program, allowing them to understand how different parts of the code interact with each other. This understanding enables whitebox fuzzers to systematically test every path through the code, aiming to cover all lines.\n\nIn contrast, generational fuzzers ( (A) typically generate inputs based on grammar rules but do not necessarily explore all paths. Blackbox fuzzers ( (B) don't have any knowledge about the internal structure of the program and generate random inputs, which might not cover all lines of code. Mutation-based fuzzers ( (D) create new inputs by modifying existing valid inputs, which also does not guarantee that all lines of code will be covered, especially if the original inputs did not trigger all possible paths."
