Viral campaigns.\n\nViral campaigns involve spreading a message, idea, or behavior rapidly and widely through social networks and other forms of peer-to-peer communication. These campaigns often leverage the power of sharing and recommendation from one person to another, aiming to create a viral effect where the content spreads quickly and reaches a large audience. This technique can be used for various purposes, including promoting products, services, or issues, and it relies heavily on online platforms and digital word-of-mouth marketing."
