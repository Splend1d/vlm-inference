The hospital negligently misidentified the husband's body and sent it to be cremated. When she was informed of the hospital's mistake, the widow suffered serious emotional distress. She has sued the hospital. Is the hospital likely to be held liable to the widow?\n\nA. No, because the widow did not witness the cremation.\nB. No, because the widow was never in any danger of bodily harm.\nC. Yes, because hospitals are strictly liable if they do not properly dispose of corpses.\nD. Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress.\n\nIn this scenario, the hospital's negligence led to the misidentification and cremation of the widow's husband's body, causing her significant emotional distress. Hospitals have a duty to handle deceased patients with care and respect, including proper identification and disposition of the body. The fact that the hospital failed to meet this standard of care and caused the widow distress is grounds for liability. The emotional impact on the widow due to the loss of her husband in such a manner would likely be considered when determining damages in this case."
