The work done by the constant force on the box equals the change in kinetic energy of the box.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy ( \\(K_i\\) of the box is given by:\n\\[K_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2\\]\nwhere \\(m = 10 \\, \\text{kg}\\) and \\(v_i = 1 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\n\nSo,\n\\[K_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 1^2 = 5 \\, \\text{J}\\]\n\nThe final kinetic energy \\(K_f\\) of the box is given by:\n\\[K_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2\\]\nwhere \\(v_f = 2 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\n\nSo,\n\\[K_f = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 2^2 = 20 \\, \\text{J}\\]\n\nThe change in kinetic energy \\(\\Delta K\\) is:\n\\[\\Delta K = K_f - K_i = 20 - 5 = 15 \\, \\text{J}\\]\n\nThe work done by the constant force is equal to the change in kinetic energy, so we have:\n\\[W = \\Delta K = 15 \\, \\text{J}\\]\n\nThe work done by a constant force is also given by:\n\\[W = Fd\\]\nwhere \\(F \\) is the force and \\( d \\) is the distance over which the force is applied.\n\nGiven that the box travels 5 meters under the influence of the force, we can substitute the known values into the equation:\n\\[15 = F \\times 5\\]\n\nS o, solving for \\( F \\):\n\\[F = \\frac{15}{5} = 3 \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which corresponds to option C."
