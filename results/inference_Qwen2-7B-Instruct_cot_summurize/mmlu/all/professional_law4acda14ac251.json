The car swerved out of control, jumped the curb, and crashed into a home. The defendant was arrested and charged with the separate crimes of larceny and malicious destruction of property. During the trial the judge instructed the jury that the theft of the car was sufficient evidence to satisfS' the malice requirement for the malicious destruction of property charge. The defendant's attorney has filed a motion objecting to the judge's jury instruction. The judge's instruction was\n\nA. correct, because malice can be inferred from the intent to steal.\nB. correct, because malicious destruction of property is a general intent crime.\nC. incorrect, because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property.\nD. incorrect, because malice requires a showing of recklessness.\n"

The judge's instruction was incorrect because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property.\n\nLarceny involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. Malicious destruction of property, on the other hand, involves willfully and maliciously damaging or destroying another person's property without their consent.\n\nWhile the commission of larceny might indicate a certain level of intent or recklessness, it does not necessarily imply the specific mental state (malice aforethought) required for malicious destruction of property. Malice in this context refers to a deliberate intention to cause harm or damage, which must be proven separately. Therefore, the theft of the car does not automatically satisfy the malice requirement for the malicious destruction of property charge. The jury should be instructed to consider whether the defendant had the requisite malice, independent of the act of stealing the car."
