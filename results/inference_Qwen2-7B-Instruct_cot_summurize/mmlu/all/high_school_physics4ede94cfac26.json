                    "text": "D. A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path.\n\nExplanation:\nIn uniform circular motion, an object moves along a circular path at a constant speed. This motion requires a centripetal force that acts towards the center of the circle. The centripetal force is responsible for changing the direction of the object's velocity vector (it does not change the speed, which remains constant.\n\nA. The statement \"The centrifugal force is the action-reaction pair of the centripetal force\" is incorrect. Centrifugal force is a fictitious force felt by an object moving in a circular path. It is not an actual force but rather a consequence of how objects perceive forces when they are accelerating tangentially to their path. There is no direct action-reaction pair for it because it doesn't represent a real force in Newton's laws of motion.\n\nB. The statement \"The centripetal acceleration and velocity point in the same direction\" is incorrect. Centripetal acceleration is always directed towards the center of the circular path, while the velocity vector is tangent to the path. They are perpendicular to each other.\n\nC. The statement \"The velocity of the object in motion changes whereas the acceleration of the object is constant\" is incorrect. While the speed (the magnitude of the velocity) may be constant, the velocity itself changes because it has a direction component that continually changes as the object moves around the circle.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct: A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is indeed \"falling\" towards the center in a circular path due to the centripetal force required to maintain this circular motion."
