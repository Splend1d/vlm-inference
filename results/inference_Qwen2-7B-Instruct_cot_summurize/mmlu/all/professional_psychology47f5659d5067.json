Gestalt therapists believe that transference, which involves clients unconsciously attributing feelings and attitudes towards significant people in their lives onto the therapist, can provide valuable insights into the client's internal dynamics. By interpreting these transferences, the therapist helps the client become more aware of their own patterns of relating to others and can facilitate personal growth.\n\nIt's important to note that options A, B, and C are not generally how transference is handled in Gestalt therapy:\n\n- A. Transference is not usually seen as created \"ab a fantasy of the client.\" Gestalt therapists focus on what is happening in the present session between the client and therapist rather than attributing it to imagined scenarios.\n  \n- B. While transference can sometimes be an indicator of therapeutic progress, it is not inherently a sign that therapy is progressing favorably. Instead, it is a dynamic that is explored and understood within the context of the therapy process.\n\n- C. Dream work might be used as one tool among many in Gestalt therapy to help clients understand their unconscious thoughts and feelings. However, the primary focus when dealing with transference is through direct interaction and dialogue between the client and therapist during sessions."
