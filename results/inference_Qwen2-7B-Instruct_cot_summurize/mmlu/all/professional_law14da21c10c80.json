The minor paid $2000 down and agreed to pay the remaining $4000 in installments over the next two years. The minor had to have the car for work because he had no other means of support. The minor later crashed the car in an accident. He disaffirmed the contract, returned the damaged car, and demanded his down payment back. Does the seller have a right to obtain any consideration in this matter?\n\nA. No the seller must return the down payment because the minor has declared his disaffirmance of the contract.\nB. The seller cannot keep the down payment and cannot obtain any other benefit from the transaction.\nC. The seller can sue the minor for misrepresentation and fraud in not revealing his age prior to buying the car.\nD. The seller can obtain only the reasonable value of the use of the car in a restitution action.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The seller can obtain only the reasonable value of the use of the car in a restitution action.\n\nWhen a minor disaffirms a contract, they are entitled to recover any payments made under the contract. However, the seller may still be able to seek compensation for the use of the car through a restitution claim. This would involve proving that the minor used the car and that the seller incurred costs or suffered damages as a result of that use. The seller would then be entitled to recover the reasonable value of that use from the minor.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the minor's disaffirmance does not automatically entitle them to a full refund of all payments made under the contract. Option C is also incorrect because the seller cannot sue the minor for misrepresentation or fraud regarding their age, as minors are generally not held liable for fraudulent misrepresentations made by themselves."
