                    "text": "To find the solution to the given differential equation, we first need to rewrite it in a more recognizable form. The given differential equation is:\n\n\\[ x \\frac{dy}{dx} + y - xe^x = 0 \\]\n\nRearranging this equation to separate variables gives us:\n\n\\[ x \\frac{dy}{dx} = xe^x - y \\]\n\n\\[ x \\frac{dy}{dx} + y = xe^x \\]\n\nDividing by \\(x\\) (assuming \\(x \\neq 0\\), since at \\(x=0\\), the original equation does not apply due to division by zero) gives us:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} + \\frac{y}{x} = e^x \\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor \\(\\mu(x)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\mu(x) = e^{\\int \\frac{1}{x} dx} = e^{\\ln|x|} = |x| \\]\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a differential equation and considering the domain where \\(x\\) could be negative or positive, for simplicity, we'll consider \\(x > 0\\) as part of our solution process, leading to:\n\n\\[ \\mu(x) = x \\]\n\nMultiplying the entire differential equation by \\(x\\) gives:\n\n\\[ x \\frac{dy}{dx} + y = xe^x \\]\n\nThis is now in the form:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx}(xy) = xe^x \\]\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to \\(x\\) yields:\n\n\\[ xy = \\int xe^x dx \\]\n\nTo integrate \\(xe^x\\), we can use integration by parts, setting \\(u = x\\) and \\(dv = e^x dx\\), which gives \\(du = dx\\) and \\(v = e^x\\). Thus,\n\n\\[ \\int xe^x dx = xe^x - \\int e^x dx = xe^x - e^x + C \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ xy = xe^x - e^x + C \\]\n\nSolving for \\(y\\) gives:\n\n\\[ y = e^x - \\frac{e^x}{x} + \\frac{C}{x} \\]\n\nUsing the initial condition \\(y = 0\\) when \\(x = 1\\), we find \\(C\\):\n\n\\[ 0 = e^1 - \\frac{e^1}{1} + \\frac{C}{1} \\]\n\n\\[ C = -e \\]\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n\\[ y = e^x - \\frac{e^x}{x} - \\frac{e}{x} \\]\n\nTo find \\(f(2)\\), we substitute \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[ f(2) = e^2 - \\frac{e^2}{2} - \\frac{e}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ f(2) = \\frac{2e^2 - e^2 - e}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ f(2) = \\frac{e^2 - e}{2} \\]\n\nThis expression doesn't directly match any of the provided options, but it's close to option A: \\(1/(2e)\\), which seems to be a misinterpretation or typo in the options provided based on the calculations. The correct answer should be closer to the derived expression, which simplifies further to:\n\n\\[ f(2) = \\frac{e^2 - e}{2} \\]\n\nGiven the options, there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation or the formulation of the question. The closest match to the derived solution among the provided options would actually be option C: \\(e^2/2\\), if considering slight variations in the interpretation of the problem or options. However, based on the exact derivation, none of the options perfectly matches the calculated result. It should be noted that the precise answer derived does not exactly align with the provided options, indicating a potential discrepancy in the question's setup or the options given."
