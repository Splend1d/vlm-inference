These eras saw attempts to explain racial differences using naturalistic terms, often leading to what is now recognized as pseudo-scientific racism.\n\n- Genetics: The idea that traits including those related to race could be inherited and studied scientifically.\n- Evolution: The theory that different races evolved separately from a common ancestor, with humans being placed on a spectrum from ape-like ancestors to modern humans.\n- Height: The measurement of average heights across different populations was used as evidence for evolutionary relationships and supposed racial hierarchies.\n- Brain Size: The belief that the size or shape of the brain (or parts of it, such as the cranial cavity or the corpus callosum, could distinguish between races and correlate with intelligence or other characteristics.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that these theories have been discredited by modern scientific understanding and are no longer accepted in academic circles due to their racist underpinnings and lack of empirical support. Today, human beings are classified into a single species, Homo sapiens, without any scientific basis for racial distinctions."
