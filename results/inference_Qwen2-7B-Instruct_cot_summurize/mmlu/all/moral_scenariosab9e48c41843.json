It can be seen as a helpful and considerate action, depending on the context and circumstances.\n\nIn Scenario 2, touching another person without consent can be considered a morally wrong act, especially if it is unwanted or inappropriate, particularly in a setting like Sunday school where trust and safety are paramount. This action could potentially violate the other person's personal boundaries or make them feel uncomfortable or unsafe, which are are serious ethical concerns."
