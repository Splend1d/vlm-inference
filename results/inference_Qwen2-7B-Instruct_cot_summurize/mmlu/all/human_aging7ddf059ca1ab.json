In excess of the average for that particular disorder\n\nExcess disability refers to the level of disability experienced by an individual that is greater than what would typically be expected given their diagnosed condition. This could include not just physical symptoms, but also psychological or cognitive symptoms that go beyond what is usually associated with a specific diagnosis. It does not necessarily imply causation by malignant social psychology ( (option A), nor is it exclusively found in the final stages of Alzheimer's (option C). Also, while some disabilities may be treatable with medical intervention when caught early (option D), the term \"excess disability\" specifically focuses on the severity or extent of disability rather than its treatment or cause."
