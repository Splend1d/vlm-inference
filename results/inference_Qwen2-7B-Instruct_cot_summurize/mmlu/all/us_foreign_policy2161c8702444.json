The correct answer is:\n\nB. They serve American interests\n\nInternational institutions, according to Liberal Internationalists, provide platforms for the US to engage with other nations on issues of mutual concern, promote global stability, and advance American values and economic interests. These institutions can help ensure a rules-based international order, which supports American strategic objectives by maintaining open markets, preventing conflict, and upholding democratic principles."
