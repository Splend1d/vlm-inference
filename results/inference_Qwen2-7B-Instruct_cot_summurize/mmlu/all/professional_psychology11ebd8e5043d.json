A strong, positive relationship with each parent can help mitigate some of the negative effects of divorce on a child. This includes emotional support, guidance, and a sense of stability which can be crucial during such transitional periods. \n\nWhile other factors like the frequency of contact with the non-custodial parent (A, the child's understanding of the divorce reasons, C, and the level of post-divorce conflict between the parents, D, also play roles, the foundational relationship quality typically stands out as a significant predictor of a child's successful adjustment post-divorce."
