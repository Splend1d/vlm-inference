They help alleviate withdrawal symptoms and cravings. When combined with behavioral techniques ( such as counseling, stress management, or support groups, these two methods can work synergistically to improve the chances of quitting successfully. Behavioral techniques help address the psychological aspects of addiction, while the nicotine patch tackles the physical dependence on nicotine. Therefore, using both methods together typically increases the effectiveness of quitting efforts compared to using either method alone."
