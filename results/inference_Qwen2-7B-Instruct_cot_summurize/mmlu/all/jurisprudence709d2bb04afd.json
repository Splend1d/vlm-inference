It reduces feminism to a political movement.\n\nRadical feminists criticize liberal feminism for focusing too much on legal and institutional reforms, which they see as insufficient in addressing the deeper structural issues that perpetuate gender inequality. They argue that this approach overlooks the need to challenge the patriarchal culture and ideology that underpins society. Radical feminists emphasize the importance of recognizing the systemic nature of oppression and the interconnectedness of various forms of discrimination, not just gender-based ones.\n\nA. Treating women as objects: This is more closely associated with objectification theory, which critiques how women are perceived and treated as objects rather than autonomous beings. This concept is not specifically tied to the focus of liberal feminism.\n\nB. Making women into men: This criticism suggests that liberal feminism aims to erase gender differences or assimilate women into male identity, which is not its primary goal. Liberal feminism advocates for equal rights and opportunities for women without negating their gender identity or experiences.\n\nD. Overlooking the historical struggle of women for justice: While this statement touches upon an aspect of radical feminist critique, it does not fully encapsulate the essence of why radical feminists might view liberal feminism's focus as problematic. Instead, it highlights a shared concern about the importance of recognizing the historical context of feminist struggles."
