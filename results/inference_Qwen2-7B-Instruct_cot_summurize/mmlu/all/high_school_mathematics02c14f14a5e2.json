However, since our calculation specifically ends at 2 days past, it's actually two days after Friday, which is **Sunday**.\n\nGiven the provided answer choices, none directly matches the correct answer based on this calculation. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or answer choices provided, as the correct day based on the calculation is **Sunday**, not listed among the options A through D."
