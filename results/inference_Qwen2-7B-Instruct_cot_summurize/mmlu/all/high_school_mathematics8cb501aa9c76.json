Therefore, the answer is not listed among your options (A. 10240, B. 5001, C. 5002, D. 8192. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or an error in the provided options since the correct answer based on the sequence's definition would be a term significantly larger than any of these choices. The closest option to our calculated result is not accurate for this sequence's progression."
