Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nRodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers\nB. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World\nC. The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa\nD.

                    "text": "Rodney's argument focuses on the historical impact of imperialism and the exploitation of Africa by European powers, particularly during the period when European colonial powers began to extensively expand their territories and influence across Africa. This process significantly intensified during the Age of Exploration, roughly from the late 15th century through the early 18th century ( which aligns with the time frame of 1450 to 1750 C.E.\n\nGiven this context, Rodney's analysis is most likely a response to:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers\n\nThis choice directly addresses the historical development during the specified time period where European powers began to extend their exploitation beyond coastal regions into the interiors of Africa, leading to significant economic, social, and political changes that had long-lasting impacts on the continent's development.\n\nThe other options do not fit as well within Rodney's argument:\nB. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World is a result of the transatlantic slave trade, which occurred later, starting in the 16th century but became more prevalent after the abolition of the African slave trade by European powers in the 1800s.\nC. The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa happened gradually over centuries and was influenced by various factors including trade, missions, and the actions of European colonial powers, but it is not the primary focus of Rodney's critique regarding African underdevelopment.\nD. The importation of New World products into Africa refers to trade between Africa and the Americas, which also developed much later than the period Rodney discusses and was not the main driver of African underdevelopment according to his argument."
