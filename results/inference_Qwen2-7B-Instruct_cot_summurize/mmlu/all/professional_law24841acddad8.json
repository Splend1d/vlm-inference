About 200 yards of the man's property bordered along a lake shoreline. A fisherman lived on a stream that flowed along one boundary of the man's land and ran into the lake. When the man acquired ownership of the property, he had a channel dredged across his land from the stream to the lake at a point some distance from the mouth of the stream. The fisherman erroneously believed that the channel was a public waterway. Because the channel served as a convenient shortcut to the lake, the fisherman made frequent trips across the channel in his fishing boat. In no way did the fisherman's use of the channel cause any harm or damage to the man's property. After the man learned about the fisherman's use of the channel, he requested that the fisherman desist further entry onto the waterway. The fisherman, who until that time was unaware of the man's ownership claim, agreed. Nonetheless, the man brought suit against the fisherman to recover damages for trespass. Judgment is likely to be for whom?\n\nA. The fisherman, because when he used the channel he believed that it was a public waterway.\nB. The fisherman, because he caused no damage to the man's land.\nC. The man, but recovery is limited to nominal damages for the fisherman's intentional use of the channel.\nD. The man, because the fisherman should have known that the waterway was not open for public use.\n"

The man, because the fisherman should have known that the waterway was not open for public use.\n\nIn this scenario, the fisherman believed that the channel was a public waterway, which led him to use it freely. However, this belief doesn't negate the fact that the man owned the land where the channel was located. Under property law, an owner has the right to exclude others from their property unless there is a clear indication that the area in question is accessible to the public. Since the fisherman had no prior knowledge of the man's ownership and was using the channel without permission, the man has the legal grounds to sue for trespass.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual outcome could depend on specific local laws and court rulings, as well as any evidence presented in court regarding the clarity of the man's property boundaries and the nature of the fisherman's belief about the status of the channel."
