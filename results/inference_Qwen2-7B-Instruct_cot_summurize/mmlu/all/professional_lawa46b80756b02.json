The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. The validity of this treaty would most likely be upheld under which of the following principles?\n\nA. The presidential power to conduct foreign affairs.\nB. An ancillary power of the President under his treaty-making power.\nC. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.\nD. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by a majority in Congress.\n"

The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the President has the power to negotiate treaties, which is one of the powers granted specifically to the President in Article II, Section 2. However, the Senate has the exclusive power to ratify treaties. This means that any treaty negotiated by the President must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the Senate to become binding on the United States. This process ensures that both the executive and legislative branches have a role in international agreements, promoting checks and balances in foreign policy decisions.\n\nTherefore, the validity of the treaty formed between the President and the leader of the foreign government would most likely be upheld under the principle of the treaty-making power of the President, subject to Senate ratification, as required by the Constitution."
