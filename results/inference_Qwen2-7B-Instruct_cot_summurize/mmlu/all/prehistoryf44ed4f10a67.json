                    "text": "The correct answer is C. An expansion of grasslands and reduction in woodlands, resulting in regional mosaic environments.\n\nDuring the late Miocene ( about 12-5 million years ago), there were significant climatic shifts that led to a drier and warmer world, which promoted the expansion of savanna ecosystems at the expense of tropical forests. This transition from forested to more open landscapes created a mosaic of habitats with patches of forest, grassland, and woodland. \n\nThis environmental change likely had profound impacts on the evolution of hominin ancestors. The shift towards more open landscapes might have influenced the development of traits such as bipedalism, which allowed early hominins to efficiently travel across these expansive plains. It also likely influenced diet and lifestyle, potentially encouraging the foraging of more diverse food sources, including browsing on grasses and other plants found in the new habitat types. \n\nIt's important to note that the exact mechanisms linking environmental change to evolutionary outcomes are complex and multifaceted, involving interactions between climate, landscape, available resources, and genetic predispositions. However, the expansion of grasslands and the contraction of forests during the late Miocene is a well-documented pattern that aligns with our current understanding of how these environmental shifts could have influenced the evolution of our hominin ancestors."
