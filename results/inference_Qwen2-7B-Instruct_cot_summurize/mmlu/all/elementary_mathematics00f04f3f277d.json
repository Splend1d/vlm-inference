This is because these individuals are more likely to be attending the game, and thus their preferences are more relevant to the question at hand. They are directly interested in the outcome of the game and the performance of both teams.\n\nOption A ( surveying the cheerleaders for the home team could be biased since they may have a strong preference for their own team due to their role as supporters.\n\nOption B, surveying people wearing hats for the visiting team might not be representative either, as hat-wearing is not necessarily correlated with team preference or attendance.\n\nOption D, surveying people who do not live in the home team\u2019s city, would likely not provide an accurate representation of the preferences of the attendees, as they might not be as invested in the outcome or familiar with the teams' performances."
