One such finding is an increase in response time. This means that older adults may take longer to process information and respond to stimuli compared to younger individuals. This could be due to various factors, including slower neural processing speeds or difficulties with working memory.\n\nIt's important to note that these changes can vary widely among individuals, and many older adults maintain high levels of cognitive function throughout their lives. Additionally, while some aspects of cognition might decline with age, other abilities such as crystallized intelligence (which includes vocabulary, knowledge, and reasoning skills based on life experience\u2014can actually improve or remain stable."
