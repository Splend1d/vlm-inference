House members may serve on only one committee at a time\n\nThis is the primary reason why House members might be more concerned about their committee assignments than Senators. In the House, members typically serve on a single committee, which means that their ability to influence legislation is closely tied to the policies and priorities of that committee. They have a high degree of specialization within their committee's jurisdiction, making their committee assignment crucial for their legislative work.\n\nIn contrast, Senators can serve on multiple committees, providing them with a broader range of policy expertise and influence over various aspects of legislation. This allows Senators to be more versatile in their legislative efforts and less dependent on a single committee's dynamics for their work."
