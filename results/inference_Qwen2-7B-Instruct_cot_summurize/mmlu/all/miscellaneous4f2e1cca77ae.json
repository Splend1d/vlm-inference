A chain of coastal volcanic mountains\n\nWhen a continental plate collides with an oceanic plate, the denser oceanic plate tends to subduct ( or slide beneath the less dense continental plate into the mantle. This process can lead to the formation of a subduction zone, which often results in the creation of a chain of volcanic mountains as magma rises to fill the gap left by the sinking plate. This is commonly seen along the western coast of South America, for example, where the Nazca Plate is subducting under the South American Plate."
