In the case of birth weight in humans, stabilizing selection would favor an average birth weight, like the commonly cited 3 kg ( by eliminating both very high and very low birth weights. This helps maintain genetic stability within a species.\n\nA. Artificial selection refers to the process where humans intentionally choose certain traits in plants or animals for breeding purposes.\nB. Directional selection favors one extreme end of the trait spectrum over others.\nD. Disruptive selection favors both extremes of a trait range over the middle range, leading to speciation and the creation of distinct subpopulations."
