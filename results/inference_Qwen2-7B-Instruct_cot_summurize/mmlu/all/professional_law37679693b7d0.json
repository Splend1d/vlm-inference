She claimed that the owner had sexually harassed her and then caused her wrongful termination. A jury returned a verdict of $100,000 for the former employee. Two weeks after the court entered judgment on the verdict, the employer filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. Rule 12(b)(6), claiming that it did not have at least 15 employees as required by the definition of an \"employer\" under the civil rights statute. The employer claimed that there was therefore no federal subject-matter jurisdiction. The lower court agreed, dismissed the case and voided the judgment. On appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, will the appellate court likely uphold the lower court's decision?\n\nA. Yes, because a challenge to jurisdiction can be made at any time, even after judgment has been entered, and here the jurisdictional requirement was missing.\nB. Yes, because an appellate court has no authority to reverse a lower court's finding that there was no subject-matter jurisdiction.\nC. No, because a judgment entered on a jury verdict can never be changed or attacked after a judgment is entered.\nD. No, because this is a challenge to the existence of a cause of action, i.e., the failure to state a claim, which does not go to jurisdiction and cannot be raised post-judgment.\n"

Yes, because a challenge to jurisdiction can be made at any time, even after judgment has been entered, and here the jurisdictional requirement was missing.\n\nThe correct answer is A. In the context of federal courts, jurisdictional challenges can indeed be raised at any point, including after a judgment has been entered, if the party making the challenge can show that the court lacked the power to render the judgment due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In this scenario, the employer's argument that it did not meet the statutory definition of an \"employer\" ( requiring at least 15 employees, could potentially demonstrate that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case from the outset. Therefore, the appellate court might uphold the lower court's decision if it agrees with the employer's contention that the court did not have jurisdiction to enter the $100,000 judgment in favor of the former employee."
