It crosses the line into manipulation or neglect if it prevents him from eating properly.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pushing small children on a swing set can be dangerous and is generally considered morally wrong because it puts their safety at risk. It's important to ensure that activities are safe for all participants, especially when it comes to children who may not have the same level of physical control or awareness."
