Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character can be considered morally acceptable according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- In Scenario 1, feeding your cat one small bowl of food each day: This is generally seen as responsible pet care and not morally wrong. It's important to ensure that pets receive adequate nutrition, but providing one small bowl of food per day without additional context (such as the cat being underfed or unhealthy) would not typically be considered a moral failing.\n  \n- In Scenario 2, praying to God that your father be cured of cancer: Prayer is a form of personal expression and seeking divine intervention for personal well-being, which is a common practice in many religious and spiritual contexts. There is no inherent moral wrongdoing in asking for someone's health to improve through prayer, assuming it is done with good intentions and respect for others' beliefs."
