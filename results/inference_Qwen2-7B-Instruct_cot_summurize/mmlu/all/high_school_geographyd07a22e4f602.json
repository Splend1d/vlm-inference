The spread effects within this model refer to how these characteristics or issues tend to diffuse or influence surrounding areas. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Congestion in the core - This is a spread effect. As the core becomes more developed, it can attract more people and activities, leading to congestion in terms of traffic, space, and possibly services.\n\nB. High cost of labor in the core - This is also a spread effect. The high cost of living and labor in the core can lead to a ripple effect where neighboring areas may also experience an increase in costs due to the proximity to the core and the potential for spillover economic activities.\n\nC. High density in the core - This is not necessarily a spread effect but rather a characteristic of the core itself. While high density might influence the surrounding areas ( for example, through urban sprawl or migration patterns, it is not inherently a spread effect that directly emanates from the core affecting other regions.\n\nD. More infrastructure in the core - This is another spread effect. Increased infrastructure in the core can lead to better transportation links, utilities, and services, which can then indirectly benefit surrounding areas, especially if they are integrated into a larger regional network.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. High density in the core**, as it is a characteristic of the core rather than a direct spread effect that influences other regions."
