Crops and timber to be severed from the property next summer.\n\nThe Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) primarily governs contracts for the sale of goods, which includes tangible personal property that can be physically delivered. Contracts involving crops and timber, which are are forms of real property that will be harvested or removed at a future date, fall under this category as they involve the sale of goods. \n\nA. A common carrier delivering a new computer would typically be governed by other laws, such as those related to transportation services, rather than the UCC.\n\nC. The purchase of a commercial property building involves real estate, not goods, and would generally be governed by real estate laws, not the UCC.\n\nD. The sale of an intangible asset might be covered by other specific laws or regulations depending on the nature of the asset, but it's less likely to fall under the general scope of the UCC, which focuses on goods."
