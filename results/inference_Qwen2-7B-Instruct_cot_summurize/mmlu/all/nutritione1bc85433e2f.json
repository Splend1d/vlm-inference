Weight and height\n\nBoth weight and height are important measurements when assessing growth in routine practice because they provide a more complete picture of a child's development. Height takes into account overall body length, while weight reflects the total mass of the body. Together, they can help identify potential issues such as undernutrition, overnutrition, or other health problems that may affect growth. Additionally, monitoring both height and weight allows for the assessment of growth patterns and trends over time, which is crucial for early detection of any abnormalities."
