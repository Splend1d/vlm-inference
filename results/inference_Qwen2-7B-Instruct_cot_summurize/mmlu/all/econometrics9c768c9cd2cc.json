All of the components of a VAR must be stationary before it can be used for forecasting.\n\nThis is because VAR models assume that the variables are integrated of order one, meaning they are non-stationary but their first differences are stationary. If this condition is not met, the model's results can be spurious and unreliable. \n\nA. The coefficient estimates may or may not have intuitive theoretical interpretations depending on the context and the specific research question. In some cases, they might, but in others, they might require further economic reasoning to understand fully.\n\nB. This statement is not necessarily true. The signs of the coefficient estimates can vary across different lags and equations within a VAR model. The signs depend on the specific relationships between the variables being modeled.\n\nC. While VAR models can provide good forecasts under certain conditions, they do not always outperform simultaneous equation structural models. The performance depends on the underlying data-generating process, the presence of structural shocks, and the ability of each model to capture these dynamics accurately."
