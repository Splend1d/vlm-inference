In order to raise funds, the state decided to consider the creation of a state postal service that only its residents may use for intrastate mail. The price for stamps printed by the state postal service would be half the cost of stamps printed by the U. S. Postal Service and would always be guaranteed to arrive within 24 hours. In addition, any employees of the state would be able to send their mail for free through the state postal service. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the proposed legislation?\n\nA. It constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws, because employees of the state receive personal benefits that are not enjoyed by employees of other states.\nB. The negative implications that flow from the delegation to Congress of the power to establish a post office prohibit such a state postal service.\nC. It denies citizens of the state who are not state government employees their rights under the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. It interferes with the sovereign autonomy of the U. S. Postal Service to operate as an independent federal agency.\n"

It interferes with the sovereign autonomy of the U.S. Postal Service to operate as an independent federal agency.\n\nThis argument is based on the fact that the United States Postal Service (USPS) is a federal agency established by Congress and operates independently from state governments. The USPS has its own legal authority and operates according to federal laws, regulations, and policies. Creating a competing state postal service could potentially interfere with the USPS's ability to fulfill its responsibilities and mandates set forth by federal law, including the provision of universal postal services across the nation.\n\nThe other options do not necessarily present clear constitutional violations:\n\nA. Denial of equal protection of the laws: While it might seem unfair that state employees receive a benefit not available to others, this issue might be more appropriately addressed through state laws rather than federal constitutional concerns.\n\nB. Delegation of power to Congress: This argument doesn't directly apply here, as the proposal is not about delegating power to Congress but rather creating a state-level postal service.\n\nC. Denial of rights under the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: This clause primarily protects individuals' rights when they move between states. It does not directly address issues related to state-run services like postal operations."
