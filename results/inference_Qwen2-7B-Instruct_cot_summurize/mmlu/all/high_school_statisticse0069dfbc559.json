Patients in the other group are given blindfolds and played soft music at bedtime. Each patient is attached to a machine that records breathing patterns. From the patterns, it is possible to determine if the patient is awake or asleep. The data will be used to decide which method is more effective in helping patients with sleep disorders. Which of the following statements is correct in the context of this experiment?\n\nA. It is not possible for this experiment to be single-blind or double-blind, because human subjects are involved.\nB. This is only a single-blind experiment because the experimenters did not include a control group that received neither medication nor a blindfold and soft music.\nC. This is only a single-blind experiment because patients will know which treatment they are receiving, although the examining doctor might not.\nD. This is a double-blind experiment because the experimenters could prevent both groups of patients from knowing what sort of treatment the other group is receiving.\n"

This is only a single-blind experiment because patients will know which treatment they are receiving, although the examining doctor might not.\n\nIn this scenario, the patients know whether they are receiving medication or the alternative treatment (since it's explicitly described as part of their assignment to a group. Therefore, the experiment is single-blind because the participants are aware of their treatment assignment. However, if the doctors or researchers analyzing the data do not know which group each patient belongs to, then the experiment could potentially be made double-blind by ensuring that the data analysts are also unaware of the treatment assignments. But based solely on the information provided, we cannot conclude that the experiment is double-blind; we can only confirm that it is single-blind regarding the patients."
