Sterilization\n\nSterilization, often referred to as tubal ligation ( for women and vasectomy for men, is the most commonly used method of birth control by married couples in the United States. It effectively prevents pregnancy by blocking or removing the means through which sperm can reach an egg or vice versa. \n\nThe IUD ( B., the diaphragm C., and the rhythm method D. are less commonly used methods compared to sterilization. The IUD is a reversible intrauterine device that prevents fertilization by keeping the sperm away from the egg. The diaphragm is a cup-shaped barrier that is placed over the cervix to prevent sperm from entering the uterus. The rhythm method is a natural family planning technique that involves tracking a woman's menstrual cycle to identify days when she may be fertile and avoiding sexual intercourse on those days. However, these methods are not as widely used due to various factors including effectiveness, ease of use, and personal preference."
