The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.\n\nIn this scenario, the homeowner initially offered a specific deal for the roofer to replace the old tiles with new ones for $5,000. This offer is typically indicative of a unilateral contract, where one party (the homeowner in this case - promises to pay upon completion of a task by another party, the roofer. \n\nThe roofer's decision to purchase the necessary materials and equipment to perform the job and then actually begin the work by unloading these items at the homeowner's house can be seen as manifesting an intent to accept the offer. At this point, the homeowner's promise becomes enforceable, even if he subsequently changed his mind. Therefore, under this theory, the roofer could argue that a contract was formed and breached when the homeowner stopped the work, without completing the agreed-upon payment for the services provided."
