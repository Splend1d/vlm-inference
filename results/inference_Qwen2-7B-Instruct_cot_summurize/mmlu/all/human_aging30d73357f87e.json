It aims to enhance safety, efficiency, and well-being by considering various factors that affect human performance. Therefore, the correct answer encompasses all the aspects mentioned in options A, B, C, and D, but fundamentally it's about:\n\nC. The human side of the equation: This refers to the comprehensive examination of how people interact with technology, systems, and environments. Human factors considers physical, cognitive, and emotional aspects of human capabilities and limitations to design systems that are safe, efficient, and user-friendly.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D provide specific perspectives within this broader scope:\n- A. The factors that influence performance: This includes physiological, psychological, and environmental factors that impact an individual's ability to perform tasks effectively.\n- B. The interaction between human and environment: This highlights the importance of considering the environment ( including tools, controls, layout, etc., in relation to human needs and abilities.\n- D. The effects of environmental changes on humans: This aspect looks at how modifications to the environment can positively or negatively impact human performance and well-being.\n\nIn summary, human factors is concerned with understanding and improving the compatibility between people and their surroundings, encompassing all these elements."
