Sympatric speciation. \n\nSympatric speciation refers to the process by which new species evolve while occupying the same geographic area as their ancestors. This can occur through various mechanisms such as reproductive isolation ( where the populations can interbreed but do not due to some barrier, or through ecological divergence where the populations become specialized to exploit different resources and thus can no longer interbreed.\n\nIn your scenario, the researcher is able to breed the new variant with itself to produce offspring that look like the new variant, indicating reproductive isolation between the original phenotype and the new one. However, when trying to breed the original phenotype with the new one, no offspring are produced, which suggests they are unable to interbreed. This fits the description of sympatric speciation."
