This is because the body can only absorb a certain amount of carbohydrates at a time, and using a mix of glucose and fructose can help maximize this absorption.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice would be:\n\nD. 90 g glucose plus fructose per hour\n\nThis combination is often recommended as it helps maintain blood glucose levels and supports sustained energy release during long-duration exercises. However, the exact amount and ratio might vary depending on individual differences such as body weight, sweat rate, and personal tolerance. It's always advisable for athletes to consult with sports nutritionists or dietitians to tailor their nutrition plan according to their specific needs."
