Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nHere's why: \n\nWhen you increase the tension in the string, it makes the string stiffer and thus increases the speed of waves (light waves in this case would be misleading here) propagating through the string. Since the frequency remains constant ( as given as 100 Hz), and the speed of the wave (v) is related to the wavelength (\u03bb) and frequency (f) via the equation v = f * \u03bb, increasing the speed of the wave requires either decreasing the wavelength or keeping it constant while decreasing the frequency - but we're told the frequency stays the same. \n\nSo, if the speed of the wave increases (which it does when tension increases), for the frequency to remain constant, the wavelength must decrease. Therefore, the correct answer is that the wavelength of the new standing waves will be less than the wavelength of the original standing waves."
