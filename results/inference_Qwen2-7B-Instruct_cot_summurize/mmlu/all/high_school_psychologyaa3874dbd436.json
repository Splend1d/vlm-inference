They detect chemical substances in the air and send signals to the brain that can help you identify the presence of certain smells, such as gasoline or natural gas. The other options listed ( gustatory receptors (which detect taste, feature detectors which are part of the visual system to recognize objects, and the basilar membrane which is part of the inner ear for hearing - do not directly sense gases in the environment."
