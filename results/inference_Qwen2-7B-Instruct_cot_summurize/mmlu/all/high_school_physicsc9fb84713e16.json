It is moving downward and slowing down.\n\nWhen someone stands on a scale, the scale measures the force exerted by the person's body against it, which corresponds to the person's apparent weight. The apparent weight can be less than the actual weight if there is an acceleration opposite to the direction of gravity (i.e., when the elevator is accelerating upwards or decelerating downwards.\n\nIn this scenario, since the scale reading is less than the person's usual weight, it indicates that the elevator is experiencing an acceleration in the upward direction (which opposes gravity. This situation occurs when the elevator is moving downward and slowing down (i.e., its velocity is decreasing as it descends. \n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. If the elevator is moving upward and slowing down, the scale would still read more than the person's weight because the upward acceleration would add to the gravitational force felt by the person.\n\nC. If the elevator is moving upward at a constant speed, the scale would read exactly the person's weight, as there would be no additional forces acting on the person due to the elevator's motion.\n\nD. If the elevator is moving downward at a constant speed, the scale would read the person's weight as usual because there would be no change in the velocity ( hence no additional forces like acceleration would act on the person."
