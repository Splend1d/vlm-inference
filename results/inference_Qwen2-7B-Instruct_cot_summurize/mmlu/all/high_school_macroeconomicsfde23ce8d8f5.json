The FED sells government securities in the secondary market. \n\nWhen the Federal Reserve sells government securities, it withdraws money from the banking system, thereby decreasing the money supply. This is because banks have to pay for these securities with funds they hold in their reserves at the Fed, reducing those reserves and thus their ability to lend more. This process is known as open market contraction. \n\nThe other options either increase or do not directly affect the money supply:\n\nA. Lowering the discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Fed, potentially increasing lending and thus the money supply.\n\nC. The federal government spending less would reduce the demand for goods and services but does not directly affect the money supply unless it also involves borrowing from the public ( (which would decrease the money supply) or selling securities, which we've already covered under option B.\n\nD. Lowering reserve requirements means banks must hold less money in reserve, allowing them to lend out more, thus increasing the money supply."
