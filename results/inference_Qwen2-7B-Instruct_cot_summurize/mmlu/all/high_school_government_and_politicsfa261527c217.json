Party leadership is dispersed among numerous officials at the national, state, and local levels.\n\nIn reality, political party leadership is not centralized but distributed across various levels of governance. National party organizations do play a significant role, but they rely on cooperation with state and local party organizations to manage activities effectively. The highest elected officials within each national party may have some influence, but they typically do not direct all party activities from the top down. Additionally, while major decisions can be made during conventions, these are not the only instances where significant decisions are taken, as party leadership also engages in discussions and negotiations throughout the year."
