A government subsidy. \n\nWhen there is a positive externality, the market fails to produce an efficient amount of the good or service because the private benefits are less than the social benefits. A government subsidy can help correct this externality by lowering the cost for consumers and producers, thus encouraging more production and consumption of the good or service. This leads to a better allocation of resources and a more efficient outcome."
