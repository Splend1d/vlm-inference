Physical examination reveals tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus and painful abduction of the right upper extremity. The cause of this patient's condition is most likely a somatic dysfunction of which of the following muscles?\n\nA. anterior scalene\nB. latissimus dorsi\nC. pectoralis minor\nD. supraspinatus\n"

This muscle is one of the primary rotator cuff muscles that stabilizes the shoulder joint and assists in lifting the arm away from the body (abduction). Injuries to this muscle can occur due to overuse, sports injuries, or falls, leading to conditions like supraspinatus tendinopathy or supraspinatus tear, which can present with similar symptoms."
