                    "text": "To find the probability that exactly two packages out of four are delivered correctly, we can use combinatorial methods. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to deliver the packages. Since there are four packages and four houses, each package can go into any of the four houses, leading to \\(4!\\) (or \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\\) possible arrangements.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to choose which two packages will be delivered correctly. This can be done in \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) ways, where \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) items from \\(n\\) items without regard to order. So,\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6.\n\\]\n\nNow, for the two chosen packages to be delivered correctly, there are no further restrictions on their delivery. However, the remaining two packages must not be delivered correctly. For the remaining two packages, since they are not being delivered correctly, they form an \"impossible\" scenario for them both to be delivered incorrectly simultaneously because if one is correct, the other must be incorrect to satisfy the condition of exactly two packages being delivered correctly. Thus, there are no valid arrangements for the last two packages under this specific condition, meaning there are 0 ways to arrange the last two packages so that exactly two packages are delivered correctly when considering the restriction directly applied.\n\nHowever, this logic overlooks the complexity of the problem. The correct approach should consider that once the two correct deliveries are chosen, the remaining two packages must be swapped between each other to ensure none of them are delivered correctly. There is only 1 way to arrange the last two packages such that neither of them is delivered to the correct house.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is actually the product of choosing the two correct deliveries and arranging the remaining two incorrectly:\n\n\\[\n\\text{F}\\text{. of favorable outcomes} = \\binom{4}{2} \\times 1 = 6 \\times 1 = 6.\n\\]\n\nFinally, the probability that exactly two packages are delivered correctly is the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 2 correct}) = \\frac{\\text{Ways to choose and arrange the 2 correct}}{\\text{Total arrangements}} = \\frac{6}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)."
