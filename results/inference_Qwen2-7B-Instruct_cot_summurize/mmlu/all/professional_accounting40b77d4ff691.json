The planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.\n\nWhen an auditor of a nonissuer designs tests of details, the primary objective is to gather sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support the planned level of assurance needed for each assertion at the relevant financial statement level. This includes assessing the accuracy of transactions, balances, and disclosures as presented in the financial statements. Ensuring that these tests provide adequate support helps the auditor form an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements.\n\nA. The planned level of control risk is related to the auditor's assessment of the likelihood that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected by the entity's internal control system. It affects the nature, timing, and extent of substantive testing but is not directly related to the tests of details.\n\nB. Management's assertions about internal controls are relate to the internal control questionnaire or interviews conducted with management, which assesses the design and implementation of controls. These assertions are part of the overall audit process but are not the direct focus of tests of details.\n\nC. The effectiveness of internal controls is a broader concept that encompasses the entire internal control system within an organization. While tests of details may indirectly provide insights into the functioning of controls, they primarily aim to verify the accuracy of transactions and balances rather than evaluating the effectiveness of the entire internal control system."
