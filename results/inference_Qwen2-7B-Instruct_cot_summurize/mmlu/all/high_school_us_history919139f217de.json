Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nIn the passage above Coolidge is reacting against which of the following?\n\nA. The economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding\nB. The growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution\nC. Populist agitation in the West\nD. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era\n"

                    "text": "The passage above by Calvin Coolidge, the 30th President of the United States, reflects his stance on the importance of individual property rights and economic responsibility. Coolidge was a proponent of limited government intervention in the economy and believed in the principles of free enterprise and personal responsibility. In this context, he seems to be reacting against what he perceived as excessive government intervention and taxation, which he believed could undermine individual freedom and economic prosperity.\n\nGiven the context and the specific criticisms in the passage about the power to tax and its potential to destroy property, it is most likely that Coolidge is reacting against D. the governmental policy of the Progressive Era. The Progressive Era (roughly from the late 19th century to the early 20th century) saw significant reforms aimed at addressing social and economic issues, including progressive taxation, which increased the government's role in the economy. Coolidge's comments suggest skepticism towards such policies, which he associates with a threat to individual liberties and economic stability.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the passage doesn't directly reference any of the other options provided, it does imply a concern for the balance between government and individual rights, which aligns more closely with the critique of the Progressive Era's policies approach rather than the others listed. For instance, option A ( Harding's economic policy might refer to a different period or focus, and options B and C relate more to political ideologies or movements rather than specific governmental policies periods."
