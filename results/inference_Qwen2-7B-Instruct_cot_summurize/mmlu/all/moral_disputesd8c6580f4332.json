These arguments are often used by proponents of anti-homosexuality views. \n\nA. Naturalness Arguments: These arguments suggest that homosexuality is biologically unnatural or not in line with what is considered 'normal' or typical for human beings. This can be based on various beliefs about the supposed biological norms or societal expectations.\n\nB. Harm Arguments: These arguments claim that homosexuality leads to negative outcomes for individuals, relationships, or society as a whole. This might include assertions about the supposed psychological harm to those who are homosexual, the instability of same-sex relationships, or moral or social harms associated with homosexuality.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Unnaturalness arguments and harm arguments."
