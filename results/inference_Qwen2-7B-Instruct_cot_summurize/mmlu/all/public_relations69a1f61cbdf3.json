Objectives should ideally be clear, specific, and focused on a particular goal.\n\nB. Achievable\nC. Measurable\nD. Time-bound\n\nThese characteristics (achievable, measurable, and time-bound\u2014are part of the SMART criteria for setting effective objectives. They help ensure that goals are realistic, quantifiable, and have a defined timeline, which facilitates planning and tracking of progress."
