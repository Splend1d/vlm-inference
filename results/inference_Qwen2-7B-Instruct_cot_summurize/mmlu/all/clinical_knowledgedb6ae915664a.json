Dysphagia ( difficulty in swallowing - is an indication for surgery in cases of a large goitre. \n\nHere's why the other options are not necessarily true:\n\nA. Stridor is usually caused by compression of the airway, specifically the trachea, not the esophagus, by a large goitre.\n\nC. Hoarseness can be caused by compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve by a large goitre, but this isn't specific to the trachea being compressed directly by the goitre.\n\nD. The severity of thyrotoxicosis (excessive production of thyroid hormones) is not determined by the size of the goitre but rather by the activity of the thyroid gland itself. A larger goitre does not inherently cause a more florid thyrotoxicosis than a smaller one."
