They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom. In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. . . .\n\"It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.\"\n\u2014Ronald Reagan, First Inaugural Address, January 21, 1981\nWhich of the following ongoing debates in U.S. history is expressed in the quotation?\n\nA. Debates over the powers of the president.\nB. Debates over participation in elections.\nC. Debates over federal power over the economy.\nD. Debates over federal power over international affairs.\n"

Ronald Reagan's statement highlights his belief in limited government intervention in the economy and emphasizes the role of states' rights. He argues that the federal government should not be the primary solution to economic problems but rather that it is part of the problem. This perspective aligns with conservative economic principles, advocating for smaller government and free-market policies approaches."
