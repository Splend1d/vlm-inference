This concept emphasizes the importance of unity and community among believers, drawing upon biblical imagery of the church as a body where each member has a specific role and function.\n\nOption C, \"all a part of God,\" is also true in a theological sense, as Christians believe that humans are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). However, this option does not directly address the specific point Butler makes in his sermon about the interconnectedness of human beings.\n\nOption D, \"part of the animal kingdom,\" is not the focus of Butler's discussion in this context. While it is true that humans are part of the natural world, Butler's emphasis here is on the spiritual unity and interdependence of believers within the body of Christ."
