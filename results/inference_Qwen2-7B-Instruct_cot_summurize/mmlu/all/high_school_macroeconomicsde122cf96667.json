                    "text": "To understand this situation, we need to consider the relationship between unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. The Phillips curve is a graphical representation of this relationship, showing an inverse correlation between unemployment and inflation rates.\n\nWhen the unemployment rate falls, it typically indicates that the economy is growing and more people are being employed. This can happen due to an increase in aggregate demand, which leads to higher production levels and lower unemployment as firms hire more workers to meet the increased demand. However, as aggregate demand increases, so does the price level (inflation), due to the economy operating closer to its full employment capacity.\n\nIn the scenario described:\n\n- Unemployment falls from 6% to 5%. This suggests that aggregate demand has increased, leading to higher employment and output. This aligns with option A: \"An increase in aggregate demand.\"\n  \n- Inflation falls from 3% to 2%. This could occur because the economy is not experiencing the same upward pressure on prices that would typically accompany higher growth (as seen when unemployment is low and aggregate demand is high. This might be due to increased productivity or efficiency, which can come from various sources such as technological advancements, better resource allocation, or improvements in labor skills. This align with option D: \"An increase in aggregate supply.\"\n\nThe explanation for both the changes in unemployment and inflation is most likely an increase in aggregate demand combined with an increase in aggregate supply. Therefore, the best answer would be:\n\nC. An increase in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply."
