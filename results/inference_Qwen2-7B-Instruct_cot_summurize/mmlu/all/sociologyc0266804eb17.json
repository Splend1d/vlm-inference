The expansion of private security companies: These companies began to provide a range of services from corporate security and personal protection to armed guarding and investigative work. They grew as an alternative to traditional public sector services.\n\nB. The building of private prisons: As part of the \"get tough on crime\" policies, governments began contracting with private companies to build and operate prisons. This shift aimed to increase efficiency and reduce costs by leveraging the private sector's management expertise.\n\nC. The introduction of market disciplines to measure police performance: Governments started using metrics such as response times, crime rates, and customer satisfaction to evaluate police departments. This approach aimed to make policing more efficient and accountable, though it also led to concerns about accountability and the potential for profit motives to influence service quality. \n\nTherefore, all these options accurately describe the ways in which law and order was privatized during that time period."
