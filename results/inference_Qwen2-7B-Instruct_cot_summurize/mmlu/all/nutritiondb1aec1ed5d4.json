It will have negative impacts in most developing countries because of the increased frequency of droughts, storms, and floods.\n\nClimate change can indeed have significant negative impacts on food security in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries where resources for adaptation might be limited. Increased frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts, storms, and floods can lead to crop failures, damage to infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution, and disruptions in water supply systems that are critical for irrigation and drinking water.\n\nWhile some regions might experience benefits from climate change (for example, increased temperatures could potentially extend growing seasons in certain areas, leading to higher yields for some crops, these benefits are not evenly distributed and are often outweighed by the negative effects mentioned above.\n\nThe other options are either incorrect or misleading:\n\nB. The statement suggesting that more carbon dioxide leads to more productivity is generally true but oversimplifies the complex relationship between CO2 levels, plant growth, and overall environmental conditions. Increased CO2 can boost plant growth, but this effect can be negated by other factors like water availability, temperature extremes, and soil quality.\n\nC. While there might be some localized benefits from climate change on agriculture due to higher CO2 levels, the negative impacts on ecosystems, water scarcity, and the spread of pests and diseases typically outweigh these potential advantages.\n\nD. There is a scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and is largely caused by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. The consensus further states that the impacts of climate change are expected to vary across different regions and sectors, with some facing significant challenges, including food security."
