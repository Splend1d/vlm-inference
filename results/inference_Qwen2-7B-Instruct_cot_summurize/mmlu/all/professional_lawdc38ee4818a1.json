While the document itself (the newspaper in this case) might be considered self-authenticating in some jurisdictions, the process can vary significantly depending on local laws and court rules. Therefore, it's crucial to have someone with knowledge or authority over the document testify about its authenticity and origin. This witness could be an employee from the publishing company who can confirm the publication details of the newspaper. This ensures that the evidence presented is not only relevant but also admissible in court."
