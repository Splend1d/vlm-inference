Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.\nB. Methane did not exist in the solar nebula at the radii of Jupiter and Saturn when the planets formed.\nC. The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\nD. Methane reacts with the abundant ammonia clouds in Jupiter and Saturn and is removed from the atmosphere.\n"

Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nUranus and Neptune, being located farther out in the solar system, have colder average temperatures than Jupiter and Saturn. This allows methane gas to remain in its liquid or solid form (ice) at these lower temperatures, leading to the formation of methane clouds that give the planets their distinct blue hues. In contrast, Jupiter and Saturn have warmer atmospheres due to their proximity to the Sun and their internal heat, which prevents methane from condensing into visible clouds. Instead, they exhibit different colors and cloud formations related to other chemical compounds present in their atmospheres."
