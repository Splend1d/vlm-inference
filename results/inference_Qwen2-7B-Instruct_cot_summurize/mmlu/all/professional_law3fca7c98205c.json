In that year, the conservationist conveyed the tract \"to my nephew in fee simple, provided, however, that the grantee agrees that neither he nor his heirs or assigns shall ever use the property for any commercial purpose. If any portion of said tract is used for other than residential purposes, then the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate. \" This deed was properly recorded. The nephew died intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist died in 2002, survived by his two daughters, his only heirs. During the period between 1981 and 2007, the spreading development from a nearby city began to engulf the tract. Though still undeveloped, the tract became surrounded by office buildings, shopping malls, and other commercial edifices. In 2009, the wife executed and delivered to a developer a fee simple conveyance of the tract, which the developer immediately recorded. The deed did not contain any reference to the restriction noted above. After the developer acquired title to the tract, he commenced construction of a hotel complex on a portion of the tract that bordered an apartment building. The applicable recording statute in effect in this jurisdiction provides, in part, \"No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, or any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. \"If one of the daughters brings suit to enjoin the developer from constructing the hotel, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. win, because either daughter's right to the tract vested immediately upon the developer's construction of the hotel complex.\nB. win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.\nC. win, because the daughters, as the conservationist's only heirs, received a valid possibility of reverter from their father.\nD. lose, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire tract.\n"

When the nephew passed away, the wife (as the surviving spouse and potentially an heir of the nephew - would have inherited his rights under the deed, including the obligation to adhere to the restrictions. \n\nUpon the conservationist's death, his daughters inherited as his only heirs. The deed restriction would pass through the nephew to the wife and ultimately to the daughters. The daughters, as the conservationist's heirs, have the right of re-entry as stated in the deed should the property be used for a prohibited purpose. Since the developer violated the deed's restriction by constructing a hotel (a commercial use of the land), the daughters can invoke the right of re-entry and seek an injunction to stop the development.\n\nThe recording statute does not apply in this case since the deed conveying the property to the developer was properly recorded. The fact that the deed did not explicitly mention the restriction is not relevant; the restriction is part of the original deed and is binding on subsequent purchasers with notice of the restriction. Therefore, the daughters have a legal basis to sue to enjoin the construction of the hotel complex on the basis of the violation of the deed's conditions."
