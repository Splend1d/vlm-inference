Vincristine\n\nVincristine, an anti-cancer drug used in the treatment of various types of cancer including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, can cause peripheral neuropathy as one of its side effects. This neuropathy can manifest as numbness, tingling, or weakness in the hands and feet, and it can also affect motor function, leading to atrophy and muscle weakness. The symptoms described in the patient, including numbness in the hands and feet and weakness in the legs, are consistent with vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy. The timing of the onset of symptoms relative to the last chemotherapy administration also aligns with vincristine as the most likely cause of the adverse effects."
