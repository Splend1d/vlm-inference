Report the colleague to the appropriate local, state/provincial, or national ethics committee.\n\nThe reason for this choice is that the scenario described involves a violation of ethical principles related to professional boundaries and confidentiality. Engaging in a sexual relationship with a current client is a serious breach of ethical standards, as it can impair professional judgment, create conflicts of interest, and potentially harm the client. Reporting the incident to the ethics committee ensures that the issue is handled appropriately through established procedures, which may include investigation, disciplinary actions, and potentially removal of the colleague from practice if found guilty of unethical behavior. This approach respects the integrity of the profession and the welfare of clients."
