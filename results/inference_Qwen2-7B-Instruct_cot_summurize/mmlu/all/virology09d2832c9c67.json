This virus then jumps to humans through contact with infected rodents or their excreta.\n\nFor Ebola:\nEbola virus, on the other hand, is thought to originate from fruit bats (specifically, the Egyptian fruit bat (Myonycteris torquata, which carries the virus without showing symptoms. The virus then potentially spreads to humans through contact with infected animals, such as chimpanzees, gorilla, fruit bats, monkeys, and porcupines.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\nC. Fruit bats for Ebola and B. Primates for Lassa virus, considering that the primates here refer to the rodents that carry the Lassa virus. However, it's important to note that the Lassa virus itself is not directly carried by primates but by the rodent Mastomys natalensis."
