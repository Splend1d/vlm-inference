Kc is based on molar concentrations ( while Kp is based on partial pressures. These two can be equal under specific conditions.\n\nThe relationship between Kp and Kc, when the temperature is constant, is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ K_p = K_c \\times (R \\times T \\]\n\nwhere R is the ideal gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFor Kp and Kc to have the same numerical value, the effect of temperature on the system (represented by \\(R \\times T\\) in the equation above) must cancel out. This means that the temperature (T) has to be such that multiplying it by the gas constant \\(R\\) equals 1. The only temperature where this happens is absolute zero (0 K.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. At absolute zero for all reactions"
