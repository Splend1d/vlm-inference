In Scenario 1, feeding the kitten to the dog is clearly morally wrong as it involves causing intentional harm and death to an innocent creature. Similarly, in Scenario 2, putting a hook in the cat's mouth to prevent it from getting loose can be considered morally wrong if the intention is to cause unnecessary suffering or harm to the animal. Both actions go against ordinary moral standards that advocate for treating animals with care and respect in the United States as of 2020."
