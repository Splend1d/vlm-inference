The relationship between energy and temperature in this context is proportional to the absolute temperature (T (in Kelvin). When the temperature is doubled, the energy available also doubles. However, the rate at which ice melts is not just a linear function of the energy but depends on the latent heat of fusion of ice, which is the amount of energy required to melt a unit mass of ice.\n\nAssuming that the rate of melting is proportional to the power delivered to the ice (which in turn is proportional to the temperature, doubling the temperature would quadruple the energy output because the energy scales with the temperature squared when considering processes like heat transfer or melting ( (E \u221d T^2 for some processes).\n\nTherefore, if everything else is constant, doubling the temperature would increase the mass of ice that could be melted in a fixed amount of time by a factor of 4. \n\nSo the correct answer is B. 4."
