Gender schemas are mental frameworks that guide our understanding of gender roles and behaviors. When a job description uses masculine language, it may trigger assumptions that the position is more suitable for men due to these preconceived notions. This phenomenon highlights how language can reinforce gender biases and impact hiring practices."
