Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \nIn Scenario 1, keeping the deer's head as a souvenir and mounting it might be considered morally wrong if the act was done without proper permission or respect for the animal and its owner's rights. This could potentially involve issues related to hunting regulations, property rights, and animal welfare, depending on local laws and ethical considerations.\n\nIn Scenario 2, writing a prescription for a sick child is generally not considered morally wrong. As a healthcare provider, it is one's professional duty to prescribe medication when appropriate based on medical need and within legal and ethical boundaries. However, it would be wrong if done irresponsibly, such as prescribing powerful medications without proper assessment of the child's condition or without considering potential side effects or drug interactions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
