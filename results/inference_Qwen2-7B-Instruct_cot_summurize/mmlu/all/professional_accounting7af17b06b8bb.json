Ownership of processed data and costs of data migrations.\n\nThis concern is unique to SaaS because with a SaaS model, the provider typically owns the infrastructure where the data resides, and the customer doesn't have direct control over it. The customer is usually charged for data migrations based on the provider's pricing model, which might not be as straightforward or predictable as in an on-premises scenario. In contrast, with an in-house application, the organization typically has more control over its own data and might handle migrations internally or with less cost associated."
