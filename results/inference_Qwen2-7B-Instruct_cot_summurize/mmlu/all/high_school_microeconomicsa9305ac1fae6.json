MC = MR. \n\nThis is based on the profit maximization rule in microeconomics, where a firm will produce up to the point where its Marginal Cost (MC equals its Marginal Revenue, MR. At this point, the firm's profits are maximized. If the price (P is greater than the Average Total Cost (ATC, then the firm can continue maximizing profits by increasing production. However, the direct relationship between MC and AFC or P=ATC does not necessarily lead to profit maximization. Similarly, setting MR equal to AVC doesn't typically maximize profit."
