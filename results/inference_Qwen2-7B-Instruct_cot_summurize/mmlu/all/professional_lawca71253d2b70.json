They are bringing the suit to challenge the constitutionality of the state contraceptive statute, which allegedly prevents them from giving professional advice to their patients about using contraceptives. Their ability to provide medical care to these patients could be impacted by the law, so they have a sufficient interest in the case to bring it to court."
