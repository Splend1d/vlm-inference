This behavior is innate and not learned. FAPs can be triggered by a variety of sensory signals in the animal's environment.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment\n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. \"occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life\" - FAPs are innate behaviors, meaning they are not learned through experience but are present from birth or early development.\n\nB. \"occurs in the absence of sensory feedback\" - While FAPs can occur without the need for continuous sensory feedback to maintain the behavior, they are indeed initiated by sensory stimuli.\n\nC. \"is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously\" - While FAPs are motor responses, they are not typically terminated spontaneously; they continue until the stimulus is removed or the animal's needs are met.\n\nTherefore, option D best describes what a fixed action pattern is."
