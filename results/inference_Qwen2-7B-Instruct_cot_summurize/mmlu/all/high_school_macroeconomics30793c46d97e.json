                    "text": "The correct answer is C. When depository institutions decide to hold more excess reserves, it means they are keeping a larger portion of their deposits as reserves rather than lending them out. This reduces the amount of money that can be loaned and spent in the economy, thus diminishing the potential amount of money created after the Fed increases bank reserves. \n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are not directly related to diminishing the potential amount of money created:\n\nA. If the public prefers to hold less cash, this might increase spending or investment, which could potentially increase the money supply through the banking system. However, this effect depends on how banks respond and lend out the increased deposits.\n\nB. A fall in the velocity of money ( refers to the rate at which money circulates within an economy. If the velocity decreases, it could imply that people are holding onto their money for longer periods, which might not directly reduce the potential amount of money created by the Fed's action. It depends on how the money supply is used and circulated.\n\nD. The marginal propensity to consume ( (MPC) is the fraction of each additional dollar of income that is spent on consumption. A lower MPC could lead to less spending, which might reduce inflationary pressures but does not directly diminish the money creation potential resulting from the Fed's action."
