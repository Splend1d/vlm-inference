On a busy day, three of his partners had clients waiting to see them, and all of the chairs in the office waiting room were filled. A woman had an appointment with the attorney, and the attorney came out to greet her in the crowded waiting room. As the woman saw the attorney she said, \"Am I glad to see you! I need a will made up right away, because I don't want my rotten son to get any of my money. He will just throw it away at the race track. \" The attorney replied, \"Let's go back to my office to discuss this matter. \" The attorney prepared a will for the woman.\nB. A woman arrived at a law office for an appointment and was escorted to her attorney's office. She sat down and said to the attorney, \"You know, I pay you a large retainer every year for your valued counsel. I need some advice now. There was a fire in my house yesterday. It was minor, but I'm covered for $15,000 under my fire insurance policy. I didn't have any furniture in the room where the fire took place, but I want to put in a claim for a sofa and love seat. How should I go about it?\" The attorney refused to give her any advice.\nC. A woman engaged an attorney to represent her in adoption proceedings. During the course of his representation, she told the attorney some very personal facts about her lifestyle that the attorney needed in order to prepare a petition for adoption. The adoption took place, but the woman never paid her agreed fee to the attorney. The attorney sued the woman to collect his fee.\nD. A woman consulted an attorney regarding a sale of 70% of the stock of a closely held corporation in which the woman was the majority shareholder. She explained the reason for the sale and divulged the financial condition of the corporation and its prospects for the future. The attorney determined that the transaction would be complicated. Since he felt he was inexperienced in handling such a transaction, the attorney decided to decline to represent the woman. The woman nevertheless sold her stock with the assistance of another attorney.\n"

The attorney's refusal to provide advice does not terminate the privilege. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the attorney-client privilege applies when the communication is made in confidence for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or services. In this scenario, the attorney's refusal to provide advice might not necessarily terminate the privilege, depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction. The privilege could potentially continue until the client receives the legal advice they sought or terminates the attorney-client relationship.\n\nFor the other options:\nA. The attorney-client privilege is not applicable since the conversation occurred in a public setting (in the crowded waiting room) and the client did not seek legal advice specifically from that particular attorney.\nC. The attorney-client privilege may not apply here because the information shared by the client pertains to the personal facts necessary for the adoption proceeding, rather than legal advice or services sought. Additionally, the privilege might be waived due to the non-payment of fees.\nD. The attorney-client privilege is not applicable since the consultation was about declining to represent the woman in a specific legal matter, and the attorney decided to decline representation based on his own judgment, not due to seeking legal advice or services from the woman."
