In fact, presidents often use executive orders to address controversial issues when they cannot gain enough support in Congress to pass legislation through the regular legislative process. Executive orders allow presidents to act unilaterally on policy matters, which can sometimes lead to controversy if the order conflicts with existing laws or policies, or if it is seen as overstepping the bounds of presidential authority."
