He has not had any other symptoms and has no history of severe headache. He has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and ranitidine. He is oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Range of motion of the neck is decreased due to pain. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Cluster headache\nB. Meningitis\nC. Migraine\nD. Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n"

Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\nThis diagnosis fits the clinical presentation given: sudden onset of severe headache, stiff neck (indicative of neck rigidity which can be a sign of meningismus seen in conditions like meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage, and decreased range of motion of the neck due to pain. The patient's history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease, along with current medications (hydrochlorothiazide and ranitidine, do not suggest a direct link to the presented symptoms. The patient's neurological examination, while normal, is still within the context of a potentially acute and serious condition requiring immediate evaluation. \n\nCluster headaches, while they cause severe headaches, typically occur on one side of the head, have different characteristics, and are not usually accompanied by neck stiffness. Meningitis could present with fever, but the body temperature here is actually lower than normal, which is unusual for meningitis. Lastly, migraines often involve nausea, vomiting, and photophobia ( none of which are mentioned in the patient's symptoms."
