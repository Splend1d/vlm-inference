In fact, the opposite is true regarding representation in the House and the Senate:\n\n- The House of Representatives represents states based on population, with each state having a minimum of one representative. This means that larger states have more representatives than smaller states.\n\n- The Senate, however, provides equal representation, with two senators from each state regardless of population size. This ensures that each state has an equal voice in the legislative process.\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\nC. States are equally represented in the Senate, while representation in the House is proportional to population."
