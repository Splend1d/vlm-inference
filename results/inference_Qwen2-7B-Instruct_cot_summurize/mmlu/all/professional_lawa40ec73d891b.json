The killing was not done with premeditation or deliberation.\n\nFirst-degree murder typically requires proof of premeditation ( the intent to kill must have been formed prior to the act itself, or deliberation, which involves a cool and collected decision to take someone's life. If the jury believes that the killing did not involve either of these elements, it could be argued that the defendant did not \"knowingly or willfully\" cause the death of another human being, potentially leading to acquittal on the charge of first-degree murder.\n\nIt's important to note that actual innocence or justifiable self-defense could also lead to acquittal, but based solely on the information provided, option B aligns most closely with negating the requirements for first-degree murder under the definition given."
