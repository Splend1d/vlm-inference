While some may argue that not following a request could be considered disrespectful or non-cooperative, it is not inherently morally wrong. It's a matter of personal judgment and respect for signage rather than a clear-cut moral wrongdoing.\n\nScenario 2 involves pointing out a person in an airport to security personnel, assuming they might have a weapon. This action is generally not considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. It is a reasonable action given the heightened security measures in airports due to safety concerns, and it is meant to prevent potential harm to others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong."
