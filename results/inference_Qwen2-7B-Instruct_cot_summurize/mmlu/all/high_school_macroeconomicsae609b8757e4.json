II, III, and IV only.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. \n\nI. The market value of movies made in Africa by U.S. citizens would not be included in U.S. GDP because it was produced outside of the U.S.\n\nII. The market value of olive oil made in Italy and sold in the United States would be included in U.S. GDP because it is a good produced and consumed within the U.S. boundaries.\n\nIII. The market value of blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan would also be included in U.S. GDP because the production occurred within the U.S., even though it was exported.\n\nIV. The market value of wine made in the United States by Canadian citizens would be included in U.S. GDP because the production took place within the U.S. regardless of who the producer is.\n\nTherefore, options II, III, and IV are correctly included in U.S. GDP."
