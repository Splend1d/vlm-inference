MC that first falls, but eventually rises, as output increases.\n\nThe Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns states that as more units of a variable input (like labor or capital) are added to fixed inputs (like land or machinery), the marginal product of the variable input will eventually decrease. This leads to an increase in the cost per unit of output, which is reflected in the Marginal Cost (MC. Initially, as production increases, the cost per unit decreases due to the efficient use of resources and spreading fixed costs over more units. However, once diminishing returns set in, each additional unit of input results in less additional output, increasing the cost per unit, thus causing the marginal cost to rise."
