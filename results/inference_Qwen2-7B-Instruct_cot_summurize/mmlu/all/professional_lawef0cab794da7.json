The statement the defendant plans to introduce from the police accident investigator about what the plaintiff said after the accident is an out-of-court statement made by the plaintiff (the party opposing the introduction of evidence), which makes it hearsay. Without further context or clarification that this statement falls under any of the recognized exceptions for hearsay (such as if the plaintiff is unavailable to testify or if the statement is being being offered to show the declarant's state of mind at the time of the event), the judge would likely rule this statement inadmissible."
