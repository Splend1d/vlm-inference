Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the main character's desire to specifically target the \"black guy\" for handshakes implies a preference based on race, which is morally wrong and discriminates against the individual based on their ethnicity. This action goes against the principles of equality, respect, and non-discrimination that are fundamental to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character chooses not to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting an animal that ran in front of the car. While this decision might be influenced by factors such as the potential danger to themselves or others if they had to swerve, it is generally considered not morally wrong. In many contexts, especially where there is no imminent risk to the driver or passengers, the priority is often to maintain control of the vehicle and prevent accidents, even if it means potentially hitting an animal. This scenario involves a judgment call under emergency conditions, which can be ethically complex but not universally deemed wrong without considering specific circumstances and context."
