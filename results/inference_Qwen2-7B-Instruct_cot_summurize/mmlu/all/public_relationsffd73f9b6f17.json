This concept suggests that organizations should focus their communication efforts on those audiences who are impacted by their actions or decisions.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Cutlip (2006 - This option seems to be incomplete or incorrectly formatted, but Cutlip is known for his work in public relations, including co-authoring \"Effective Public Relations\" ( which doesn't directly quote this specific statement.\n\nB. Leitch and Neilson (2001 - This option also appears to be incomplete. However, both authors have contributed significantly to the field of public relations. They might discuss audience targeting, but without further context, it's hard to confirm their as the source of this exact statement.\n\nC. Amaral and Phillips (2010 - This option seems like it could be a pair of authors discussing some aspect of public relations, but again, without more context, it's not clear whether they would argue for or against considering all publics equally.\n\nD. Grunig and Hunt 1984 - These authors are well-known for their work on the two-way symmetrical model of public relations, which emphasizes the importance of mutual understanding between an organization and its publics. Contrary to the statement provided, Grunig and Hunt would likely argue that all publics should be considered important for effective communication, even if they don't currently seem to be affected by the organization.\n\nGiven the context of the statement, the most plausible answer would be D. Grunig and Hunt 1984, because their work generally advocates for considering all publics in an organization's communications, regardless of immediate impact. However, without direct quotes from these sources or other definitive evidence, attributing such a nuanced argument solely to one of these authors or pairs based on this statement alone is speculative. It's possible that any of the options might have made similar points depending on the broader context of their work."
