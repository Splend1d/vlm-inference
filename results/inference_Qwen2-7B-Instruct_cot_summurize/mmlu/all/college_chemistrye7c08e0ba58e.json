However, the number of unpaired electrons is only considered for the 6p orbital since the 5s orbital electrons are paired. Therefore, N = 6.\n\nGiven P = 2.5 x 10^-6 C/m\u00b2, we can rearrange the formula to solve for B:\n\nB = P / (\u03bc\u2080 * N\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = ( 2.5 x 10^-6 C/m\u00b2 / ( (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 T\u00b7m/A) * 6\nB \u2248 1.27 T\n\nThe closest answer choice to this calculated value is:\n\nB. 1.2 T"
