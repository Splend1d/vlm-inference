This principle breaks away from classical mechanics where the laws were thought to be absolute and not dependent on the observer's state of motion. \n\nIt's important to note that this applies only to inertial frames of reference - those that are either at rest or moving with constant velocity. If an object is accelerating, the laws of physics can indeed look different depending on the observer's frame of reference. For such scenarios, Einstein later developed the General Theory of Relativity."
