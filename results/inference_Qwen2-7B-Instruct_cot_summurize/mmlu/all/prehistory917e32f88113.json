They are usually conducted when there is a need to assess an area before more intrusive investigations like excavation. The appropriateness and usefulness of pedestrian surveys depend on various factors. Among the options provided, option C, \"associations that can be established between artifacts, ecofacts, and bone,\" is the most directly relevant factor.\n\nPedestrian surveys rely heavily on the ability to identify and interpret patterns or clusters of artifacts, ecofacts ( (which are can include items like animal bones, plant remains, and other organic materials), and bone. These items often indicate areas where human activity has taken place in the past. By establishing associations between these different types of finds, archaeologists can infer about the nature of past human activities, the sequence of events, and the spatial layout of sites.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that all the options you've listed play some role in the effectiveness of pedestrian surveys:\n\nA. The presence of primary and secondary refuse: Areas with a history of human habitation are likely to have a mix of primary refuse ( items discarded immediately after use, and secondary refuse, items moved from the immediate vicinity of their use. This mix can be crucial for identifying potential archaeological sites.\n\nB. Naturally exposed layers: In some cases, natural processes such as erosion or landslides can expose archaeological features or artifacts at or near the surface. Pedestrian surveys are particularly useful in such environments.\n\nD. The existence of a cache or collection of artifacts: While caches or collections might be more easily identified through other methods, pedestrian surveys can still provide valuable information about the spatial distribution of these items if they are not too deeply buried or obscured.\n\nIn summary, while each of the options contributes to the overall utility of pedestrian surveys, option C highlights a critical aspect that directly enables archaeologists to make meaningful interpretations about past human behavior based on the spatial relationships among artifacts, ecofacts, and bone."
