Selling real estate at a price that differs significantly from its appraised value.\n\nThis option most likely indicates the existence of related party transactions because it involves a transaction between the entity and one of its related parties (the entity itself, in this case, selling property at an unusually high or low price. This can be indicative of non-arm's length transactions, which are are often scrutinized for potential manipulation or unfair advantage.\n\nOptions A, C, and D also involve related party transactions but might not necessarily raise red flags in the same way that B does:\n\nA. Insuring the lives of key executives and listing the entity as beneficiary: This could be seen as a risk management strategy rather than a typical indication of a related party transaction. However, it could become suspicious if the premiums are unusually high or if there is a pattern of insuring key employees and making them beneficiaries, potentially leading to tax benefits or other financial advantages that could be questioned.\n\nC. Making a loan with specific scheduled terms for repayment of the funds: This is a standard business practice involving a related party (the entity itself or another subsidiary. It's a loan and should follow normal lending practices and terms agreed upon by both parties. If the interest rates, terms, or conditions are significantly different from market standards, it could raise concerns about fairness.\n\nD. Granting stock options to key executives at favorable prices: This is a common practice in corporate compensation packages. The fairness of such grants depends on the market conditions, the performance of the company, and the vesting schedule. If the terms are significantly more favorable than those offered to non-executive employees or are not aligned with the company's overall compensation philosophy, they could be viewed with suspicion."
