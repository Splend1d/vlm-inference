Experiential consumption. \n\nExperiential consumption focuses on the hedonic or emotional aspects of using and interacting with products, rather than just their functional utility. It examines how consumers derive pleasure, enjoyment, or emotional experiences from products and services, which can include social interactions, sensory experiences, and personal growth. This perspective emphasizes the importance of the overall experience associated with a product, beyond its practical functions."
