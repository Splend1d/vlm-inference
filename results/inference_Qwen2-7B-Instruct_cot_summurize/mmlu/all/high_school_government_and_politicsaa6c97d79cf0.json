The Senate may use the filibuster to block an executive order. \n\nExplanation: While the filibuster can be used by the Senate to delay or prevent action on a bill, it cannot block an executive order outright. Executive orders are are issued by the President and can only be challenged through legal means, such as lawsuits, rather than being blocked by legislative action like a filibuster. The other options listed ( impeachment, treaty ratification, and Supreme Court nominations, are ways that the legislative branch can exercise oversight and limit the power of the executive branch."
