This is because foreign buyers need to purchase dollars to pay for the US exports. As the demand for dollars increases, the value of the dollar tends to rise relative to other currencies, assuming all else remains equal.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the value of the dollar rises as demand for dollars increases."
