All of the statements (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are disadvantages of the Dickey-Fuller / Engle-Granger approach to testing for cointegration and modeling cointegrating relationships:\n\ni) Only one cointegrating relationship can be estimated: This means that if there are multiple cointegrating relationships among the variables, this method will not be able to identify all of them.\n\nii) Particularly for small samples, there is a high chance of the tests suggesting that variables are not cointegrated when they are: Small sample sizes can lead to less reliable test results, making it more likely that true cointegration might be incorrectly rejected.\n\niii) It is not possible to make inferences on the cointegrating regression: The Engle-Granger two-step method does not allow for straightforward inference about the coefficients in the cointegrating equation, as these are estimated in a separate step from the unit root test.\n\niv) The procedure forces the researcher to specify which is the dependent variable and which are the independent variables: The first step of the Engle-Granger method involves running a regression where one variable is taken as the dependent variable and the others as independent variables. This arbitrary choice can affect the outcome of the cointegration test."
