Her coworkers became concerned when she did not arrive for work. On arrival, she is unable to provide a history. Her pulse is 96/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300 U/L. Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine. Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24 hours?\n\nA. Acute respiratory distress syndrome\nB. Acute tubular necrosis\nC. Cerebral edema\nD. Cerebral hemorrhage\n"

                    "text": "The patient described presents with several concerning symptoms and findings that suggest a serious medical condition. The presence of erythema, warmth, and induration on the skin, along with high serum creatine kinase levels and a positive urine toxicology screen for opiates and cocaine, points towards rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue leading to the release of myoglobin, creatine kinase, and other substances into the bloodstream.\n\nGiven the high serum creatine kinase activity and the finding of pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes in the urine, the patient is also at risk for acute tubular necrosis ( (ATN). This is a type of kidney injury where the tubules of the nephrons ( the functional units of the kidneys) are damaged due to toxins or metabolic disturbances. The release of substances like myoglobin can cause blockages in the renal tubules, leading to decreased urine output and potential kidney failure.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's elevated creatinine levels and the strong positive urine dipstick for blood may indicate ongoing kidney dysfunction.\n\nConsidering the options provided:\n\nA. Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( (ARDS) is less likely given the current information, as it typically arises from lung injury and does not directly correlate with the symptoms described here.\n  \nB. Acute tubular necrosis is the most relevant answer based on the information provided, indicating the patient's risk for kidney damage and failure.\n\nC. Cerebral edema and D. Cerebral hemorrhage are also possible complications, but they are not as directly supported by the evidence provided. Cerebral edema could potentially arise if there were significant blood loss or dehydration, but without additional information about the patient's history, including any signs of trauma or bleeding disorders, these are not the primary concerns based on the presented symptoms and test results.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Acute tubular necrosis**, as it is the most likely condition the patient is at risk for based on the available information."
