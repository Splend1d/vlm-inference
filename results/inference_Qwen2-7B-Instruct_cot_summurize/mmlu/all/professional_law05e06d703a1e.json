Two months after completion of the work, the company sued the city for its failure to pay under the terms of the contract. At trial, the company's construction supervisor who personally oversaw all the repair work was called to testify. He sought to testify about the amount of sewer pipe used, the number of hours required to complete the job, and the number of workers employed by the company during the construction repair work. The defendant's attorney objected on the grounds that the company routinely recorded such factual information in their log books, which were in the company's possession. As a consequence, the supervisor's testimony should be ruled\n\nA. admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge.\nB. admissible, because it is a report of regularly conducted business activities.\nC. inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.\nD. inadmissible, because no evidence was introduced to show that the original log records are not available for examination.\n"

The rationale behind this is that when a company maintains records as part of its normal operations, those records are considered reliable and trustworthy, reflecting typical and expected business procedures. In this case, the supervisor's testimony about the factual information recorded in the company's log books, which detail the amount of materials used, labor hours, and workforce numbers, would likely be deemed admissible as it is a report of regularly conducted business activities. This testimony serves to corroborate the entries in the log books and provides a basis for determining the costs or charges agreed upon in the contract. \n\nHowever, the judge might also consider other factors such as the availability of the original records and whether there is any reason to doubt the accuracy or completeness of the log book entries before ruling on the admissibility of the supervisor's testimony. If the company has maintained proper record-keeping practices, the supervisor's recollection of these entries would typically be accepted as sufficient without needing to inspect the original documents."
