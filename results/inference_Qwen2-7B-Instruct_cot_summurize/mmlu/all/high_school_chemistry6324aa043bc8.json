                    "text": "To find the ionization constant (Ka) of a weak monoprotic acid, we first need to determine the concentration of hydrogen ions ([H+]) from the given pH value.\n\nThe pH formula is:\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log_{10}[\\text{H}^+] \\]\n\nGiven that the pH is 2.0, we can solve for [H+] as follows:\n\\[ 2.0 = -\\log_{10}[\\text{H}^+] \\]\n\\[ [\\text{H}^+] = 10^{-2.0} \\]\n\\[ [\\text{H}^+] = 0.01 \\text{ M} \\]\n\nNow, we know that for a weak monoprotic acid HA dissociating into H+ and A-, the ionization constant expression is:\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} \\]\n\nSince the acid is weak, we assume that the change in concentration of the acid is negligible compared to its initial concentration. Therefore, the concentration of the undissociated acid ([HA]) is approximately equal to the initial concentration of the acid, which is 0.060 M.\n\nGiven that [H+] = [A-] ( (because each H+ ion comes from the dissociation of one acid molecule), we have:\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{(0.01)(0.01)}{0.060} \\]\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{0.0001}{0.060} \\]\n\\[ K_a = 0.001666... \\]\n\nRounding off to four significant figures, we get:\n\\[ K_a = 1.7 \\times 10^{-3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1.7 \u00d7 10^-1"
