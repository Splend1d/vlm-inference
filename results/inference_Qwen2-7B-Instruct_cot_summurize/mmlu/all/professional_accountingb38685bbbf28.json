The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Collection Period} = \\frac{\\text{Days in a Year}}{\\text{Number of Sales Transactions per Day}} \\]\n\nGiven that the average collection period is 36 days and assuming a 365-day year, we can calculate the number of sales transactions per day as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Sales Transactions per Day} = \\frac{365}{\\text{Average Collection Period}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Sales Transactions per Day} = \\frac{365}{36} \\approx 10.14 \\]\n\nThe total sales for the year are $265 million, and out of this, $25 million were cash sales. This means that the remaining sales were on credit:\n\n\\[ \\text{Credit Sales} = \\text{Total Sales} - \\text{Cash Sales} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Credit Sales} = \\$265\\, \\text{million} - \\$25\\, \\text{million} = \\$240\\, \\text{million} \\]\n\nTo find the ending accounts receivable balance, we need to determine what portion of these credit sales corresponds to the average collection period of 36 days. Since we know the number of sales transactions per day, we can estimate the average value of each transaction:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Value of Each Transaction} = \\frac{\\text{Credit Sales}}{\\text{Number of Sales Transactions per Day}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Value of Each Transaction} = \\frac{\\$240\\, \\text{million}}{10.14} \\approx \\$23.69\\, \\text{million} \\]\n\nNow, since we're looking for the balance corresponding to the average collection period of 36 days, we divide the number of days in a year by the average collection period to find how many transactions represent this period:\n\n\\[ \\text{Transactions for Average Collection Period} = \\frac{365}{36} \\approx 10.14 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the number of transactions for the average collection period by the average value of each transaction to find the ending accounts receivable balance:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable Balance} = \\text{Transactions for Average Collection Period} \\times \\text{Average Value of Each Transaction} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable Balance} \\approx 10.14 \\times \\$23.69\\, \\text{million} \\approx \\$23.7\\, \\text{million} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ending accounts receivable balance is closest to $23.7 million, which corresponds to option B."
