In other words, the reward can justify the behavior to the point where the individual no longer finds the activity enjoyable or motivating for its own sake.\n\nTherefore, option A: \"rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest,\" aligns with the Overjustification Hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that external rewards might lead to a decrease in the individual's intrinsic motivation towards the activity."
