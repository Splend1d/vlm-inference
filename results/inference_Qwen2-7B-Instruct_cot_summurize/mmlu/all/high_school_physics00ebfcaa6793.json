This occurs where the derivative of the potential energy function with respect to \\(x\\) equals zero, because force is the negative gradient of the potential energy.\n\nGiven the potential energy function:\n\\[U(x) = (x - 2)^3 - 12x\\]\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of \\(U(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\):\n\\[U'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[(x - 2)^3 - 12x] = 3(x - 2)^2 - 12\\]\n\nSetting \\(U'(x) = 0\\) to find the critical points:\n\\[3(x - 2)^2 - 12 = 0\\]\n\\[(x - 2)^2 = 4\\]\n\\[x - 2 = \\pm 2\\]\n\nThus, the solutions are \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = 0\\).\n\nNext, to determine if these points represent stable or unstable equilibrium, we can examine the second derivative of \\(U(x)\\), which gives us information about the curvature of the potential energy function at those points.\n\nThe second derivative of \\(U(x)\\) is:\n\\[U''(x) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}[(x - 2)^3 - 12x] = 6(x - 2)\\]\n\nNow, let's evaluate \\(U''(x)\\) at the critical points:\n\n- For \\(x = 4\\): \\(U''(4) = 6(4 - 2) = 12 > 0\\). Since the second derivative is positive, this indicates that the potential energy function has a minimum at \\(x = 4\\), which corresponds to a position of stable equilibrium.\n  \n- For \\(x = 0\\): \\(U''(0) = 6(0 - 2) = -12 < 0\\). Since the second derivative is negative, this indicates that the potential energy function has a maximum at \\(x = 0\\), which corresponds to a position of unstable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\(x = 4\\), which represents a position of stable equilibrium."
