It can cause serious harm or death to the child, which violates basic principles of care and protection for minors.\n\nDriving through a red light is also considered wrong as it poses a risk to other road users and can lead to accidents, injuries, or fatalities. However, it might be considered less morally egregious than intentionally harming a child.\n\nIn both cases, the actions violate laws and societal norms concerning safety, care, and respect for others."
