Diminished economic resources\n\nExplanation: Defenses such as breach of contract, fraud in the inducement, and mental incapacity can potentially be used to avoid payment on a negotiable instrument. However, \"diminished economic resources\" is not generally considered a legal defense for non-payment of a negotiable instrument like a check or promissory note. This is because it typically refers to a situation where someone simply does not have the funds to pay, which is not a valid legal defense against payment demands."
