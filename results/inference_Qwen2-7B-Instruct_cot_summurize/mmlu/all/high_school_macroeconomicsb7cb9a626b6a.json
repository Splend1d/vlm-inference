U.S. GDP falls and Brazil's GDP rises.\n\nWhen an American firm moves its manufacturing plant to Brazil, it implies that the production activities and potential economic output that were contributing to the U.S. GDP are now contributing to the Brazilian GDP instead. This relocation results in a decrease in the economic activity accounted for in the U.S. GDP. On the other hand, Brazil's GDP increases because the new manufacturing plant adds to its economic output."
