The retailer stayed in possession and became the lessee for the next 25 years with monthly payments and various obligations regarding maintaining the property. The retailer had to pay most of the expenses on the property, and had options for further extensions but not to purchase the property back. Within a few years, lessee's business grew and he wanted to tear down one of the buildings and attach a new building to his store. The investor refused to consent. Lessee filed suit asking for an order compelling compliance. Will the court likely order the investor to comply with the lessor's demands?\n\nA. No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.\nB. Yes, the lessee will be able to make the improvements without the investor's consent but the improvements will belong to the investor.\nC. No, because in every sale-leaseback agreement, there is a clause guaranteeing that the lessee cannot make improvements without the written consent of the investor.\nD. Yes, because the lessee's equity interest surpasses the investor's interest, giving the lessee the right to make improvements.\n"

Sale-leaseback agreements can vary significantly in their stipulations, including the rights of the lessee to make improvements to the property, and whether such improvements require the consent of the investor.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\nA. It's possible that the court might side with the investor, especially if the lease agreement explicitly states that significant alterations or improvements require the landlord's consent. This would likely prevent the lessee from making the desired changes without the investor's approval.\n\nB. This option seems unlikely because if the lease agreement requires the investor's consent for certain modifications, the court would enforce these terms unless they are deemed unreasonable or against public policy.\n\nC. This option is also unlikely for similar reasons as A. Without evidence suggesting that every sale-leaseback agreement universally includes such a clause, it's more reasonable to consider the specifics of this agreement.\n\nD. The equity interest of the lessee relative to the investor does not necessarily determine the outcome of such a legal dispute. The decision would still hinge on the terms of the lease agreement. If the agreement restricts the lessee's ability to make substantial changes without the investor's consent, the court would likely uphold these restrictions.\n\nTherefore, without knowing the exact terms of the lease agreement, it's difficult to definitively choose one of these options. In practice, a judge would review the contract to determine the rights and responsibilities of both parties, potentially ruling in favor of either party based on the specific wording of the lease agreement."
