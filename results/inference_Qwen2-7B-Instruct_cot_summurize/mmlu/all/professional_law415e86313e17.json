The United States sued a state in federal court for injunctive relief, arguing that the state's child welfare programs, which were funded in part by federal funds disbursed under this statute, failed to comply with federal standards. The state has moved to dismiss the action. Is the court likely to dismiss the action?\n\nA. No, because Congress can place any condition on the receipt of federal funds.\nB. No, because the Eleventh Amendment does not bar actions brought by the United States.\nC. Yes, because the Eleventh Amendment bars actions against a state in federal court.\nD. Yes, because the protection of child welfare is reserved to the states.\n"

No, because the Eleventh Amendment does not bar actions brought by the United States.\n\nThe Eleventh Amendment generally prohibits suits against a state by citizens of another state or foreign entities in federal court. However, this amendment does not apply when the United States itself is bringing suit against a state. In this scenario, since the United States is seeking injunctive relief against a state for non-compliance with federal standards regarding child welfare programs funded in part by federal funds, the Eleventh Amendment would not prevent the action from proceeding in federal court."
