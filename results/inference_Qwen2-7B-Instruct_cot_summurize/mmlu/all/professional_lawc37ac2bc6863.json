Negligence would need to be proven through evidence showing that the neighbor's excavations were conducted without proper consideration for the potential impact on neighboring properties or that the excavations exceeded what would be considered reasonable in terms of scale or frequency.\n\nStrict liability, which would apply if the neighbor's actions automatically make them liable regardless of fault, might not necessarily apply here since the focus seems to be on the specific actions taken by the neighbor rather than a general duty to support the musician's property. Additionally, while it's true that there may be no affirmative duty to laterally support a neighbor's land, the concept of \"coming to the aid\" of a neighbor's land in the case of excavations (as in the doctrine of lateral support, applies more generally to the prevention of harm to neighboring properties due to excavations that cause soil instability or collapse. Thus, the negligence standard is more likely to apply in this context.\n\nHowever, the specific laws and legal doctrines applicable in the jurisdiction where this incident occurred would ultimately determine the outcome of the lawsuit."
