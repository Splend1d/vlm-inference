Erotica may lead to increases in sexual arousal for men and women.\n\nResearch on the effects of sexually explicit material, particularly when it is found acceptable by the viewer, typically suggests that such materials can increase sexual arousal. This is especially true for erotica, which is often designed to be sexually arousing. However, it's important to note that the effects can vary widely depending on individual differences, cultural context, and personal experiences.\n\nFor example, studies have shown that viewing erotic material can lead to physiological responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, as well as subjective reports of increased sexual arousal. The impact on sexual behavior, however, can be more complex and may depend on additional factors such as relationship status, personal values, and prior sexual experiences.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the other options presented ( C. nonaggressive erotica leading to massive increases in aggressive behavior, and D. erotica decreasing sexual arousal and sexual interest, do not align with the majority of empirical research findings. There is no substantial evidence supporting that erotica leads to massive increases in aggressive behavior or that it universally decreases sexual arousal and interest."
