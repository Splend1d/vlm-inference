It focuses on national, regional, or global economies rather than individual markets or specific industries. It examines issues such as inflation, unemployment, economic growth, fiscal policy, monetary policy, and international trade. \n\nA. Government and its laws that affect commerce is a part of microeconomics which focuses on the actions of individuals and industries as buyers and sellers in markets.\nB. Individuals and their resource use is also a part of microeconomics, focusing on consumer choices, production decisions by firms, etc.\nC. Corporations and their production levels can be analyzed using both microeconomic and macroeconomic principles. Microeconomics would focus on the corporation's internal decisions, while macroeconomics would look at how those decisions impact the overall economy."
