A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it. \n\nExplanation: Arrests without a warrant can occur under certain circumstances including when an officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has occurred and that the arrested person committed it (Option B), when an officer may arrest for a felony committed in his presence (Option C), or when an officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is a breach of the peace and committed in the arresting party's presence (Option D). However, for a misdemeanor, an officer does not necessarily need to believe that the person arrested committed it, as long as there is sufficient evidence or probable cause to make an arrest, which is different from the wording provided in Option A."
