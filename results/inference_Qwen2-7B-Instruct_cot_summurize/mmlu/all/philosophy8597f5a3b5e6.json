This alignss with Sidgwick's ethical theory which posits that the rightness or wrongness of actions can be determined by their outcomes or consequences. Specifically, he argued that one should choose the course of action that will produce the greatest overall good (utility, which is often synonymous with 'badness' being understood as the opposite of 'goodness'. This utilitarian approach focuses on the actual effects of actions rather than their intentions, duties, or adherence to divine law."
