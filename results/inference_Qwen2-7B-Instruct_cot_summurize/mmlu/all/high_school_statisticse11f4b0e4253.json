Changing the measurement units does not affect the value of the correlation coefficient \\(r\\). Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, and changing the units (e.g., from meters to centimeters) does not alter this relationship.\n\nB. Reversing the roles of which variable is considered as x and which as y does not change the value of the correlation coefficient \\(r\\). The correlation coefficient is symmetric with respect to the two variables, meaning it will have the same absolute value regardless of which variable is considered the predictor (x and which is the outcome variable y.\n\nC. Adding a constant to all values of the x-variable does not affect the value of the correlation coefficient \\(r\\). This is because adding a constant to all x-values shifts all points vertically but does not change their relative distances to each other, which is what the correlation coefficient measures.\n\nTherefore, none of the options listed can affect the value of the correlation coefficient \\(r\\), making the correct answer D."
