According to their agreement, the owner was to pay the money to the landscaper's son. The landscaper intended to have the $5,000 given to his son as a graduation present. After the landscaper completed the job, the landscaper requested that the owner pay the $5,000 to him instead of to his son. The owner paid the landscaper. The next day, the son learned of the contract between the landscaper and the owner, as well as the payment to his father. In an action by the son against the owner for $5,000, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the written contract between the owner and the landscaper operated as a valid assignment to the son.\nB. prevail, because the son was the intended beneficiary under the terms of the written contract between the owner and the landscaper.\nC. not prevail, because the owner and the landscaper effectively modified their agreement, thereby depriving the son of any rights he may have had.\nD. not prevail, because the son did not give any consideration.\n"

This modification involved changing the recipient of the payment from the landscaper's son to the landscaper himself. Since the son was not a party to this new agreement, he would not be able to enforce it against the owner. The son could argue that he was the intended beneficiary of the contract, but the fact that the contract was effectively modified without his consent means that the modification is not binding on him. Therefore, the son would most likely not prevail in his action against the owner for the $5,000."
