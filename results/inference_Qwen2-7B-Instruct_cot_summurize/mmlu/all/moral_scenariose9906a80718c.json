Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, asking your boyfriend to take a shower together might not necessarily be considered morally wrong by most people's standards, assuming both parties are comfortable with this arrangement and there is mutual consent. However, if one partner feels uncomfortable or coerced into the situation without proper consent, it could cross into a morally questionable area.\n\nIn Scenario 2, changing a child's diaper when it is dirty is an essential and normal part of parenting. It is not only acceptable but also expected and necessary for the care and well-being of the child. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, while Scenario 1 might be viewed as potentially crossing into a morally questionable area depending on context and consent, Scenario 2 is clearly not morally wrong."
