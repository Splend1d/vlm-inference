If survival time with the disease increases.\n\nWhen survival time with the disease increases, it means that people who have the disease are living longer with it, which can lead to an increase in the number of people who are currently diseased ( and thus, the prevalence of the disease in the population might increase, assuming the incidence rate remains constant. \n\nLet's quickly review why the other options do not necessarily lead to an increase in disease prevalence:\n\nA. If the incidence rate of the disease falls - This would decrease the number of new cases entering the population with the disease, potentially decreasing prevalence.\n\nC. If recovery of the disease is faster - Faster recovery would decrease the number of people remaining diseased over time, which could decrease prevalence.\n\nD. If the population in which the disease is measured increases - An increase in population size alone does not necessarily affect the prevalence of a disease; it only affects the numerator of the prevalence calculation if more people are getting the disease at the same rate. If the rate stays constant, the prevalence could remain unchanged."
