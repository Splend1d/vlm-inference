This rubber band can wind and unwind around the axle supporting the wheels. This toy is given a shove, after which the toy rolls across a flat surface and up a ramp. It is observed that the toy does not go a consistent distance up the ramp\u2014in some trials it ends up higher than in other trials, even though the shove imparts the same kinetic energy to the cart each time. Which of the following is a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon?\n\nA. Depending on how the rubber band is initially wound, more or less potential energy can be transferred from the rubber band to the kinetic energy of the car\u2019s motion.\nB. The normal force on the cart\u2019s wheels will be different depending on how much the rubber band winds or unwinds.\nC. How much energy is transferred from kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy depends on the vertical height at which the cart ends up.\nD. Some of the cart\u2019s initial kinetic energy will be dissipated due to work done by friction.\n"

Depending on how the rubber band is initially wound, more or less potential energy can be transferred from the rubber band to the kinetic energy of the car\u2019s motion.\n\nThis is because the amount of potential energy stored in the rubber band depends on how tightly it is wound around the axle. When the toy is given a shove, the rubber band unwinds, transferring its potential energy to the kinetic energy of the cart. If the rubber band is wound more tightly, it has more potential energy to transfer, potentially resulting in the cart having more kinetic energy and thus going higher up the ramp. Conversely, if the rubber band is wound loosely, it has less potential energy to transfer, leading to less kinetic energy and the cart going lower up the ramp.\n\nOptions B, C, and D also contribute to the overall energy loss or redistribution during the process, but they do not directly explain why the toy goes a variable distance up the ramp based solely on the initial conditions. The normal force ( B, depends on the mass of the cart and the angle of the ramp, and the gravitational potential energy gained, C, depends on the final height, both of which are would vary with the ramp's incline and the cart's mass, respectively. Option D introduces the concept of energy dissipation due to friction, which indeed occurs but is not the primary reason for the inconsistency in the distance traveled up the ramp based on the initial conditions described."
