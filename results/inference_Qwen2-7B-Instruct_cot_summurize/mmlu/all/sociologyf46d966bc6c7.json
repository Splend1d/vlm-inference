These stages are:\n\n1. **High Stationary**: Characterized by high birth rates and high death rates, resulting in a stable or slightly increasing population.\n2. **Early Transitory**: Here, improvements in healthcare lead to a decrease in death rates, but birth rates remain high, causing the population to grow rapidly.\n3. **Late Transitory**: Birth rates begin to decline as a result of factors such as education, urbanization, and economic development, while death rates continue to fall, leading to population growth.\n4. **Decoupled**: In this stage, both birth and death rates are low, resulting in a stable population size.\n5. **Post-Industrial**: With further development, populations may experience slight decreases in birth rates and increases in life expectancy, leading to an aging population.\n\nTherefore, option **D** ( \"a decline in the birth rate, greater life expectancy, and an ageing population\" accurately describes the late transitory and post-industrial stages of demographic transition, where societies have experienced significant improvements in health care, education, and living standards, leading to lower birth rates and higher life expectancies."
