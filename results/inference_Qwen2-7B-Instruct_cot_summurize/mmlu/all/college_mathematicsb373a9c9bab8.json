Let's denote:\n\n- The distance from the base of the ladder to the wall as \\(x\\).\n- The height of the ladder on the wall as \\(y\\).\n\nGiven that the ladder is 9 meters long, we have:\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 = 81\\]\n\nWe are given that \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2\\) meters per second ( (the rate at which the base of the ladder moves away from the wall), and we want to find \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\) when \\(y = 3\\) meters.\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation with respect to time \\(t\\):\n\\[2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nWe need to find \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\). To do so, first, let's find the value of \\(x\\) when \\(y = 3\\).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[x^2 + 3^2 = 81\\]\n\\[x^2 + 9 = 81\\]\n\\[x^2 = 72\\]\n\\[x = \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nNow, plug in the values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) into the differentiated equation:\n\\[2(6\\sqrt{2})(2) + 2(3)\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\\[24\\sqrt{2} + 6\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\\[6\\frac{dy}{dt} = -24\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -4\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the height of the ladder on the wall is decreasing.
