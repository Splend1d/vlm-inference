The condition given for the dimensions of \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) doesn't make sense as written (\\(\\dim(W) < 1\\)). Assuming you meant \\(\\dim(W) > \\dim(V)\\), it's still not guaranteed that \\(T\\) is injective. For a linear transformation to be injective (or one-to-one), each element in \\(V\\) must map to a unique element in \\(W\\). However, if \\(\\dim(V) < \\dim(W)\\), there could be more elements in \\(W\\) than in \\(V\\), but this does not automatically ensure injectivity; it depends on how \\(T\\) maps elements from \\(V\\) to \\(W\\). A counterexample would be a linear transformation that maps all of \\(V\\) to a single vector in \\(W\\), which would not be injective.\n\n**Statement 2:** Let \\(\\dim(V) = n\\) and suppose that \\(T: V \\rightarrow V\\) is linear. If \\(T\\) is injective, then it is a bijection.\n\nThis statement is **True**. If \\(T\\) is injective, it means every element in \\(V\\) maps to a unique element in \\(V\\), and no two different elements in \\(V\\) map to the same element in \\(V\\). Since \\(T\\) is also defined from \\(V\\) to \\(V\\), and assuming \\(V\\) is finite-dimensional (which it is, given that \\(\\dim(V) = n\\)), being injective implies that \\(T\\) is also surjective (because every element in \\(V\\) can be reached by applying \\(T\\) to some element in \\(V\\), given the finite size of \\(V\\) and the injective property. Therefore, \\(T\\) is both one-to-one and onto, making it a bijection.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **D. False, True**."
