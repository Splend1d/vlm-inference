It includes not only the genes that code for proteins and RNAs, but also non-coding regions, regulatory elements, and repetitive sequences. So, it's not just the DNA sequence of an entire chromosome (option D), nor is it simply the number of chromosomes (option A), and it certainly isn't just the entire list of proteins an organism can produce (option C). The term \"genome\" refers to the complete set of genetic information an organism possesses."
