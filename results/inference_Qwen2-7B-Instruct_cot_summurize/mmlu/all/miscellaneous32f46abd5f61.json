They might not be capable of spelling words correctly or capitalizing proper nouns yet, but they can start to express their thoughts and speech through scribbles, marks, and simple drawings. This stage is crucial for developing foundational writing skills, which involves connecting sounds with symbols (letters) and expressing their thoughts in a written form. \n\nParaphrasing ideas is more advanced and usually associated with older children or adults who have a good grasp of language comprehension and expression. Therefore, focusing on helping these young children express their speech in print is the most appropriate for their developmental stage."
