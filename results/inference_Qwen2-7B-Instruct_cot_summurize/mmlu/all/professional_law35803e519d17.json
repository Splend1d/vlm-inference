At the hospital she refused the transfusion because of religious beliefs. She died shortly thereafter. The physician verified that the patient would have fully recovered if she had agreed to treatment. What damages can the pedestrian's estate collect from the driver of the car?\n\nA. All damages for wrongful death because it is foreseeable that this kind of negligence could injure someone who will not accept treatment for religious reasons.\nB. No damages, because the pedestrian's wrongdoing in not accepting treatment was the sole cause for her death.\nC. Damages for the wound and the pain and suffering up to the point that she refused the transfusion.\nD. No damages, because the pedestrian's refusal of treatment constitutes contributory negligence.\n"

All damages for wrongful death because it is foreseeable that this kind of negligence could injure someone who will not accept treatment for religious reasons.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the driver of the car is held liable for the pedestrian's death due to the driver's negligence in hitting the pedestrian. The pedestrian's decision not to accept the blood transfusion is not considered contributory negligence because it was an action taken after the accident, and thus outside the scope of the driver's negligence. The driver's actions caused the situation leading to the pedestrian's injury and subsequent death, making them responsible for all damages resulting from the incident. Therefore, the pedestrian's estate can collect damages for wrongful death, which includes compensation for the injuries sustained before the pedestrian's death."
