                    "text": "The correct answer is A. When the nerve stimulus is removed, the muscle fibre relaxes. Muscle contraction is initiated by an electrical signal (nerve impulse) that travels down the muscle fiber. When this signal reaches the end of the fiber, it triggers a series of events that result in muscle contraction. When the nerve stimulus ceases, these events are no longer triggered, and the muscle fiber returns to its relaxed state.\n\nB. The nerve stimulus being too forceful does not typically cause relaxation; rather, it would lead to stronger contractions.\n\nC. Uncovering the actin binding sites ( usually occurs during muscle contraction when the myosin heads bind to the actin filaments. When the muscle is relaxed, the actin filaments are already in their position, so uncovering them wouldn't cause relaxation.\n\nD. Saturation of the actin binding sites refers to a situation where all the binding sites on the actin filaments are occupied by myosin heads. This would actually lead to further contraction, not relaxation."
