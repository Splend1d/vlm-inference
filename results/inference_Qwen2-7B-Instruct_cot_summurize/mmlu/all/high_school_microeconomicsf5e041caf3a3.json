Wage = Marginal Revenue Product of Labor.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, firms hire labor until the wage rate equals the marginal revenue product (of labor (MRPL). The marginal revenue product of labor is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more unit of labor. Firms aim to maximize profits, and in perfect competition, they do this by equating the marginal revenue product of labor with the wage rate. This ensures that the last dollar spent on labor is equal to the last dollar of revenue generated by that labor, maximizing efficiency."
