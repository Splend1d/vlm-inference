This process releases heat over millions of years, contributing to the Earth's overall internal energy. While tidal friction, gravitational pressure, and solar radiation do play roles in certain aspects of the Earth's energy dynamics ( such as plate tectonics and climate, they are not the primary sources of the Earth's internal heat."
