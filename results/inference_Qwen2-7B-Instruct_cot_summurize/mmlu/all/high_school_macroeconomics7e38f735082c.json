Increased investment in capital. \n\nLong-run aggregate supply (LRAS) represents the total output that an economy can produce with its available resources and technology, assuming all factors of production are fully employed and operating at their maximum potential. An increase in investment in capital, such as machinery, equipment, and infrastructure, leads to higher productivity and efficiency in the long run. This results in an outward shift of the LRAS curve, indicating an increase in the economy's potential output.\n\nLet's look at the other options:\n\nA. An increase in the real interest rate typically discourages investment and slows economic growth, which would not increase LRAS.\n\nC. An increase in aggregate demand shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right but does not affect LRAS; it only impacts the price level and output in the short run.\n\nD. An increase in the unemployment rate suggests underutilization of labor, which might temporarily increase output, but this doesn't lead to an increase in LRAS, as it is determined by the economy's productive capacity rather than current employment levels."
