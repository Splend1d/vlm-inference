                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis based on the description provided is B. Atrial Septal Defect ( (ASd). The symptoms described, including a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard along the upper left sternal border and a widely split S2 that doesn't vary with respiration, are typical for an asd. Additionally, the presence of a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border suggests a possibility of a small pulmonary stenosis or a patent ductus arteriosus, which are often seen in conjunction with an asd. However, without further diagnostic tests such as an echocardiogram, it's difficult to make a definitive diagnosis.\n\nAortic stenosis typically presents with a high-pitched, blowing murmur best heard at the second right intercostal space and may be accompanied by a split S2 that varies with respiration.\nCoarctation of the aorta would also cause a high-pitched systolic ejection murmur, but it usually is heard at the second right intercostal space and radiates to the carotids.\nMitral valve prolapse is often associated with a continuous \"machinery\" murmur and a low-pitched rumbling diastolic murmur, typically heard at the apex of the heart, which does not match the described symptoms."
