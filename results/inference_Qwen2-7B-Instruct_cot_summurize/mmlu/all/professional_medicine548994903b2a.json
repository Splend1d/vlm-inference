Case series\n\nThis study design is a case series because it involves observing and collecting data on a group of patients (in this case, children with chronic headaches who have been treated with acupuncture. It does not compare these patients to another group (as would be done in a case-control study), nor does it involve random assignment to different interventions ( as would be done in an experimental design). There's no indication of a crossover design where participants switch between different treatments, and \"cross-sectional\" refers to a snapshot of a population at one point in time, rather than a longitudinal study like this one."
