                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Increased oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the tissues.\n\nFetal hemoglobin (HbF) has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (HbA). Therefore, if an individual retains a portion of their fetal hemoglobin into adulthood due to a mutation, they would likely have increased oxygen binding capacity compared to someone without this mutation. This can lead to several beneficial effects, such as improved oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially reduced symptoms associated with certain blood disorders like sickle cell disease. However, it's important to note that the specific effects can vary based on the exact nature of the mutation and other factors."
