                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Because Aristotle believed that man is a 'social animal'. Communitarianism emphasizes the importance of community and collective values, which aligns with Aristotle's philosophy. Aristotle viewed humans as inherently social creatures who derive their nature and purpose from their relationships within communities ( (Nicomachean Ethics, Book 1). He believed that individuals' well-being is closely tied to the well-being of their communities, and that virtues such as justice and friendship flourish in a social context.\n\nIn contrast, Immanuel Kant, a key figure in modern philosophy, focused on the autonomy and rationality of the individual. His ethical theory is grounded in the idea that moral actions arise from duty and adherence to universal laws ( (Kant's Categorical Imperative), rather than from the demands of a community. Thus, Kant's philosophy places greater emphasis on individual rights and moral agency than on communal ties or obligations, which contrasts with the communitarian perspective."
