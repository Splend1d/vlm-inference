The formula for this relationship is:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{k}{d^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(F\\) is the flux, \\(k\\) is a constant that depends on the total energy emitted by the Sun and its distribution over the visible area, and \\(d\\) is the distance from the Sun.\n\nTo find the ratio of the solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface during perihelion (0.304 AU) versus aphelion (0.455 AU), we compare the fluxes at these two distances using the inverse square law:\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_{per}}{F_{aph}} = \\left(\\frac{d_{aph}}{d_{per}}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nPlugging in the given distances:\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_{per}}{F_{aph}} = \\left(\\frac{0.455}{0.304}\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_{per}}{F_{aph}} = \\left(\\frac{455}{304}\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_{per}}{F_{aph}} = \\left(1.4986\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_{per}}{F_{aph}} = 2.247 \\]\n\nThis means that the solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface at perihelion is approximately 2.247 times greater than at aphelion.\n\nThe closest answer choice to this calculation is **D. 9:4**. This is an approximation since the exact value of the ratio is closer to 2.247, but among the provided options, **D. 9:4** is the closest to the calculated ratio."
