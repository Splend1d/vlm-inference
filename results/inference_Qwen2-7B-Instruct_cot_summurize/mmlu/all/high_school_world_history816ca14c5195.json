Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

                    "text": "The passage discusses the extraction and trade of copper and gold in the Mali Empire. It mentions that copper is mined in a town called ZKRY, and the mined copper is then sold for gold in the pagan Sudan region, with a price ratio of two-thirds of its weight in gold. It also states that some pagan nations within the kingdom do not pay the jizya tax but are employed in gold extraction.\n\nInference B, \"International trade with Sub-Saharan Africa involved the exchange of mineral resources,\" is most supported by the discussion. The text indicates that Mali traded copper for gold with neighboring regions(s), and that there were pagan nations in their territory that were involved in gold mining without paying taxes, suggesting a form of trade or labor exchange.\n\nOption A ( \"Mali was able to forge advanced bronze tools from its mineral resources\" cannot be inferred directly from the text since it does not mention any forging or use of the copper for tool-making.\n\nOption C \"The jizya could only be collected on unbelievers who had minerals to exploit\" is not directly supported by the text. While it mentions the jizya being not collected from certain pagan nations due to their involvement in mining, it does not suggest that the jizya could only be collected from unbelievers exploiting minerals.\n\nOption D \"Mali's relatively advanced mining technologies accounted for its mineral wealth\" cannot be inferred directly from the text as it does not provide details about the technology used in mining operations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B**."
