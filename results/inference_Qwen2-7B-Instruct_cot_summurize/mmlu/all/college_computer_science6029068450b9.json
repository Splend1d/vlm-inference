This allows programs to access more memory than is physically available at any given time by swapping pages between the slower secondary storage (like hard drive or SSDs) and the faster main memory as needed. \n\nStatement II is false because programs do not necessarily have to be completely resident in main memory throughout their execution. Virtual memory allows parts of a program to be swapped out to secondary storage when the system needs more memory for other tasks.\n\nStatement III is also false. Pages in a virtual memory system typically correspond to physical memory locations rather than semantic characteristics of the program. The semantic characteristics would be more related to how the program organizes its data and instructions, whereas page boundaries are more about the physical layout of data in memory."
