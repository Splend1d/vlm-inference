It is often associated with former President Donald Trump's administration and his policies agenda. Therefore, option A, \"A strand of neo-isolationist sentiment,\" aligns best with the description of New Populism as it reflects its emphasis on protectionism, skepticism towards international agreements, and a desire for national sovereignty.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the concept of New Populism can vary depending on the context and specific interpretations, and it may not fit neatly into any one of these options universally or exclusively. The movement tends to emphasize issues that resonate with middle and working-class voters who feel left behind by globalization and economic changes, often advocating for policies changes that benefit domestic industries and workers."
