Wrong, Wrong\n\nCutting someone else's prized flowers is generally considered a clear violation of property rights and can be seen as morally wrong, especially if done without permission or justification. High-fivinging a married coworker may not be universally seen as morally wrong, but it can be perceived as inappropriate if it is seen as flirtatious or disrespectful to their marital status by others. However, this might also depend on the context and the relationship between the individuals involved. In many workplaces, it could be seen as unprofessional. Therefore, both actions can be considered morally questionable depending on the specific circumstances and cultural norms."
