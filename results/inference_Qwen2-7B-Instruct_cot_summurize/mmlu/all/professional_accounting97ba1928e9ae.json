These expenditures are should be reported in the following way:\n\n- General Fund: This fund covers non-debt related expenses and does not include debt service payments. Therefore, no amount is reported for the General Fund.\n- Debt Service Fund: This fund is specifically used for the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations. Thus, the full amount of the payments, which is $25,000, should be reported here.\n- Permanent Fund: This fund typically holds assets that are are intended to remain intact (e.g., endowments or trust funds). Since the payments in question are relate to debt service, they would not typically be reported in a Permanent Fund.\n\nSo, the correct reporting would be:\n\nGeneral Fund: $0\nDebt Service Fund: $25,000\nPermanent Fund: $0"
