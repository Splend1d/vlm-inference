Before trial, the defendant entered into plea bargain negotiations with the prosecution. During the course of these negotiations, the defendant sent a letter to the prosecuting attorney in which she stated: \"I don't want to go to jail, so if you recommend a suspended sentence, I'll plead guilty and admit that I forged my ex-husband's signature on the check. \" Subsequently, the plea bargain negotiations fell through. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was arrested and charged with forging her ex-husband's signature on his next pay check. She has denied culpability regarding the second forgery charge. At trial for the alleged second forgery, the prosecution seeks to introduce the letter the defendant sent to the prosecution during her earlier plea bargain negotiations. The defendant's attorney objects to the admissibility of the letter. The trial court judge should rule the letter is\n\nA. admissible as evidence of the defendant's propensity for committing the crime.\nB. admissible as an admission.\nC. inadmissible, because it was written during the course of plea bargain negotiations.\nD. inadmissible, because specific instances of misconduct are not admissible in a criminal case.\n"

An admission is a statement made by a party that is against their interest and is offered by the opposing party in court. In criminal cases, admissions are generally admissible as evidence, provided they meet certain criteria such as being relevant and not overly prejudicial.\n\nThe fact that the plea bargain negotiations fell through does not affect the admissibility of the letter as an admission. The letter was sent at a time when the defendant was considering entering a plea, which suggests that she believed the statement to be truthful and relevant to the matter at hand. Therefore, the letter can be used to demonstrate that the defendant admitted to the forgery during the plea bargaining process.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n- A. Propensity for committing the crime: The letter alone does not necessarily indicate a propensity for committing crimes; rather, it demonstrates an admission of guilt in a specific instance.\n- C. Plea bargain negotiations: The letter was sent during plea bargain negotiations but its content pertains to an admission of guilt, which is a separate consideration from the negotiations themselves.\n- D. Specific instances of misconduct: Although the letter might involve a specific instance of misconduct, it is still admissible as an admission, which is a recognized exception to the general prohibition on introducing specific instances of misconduct in criminal trials."
