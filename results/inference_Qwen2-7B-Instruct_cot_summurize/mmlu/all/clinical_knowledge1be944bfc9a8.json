A 12.5 microgram Fentanyl patch, and D. A 500 ml bottle of Morphine 10 mg in 5 ml in oral suspension are are indeed controlled drugs. Controlled drugs are also known as controlled substances or narcotics, which are medications that have high potential for abuse and addiction. They require strict control over their prescription, distribution, and use to prevent misuse and ensure they are used for legitimate medical purposes. Therefore, none of these options can be considered as non-controlled drugs."
