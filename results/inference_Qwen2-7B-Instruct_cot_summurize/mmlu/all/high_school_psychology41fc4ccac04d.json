The education system places a high value on collective responsibility, and there is often a societal expectation that parents will be involved in their children's education. When a student is failing at school, it is not uncommon for there to be increased scrutiny on the parents' role in supporting their child's learning and development. This can lead to a societal expectation that parents should take more active responsibility for improving their child's performance in school."
