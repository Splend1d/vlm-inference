His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination shows enlarged, 3-cm, erythematous axillary lymph nodes bilaterally. On palpation, the nodes are tender, fluctuant, and movable. Examination of a fine-needle aspirate from one of the nodes shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Cultures of the aspirate grow yellow, \u03b2hemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive. A polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?\n\nA. Ciprofloxacin\nB. Penicillin G\nC. Rifampin\nD. Vancomycin\n"

The presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters suggests Staphylococcus aureus as the causative organism. The confirmation of Staphylococcus aureus through culture, along with the detection of the mecA gene, indicates that the bacteria are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( (MRSA). MRSA is resistant to many common antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Ciprofloxacin: This is an antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections but is not effective against MRSA.\n\nB. Penicillin G: As mentioned earlier, penicillin G is ineffective against MRSA due to its resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.\n\nC. Rifampin: This is an antibiotic commonly used to treat tuberculosis and some types of bacterial infections. It's not typically used for MRSA infections.\n\nD. Vancomycin: This is a powerful antibiotic that is effective against MRSA. It is often used as a last resort when other antibiotics fail.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be **D. Vancomycin**."
