Life span\n\nLife span refers to the total time from birth to death, which theoretically can be longer than life expectancy at birth ( (LEAB) or life expectancy at a specified age (LEASA). LEAB represents the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if current mortality rates remain constant throughout their lifetime. LEASA, on the other hand, is the average remaining lifetime for someone who has already reached a certain age. It's important to note that life spans can vary widely among individuals and populations due to factors like genetics, lifestyle, and environmental conditions."
