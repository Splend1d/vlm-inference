Intake only of locally grown food in central Africa\n\nCentral Africa might not have a diet rich in iodized salt or foods naturally high in iodine, which can lead to iodine deficiency. This region may also have limited access to iodized salt or other sources of iodine. \n\nA. Low intake of fruits and vegetables: While fruits and vegetables do not typically contain high levels of iodine, they form part of a balanced diet that could include other iodine-rich foods.\n\nC. Insufficient caloric intake: A low-calorie diet is more likely to affect overall nutrition rather than specifically iodine levels, unless it coincides with a lack of iodine-rich foods.\n\nD. Inadequate sunlight exposure: Sunlight exposure primarily affects vitamin D synthesis, not iodine levels. However, iodine absorption in the thyroid gland can be influenced by selenium intake, and selenium is abundant in soil where sunlight exposure plays a role. But this option doesn't directly lead to iodine deficiency."
