The farmer then gave a co-workera mortgage on the olive grove to secure a loanfrom the co-worker to the farmer in the amount of$120,000. The farmer then gave an investor a mortgage on the olive grove to secure a loan from the investor to the farmer in the amount of $110,000. The co-worker then records. The investor then records. Thereafter, the friend records. In a foreclosure proceeding where the friend, the co-worker, and the investor were parties, the olive grove sold for $220,000. The recording statute in this jurisdiction provided \"any written instrument affecting title to land that is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded. \"If the olive grove sold for $220,000, what dollar amount, if any, should go to the investor?\n\nA. $0. 00\nB. $90,000. 00\nC. $100,000. 00\nD. $110,000. 00\n"

Given the information:\n\n1. The friend's mortgage was was recorded last.\n2. The co-worker's mortgage was was recorded second.\n3. The investor's mortgage0 was recorded first.\n\nSince the investor had their mortgage recorded before the friend or the co-worker, they have the highest priority according to the recording statute. This means that the investor would receive the full amount of their loan back, up to the value of the olive grove, before the friend or the co-worker.\n\nThe olive grove sold for $220,000. The investor's loan was for $110,000, so after paying off the investor's loan, there would be $110,000 remaining ($220,000 - $110,000 = $110,000). Therefore, the investor would receive the full $110,000 they loaned to the farmer.\n\nThe correct answer is D. $110,000.00."
