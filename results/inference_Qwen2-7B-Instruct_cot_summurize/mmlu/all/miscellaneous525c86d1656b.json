However, it's important to note that while blue whales can make very loud noises, they're not necessarily the loudest in terms of volume due to their size and distance from the listener. Sperm whales, on the other hand, are known for their loud vocalizations, including clicks that can be heard up to 230 decibels in the water, making them one of the loudest animals in the ocean."
