Because he believes portions of March's deposition are highly favorable to his case, Cooper's attorney intends to read parts of the deposition at trial instead of calling March to the stand. March objects to Cooper's use of the deposition at trial. What is the court's likely ruling?\n\nA. Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.\nB. Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only to contradict or impeach March's prior inconsistent statements or pleadings.\nC. Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist.\nD. Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as this would make March his witness and immune to impeachment.\n"

Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only to contradict or impeach March's prior inconsistent statements or pleadings.\n\nDeposition testimony can be used at trial to either support or contradict the witness's testimony. It is particularly useful when the witness's memory is imperfect or when the witness's credibility is in question. However, it is typically restricted to purposes of contradiction or impeachment. This means that if March contradicts himself or makes statements during the deposition that are inconsistent with his trial testimony, Cooper's attorney can use those parts of the deposition to challenge March's credibility. If there are no such inconsistencies, the deposition testimony cannot generally be used to bolster Cooper's case."
