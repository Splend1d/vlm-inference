He emphasized that true happiness comes from inner peace, freedom from fear, and the absence of pain, both physical and mental. Epicurus did not believe that philosophy was inherently unpleasant; rather, he suggested that it could provide guidance on how to live a life free from unnecessary fears and desires, which he considered to be the root causes of unhappiness.\n\nGiven this context, none of the options A, B, or C accurately represent Epicurus's view on philosophy. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. none of the above."
