It involves making decisions and policies that aim to improve the overall health and welfare of a community or group of people. This can include considerations related to disease prevention, health promotion, environmental health, and access to healthcare services.\n\nWhile respecting the rights of individuals (D is also an important aspect of public health ethics, it is not the primary focus. Public health interventions often require balancing individual rights with the need to protect the health of the population as a whole."
