They often contend that we exist in a world saturated with superficial, fragmented images that are created by mass media and consumer culture. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and meaninglessness.\n\nB. Postmodernists also argue that there is no single, absolute truth or one best theory. Instead, they suggest that all theories are equally valid and that truth is subjective and constructed by cultural contexts. This idea is famously encapsulated in the phrase \"there are no facts, only interpretations.\"\n\nC. They also observe significant societal changes that have occurred since the modernist era, such as increased globalization, technological advancements, and shifts in social structures. These changes necessitate new forms of thinking and theories to understand contemporary life.\n\nIn summary, postmodernist thinkers challenge traditional notions of truth, reality, and knowledge, while also acknowledging the profound transformations happening in society."
