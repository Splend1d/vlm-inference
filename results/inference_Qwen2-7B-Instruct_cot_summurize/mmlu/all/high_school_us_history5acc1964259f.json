Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865\nWhich of the following factors did Alexander Hamilton believe was a source for the problems in the excerpt from Federalist #15?\n\nA. economic class divisions among the American people that prevented them from forging a unified vision.\nB. a failure of American policy-makers to abandon mercantilist principles and to embrace a laissez-faire approach to trade.\nC. a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\nD. an unhealthy obsession among the American people with religion and individual salvation, at the expense of interest in solving practical national problems.\n"

Samuel Thomas, discussing the societal attitudes and issues faced by freed African Americans post-Civil War, particularly focusing on racial prejudice and the perception of African Americans as property rather than citizens with rights. This text does not directly refer to any of the factors listed under Alexander Hamilton's beliefs.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, was indeed influential in shaping early American economic policy and the role of the federal government. He advocated for a strong central government capable of managing debt, establishing a national bank, and promoting manufacturing through tariffs. However, the provided text does not discuss economic policies, religious fervor, or the central government's power, which are were not the primary focus of the issues presented.\n\nInstead, the text discusses societal attitudes and the legacy of slavery, which are not directly aligned with Hamilton's concerns about economic class divisions, mercantilism, or the weakness of the central government. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D accurately reflect factors that Alexander Hamilton believed were sources for the problems described in the excerpt."
