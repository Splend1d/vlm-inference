Steel\n\nSteel is an example of a bulk-gaining industry because it involves producing large quantities of a single product, steel, which is used in various applications such as construction, manufacturing, and infrastructure development. The production process typically involves significant raw material inputs and results in substantial output volumes.\n\nBottled orange juice ( would be considered a consumer goods industry, as it produces a packaged beverage for individual consumption.\n\nPaper is also a bulk-gaining industry, as it involves producing large quantities of paper products from raw materials like wood pulp or recycled paper.\n\nC. Paper \n\nD. Copper \n\nBoth copper and paper are bulk-gaining industries because they involve mass production of commodities that are widely used in different sectors of the economy. However, since the question asks for one example, any of these could technically fit the criteria, but historically, steel has been a particularly large-scale industry, hence option A might be considered the most fitting answer among the given choices."
