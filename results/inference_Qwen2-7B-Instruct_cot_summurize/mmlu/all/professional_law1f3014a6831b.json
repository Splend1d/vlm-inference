Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly. Walter's will provided in part:\"The net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares. \"Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001. Both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009. There is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction. Harriet, on behalf of Grace, brings an appropriate action against the Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate to allow the distribution of the income from said trust to be paid to Grace. Is Harriet likely to prevail in this action?\n\nA. No, because Grace was not a life-in-being at the time of Walter's death.\nB. No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\nC. Yes, because that was Walter's intent.\nD. Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.\n"

                    "text": "The answer to this question depends on the interpretation of the Rule Against Perpetuities, which varies by jurisdiction but generally aims to prevent the indefinite deferral of property rights. If the jurisdiction follows a \"per stirpes\" approach to perpetuities, it would consider whether a person has an interest in their own lifetime or the lifetime of a lineal descendant.\n\nGiven the information:\n\n- Walter died in 1997, leaving the trust to pay income to Stan for life.\n- Stan died in 2009, leaving behind a widow, Morgana, and two children, Andrew and Beverly.\n- Harriet is Stan's mother, and Grace is Harriet's daughter, born in 2001.\n\nIf Grace qualifies as a \"life-in-being\" at the time of Walter's death, she could potentially inherit under the terms of the trust, assuming the jurisdiction allows such a distribution under the perpetuities rule. A \"life-in-being\" typically refers to someone who is alive at the creation of the trust or the death of the last person named in the trust.\n\nOption A states that Grace was was not a life-in-being at the time of Walter's death. This might seem true since Grace was born after Walter's death, but if Grace is considered a lineal descendant of Stan (and thus potentially a \"life-in-being\" under the perpetuities rule, she could still qualify under a per stirpes interpretation.\n\nOption B mentions the Rule Against Perpetuities, which could indeed be a barrier if not properly addressed in the trust terms or by the jurisdiction's laws. However, without specific knowledge of how the perpetuities rule applies in this case, we cannot definitively say whether this option applies.\n\nOption C states that Walter's intent matters. While intentions are to be considered, they may not override legal constraints like the Rule Against Perpetuities, especially if the trust terms do not explicitly address the perpetuity issue.\n\nOption D states that all other persons with claims to the income are deceased. This could suggest that Grace is the only remaining beneficiary under the trust terms, but it does not address the perpetuities rule directly.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely correct answer is **C. Yes, because that was Walter's intent**. If the trust language clearly states that upon Stan's death, the income should go to Harriet's surviving child, and if Grace meets the legal criteria for being considered a \"life-in-being,\" then her claim based on Walter's intent would likely prevail, assuming the perpetuities rule does not apply in a way that invalidates this provision. However, this conclusion assumes that Grace can be considered a \"life-in-being\" under the relevant legal standards, which would require further examination of the specific jurisdiction's perpetuities laws and interpretations."
