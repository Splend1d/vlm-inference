Borrowers repaying a long-term loan at a fixed interest rate would benefit from unexpectedly high rates of inflation because the real value of what they owe decreases over time.\n\nB. Savers who have put their money in long-term assets that pay a fixed interest rate would lose out if the inflation rate exceeds the interest rate on their savings. The purchasing power of their savings would decrease over time.\n\nD. Renters of apartments who have signed a lease that holds rent constant for two years would be harmed by unexpected high inflation. The cost of living might increase, but their rent does not adjust accordingly, potentially leading to a lower standard of living or financial strain. \n\nC. Workers who have negotiated cost-of-living raises into their contracts would not necessarily be harmed by unexpected high inflation if their raises match or exceed the inflation rate. However, if the raises do not keep up with inflation, their purchasing power could still decrease over time."
