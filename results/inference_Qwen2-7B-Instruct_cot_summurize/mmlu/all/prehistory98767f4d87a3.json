This process unfolded differently across various regions of the world, influenced by factors such as climate, available resources, and technological advancements. It's important to note that this transition was gradual and involved significant cultural, social, and technological changes. The development of agriculture allowed human populations to settle in one place, leading to the formation of permanent settlements and the rise of complex societies."
