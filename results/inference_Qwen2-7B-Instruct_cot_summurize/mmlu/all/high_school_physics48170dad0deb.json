                    "text": "A. The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.\n\nThis statement is correct because, for a given temperature, the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas is directly proportional to the root mean square speed of those particles. Hydrogen atoms have a smaller atomic mass than nitrogen atoms, which means that at the same temperature, hydrogen atoms will move faster (have a higher root mean square speed) and thus have greater average kinetic energy.\n\nB. The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The average force exerted on the container is determined by the average pressure exerted by the gas molecules, which is related to the number of collisions per unit area and the kinetic energy of the molecules. Since the hydrogen and nitrogen molecules have the same volume and temperature ( and assuming equal number of molecules in both containers, their average pressures would be the same, and so would be the average force exerted on the container.\n\nC. The density of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Density is generally inversely proportional to molecular mass for a given temperature and pressure. Since hydrogen has a lower molecular mass than nitrogen, it would have a higher density if all other conditions were the same.\n\nD. The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. For ideal gases under the same temperature and volume, the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to the number of moles ( (or equivalently, the number of molecules) according to the Ideal Gas Law (PV=nRT. So if the temperature and volume are the same, you can compare pressures based on the number of molecules in each container."
