In this case, those heirs are Joan and the Salvation Army. Thus, Mary's estate would be split evenly between them. \n\nOptions A, B, and D suggest potential complexities or conditions not present in the original scenario described. For example, option B implies that there is some procedural requirement for Joan to file a petition to avoid the bequest to the Salvation Army, which isn't indicated in the information given. Similarly, option D introduces the concept of \"income for life\" which isn't suggested by the terms of the will provided."
