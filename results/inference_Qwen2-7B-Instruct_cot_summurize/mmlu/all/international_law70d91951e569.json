When it is not committed against another vessel and when it is not committed for 'private ends'.\n\nPiracy, under international law as defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ( and the International Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, generally involves acts of violence or detention that are committed for private ends against a ship, aircraft, or other object on the high seas or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any State.\n\nAn illegal act of violence on the high seas falls short of qualifying as piracy if:\n\n1. It is not committed against a vessel or aircraft. For example, if the act is committed against a floating platform or other structure on the high seas.\n2. It is not committed for 'private ends'. This means the act must be carried out with the intent to gain something of value, such as ransom or loot, rather than for political, ideological, or state-sponsored reasons.\n\nOptions A, B, and C describe scenarios where acts of violence might still be considered piracy depending on the circumstances, including the nature of the vessel being attacked (whether it's a public vessel or a private one, and whether the act is committed for personal gain. Option C specifically mentions a warship, which could potentially be subject to different legal considerations under international law, especially if the mutiny involves personnel from another state. However, the core requirement for piracy remains that the act must be committed against a vessel or aircraft and for private gain."
