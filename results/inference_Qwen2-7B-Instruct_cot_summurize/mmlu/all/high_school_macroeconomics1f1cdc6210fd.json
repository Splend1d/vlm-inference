The nominal interest rates falls.\n\nWhen the money supply increases, assuming that the money demand curve is downward sloping, this typically leads to a decrease in nominal interest rates. This is because with more money available in the economy, there is a greater supply of funds relative to the demand for those funds at any given interest rate. As a result, lenders are willing to lend at lower interest rates to attract borrowers, causing the equilibrium interest rate to fall. This is a key concept in monetary economics, often associated with the quantity theory of money and the role of central banks in managing monetary policy."
