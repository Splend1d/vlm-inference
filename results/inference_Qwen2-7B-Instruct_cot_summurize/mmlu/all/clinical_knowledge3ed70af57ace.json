The body replenishes ATP through various metabolic pathways, but during intense exercise, the demand for ATP can quickly exceed the supply, leading to a state where the ATP supply cannot keep up with the demand. This imbalance causes fatigue as the muscles struggle to contract effectively due to the lack of sufficient energy."
