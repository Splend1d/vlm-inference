Suppression of the immune system.\n\nWhen a person experiences continued stress, their body releases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can have a number of negative effects on the body when they are present in high levels for extended periods of time. One of the effects of prolonged stress is that it can suppress the immune system. This means that the body may not be able to fight off infections and diseases as effectively as it should. This increased vulnerability to illness is one of the ways that chronic stress can lead to damage to health and reduce longevity. \n\nOptions A, C, and D are also consequences of stress but they are not the direct result of the stress itself. Option A, over-exercising, can happen as a response to stress, but it's not an inherent effect of stress. Option C, less eating or severe eating disorders, can occur due to stress-induced changes in appetite, but it's not a direct consequence of the stress hormone itself. Option D, engaging in risky behaviors like speeding or not using a seat belts, while common among stressed individuals, is a behavioral response rather than a physiological effect of stress."
