The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart.\n\nWhen a liquid substance like ammonia (NH3 reaches its boiling point, the energy added to the system causes the kinetic energy of its molecules to increase. This increased energy leads to the breaking of intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonds in the case of NH3, allowing the molecules to move more freely and transition from the liquid phase to the gas phase."
