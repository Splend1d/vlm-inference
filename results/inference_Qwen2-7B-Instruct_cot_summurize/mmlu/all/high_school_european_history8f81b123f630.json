A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following contributed the LEAST to the health and hunger problems faced by the French people in the seventeenth century?\n\nA. Low-productivity agricultural practices\nB. Adverse weather\nC. Low taxes on the peasants and middle class\nD. Poor transportation\n"

Low taxes on the peasants and middle class\n\nThe low taxes on the peasants and middle class would actually have provided some relief to those struggling with hunger and other economic hardships. It's less likely that this factor contributed significantly to the health and hunger problems described in the passage. Instead, it might have been a result or a temporary solution to the issues faced by the population.\n\nA. Low-productivity agricultural practices: These would have made it difficult for farmers to produce sufficient food, contributing to food shortages and famine.\n\nB. Adverse weather: Harsh weather conditions, such as droughts, floods, or extreme cold, can devastate crops and lead to food scarcity.\n\nD. Poor transportation: Inefficient transportation systems could hinder the distribution of food, making it harder for people to access what little food was available."
