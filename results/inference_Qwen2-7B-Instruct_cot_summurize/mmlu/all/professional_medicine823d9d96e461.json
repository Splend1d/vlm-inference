His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation. Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?\n\nA. Disruption of vascular basement membranes\nB. Increased hydrostatic pressure\nC. Release of thromboxane\nD. Separation of endothelial junctions\n"

Increased hydrostatic pressure\n\nThis occurs when there is an increase in blood volume or hypertension, leading to an increase in the pressure within the blood vessels. This increased pressure forces more fluid out of the capillaries and into the surrounding tissues, resulting in edema or swelling. In this case, the patient's wound might have led to inflammation, which can cause vasodilation and increased permeability of the capillary walls, allowing more fluid to leak into the interstitial space and contribute to the edema. The other options listed ( disruption of vascular basement membranes, release of thromboxane, and separation of endothelial junctions, are can also contribute to inflammation and edema but are not the most direct explanation for the development of edema in this scenario based on the information provided."
