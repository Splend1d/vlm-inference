DPI ( Disposable Personal Income will be greater than PI ( Personal Income.\n\nTransfer payments, which include government benefits such as social security, unemployment insurance, and welfare, do not factor into the calculation of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP. However, they do impact other economic measures like Personal Income ( PI and Disposable Personal Income DPI.\n\nPersonal Income (PI) includes wages, salaries, rental income, interest income, and other income sources, but it does not include any government transfers or subsidies. \n\nDisposable Personal Income ( DPI, on the other hand, is PI minus personal taxes ( including income taxes, sales taxes, etc., plus any government transfer payments received by households. \n\nIf transfer payments are greater than the sum of Social Security contributions, corporate taxes, and retained earnings combined, this means that households are receiving more in government benefits than they are paying out in these forms. This would increase DPI, since the additional government benefits are added back to PI when calculating DPI, making DPI greater than PI."
