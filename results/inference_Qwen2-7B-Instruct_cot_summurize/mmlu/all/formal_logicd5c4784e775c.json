(\u2200x)[Bx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Ny \u2022 Lxy)].\n\nThis formula correctly expresses that for every x, if x is a bird (Bx), then there exists some y such that y is a nest (Ny) and x lives in y (Lxy). \n\nLet's quickly look at the other options:\n\nA. (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[(Bx \u2022 Ny) \u2283 Lxy]: This statement says that for all x and for all y, if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. This is not what the original sentence states - it does not specify that each bird must live in a nest.\n\nC. (\u2200x)[(\u2203y)(Ny \u2022 Bx) \u2283 Lxy]: This statement says that for all x, if there exists some y that is both a nest and a bird, then x lives in y. This is also incorrect because it suggests that a bird can be both a bird and a nest simultaneously, which is not what the original sentence states.\n\nD. (\u2200x)(\u2203y)[(Bx \u2022 Ny) \u2283 Lxy]: This statement says that for all x, there exists some y such that if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. This is similar to option B but with a different order of quantifiers. It still does not capture the intended meaning of the original sentence as clearly as option B.\n\nTherefore, option B is the best choice."
