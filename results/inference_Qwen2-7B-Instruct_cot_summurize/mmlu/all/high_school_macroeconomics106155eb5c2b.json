Removal of the investment tax credit\n\nRemoving the investment tax credit would likely slow a nation's economic growth because it would reduce incentives for businesses to invest in new equipment, technology, and infrastructure. This could lead to slower productivity growth and reduced capacity for the economy to produce goods and services.\n\nA. Guaranteed low-interest loans for college students: This can stimulate economic growth by increasing human capital and potentially leading to higher productivity and wages in the future.\n\nB. Removal of a tax on income earned on saving: This could encourage more saving and investment, which typically contributes to economic growth.\n\nD. More research grants given to medical schools: This can lead to advancements in healthcare and biotechnology, which can drive innovation and economic growth."
