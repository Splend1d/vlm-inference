In the short run, an increase in the money supply can lead to an increase in aggregate demand, which can boost economic activity, including production and employment. However, if this increase in the money supply continues over the long term, it will likely lead to inflation as the economy adjusts to the new amount of money in circulation. This does not necessarily mean that the inflation will be high, but it is expected that inflation will rise over time if the money supply grows faster than the economy's productive capacity."
