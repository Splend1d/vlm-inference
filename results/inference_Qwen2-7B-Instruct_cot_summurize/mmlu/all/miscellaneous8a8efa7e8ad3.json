Strong nuclear force\n4. Weak nuclear force\n\nCentrifugal force is an apparent force that appears to push a body outward when it rotates around a circular path. It does not qualify as a fundamental force because it is not a direct interaction between particles, but rather a consequence of acceleration and the inertia of the object."
