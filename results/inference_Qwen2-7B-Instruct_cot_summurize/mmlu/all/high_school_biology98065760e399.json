A and B.\n\nCattle breeders have indeed used both artificial selection and directional selection to improve the quality of meat over the years.\n\nArtificial selection, also known as selective breeding, involves humans choosing which animals in a population to breed based on specific traits they desire. Over generations, this process can lead to significant changes in the characteristics of the population. In the context of cattle, breeders might select for traits such as leaner meat, higher marbling (which refers to the desirable fat distribution within the muscle, or faster growth rates.\n\nDirectional selection, on the other hand, is a type of natural selection where the population evolves towards a single extreme phenotype. However, in the context of cattle breeding, it's often implemented through artificial selection rather than occurring naturally. Breeders might apply directional selection by consistently selecting for animals that exhibit the most desirable trait for meat quality, pushing the entire population in that direction over time.\n\nBoth methods allow cattle breeders to enhance the quality of meat, making it more tender, flavorful, and nutritious, depending on the specific goals of the breeding program."
