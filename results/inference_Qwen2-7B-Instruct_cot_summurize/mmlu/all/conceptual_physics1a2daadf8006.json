Mass distorts spacetime: This is the essence of general relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n\nB. Gravity affects clocks: In the presence of strong gravitational fields (like near a massive object or in a black hole), time actually runs slower compared to regions with weaker gravitational fields. This phenomenon is known as gravitational time dilation.\n\nC. Light can\u2019t escape from a black hole: A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it once it crosses the event horizon, the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape."
