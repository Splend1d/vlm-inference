This is often due to the intensity of their activism and the resources they can dedicate to influencing policymakers. For example, the NRA has been successful in pushing through gun rights legislation even when public opinion polls indicate that the majority of Americans support stricter gun laws. Similarly, antiabortion activists have influenced policies related to abortion access despite the fact that many Americans support legal abortion rights. These examples illustrate that the intensity of a minority's commitment to activism can sometimes override majority opinion in the realm of domestic policy."
