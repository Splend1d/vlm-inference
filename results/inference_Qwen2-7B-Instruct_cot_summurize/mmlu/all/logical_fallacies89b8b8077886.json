If the person does not take the test, they cannot do well on it, and thus, according to the premise, they will be mad.\n\nOptions C (\"My birthday is today\") does not logically follow from the given major premise, as it does not relate to the outcomes of doing well on the test or being being mad. Therefore, it cannot lead to a valid conclusion based on the provided information.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D, both A and B."
