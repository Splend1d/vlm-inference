This could potentially wake them up unexpectedly or cause some disturbance, especially if it involves loud noises or strong odors. In this case, the action can be considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character's pride in their own SAT test scores is not an action that affects others and is generally seen as a positive attribute, as it indicates personal accomplishment and achievement. Therefore, it is not considered morally wrong."
