This process involves not only direct observation but also the internalization of behaviors, attitudes, and values seen in these role models. In the context of gender identity, children may learn about what it means to be male or female by observing and imitating behaviors typically associated with their own gender.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D are play roles in gender development, they do not align with the core principles of social learning theory:\n\nA. Chromosomal differences and prenatal hormone levels are biological factors that influence gender development, but according to social learning theory, they do not directly result in gender identity. These factors establish the physical differences between males and females but do not determine how one perceives and identifies with those characteristics.\n\nB. The Oedipus complex is a concept from psychoanalytic theory, proposed by Sigmmond Freud, which suggests that during early childhood, children develop unconscious sexual desires towards the opposite-sex parent and a hostile or jealous attitude toward the same-sex parent. While this can influence various aspects of personality development, it does not specifically explain the development of gender identity according to social learning theory.\n\nD. Reinforcement of gender-appropriate behaviors and punishment of gender-inappropriate behaviors can certainly influence how an individual behaves and conforms to societal expectations regarding gender roles. However, social learning theory focuses on the observation and imitation of models rather than the reinforcement of behaviors themselves as the primary mechanism for learning gender identity."
