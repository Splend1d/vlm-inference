While he was watching television in his hotel room, a thief picked the lock on the hotel room door, entered, hit the traveler over the head, and stole his wallet. The traveler, who suffered a concussion, was hospitalized for three days. The lock on the hotel room door fully complied with a local ordinance that prescribed minimum security standards for hotel locks.

The hotel had fulfilled its duty to provide a reasonably secure environment by having a lock that met local security standards. Once the thief entered the room, the hotel's responsibility for the traveler's safety ended. The hotel is not liable for subsequent criminal acts by third parties, such as theft or assault, unless there was some ongoing negligence or failure to secure the premises after the initial breach of security ( which does not seem to be the case here. Therefore, the traveler would not prevail in this situation."
