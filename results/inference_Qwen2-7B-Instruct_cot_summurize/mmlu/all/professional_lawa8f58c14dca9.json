                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The man, the adult principal, must be convicted before any prosecution can be maintained against a minor.\n\nIn legal terms, when dealing with cases involving adults and minors, the prosecution typically needs to establish the guilt of the adult first. This is because the relationship between the adult and the minor can impact the charges and defenses available. In this scenario, if the man is found guilty of the charges against him, it would logically follow that he contributed to the delinquency of the minor. Consequently, the prosecution might have a stronger case for charging the 14-year-old girl with being an accomplice to the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not accurately reflect the legal principles involved in such cases:\n\nA. Whether someone is an accomplice depends on their actions and intent in relation to the crime, not solely on whether they smoked marijuana. The girl could still be an accomplice if she knowingly and willingly participated in the act or facilitated it.\n\nC. A minor can be prosecuted for certain crimes, including those related to delinquency. However, the prosecution process and potential sentences may differ from those for adults due to considerations regarding the minor's age and maturity.\n\nD. While laws often aim to protect minors, the prosecution of minors as accomplices can still occur based on the specific circumstances of the case and applicable laws. The fact that a law is designed to protect minors does not automatically exempt minors from prosecution for certain actions."
