They do not use reverse transcriptase (RT), which is involved in converting RNA into DNA during the replication process seen in some other RNA viruses. \n\nSo, while none of your provided options are entirely correct based on the information you've given, option C (\"ds RNA virus\") comes closest to describing the genetic structure of rotavirus. However, it's important to note that rotaviruses specifically do not fit neatly into any of these categories due to their unique properties and replication mechanisms."
