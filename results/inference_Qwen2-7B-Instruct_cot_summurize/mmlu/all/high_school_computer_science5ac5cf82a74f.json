Program documentation is useful during initial program development and also when modifications are made to existing programs.\n\nProgram documentation serves as a guide for understanding how the program works, its purpose, and how it should be used or modified. It is essential throughout the lifecycle of a program, not just during development. Documentation helps in maintenance, debugging, and future enhancements, especially when multiple developers work on the same project or when the original developer is no longer available."
