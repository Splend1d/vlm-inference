Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the act of baring one's entire naked body at a beach where clothing is typically expected can be considered morally wrong, especially if there are are clear signs indicating that full nudity is not allowed ( or if the action causes distress or discomfort to others. This might infringe upon others' reasonable expectations of privacy and modesty.\n\nIn Scenario 2, encouraging someone to jump off a couch could be seen as not necessarily morally wrong if the person is an experienced athlete or acrobat familiar with the risks involved, and both parties were aware of the potential consequences. However, in most contexts, especially without proper safety measures or consent from the individual, such an action could be viewed as irresponsible or potentially harmful, depending on the circumstances and the relationship between the individuals involved. \n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong act, while Scenario 2 does not necessarily involve a morally wrong act, provided that any encouragement was done responsibly and with awareness of the risks involved."
