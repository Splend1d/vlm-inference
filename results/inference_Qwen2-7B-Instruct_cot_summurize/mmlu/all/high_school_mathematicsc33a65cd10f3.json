Since the longer side is 11 inches, we're essentially folding along the 8.5-inch side. After the first fold, the dimensions become \\(8.5\\) by \\(\\frac{11}{2}\\) = \\(8.5\\) by \\(5.5\\).\n3. **Second Fold**: Now, we have a rectangle that is \\(8.5\\) inches by \\(5.5\\) inches. We fold it in half again, shortening the new long side. This time, we're folding along the \\(8.5\\)-inch side. After the second fold, the dimensions become \\(5.5\\) by \\(\\frac{8.5}{2}\\) = \\(5.5\\) by \\(4.25\\).\n\nThe question asks for the length of the longest side immediately after the second fold, which is \\(5.5\\) inches.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. 5.5**."
