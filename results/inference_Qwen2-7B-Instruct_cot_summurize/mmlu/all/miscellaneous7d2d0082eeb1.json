Action and movement\n\nGesture drawing is a type of drawing that focuses on capturing the overall shape, form, and movement of the subject rather than detailed accuracy or precise realism. The goal is to quickly convey the essence or energy of the subject, often by exaggerating the pose and simplifying the details. This style of drawing often uses loose, expressive lines and shapes to emphasize action and movement."
