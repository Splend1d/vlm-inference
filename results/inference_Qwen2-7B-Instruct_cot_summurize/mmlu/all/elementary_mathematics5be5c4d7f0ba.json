He wants to distribute 12 rolls of paper towels equally across 4 rooms. The equation he used, 12 \u00f7 t = 4, is solving for how many rolls go into each room (t. \n\nWhen we rearrange this problem into a multiplication format, we're essentially asking, \"What number, when multiplied by the number of rooms (4, gives us the total number of rolls 12?\" This translates directly into the equation 4 \u00d7 t = 12. This equation asks us to find the value of t that, when multiplied by 4, equals 12, which is the same goal as the original division problem.\n\nLet's quickly check the other options:\n\nA. 4 \u00f7 12 = t: This would give a fraction or decimal value for t, not an integer, and it doesn't represent the distribution of rolls equally across rooms.\n\nB. 4 \u2013 t = 12: This equation suggests subtraction, which doesn't logically fit the scenario of distributing items equally.\n\nC. 4 + 12 = t: This equation suggests adding more rolls than there are, which contradicts the original context of distributing all available rolls.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. 4 \u00d7 t = 12, because it correctly represents finding the number of rolls (t, that when multiplied by the number of rooms (4, gives the total number of rolls 12."
