He suggested that in societies where fathers were absent or had little involvement, the likelihood of homosexuality among males increased. This theory was based on his observations of various cultures around the world and their patterns of paternal absence and homosexual behavior.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this theory has been widely criticized by the scientific community for lacking empirical evidence and being based on questionable assumptions. Modern research on the causes of homosexuality generally supports a more complex model involving both genetic and environmental factors, rather than attributing it solely to paternal absence."
