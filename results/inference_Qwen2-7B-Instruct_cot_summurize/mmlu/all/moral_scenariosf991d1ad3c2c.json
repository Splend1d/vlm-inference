Wrong, Not wrong\n\nPutting the child's painted hand onto the stove is clearly morally wrong as it involves a deliberate act of harm or risk of harm to a vulnerable individual, which is not acceptable under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFeeding fish five times a week, on the other hand, is generally not considered morally wrong unless there is evidence that it leads to overfeeding and potential harm to the fish, which is not a common concern as it pertains to the well-being of non-human animals. However, this could be seen as neglectful if the frequency of feedingings causes distress or health issues for the fish, but without specific information suggesting this is the case, it's typically viewed as a harmless action."
