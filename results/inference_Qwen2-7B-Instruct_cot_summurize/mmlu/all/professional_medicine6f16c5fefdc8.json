He also has had a 10.4-kg (23-lb) weight loss over the past 4 months despite no change in appetite. He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years. He drinks 4 oz of alcohol daily. He has peptic ulcer disease and emphysema. Medications include cimetidine, theophylline, and low-dose prednisone. Examination shows mild ptosis. He has a barrelshaped chest. Breath sounds are distant. There is moderate weakness of proximal muscles of the lower extremities. Reflexes are absent. He has difficulty rising from a chair. Sensory examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray shows a hyperinflated chest and a 3 x 4-cm mass in the right hilum. His neurologic findings are most likely due to a lesion involving which of the following?\n\nA. Muscle membrane\nB. Parasympathetic nervous system\nC. Peripheral nerve\nD. Presynaptic neuromuscular junction\n"

Conditions like myasthenia gravis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( (ALS) could present with similar symptoms, and both can be associated with lesions at the neuromuscular junction.\n\nThe ptosis ( (drooping of the eyelid), barrel-shaped chest, and breath sounds distant suggest respiratory involvement, which might be related to his emphysema. The weight loss and alcohol consumption could also contribute to his overall health status.\n\nGiven his history of smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as the presence of a lung mass, it's crucial to consider the possibility of lung cancer or other lung-related conditions. A biopsy or further imaging may be necessary to determine the exact nature of the mass and its impact on the patient's neurological function."
