While these cases do not explicitly state that evil intentions always involve the origination of harmful sequences, they do highlight the moral complexities involved in distinguishing between different types of intentions and actions.\n\nIn Rescue I, the scenario involves two children drowning, and the choice between saving one or the other. This case is often used to discuss the moral implications of making choices when faced with the possibility of causing harm to others, particularly in situations involving unequal burdens of harm.\n\nRescue II builds upon Rescue I by introducing an additional scenario where the choice involves saving either one child or allowing them both to drown. This case further explores the ethical considerations of intervention versus non-intervention, especially when it comes to the potential for causing harm through action versus inaction.\n\nBoth cases aim to challenge conventional thinking about moral responsibility and the distinction between good and evil intentions, as well as the role of intention in evaluating the morality of actions that lead to harm."
