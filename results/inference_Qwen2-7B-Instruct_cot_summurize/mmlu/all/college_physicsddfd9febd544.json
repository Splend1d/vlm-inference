When it moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field, known as the Lorentz force. \n\nIn this scenario, the proton's trajectory is not affected by the magnetic field B in the +y-direction, which means the magnetic force is zero ( because the proton's velocity vector is along the z-axis, and the magnetic field is perpendicular to it. This implies there's no change in the proton's direction due to the magnetic field.\n\nHowever, when the proton moves through the electric field E in the +x-direction, it experiences a force \\( F = qE \\) ( where \\( q \\) is the charge of the proton ( and \\( E \\) is the electric field strength. Since the proton has a positive charge, this force will act in the opposite direction of the electric field, i.e., in the -x-direction. \n\nThus, if the potential difference was doubled from V to 2V, the proton would experience twice the force from the electric field, causing it to be deflected even more in the -x-direction. Therefore, the correct answer is B: deflected in the -x-direction."
