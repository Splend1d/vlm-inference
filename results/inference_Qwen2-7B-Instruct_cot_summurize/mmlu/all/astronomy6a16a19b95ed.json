While there are various theories, including panspermia ( (B), where life is believed to have originated elsewhere in the universe and then spread to Earth, or the idea that life arose independently on Earth through a series of chemical reactions (often referred to as abiogenesis, there is no definitive proof to support any single theory conclusively. The study of this topic involves fields like astrobiology, geology, and molecular biology, among others."
