Pouch of Douglas\n\nThe pouch of Douglas is the space between the pelvic sidewall and the rectum. It's the lowest part of the peritoneal cavity, and it's where free fluid tends to accumulate due to gravity. In cases of ectopic pregnancy rupture, this location is common for the collection of hemorrhagic fluid."
