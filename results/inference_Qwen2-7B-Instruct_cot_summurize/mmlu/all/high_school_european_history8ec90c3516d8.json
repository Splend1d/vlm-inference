One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nThe ideas expressed by Voltaire, above, best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?\n\nA. Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe.\nB. They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\nC. Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.\nD. Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n"

Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nVoltaire's response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake reflects his views on the natural world and humanity's place within it. He acknowledges the cruelty of nature and the devastating effects of earthquakes, suggesting that even in the \"best of possible worlds,\" such disasters occur. His mention of the suffering of ants and the destruction of lives across Europe highlights his concern for human suffering and the unpredictability of life. \n\nMoreover, Voltaire uses this event to critique society and its institutions, particularly the Inquisition. He implies that the earth's capacity to swallow up entire societies, including those who claim moral superiority, underscores the folly of human arrogance and persecution. This sentiment align with the Enlightenment's broader themes of skepticism towards traditional authority and dogma, advocating for a more rational and tolerant society based on empirical evidence and reason.\n\nWhile Voltaire was indeed a prominent intellectual during the Enlightenment, known for his contributions to literature, philosophy, and political thought, the passage provided does not directly highlight his scientific achievements ( option A) or the methods of communication ( option B). Additionally, it does not suggest that he rejected religion altogether or adopted atheism as a creed, although he was a critic of religious intolerance and superstition ( option C).\n\nTherefore, the most fitting characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals that the passage above best illustrates is D: many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues."
