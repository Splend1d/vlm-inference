Insanity.\n\nIf the man's acquittal was based on insanity, the defendant (who provided the gun and instructed the man to commit the crime, can argue that he did not intend for the act to be carried out as he believed the man would not follow through with the killing due to his mental state. This could potentially be used as a defense in the defendant's trial for the same murder charge, claiming he lacked the intent necessary for murder because he believed the individual who received the gun was incapable of carrying out the act due to mental illness. However, this defense may vary in effectiveness depending on the jurisdiction and specifics of the case."
