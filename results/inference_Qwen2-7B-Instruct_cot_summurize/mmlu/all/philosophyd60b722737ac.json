Psychological egoism is the ethical theory that all human actions are motivated by self-interest. The argument that supports this theory usually involves reasoning and philosophical deduction rather than empirical evidence, which is data collected through observation or experimentation. \n\nTherefore, options A (make reference to neuroscience., B. are based on controlled studies., and C. are based on interviews and surveys. all involve empirical methods, which are not typically used in arguments for psychological egoism as they aim to explain motivations rather than observe behavior directly."
