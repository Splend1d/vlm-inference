It's following rules and ensuring safety.\n\nIn Scenario 2, attending an office Christmas party while being sick might be seen as spreading illness, which could be considered morally wrong, especially if it endangers others' health. However, this also depends on the context - if the office is aware of the employee's condition and there are no severe symptoms that could cause harm to others, attending might not be as clearly morally wrong. But generally speaking, given the potential risk to others, attending a gathering while sick can be viewed as irresponsible or inconsiderate."
