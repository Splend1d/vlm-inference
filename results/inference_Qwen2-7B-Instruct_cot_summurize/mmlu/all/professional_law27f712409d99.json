When the boy's mother inquired about the lipstick stains, the boy said that his teacher had kissed him. The mother then contacted the police, who subsequently conducted an investigation and arrested the teacher, charging her with two felony counts of child molestation. In accord with state law, a preliminary hearing was scheduled. After the boy was subpoenaed to testify at the preliminary hearing, the prosecution filed a motion to exclude the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's appearance. The motion, with supporting affidavits from a child psychologist, claimed that having the boy and the teacher in the same room would cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the alleged victim. The judge should\n\nA. deny the motion, because a pretrial proceeding is an early stage of trial, and a defendant has a constitutional right of confrontation at every stage of the trial.\nB. deny the motion, because the teacher's exclusion from the courtroom would have prejudicial impact on receiving effective assistance of counsel.\nC. grant the motion, because the teacher's attorney still has an opportunity to cross-examine the witness despite the teacher's absence from the courtroom.\nD. grant the motion, because cross-examination at a preliminary hearing is not required by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\n"

It ensures that the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine any witnesses whose testimony is being to be used against them in court. This provision applies only during the trial itself and does not extend to preliminary hearings or other pretrial proceedings. \n\nPreliminary hearings serve different purposes than full trials, primarily to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to bind a defendant over for trial. As such, the rules regarding witness presence, confrontation, and cross-examination may differ. In this case, the judge might grant the motion to exclude the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's testimony if they believe it would be detrimental to the child's emotional well-being. This decision could be made in the interest of protecting the child and ensuring that the proceedings do not cause further harm.\n\nIt's important to note that each jurisdiction might have its own specific laws and practices regarding preliminary hearings and witness protection, so the exact ruling could vary based on local statutes and judicial interpretations."
