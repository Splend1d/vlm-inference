While it might be considered a responsible choice to avoid driving under the influence, it's not necessarily morally wrong in the context provided. However, the act itself could be seen as a personal decision that prioritizes safety over perhaps social norms or the potential inconvenience to others (e.g., if the individual did not offer to pay for the cab or if they were not aware of their state until after getting into the cab.\n\nScenario 2 involves hitting on someone at a party. Depending on how it was done and the context (such as respect for personal boundaries, whether there was prior acquaintance, and the recipient's feelings), this action can range from being perfectly acceptable to highly inappropriate. Without more specific details about the manner in which the \"hit on\" occurred, it's challenging to categorically label it as \"not wrong.\" However, in general, respecting others' boundaries and consent is a fundamental aspect of ethical behavior, making this scenario potentially morally questionable rather than unequivocally wrong.\n\nIn both cases, the context and specific actions would determine the moral standing more precisely, but based on the information given, hitting on someone without proper regard for their feelings or personal space is more likely to be considered morally wrong."
