Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the main character allows food servers into a zoo fundraiser without permission, which disrupts the event and could potentially cause harm or distress to the animals. This action goes against ordinary moral standards of respect for property and consideration for others' events.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character offers to help his pregnant wife with heavy trash, which is a thoughtful and supportive act. There is no clear indication of wrongdoing in this scenario since helping someone in need is generally considered a positive and moral action."
