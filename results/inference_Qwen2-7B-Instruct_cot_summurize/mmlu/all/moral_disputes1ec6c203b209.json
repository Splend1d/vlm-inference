It argues that ethical deliberation should involve not just abstract principles or detached reasoning, but also empathy, understanding, and concern for the well-being of others. This approach often critiques traditional moral theories like utilitarianism or deontology for their overemphasis on impersonal rules or consequences.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice to reflecting a key claim of care ethics would be:\n\nA. Deliberation should include sympathy and direct attendance to concrete particulars.\n\nThis aligns with the core idea that care ethics advocates for attending to the specific needs and situations of individuals ( \"concrete particulars\" - while also considering the emotional responses (\"sympathy\") that arise from such encounters. This holistic approach contrasts with options B, C, and D, which either overly limit or exclude certain aspects of ethical consideration that care ethics seeks to incorporate."
