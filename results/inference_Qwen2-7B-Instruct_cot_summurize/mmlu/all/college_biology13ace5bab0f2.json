The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\n\nA. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\nB. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\nC. The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\nD. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\n"

                    "text": "The correct statement based on the theory provided is:\n\nA. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\n\nExplanation: Osmotic shock occurs when there is a rapid change in the concentration of solutes across a semi-permeable membrane, causing water to move into or out of the cell. In this scenario, the exposure to water (which increases the external solution's solute concentration relative to the pollen grain's interior - would cause water to move out of the pollen grain, assuming its interior was initially hypotonic ( (having fewer solutes than the external environment). This movement of water can lead to the release of starch granules from the pollen grain if the osmotic pressure difference is significant enough. Plasmolysis, which is the process of a cell's cytoplasm pulling away from the cell wall due to dehydration, is not directly mentioned in the context of this theory, and shrinking before rupturing is not a standard biological response under normal conditions."
