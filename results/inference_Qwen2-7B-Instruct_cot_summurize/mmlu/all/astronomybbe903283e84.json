All the constellations listed - Perseus, Cygnus, and Scorpius - contain parts of the Milky Way galaxy as viewed from Earth. The constellation Leo, however, does not directly align with the galactic plane where the majority of the Milky Way's stars reside. Instead, it is positioned more towards the outer regions of our galaxy. So technically, Leo is not \"along\" the Milky Way as seen from Earth, but it still contains stars that are part of the Milky Way."
