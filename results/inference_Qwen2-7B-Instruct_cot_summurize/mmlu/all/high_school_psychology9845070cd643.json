In the pre-operational stage, children typically range from about 2 to 7 years old and are not yet able to understand concepts of conservation ( which refers to the understanding that certain properties of objects remain constant despite changes in their appearance.\n\nFor example, a child might be shown two identical balls of clay, one flattened out and one round, but the same volume. A child in the pre-operational stage might believe that the flat ball contains more clay than the round one because it takes up more space, whereas a child in the concrete operational stage would understand that the amount of clay is the same regardless of its shape.\n\nTo determine if a child is in the pre-operational or concrete operational stage, Piaget would use tasks that assess understanding of conservation. If a child fails to understand conservation, they are likely in the pre-operational stage. If they do understand conservation, they are likely in the concrete operational stage."
