Looting and theft, especially where corruption is endemic, states are weak, and weapons stockpiles are not properly secured.\n\nThis option acknowledges that in situations where states are weak, have high levels of corruption, or lack adequate security measures for their weapon stockpiles, there is a higher risk of weapons being stolen or looted and entering the illicit arms market. This can include cases where officials involved in the procurement, storage, or distribution of military equipment engage in illegal activities, such as selling weapons for personal gain or to external entities. Additionally, in conflict zones or areas with weak governance, weapons may simply be taken from government stores by non-state actors, including armed groups and criminal organizations."
