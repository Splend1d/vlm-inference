It limits the dangers of factionalism by diluting political power.\n\nIn The Federalist Papers, particularly in Federalist No. 10, James Madison discusses the problem of factions\u2014interest groups that seek to advance their own goals at the expense of others. He argues that large republics, like the United States under a federal system, can mitigate the effects of factions through the distribution of power between the federal government and the states. This system, according to Madison, helps to prevent any one faction from gaining too much power, thus reducing the likelihood of tyranny or oppression by a dominant group."
