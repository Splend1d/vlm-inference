The following month, the doctor was granted a license to practice optometry in that neighboring state by its board of optometrists. For approximately one year, the doctor was engaged in the practice of optometry in the neighboring state. Subsequently, the doctor decided to relocate his practice to the state for which Section 2022(a) applies. The doctor re-domiciled in the state, where he opened a new office for the practice of optometry. When he initially opened his office, the doctor was unaware of the state's licensing provision for optometrists. Since the doctor was a licensed optometrist for 10 years, he assumed that he could practice optometry in the state by reciprocity. The doctor received notification from the state's board of optometrists that he was illegally practicing optometry and that he must immediately cease and desist from such practice. If the doctor challenges the constitutionality of Section 2022(a) of the medical licensing statute as violating the Commerce Clause, which of the following, if factually true, is the WEAKEST defense that the state could offer?\n\nA. The statute will help to ensure that only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state.\nB. The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.\nC. The statute will help to ensure a continuously available number of practicing optometrists within the state.\nD. The statute will help to ensure that the practicing optometrists in the state are subject to standards of a regulatory body.\n"

The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.\n\nWhile this might be a legitimate concern for the state to address, it does not directly relate to the Commerce Clause's prohibition on protectionist measures that burden or discriminate against interstate commerce. The other options (A, C, and D, relate more directly to the qualifications, education, and regulation of optometrists within the state, which are are more in line with traditional state police powers that are generally not subject to Commerce Clause scrutiny under the rational basis test or the substantial relation test. However, it's important to note that the strength of any defense would depend on the specific application of the Commerce Clause in the context of the case and the interpretation of the Supreme Court at the time the case is decided."
