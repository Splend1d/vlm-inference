The operation here is composition of permutations.\n\nFor a group of permutations of 5 objects, we're looking at the symmetric group \\(S_5\\), which consists of all possible permutations of 5 elements.\n\nThe largest order of an element in \\(S_n\\) ( for any \\(n\\) can be found by considering cycles in permutations. The order of a permutation is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the cycles in its cycle decomposition.\n\nTo maximize the order, we want to maximize the LCM of cycle lengths. The largest cycle length in \\(S_5\\) is 5 ( (a single 5-cycle). However, since we're dealing with permutations of 5 objects, we can't have a single cycle of length 5 without leaving out one of the objects, which would not make sense as we need to account for all 5 objects.\n\nInstead, consider the scenario of using all available cycles while maximizing their lengths: we could use one 4-cycle and one 1-cycle ( or two 3-cycles, etc., but these configurations won't yield the maximum order directly because they don't fully utilize the maximum cycle lengths available given the number of elements.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to use cycles that are close to the total number of elements (since the LCM of numbers close to the total number will be higher than if we used smaller numbers. \n\nThus, the optimal configuration is to use one 5-cycle, which would give us the largest order. This is because:\n- A 5-cycle uses all 5 elements and thus maximizes the order.\n- The order of a 5-cycle is simply 5, as it takes 5 applications to return to the starting configuration ( (which is the identity in this context).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. 5"
