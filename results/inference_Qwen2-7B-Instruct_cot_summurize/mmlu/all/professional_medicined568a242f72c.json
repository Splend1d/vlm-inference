On morning rounds you note that the delivery records report that she had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL. Today blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, she is afebrile, and deep tendon reflexes are normal. The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus, and her perineum is slightly edematous. Hematocrit is 33%. She is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring. Which of the following is the most important next step in management?\n\nA. Begin oral methyldopa\nB. Institute fundal massage\nC. Order daily sitz baths\nD. Provide education for well-baby care\n"

Begin oral methyldopa\n\nMethyldopa is often used to manage mild to moderate hypertension in pregnant women, and its use can continue postpartum if necessary. The fact that she had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor suggests that it might still be a concern post-delivery.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider other options as well:\nB. Fundal massage can help reduce postpartum bleeding by encouraging the uterus to contract.\nC. Sitz baths may provide comfort and aid in healing after childbirth, but they are not typically considered a critical management step.\nD. Education for well-baby care is crucial, but given the immediate concerns of postpartum health, this would be less pressing than managing her blood pressure or addressing any signs of excessive bleeding.\n\nTherefore, starting with methyldopa could be the most important step, followed by considering the other options based on further assessment and clinical judgment."
