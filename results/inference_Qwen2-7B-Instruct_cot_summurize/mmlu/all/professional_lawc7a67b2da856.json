Tomato growers in a second state wish to ship tomatoes for sale into the first state but its tomatoes are in compliance only with the federal standards. The tomato growers' association in the second state brought an injunctive action in federal court against the agricultural department of the first state to enjoin enforcement of the genetic engineering rule on the basis of federal preemption. According to U.S. Supreme Court precedent, how will the courts decide the preemption claim?\n\nA. There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.\nB. The injunction will be granted because tomatoes that are in compliance with federal law never have to be approved also under a state law.\nC. When it comes to fresh produce, federal laws will always preempt state laws, and the injunction will be granted for that reason.\nD. The first state's law sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the second state's law and therefore the first state's law is preempted.\n"

The injunction will be granted because tomatoes that are in compliance with federal law never have to be approved also under a state law.\n\nThe principle of preemption occurs when federal law supersedes or takes precedence over conflicting state law. In this case, since the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not use or mention genetic engineering factors in its standards for the sale and transportation of tomatoes, and the tomatoes in question comply with federal standards, there would likely be a finding of preemption. The rationale is that if the tomatoes meet the federal standards, they should also meet the state's standards by default, as the state's standards do not require additional approval or criteria beyond what the federal law specifies. Therefore, the state's prohibition on tomatoes based on a \"genetic engineering factor\" would be considered redundant or conflicting with federal law, leading to the granting of the injunction.\n\nOptions A, C, and D either misinterpret the concept of preemption or present incorrect assumptions about the relationship between federal and state laws in this context."
