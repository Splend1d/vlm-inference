Both of the statements are correct\n\nChildhood stunting, which refers to the failure of an individual's growth and development in comparison with other children of the same age and sex, can indeed affect both short-term and long-term cognitive performance. In the short term, stunted children may have difficulties concentrating, learning, and remembering information, which can impact their academic performance and overall educational progress. These effects are often observed during early childhood education and schooling.\n\nIn the long term, the cognitive impacts of childhood stunting can persist into adulthood, affecting various aspects of life such as memory, attention, problem-solving skills, and executive function. These cognitive deficits can lead to lower educational attainment, reduced job opportunities, and decreased productivity. Additionally, they might also increase the risk of developing chronic diseases and mental health issues later in life.\n\nTherefore, it is accurate to say that childhood stunting before 24 months of age affects both short-term and long-term cognitive performance."
