As a result, the husband drove to his friend's house with a loaded shotgun. Believing that his friend was in an upstairs bedroom, the husband fired the shotgun through the dining room window, as he only wanted to teach him a lesson. Unbeknownst to the husband, his friend's wife was in the dining room and suffered a minor gunshot wound.

However, due to a tragic mistake, he accidentally shot the friend's wife instead. This act also constitutes attempted murder, as the husband had the specific intent to cause serious bodily injury or death to someone (his friend) when he fired the shotgun, and it resulted in an unintended harm to another person (the friend's wife).\n\nIt is important to note that the law typically does not differentiate between the intended victim and the unintended victim in cases of attempted murder if there was a specific intent to commit the crime against one individual, regardless of any unforeseen consequences that may occur. Therefore, the husband could potentially face charges for attempted murder of both his friend and the friend's wife."
