                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Initially, the pH slowly decreases because the added strong acid is reacting with the weak base, consuming the hydroxide ions (OH- produced by the weak base. This reduces the concentration of OH-, causing the pH to decrease. However, since the base is weak, it does not react completely with the strong acid, leaving some OH- ions in solution even after most of the weak base has been neutralized. At the equivalence point, when all the weak base has reacted with the strong acid, the solution will contain only the conjugate acid of the weak base and water. Since the conjugate acid is a weak acid, it will produce a small amount of H+ ions, leading to a pH that is less than 7 but not as low as in option B. Therefore, option A accurately describes the typical behavior of a weak base titration with a strong acid."
