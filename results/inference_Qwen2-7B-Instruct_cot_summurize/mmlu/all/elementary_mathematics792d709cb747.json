However, since the question seems to imply there should be a single correct answer and given the nature of rounding rules where numbers ending in 50-99 round up to the next hundred, options B and C both fit the criteria correctly presented in the context of providing examples of pairs that round to 1,500. \n\nIf the intention was to find a single pair that meets the criteria most directly, both B and C are technically correct under standard rounding rules, but typically, such questions aim for clarity and simplicity. If forced to choose based on common rounding practices, **Option C** ( 1,457 and 1,547 might be considered more straightforward as it clearly falls within the range that rounds to 1,500 without ambiguity. However, it's important to note that both B and C are valid under precise interpretation of the question."
