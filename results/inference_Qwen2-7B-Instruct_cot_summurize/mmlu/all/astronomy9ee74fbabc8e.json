There are many geologic features on Mars that are difficult to explain unless liquid water was once stable at the surface.\n\nMars shows several signs that it had a warmer and wetter past, including:\n\n1. **Valleys and Channels**: Mars has numerous valleys and channels that resemble those formed by flowing water on Earth. These features suggest that large volumes of water flowed across the Martian surface in the past.\n\n2. **Impact Craters**: Some impact craters on Mars show evidence of water erosion, such as terraces or levees-like structures, indicating that water played a role in their formation.\n\n3. **Lakes and Oceans**: There is evidence for ancient lakes and oceans on Mars, indicated by sedimentary layers and outcrops of rocks that might have formed in standing bodies of water. These include the layered sedimentary rocks of the Aeolis quadrangle, which some scientists believe were once covered by an ocean.\n\n4. **Ice Deposits**: Mars has polar ice caps and seasonal frost that are rich in water. The presence of these ice deposits suggests that Mars has held water in the past, although much of it is now locked up in frozen form.\n\n5. **Thermally Active Regions**: Some regions on Mars show signs of recent or ongoing thermal activity, such as the formation of gullies and changes in the shape of sand dunes. While this could also be due to other processes ( like carbon dioxide sublimation, the similarity to Earth's processes suggests water could play a role.\n\n6. **Seasonal Flows**: Observations of water-ice flows on slopes of Mars during the summer suggest that liquid water can still flow on the planet today, albeit under extreme conditions. This indicates that water could have been more stable in the past.\n\nThese features and phenomena provide strong evidence that Mars was once warmer and wetter, supporting the hypothesis that liquid water flowed on its surface in the past."
