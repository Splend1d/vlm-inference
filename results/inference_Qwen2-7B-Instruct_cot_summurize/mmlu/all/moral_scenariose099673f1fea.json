This action can lead to financial hardship and instability, which are are generally viewed as unethical.\n\nIn Scenario 2, driving above the speed limit to defuse a bomb is not considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards. In this context, the urgency and potential life-saving nature of the situation justify breaking the law. The primary concern would be public safety and timely defusal of the bomb, rather than traffic regulations."
