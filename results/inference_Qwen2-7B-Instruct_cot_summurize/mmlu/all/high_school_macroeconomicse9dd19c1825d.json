This action can lead to a decrease in the current supply of the product. \n\nIt's important to note that while this might affect the quantity supplied in the short term, it doesn't necessarily mean there will be no effect on the supply in the future ( (D). The anticipation could also influence how much inventory firms choose to keep, which in turn affects future supply decisions. However, among the options provided, B best directly addresses the immediate impact on supply due to the expectation of a lower future price."
