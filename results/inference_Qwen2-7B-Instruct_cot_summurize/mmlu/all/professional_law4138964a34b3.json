Not formed because the addition of the three-year payment request was, in effect, a rejection.\n\nIn a standard contract formation process, an offer (also known as an \"invitation to treat\" in legal terms, must be accepted without any additional terms or conditions unless the offeror consents to those terms. If the offeree adds new terms to the offer, it is typically considered a counteroffer rather than an acceptance. In this scenario, Berg's offer was for $75,000 cash. Jones' response, asking for payments spread over three years, is considered a new proposal that alters the original terms of the offer, thus turning it into a counteroffer rather than an acceptance.\n\nTherefore, no contract is formed between Berg and Jones based on their respective communications."
