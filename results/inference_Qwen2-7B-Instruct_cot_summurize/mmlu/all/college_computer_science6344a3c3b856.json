At least three of \\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\) are true.**\n\nWe want at least three of the four variables to be true. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\((p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3) \\lor (p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_4) \\lor (p_1 \\land p_3 \\land p_4) \\lor (p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4)\\)\n\n**II. Exactly three of \\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\) are true.**\n\nThis condition cannot be directly expressed using only conjunction and disjunction because it requires counting the exact number of true variables, which is inherently a form of negation (not allowing for a direct expression with just ANDs and ORs.\n\n**III. An even number of \\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\) are true.**\n\nAn even number of true variables means either all 0, 2, or 4 variables are true. We can express this by combining the other conditions:\n\n- All 4 are true: \\((p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4)\\)\n- Exactly 2 are true: We can express this by combining the previous conditions with disjunctions and conjunctions, but it's more complex and not straightforward without negation.\n- All 0 or 4 are true: This can be expressed as:\n  \n  \\(((p_1 \\land \\neg p_2 \\land \\neg p_3 \\land \\neg p_4) \\lor (\\neg p_1 \\land p_2 \\land \\neg p_3 \\land \\neg p_4) \\lor (\\neg p_1 \\land \\neg p_2 \\land p_3 \\land \\neg p_4) \\lor (\\neg p_1 \\land \\neg p_2 \\land \\neg p_3 \\land p_4)) \\land ((p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4)))\\)\n\nHowever, this expression also becomes quite complex and is not as clean as desired.\n\nGiven these explanations, **only condition I** can be directly expressed using only conjunction and disjunction without negation. Therefore, the correct answer is **A. I only**."
