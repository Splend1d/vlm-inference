During direct examination, the informer testified that he was unemployed but sometimes worked part-time as a substitute teacher. On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the informer if he had recently filed an application to become a police officer. The informer responded affirmatively. The defendant's attorney then asked the informer the following question:\"Isn't it true that you hope that by acting as an undercover agent, the police department will overlook the fact that you had two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana?\" The prosecuting attorney immediately objected. The trial judge should rule that the defendant's attorney's inquiry concerning the informer's hopes and misdemeanor convictions is\n\nA. improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.\nB. improper, as relating to convictions of crimes not punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\nC. proper, as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness.\nD. proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.\n"

The informer's hope that his actions as an undercover agent might lead to the police department overlooking his past misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana could be indicative of a bias or interest in providing testimony favorable to the prosecution. This is relevant to the credibility of the witness and whether the jury should consider the testimony with caution due to any potential self-serving motives. Therefore, the question falls under the category of inquiries that can be used to assess a witness's bias or motive, which is generally permissible during cross-examination."
