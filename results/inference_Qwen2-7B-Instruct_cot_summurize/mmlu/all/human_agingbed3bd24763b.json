Insurance regulators\n\nIn many jurisdictions, insurance regulators and similar public-facing or safety-critical positions often have mandatory retirement ages due to concerns about age-related declines in physical or mental capabilities. However, it's important to note that specific laws and regulations can vary by country and even by state within countries. For example, in the United States, while there is no federal law mandating retirement for insurance regulators or most other jobs, individual states may have such requirements.\n\nTo get the most accurate information, one would need to consult the relevant labor laws and regulations in their specific jurisdiction."
