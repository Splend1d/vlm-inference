According to the theorem in topology, if a function \\(f: X \\rightarrow Y\\) is continuous and the domain \\(X\\) is compact, then \\(f\\) must be uniformly continuous. This is a consequence of the fact that uniform continuity can be deduced from continuity when the domain is compact.\n\nStatement 2 is False. The composition of two functions being differentiable does not necessarily mean that both individual functions are differentiable everywhere. For instance, consider \\(f(x) = x^2\\sin(1/x)\\) for \\(x \\neq 0\\) and \\(f(0) = 0\\), which is everywhere differentiable, and \\(g(x) = x\\) for all \\(x\\). Then, \\(f(g(x)) = x^2\\sin(1/x)\\) is not everywhere differentiable because \\(f(x)\\) has points where its derivative oscillates wildly as \\(x\\) approaches 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. False, True**."
