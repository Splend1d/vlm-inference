It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nWhich one of the following was an unintended consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s?\n\nA. Liberal Democrats abandoned anti-war protests in a show of support for President Johnson.\nB. Conservative Republicans mobilized to defend traditional mores and curb government authority.\nC. Economic recession catalyzed by increased government spending causing \"stagflation.\"\nD. A majority of Northern black voters abandoned the Democrat party, siding with Republicans.\n"

                    "text": "B. Conservative Republicans mobilized to defend traditional mores and curb government authority.\n\nThe passage from Lyndon Johnson's speech discusses the goals of the Great Society, emphasizing the importance of using wealth to enrich and elevate society, fight poverty, promote education, and create a balance between technological advancement and the need for beauty and community. While it does not directly address unintended consequences of the liberal successes of the 1960s, option B is the closest in alignment with historical context and the themes presented in the passage.\n\nIn the 1960s, as the Great Society programs were being implemented, there was indeed a rise in conservative activism and political mobilization among Republicans. This was partly in response to perceived overreach of federal power, civil rights legislation, and social changes that some conservatives saw as undermining traditional values and family structures. This mobilization contributed to a shift in political ideology and voter allegiance, with many conservative-leaning individuals and groups becoming more active in politics and supporting Republican candidates, especially during the later part of the decade when issues such as the Vietnam War became increasingly controversial. \n\nOptions A, C, and D either do not fit the context of Johnson's speech or do not directly result from the liberal successes of the 1960s as described within the passage. Option A suggests a change in political behavior of liberal Democrats, which is not discussed in the text. Option C describes an economic issue that could be seen as a result of increased government spending, but this is not specified as an unintended consequence of liberal successes in Johnson's speech. Option D refers to a significant political realignment of voting patterns that occurred after the 1960s and might not necessarily be considered an \"unintended consequence\" of the specific liberal successes mentioned by Johnson."
