Social learning** theory of gender-role identity development.\n\nSocial learning theory, proposed by Albert Bandura, suggests that individuals learn behaviors through observation, imitation, and modeling. In the context of gender roles, this means that children learn how to behave in certain ways based on observing and imitating others, particularly those around them like parents or caregivers. The observed behaviors can include how adults interact with boys and girls differently, which can influence how children develop their own gender identities and behaviors.\n\nPsychodynamic theory ( (A) focuses on unconscious motivations and early childhood experiences to explain behavior, which might not directly address gender role differences in parenting styles.\n\nCognitive development theory ( (C), associated with Jean Piaget, emphasizes the development of mental processes and how children understand the world through stages of cognitive growth, which does not specifically address gender role differences in parental interactions.\n\nGender schema theory ( (D), developed by Susan Harter, suggests that individuals organize information about themselves and others into schemas based on gender, which can influence perceptions, thoughts, and actions. While it does relate to gender roles, social learning theory provides a more direct explanation for how behaviors are learned through observation and imitation, which seems to align better with the described scenario."
