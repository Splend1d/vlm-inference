Emergent norm**.\n\nAn emergent norm is a social norm that arises spontaneously within a group through repeated behavior. In this case, when one person (the \"first responder\" stops to help after a car accident, their action sets an example for others. Seeing someone else acting altruistically and helping those in need encourages others to follow suit. This behavior then becomes a norm within the group of bystanders present at the scene, as they too feel compelled to help. The act of helping becomes a shared expectation or norm, not because it was explicitly taught or agreed upon beforehand, but because it was observed and modeled by another individual."
