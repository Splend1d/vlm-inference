For a continuous random variable \\(x\\) and its probability density function \\(p(x)\\), it indeed holds that \\(0 \\leq p(x) \\leq 1\\) for all \\(x\\). This is because the probability density function must be non-negative and integrate to 1 over the entire domain of the random variable.\n\nStatement 2 is false. Decision trees are typically learned by maximizing information gain or minimizing entropy, not by minimizing information gain. The goal is to find the split that provides the most information about the class labels, which is achieved by maximizing information gain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False."
