He found that the rates of violent crime were similar for both men and women, challenging the common stereotype that men are more prone to violent crimes.\nB. He also observed that women's sexual delinquency ( which can include behaviors such as prostitution or sexual exploitation - was more likely to be normalized or excused in society compared to men's similar behaviors, indicating a gender bias in how society views and judges these actions.\nC. Smart noted that women's criminal behavior often reflected traditional gender roles, suggesting that their crimes might be related to societal expectations placed on women rather than personal motivations.\n\nThus, option D correctly encapsulates the three main points made about Smart's work based on the information provided."
