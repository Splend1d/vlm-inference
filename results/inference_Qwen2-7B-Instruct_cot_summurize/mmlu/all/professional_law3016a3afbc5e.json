This is known as a unilateral contract with a condition precedent (the neighbor's acceptance. Once the offeror (the man) allows the offeree a chance to consider the offer, the offer becomes irrevocable during that time unless the offer explicitly states it can be withdrawn.\n\nIn this scenario, when the man said \"If you say so\" after the neighbor expressed hesitation, he tacitly agreed to keep the offer open for a reasonable time based on the neighbor's request. When the neighbor later decided to accept the offer, the man had already sold the barbecue to his brother, which constitutes a breach of contract since the man did not fulfill his end of the bargain after the reasonable time had expired without withdrawal of the offer.\n\nTherefore, the neighbor would have grounds to sue the man for breach of contract."
