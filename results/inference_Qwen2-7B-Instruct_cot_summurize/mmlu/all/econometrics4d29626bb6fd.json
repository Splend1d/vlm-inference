While this might be a common assumption in some contexts, especially when using certain types of tests or diagnostics, it's not a fundamental requirement of the GARCH model itself.\n\nii) This statement is true. In a correctly specified GARCH(p,q) model, the standardized residuals should exhibit a property where the conditional variance of each residual is related to its own lagged squared values. This is due to the GARCH model's ability to capture volatility clustering in financial time series data.\n\niii) This statement is generally false. While it's possible for standardized residuals to exhibit fat tails ( indicating heavier tails than a normal distribution, this isn't a guaranteed feature of GARCH models. The presence of fat tails depends on the specific parameters of the model and the underlying data.\n\niv) This statement is false as stated. The standardised residuals and the raw residuals are not identical. The standardised residuals are obtained by dividing the raw residuals by their respective conditional standard deviations, which are part of the GARCH model's estimation process. These two types of residuals therefore differ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Only statements ii) and iv) are true."
