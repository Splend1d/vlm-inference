The victim died of a heart attack before the fire spread to his bedroom.\n\nThis assertion is the least likely to remove liability for felony murder because it does not directly relate to the defendant's intent or responsibility for the victim's death. Felony murder charges typically hold a defendant liable for someone's death during the commission of a dangerous felony, regardless of whether the defendant intended to cause death. If the victim died of a heart attack before the fire reached his bedroom, it suggests that the death was not caused by the defendant's actions but rather an independent event. However, this still depends on how the law defines \"during the commission of a dangerous felony\" in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred."
