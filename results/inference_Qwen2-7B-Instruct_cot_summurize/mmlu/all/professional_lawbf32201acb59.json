The deed recited that the title was conveyed to the three siblings \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" One of the sisters, during the lifetime of all three, conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party. The third party died, leaving a will that bequeathed her one-third interest to her son. Is the son's ownership interest enforceable as against the two surviving sisters who say that they now own 100% of the property pursuant to the law of joint tenancies?\n\nA. No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\nB. Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\nC. Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\nD. No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\n"

Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\n\nIn a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship, the interest of each joint tenant is equal and undivisible. When one joint tenant conveys their interest to someone else, it typically results in a severance of the joint tenancy. This means that the property is no longer held as joint tenants, but rather becomes owned by the original joint tenant (the selling sister in this case - and the transferee (the third party. \n\nThe third party then has full rights to dispose of their interest through their will, including passing it on to her son. Therefore, the son's ownership interest would be enforceable against the two surviving sisters under the law of joint tenancies, as the joint tenancy had been severed when the first sister conveyed her share."
