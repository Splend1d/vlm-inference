                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The slope will be linearly proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m^3.\n\nThis is based on the Ideal Gas Law, which can be rearranged into a form suitable for plotting a graph of volume versus temperature when pressure is constant:\n\n\\[ PV = nRT \\]\n\nwhere \\(P\\) is the pressure, \\(V\\) is the volume, \\(n\\) is the number of moles, \\(R\\) is the gas constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin. If we solve for \\(V\\), we get:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{nRT}{P} \\]\n\nWhen plotting \\(V\\) ( (volume) against \\(T\\) ( (temperature) with \\(P\\) ( (pressure) held constant, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{k}{T} \\]\n\nwhere \\(k = nR/P\\) is a constant. This equation represents an inverse relationship between volume and temperature when plotted, indicating that as temperature increases, volume decreases, and vice versa, assuming constant pressure. The slope of this graph would therefore be negative, reflecting the inverse proportionality between volume and temperature at constant pressure. Since \\(P\\) is constant, the intercept would indeed be 0 \\(m^3\\) if the temperature is 0 Kelvin, meaning there would be no volume at absolute zero under these conditions."
