The defendant claimed that he acted in self-defense after he was attacked by the victim, who was drunk and belligerent. At trial, the defendant called a witness who testified that the victim was the aggressor in the altercation. On cross-examination of the witness, the prosecuting attorney asked the witness the following question:\"Isn't it true that when you filed your federal income tax return last year, you failed to report the interest income from your savings accounts?\" The prosecuting attorney was informed of this fact by the witness's accountant. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the prosecutor's question is\n\nA. improper, because it is not relevant to the issues in the case.\nB. improper, because the defendant has not been convicted of any crime in connection with the tax return.\nC. within the court's discretion to allow, because filing a false income tax return is an act that bears on the witness's truthfulness.\nD. within the court's discretion to allow, because federal income tax evasion is a crime punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\n"

Within the court's discretion to allow, because filing a false income tax return is an act that bears on the witness's truthfulness.\n\nIn a criminal trial, the prosecution may ask questions that are go beyond the immediate facts of the case if they are relevant to assessing the credibility or character of a witness. In this scenario, asking about the witness's past act of failing to report income on their tax return could be seen as relevant to their credibility, as it might suggest a propensity for dishonesty. This is particularly true if there is evidence that the witness's failure to report income was intentional and fraudulent. However, the admissibility of such evidence can depend on local rules and precedents, and the judge would have the discretion to decide whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its potential prejudicial effect.\n\nOption A ( \"improper, because it is not relevant to the issues in the case\" is incorrect because, as explained, the question might be considered relevant to the witness's credibility.\nOption B \"improper, because the defendant has not been convicted of any crime in connection with the tax return\" is incorrect because the relevance of the question does not necessarily depend on the witness having been convicted of a crime; it depends on whether the act affects the witness's credibility.\nOption D \"within the court's discretion to allow, because federal income tax evasion is a crime punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year\" is not the primary reason for allowing such a question. While it's true that tax evasion can be a serious crime, the key consideration here is the impact on the witness's credibility, not the severity of the crime itself."
