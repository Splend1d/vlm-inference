These are considered to be absolute and without exception. For example, not lying is a perfect duty - if you have the opportunity to lie, you should not do so, even if it might result in a more beneficial outcome.\n\nImperfect obligations, on the other hand, are those that are we should strive to fulfill, but are not absolutely required in every situation. These can be thought of as conditional or relative duties. An example would be charitable giving - while it's desirable, there are circumstances (like dire personal financial need) where it may not be feasible.\n\nJustice, as an ideal, often requires absolute adherence, making it akin to perfect duties. For instance, the principle of fairness demands that we treat everyone equally and justly under all circumstances, without exception. This is why justice can be seen as a perfect obligation."
