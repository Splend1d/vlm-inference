Physical examination shows a 4-cm, necrotizing wound with a purplish black discoloration over the heel. Crepitant bullae producing profuse amounts of serous drainage are seen. A Gram stain of a tissue biopsy specimen shows gram-positive rods. The causal organism most likely produces which of the following virulence factors?\n\nA. Fimbriae\nB. Pneumolysin\nC. Polysaccharide capsule\nD. \u03b1-Toxin\n"

They can cause tissue damage and necrosis, which could explain the necrotizing wound and the purplish black discoloration observed in the patient's foot. In this case, the Gram stain of a tissue biopsy specimen showing gram-positive rods suggests that the bacteria responsible might belong to a group such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, both of which can produce \u03b1-toxins.\n\nThe other options:\nA. Fimbriae are bacterial adhesions that help bacteria attach to surfaces.\nB. Pneumolysin is a toxin produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae that causes cell lysis and contributes to the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\nC. Polysaccharide capsule helps some bacteria evade the immune system and adhere to host cells, but it does not directly cause tissue damage or necrosis like \u03b1-Toxins do."
