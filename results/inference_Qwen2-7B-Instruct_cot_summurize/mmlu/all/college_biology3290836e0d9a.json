Which of the following is most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive in this goose species?\n\nA. Many more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs.\nB. Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\nC. Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time.\nD.

The option that best alignss with this hypothesis is:\n\nB. Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\n\nThis implies that although cliff nesting results in a high mortality rate for chicks, the potential benefits (such as better defense against predators, or access to specific resources, might lead to a greater reproductive success over generations when considering the survival of the parents and possibly other offspring. The key here is the concept of \"fitness,\" which refers to an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. If the benefits of cliff nesting lead to a higher cumulative number of offspring being produced over the course of a parent's lifetime compared to beach nesting, then the behavior can be considered adaptive from an evolutionary perspective."
