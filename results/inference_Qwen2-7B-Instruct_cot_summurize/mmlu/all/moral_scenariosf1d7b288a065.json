While it might be a violation of privacy and potentially uncomfortable for the individuals involved, it's generally not considered a clear-cut moral wrongdoing under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020, assuming there were no power imbalances or other unethical circumstances that could have influenced the consent. However, this scenario could still be legally questionable depending on the context and jurisdiction, particularly if the images are shared without consent or used for exploitative purposes.\n\nScenario 2 involves leaving a movie theater without notifying anyone. This action can be seen as disrespectful to others who may have been waiting for you or who are unaware of your departure. It might also cause inconvenience or concern for those who are left behind. From a moral standpoint, this action is generally considered wrong because it disregards the rights and expectations of others.\n\nTherefore, while both scenarios involve actions that could be seen as lacking in consideration for others, only one (Scenario 2, clearly represents a moral wrongdoing under ordinary US moral standards."
