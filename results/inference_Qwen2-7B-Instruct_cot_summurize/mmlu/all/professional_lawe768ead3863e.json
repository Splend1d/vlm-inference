The daughter lived with the wife, but the husband frequently visited his daughter at her house. One morning, the husband came to his ex-wife's home to see his daughter. He and his daughter were outside on the patio chatting when the wife noticed her ex-husband's briefcase lying on the kitchen floor. The husband had entered the house carrying his briefcase, which he placed down before going out to see his daughter on the patio. Seeing the briefcase, the wife decided to open it. Inside she found a large envelope. She decided to keep it, thinking it contained money. Later that night after her ex-husband left, she opened the envelope and found a large amount of cocaine. The wife called the police who came and confiscated the drugs. The husband was subsequently charged with possession of cocaine. The husband has filed a motion to exclude the cocaine from being introduced into evidence. His motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the seizure violated the husband's right of privacy.\nB. granted, because the police failed to secure a search warrant before the seizure of the cocaine.\nC. denied, because the initial seizure was made by a private individual.\nD. denied, because the husband left the briefcase in the kitchen in plain view.\n"

Since the wife, as a private individual, seized the cocaine, the question then becomes whether this action can be used as evidence against the husband in court.\n\nThe exclusionary rule generally applies to evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, the Fourth Amendment does not apply to seizures by private individuals unless those seizures are so intertwined with government action that they violate the Constitution. In this case, there is no indication that the wife's actions were so intertwined with any government action or that they violated the husband's constitutional rights.\n\nThe husband's motion to exclude the cocaine would likely be denied based on the fact that the cocaine was seized by a private individual (the wife. The police, acting in their official capacity, only became involved after the wife had already discovered the cocaine and contacted them. Therefore, since the initial discovery and seizure were not conducted by a government agent or under government authority, the evidence would not be subject to the exclusionary rule.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the actions taken by the wife were not a violation of the husband's privacy or required a warrant, respectively. Option D is also incorrect because while the briefcase was in plain view, the subsequent opening and seizing of the cocaine by the wife was not justified under the plain view doctrine due to the lack of consent and the constitutional implications of a private seizure."
