The law of survival of the fittest was not made by man, and it cannot be abrogated by man. We can only, by interfering with it, produce the survival of the unfittest. . . . The millionaires are a product of natural selection, acting on the whole body of men to pick out those who can meet the requirement of certain work to be done. In this respect they are just like the great statesmen, or scientific men, or military men. It is because they are thus selected that wealth\u2014both their own and that entrusted to them\u2014aggregates under their hands. Let one of them make a mistake and see how quickly the concentration gives way to dispersion.\"\n\u2014William Graham Sumner, What Social Classes Owe to Each Other, 1883\nThe sociological ideas of William Graham Sumner reflect the idea that during the late 1800s\n\nA. cultural and intellectual arguments justified the success of those at the top of the socioeconomic structure as both appropriate and inevitable.\nB. popular writers rejected ideas from the sciences, and based their arguments on faith.\nC. intellectuals were critical of the cut-throat competition of the ages, and proposed radical alternatives based on creating a cooperative economy.\nD. cultural products of the era tended to ignore the economic direction of society and looked back wistfully to the past.\n"

This perspective legitimized the wealth accumulation of the elite as an inevitable result of merit and hard work, while also justifying the harsh conditions faced by the less fortunate. The quote suggests that the wealthy (millionaires) are the result of natural selection, implying that they are better suited for their roles, and that their wealth is a consequence of this selection process. This aligns with the idea that cultural and intellectual arguments at the time supported and reinforced the status quo of economic inequality."
