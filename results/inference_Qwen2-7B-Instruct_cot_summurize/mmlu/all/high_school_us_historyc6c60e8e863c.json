It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nIn what way did the actions of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 contradict Douglass's sentiments in the excerpt above?\n\nA. Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state.\nB. Lincoln passed the Homestead Act to give free land to all western settlers.\nC.

He saw these entities as being aligned against the cause of abolishing slavery. By supporting the exclusion of slavery from new territories, Lincoln took a stance that directly opposed the expansion of slavery, which was seen as a positive step towards abolition. This position was in contrast to Douglass's perspective, who likely would have supported immediate emancipation and the dismantling of the institution of slavery rather than its containment or eventual abolition through incremental means.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not directly address the organizational and systemic nature of support for slavery that Douglass criticized. Option A speaks to the rights of settlers in territories, but does not necessarily reflect an organizational advantage for slavery. Option B pertains to land distribution, which is unrelated to the organizational support of slavery. Option D involves the distribution of land to freed slaves, which, while a positive step, does not directly address the systemic issues Douglass highlighted regarding the organization of support for slavery."
