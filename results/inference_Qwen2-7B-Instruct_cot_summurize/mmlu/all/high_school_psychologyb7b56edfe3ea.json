Shape constancy\n\nThe concept that best explains Tina's problem is \"shape constancy.\" This refers to our ability to recognize an object as the same despite changes in its appearance due to lighting, angle, or distance. In Tina's case, when she saw the picture of the space shuttle launching, it was presented differently than when she saw it flying. The change in perspective and possibly other visual factors made it difficult for her to recognize the same object. Shape constancy allows us to identify objects consistently, even under varying conditions, which is why it fits the scenario described."
