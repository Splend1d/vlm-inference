They have equal magnitude and are pointed in opposite directions.\n\nWhen you add two vectors, the resultant vector (the one that results from this addition) can be found using vector addition rules. If the resultant vector is zero, it means that the vectors cancel each other out completely.\n\nFor two vectors to cancel each other out, they must have the same magnitude but point in exactly opposite directions. This is because the component of each vector in any direction perpendicular to the line connecting their tails must exactly match the component of the other vector in the same direction. The only way this can happen is if both vectors have the same magnitude but are oriented in opposite directions along the line connecting their tails.\n\nThus, option B correctly describes the condition where the sum of two non-zero vectors results in a zero vector."
