This results in higher consumer spending, which in turn increases aggregate demand. Since the economy is already operating at its full employment level of output, the increase in aggregate demand cannot be met by increased production (as resources are fully employed). This means that the economy experiences inflation as the increased demand pushes up prices without a corresponding increase in the supply of goods and services.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not accurately describe the long-run effects of a tax cut in an economy already at full employment:\n\n- A. Raising real output and raising the price level: Real output would not increase because the economy is already at full employment. The price level could rise due to the imbalance between increased demand and unchanged or limited supply.\n- B. Lowering real output and raising the price level: Lowering real output contradicts the concept of full employment, where all available resources are being being used efficiently.\n- C. Raising real output and lowering the price level: Again, this contradicts the idea of full employment, where additional output cannot be produced without increasing resources, and it also implies a decrease in price level which is unlikely when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply."
