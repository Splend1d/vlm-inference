An increase in the price of ice cream, a complimentary good to ice cream cones\n\nWhen the price of a complementary good increases, it makes that good relatively more expensive, which can lead to an increase in the demand for the other good. In this case, as the price of ice cream increases, people might buy more ice cream cones as they become a relatively cheaper alternative to enjoying a sweet treat. This phenomenon is known as the income effect or substitution effect in economics."
