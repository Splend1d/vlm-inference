Time and motion studies\n\nGilbreth, along with his wife Lillian, made significant contributions to the field of industrial engineering through their pioneering work in time and motion studies. They aimed to improve workplace efficiency by scientifically analyzing the motions people make during tasks and finding ways to streamline them. Their approach involved breaking down complex tasks into simpler, more efficient steps, which was a key component of the broader movement known as Scientific Management. The Gilbreths' methods helped pave the way for modern ergonomics and human factors engineering, focusing on how to optimize the interaction between people and their work environment for maximum productivity and comfort."
