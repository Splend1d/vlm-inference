The report made several key findings and recommendations.\n\nAmong its most significant conclusions, the Macpherson Report highlighted the existence of \"institutional racism\" (option B), which refers to systematic forms of disadvantage built into the routines and practices of social institutions, such as the police, education, and housing. This type of racism is embedded within these systems and can lead to unfair treatment and discrimination against minority groups. The report argued that addressing this issue required systemic changes and reforms rather than merely tackling individual acts of racism or prejudice.\n\nWhile the other options mentioned\u2014hate crimes (and the challenges faced by asylum seekers\u2014are certainly relevant issues in their own right, they do not specifically capture the central concern addressed by the Macpherson Report, which was the systemic nature of racism within institutions."
