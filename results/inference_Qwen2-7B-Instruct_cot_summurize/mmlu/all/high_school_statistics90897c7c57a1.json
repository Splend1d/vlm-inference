No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nThe method described, where every twenty-fifth student is selected as they enter the school, is known as systematic sampling. This method does not ensure that every student has an equal chance of being selected, which is a key characteristic of a simple random sample. In systematic sampling, once the starting point is chosen, every nth member of the population is selected, which can introduce bias if there is a pattern in the population that aligns with the selection interval (in this case, selecting every 25th student. Therefore, option D correctly identifies that not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected."
