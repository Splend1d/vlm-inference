The coordinates range from $-1$ to $1$, hence the volume of this cube is:\n\n\\[V_{\\text{cube}} = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\\]\n\nThe condition $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 1$ defines a sphere centered at the origin with radius $1$. This sphere is entirely contained within our cube since its diameter (which is 2) fits perfectly inside the cube.\n\nThe volume of the sphere is given by the formula:\n\n\\[V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\]\n\nFor a sphere with radius $r = 1$, we have:\n\n\\[V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (1^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\]\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected point from the cube lies inside the sphere is the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cube:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{V_{\\text{sphere}}}{V_{\\text{cube}}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$"
