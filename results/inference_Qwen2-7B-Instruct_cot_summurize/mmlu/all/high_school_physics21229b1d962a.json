The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.\nB. The wave speed on the string is fixed.\nC. 60 Hz is in the lowest range of audible sound.\nD. The wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker is equal to the speed of waves on the string divided by 60 Hz.\n"

The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.\n\nExplanation: For standing waves to occur on a string fixed at both ends, the length of the string must be a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave. This is because the nodes (points of no displacement) of the standing wave must align with the fixed ends of the string. If the length of the string is not a multiple of half the wavelength, the wave will not be able to form a complete standing wave pattern."
