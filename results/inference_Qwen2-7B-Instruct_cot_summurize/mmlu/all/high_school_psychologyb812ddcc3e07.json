Additionally, he can use other senses and visual cues that are not affected by the loss of sight in one eye. These include:\n\n1. **Hearing**: Listening for sounds made by vehicles, such as engine noise or beeping warnings.\n2. **Tactile Feedback**: Feeling the steering wheel and road vibrations through the vehicle's suspension.\n3. **Other Visual Cues**: Observing the road ahead, traffic lights, road signs, and other vehicles' positions relative to lane markings.\n4. **Vehicle Systems**: Utilizing the car's advanced driver assistance systems ( (ADAS), such as blind-spot detection, rear-view cameras, and adaptive cruise control, which provide auditory and visual feedback.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be **D. I and II only**, considering the options provided, but it's important to note that Abdul might also be able to use other cues mentioned above, which were not listed as options."
