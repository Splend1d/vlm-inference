This is a common and expected behavior in educational settings.\n- In scenario 2, making a homemade dinner from chickens' eggs owned by oneself or one's partner is also not morally wrong, assuming the chickens are treated ethically and the act is not intended to cause harm to them. The act of using homegrown ingredients to cook a meal is generally seen as a positive and resourceful action."
