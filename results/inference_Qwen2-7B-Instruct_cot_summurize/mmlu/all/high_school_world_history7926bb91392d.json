Specifically, the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia was passed by the Congress of Angostura convened by Simon Bolivar, who was a prominent figure in the Latin American wars of independence against Spanish rule. This constitution aimed to unify several South American territories into a single nation, reflectinging Bolivar's vision of a larger, unified South America.\n\nThe Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, on the other hand, was established after Brazil gained independence from Portugal in 1822. It was created during the process of establishing Brazil as a sovereign nation with its own governance structure, which also reflects elements of nationalism and the desire for independence.\n\nTherefore, the creation of these constitutions was primarily driven by nationalist movements advocating for pan-American unity or for the establishment of independent nation-states, respectively."
