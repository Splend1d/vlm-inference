Officers then submitted to a magistrate an affidavit setting forth circumstances showing probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant. The magistrate issued a search warrant for narcotics at the man's address. Police officers went to the man's home and rang the door bell. When no one answered, the police broke in and entered the dwelling. They searched the rooms on the first floor and found no incriminating evidence, then walked outside and noticed a separate entrance leading up to the second floor of the dwelling. They ascended the stairway and entered an upstairs bedroom. Inside the room the officers found a stash of cocaine lying on a dresser. As the officers were continuing their search of the bedroom, the defendant entered the room. The police asked the defendant if he was the man. The defendant identified himself and told the police that they were in his bedroom and he occupied the second floor of the dwelling. The defendant explained that the man resided on the first floor and his living quarters were separate from the defendant's. Nonetheless, the defendant was placed under arrest and charged with possession of cocaine. The defendant has filed a motion to exclude the cocaine from being admitted into evidence. The defendant's motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the warrant did not name the defendant.\nB. granted, because the warrant did not state with specificity the area to be searched.\nC. denied, because the police reasonably believed they were searching the man's residence when they entered the defendant's living quarters.\nD. denied, because the warrant was valid and issued with probable cause.\n"

                    "text": "C. denied, because the police reasonably believed they were searching the man's residence when they entered the defendant's living quarters.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring law enforcement to obtain a search warrant based on probable cause. The warrant must describe the place to be searched and the items to be seized with reasonable particularity. However, it does not need to specify the exact location or individual within the described premises where the items might be found.\n\nIn this case, the police had a valid search warrant for narcotics at the man's address. Upon entering the dwelling, they searched the first floor without incident. The warrant did not list the defendant specifically but authorized a search for narcotics at the man's residence. The police discovered the stash of cocaine in the upstairs bedroom, which is part of the dwelling they were legally entitled to search under the terms of the warrant.\n\nWhen the defendant entered the room and confirmed his presence, he was not necessarily committing a separate offense by being in the bedroom; rather, his presence became relevant to the investigation once the police recognized him as potentially involved in the activities for which the warrant was obtained. The fact that the defendant's living quarters were separate from the man's does not negate the reasonableness of the police's actions given the scope of the warrant.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely deny the defendant's motion to exclude the cocaine from being admitted into evidence, as the search was conducted pursuant to a validly issued warrant and the police acted within the bounds of that warrant when they entered the upstairs bedroom and discovered the drugs stash."
