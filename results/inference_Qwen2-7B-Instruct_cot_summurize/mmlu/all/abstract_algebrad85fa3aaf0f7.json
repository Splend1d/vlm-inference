The order of an element in \\(S_n\\) is equal to the least common multiple (lcm of the lengths of its disjoint cycles.\n\nFor \\(S_6\\), let's consider the possible cycle structures and their corresponding orders:\n\n1. **Six 1-cycles** (\\(6 \\times 1\\)): This corresponds to the identity permutation, which has order 1.\n2. **Five 1-cycle and one 2-cycle**: The lcm of 1 and 2 is 2, so the order here is 2.\n3. **Four 1-cycle and two 1-cycles**: The lcm of 1 and 4 is 4, so the order here is 4.\n4. **Four 1-cycle and one 3-cycle**: The lcm of 1 and 3 is 3, so the order here is 3.\n5. **Three 2-cycles**: The lcm of 2 is 2, so the order here is 2.\n6. **Three 1-cycle and one 2-cycle**: The lcm of 1 and 2 is 2, so the order here is 2.\n7. **Three 1-cycle and one 3-cycle**: The lcm of 1 and 3 is 3, so the order here is 3.\n8. **Two 2-cycles and one 2-cycle**: The lcm of 2 is 2, so the order here is 2.\n9. **Two 2-cycles and one 3-cycle**: The lcm of 2 and 3 is 6, so the order here is 6.\n10. **Two 2-cycles and one 1-cycle**: The lcm of 2 is 2, so the order here is 2.\n11. **Two 3-cycles**: The lcm of 3 is 3, so the order here is 3.\n12. **One 6-cycle**: The lcm of 6 is 6, so the order here is 6.\n13. **One 5-cycle and one 1-cycle**: The lcm of 5 is 5, so the order here is 5.\n14. **One 4-cycle and two 1-cycles**: The lcm of 4 is 4, so the order here is 4.\n15. **One 4-cycle and one 2-cycle**: The lcm of 2 and 4 is 4, so the order here is 4.\n16. **One 4-cycle and one 1-cycle**: The lcm of 4 is 4, so the order here is 4.\n17. **One 3-cycle and three 1-cycles**: The lcm of 3 is 3, so the order here is 3.\n18. **One 3-cycle and one 2-cycle**: The lcm of 2 and 3 is 6, so the order here is 6.\n19. **One 3-cycle and one 1-cycle**: The lcm of 3 is 3, so the order here is 3.\n20. **One 2-cycle and four 1-cycles**: The lcm of 2 is 2, so the order here is 2.\n21. **One 2-cycle and one 3-cycle**: The lcm of 2 and 3 is 6, so the order here is 6.\n22. **One 2-cycle and one 1-cycle**: The lcm of 2 is 2, so the order here is 2.\n23. **One 1-cycle**: This corresponds to the identity permutation, which has order 1.\n\nAmong these possibilities, the maximum possible order for an element in \\(S_6\\) is 6, as seen in cases like six 1-cycles or one 6-cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. 6**."
