The mall has a Social Security Office and the real estate is owned by the state. The grocery store pays rent to the state. Any type of picketers are prevented from entering the mall to picket inside by the owners of the mall, who also pay rent to the state for the land, and there is no outside entrance of the store at the mall where the picketers could strike. If the picketers go before the court to claim violations of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, will state action likely be found against the store and the mall owners?\n\nA. No, under the mantle of authority test there are not enough connections between the state and the private actions of the mall and the store.\nB. No, because a private actor can never be held liable in a constitutional rights claim that requires state action.\nC. Yes, because the equal protection balancing test shows that there is state action in renting the property to private actors who are discriminating.\nD. Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.\n"

No, under the mantle of authority test there are not enough connections between the state and the private actions of the mall and the store.\n\nTo understand why, let's break down the legal concepts involved:\n\n1. **First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights**: These amendments guarantee freedom of speech and assembly, and due process and equal protection under the law, respectively. In this context, the picketers are claiming their rights are being violated.\n\n2. **State Action**: For a private party's actions to be subject to constitutional scrutiny, they must have \"state action\" or \"state involvement.\" This typically means the government has significantly influenced or controlled the actions of the private party. The U.S. Supreme Court uses various tests to determine if state action exists, including the \"mell of authority\" test, which looks for a significant role played by the state or its agents in the private party's conduct.\n\n3. **Mell of Authority Test**: This test asks whether the state has sufficiently intervened in the private party's actions to make them state action. It considers factors such as the degree of state control over the private party, the extent to which the state has the power to regulate the party's behavior, and the degree to which the party's actions are intertwined with state interests.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- The mall and the grocery store pay rent to the state, indicating some level of state control over the use of the property.\n- However, the mall and the grocery store are private entities that own and operate within the rented space, with the ability to manage their own affairs (like setting rules for picketing.\n- The picketers' claim that the mall and the store are preventing them from entering the mall to picket inside does not necessarily mean the state is directly controlling these actions. The mall owners may have the right to restrict access to their property to maintain order and safety.\n- There is no evidence that the state has directly compelled the mall or the store to prevent the picketing, or that the state's actions have significantly influenced their decisions in this matter.\n\nGiven these points, it is unlikely that the state action would be found against the store and the mall owners under the mantle of authority test. The state's role appears to be minimal, and the private parties retain significant autonomy in managing their property and operations.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly identifies that the state action is not likely in this case."
