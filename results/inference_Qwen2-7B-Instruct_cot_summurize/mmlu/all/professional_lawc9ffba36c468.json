In this case, the covenants of seisin ( possession or ownership, right to convey, and against encumbrances are stated as running with the land. This means these promises made by the farmer to the landscaper, and then to the buyer through the warranty deed, are obligations that continue to apply to any future owner of the property, such as the buyer who was later evicted by a woman claiming paramount title.\n\nSince the covenants run with the land, the buyer can bring suit against the farmer for breach of these covenants, even though the farmer is not directly involved in the current dispute between the buyer and the woman. The farmer's obligation to uphold these covenants was part of the contract that transferred the property to the buyer, and thus, the buyer can enforce those covenants against the farmer."
