Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, handing the scissors to your cousin with the blade pointed towards her could be seen as reckless and potentially dangerous, but it doesn't necessarily involve malice or intent to cause harm. It might be considered disrespectful or thoughtless, but not necessarily morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards in 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, setting an entire national park's valley on fire would generally be considered a serious act of arson, which is illegal and morally reprehensible. It poses a significant risk to public safety, endangers wildlife, and can cause extensive environmental damage. This action would likely be widely condemned as morally wrong."
