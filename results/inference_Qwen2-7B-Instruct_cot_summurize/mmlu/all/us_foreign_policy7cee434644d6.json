These states are:\n\n1. The United States\n2. Russia\n3. United Kingdom\n4. France\n5. China\n6. India\n7. Pakistan\n8. Israel (not formally acknowledged by the NPT)\n9. North Korea\n\nGiven that North Korea is often considered a nuclear state, and Iran is frequently mentioned as a country pursuing nuclear capabilities, the number could be argued to be closer to ten if Iran is also included. However, Iran has not officially declared itself a nuclear state and its nuclear program is subject to international scrutiny under various agreements.\n\nTherefore, based on the options provided, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. Fewer than 7 ( (This answer would not be accurate given the current count of recognized nuclear states)\n\nB. Between 8 and 15\n\nConsidering only the officially recognized nuclear-weapon states, this range is more accurate. However, if you include countries with suspected or undeclared nuclear programs like Iran, the count could potentially be higher, but still within the \"Between 8 and 15\" range.\n\nPlease note that the status of nuclear states can change over time due to diplomatic developments and changes in policy."
