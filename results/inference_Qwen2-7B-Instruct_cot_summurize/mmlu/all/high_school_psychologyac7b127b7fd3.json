Taking an upper-level undergraduate course aligns with this motivation because these courses typically cover more complex topics, require deeper understanding, and involve more rigorous academic challenges compared to introductory classes. This type of course would not only provide him with new information and knowledge but also challenge him to apply and expand upon his existing skills and understanding in psychology, thus offering an environment where he can continue to push himself academically."
