The auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity.\n\nWhen an auditor lacks independence, it significantly affects their ability to provide an unbiased and objective audit opinion. This lack of independence could lead to a qualified opinion or even an adverse opinion if the auditor feels that they cannot maintain objectivity due to a conflict of interest or other impairments to independence. In such cases, the auditor must disclose the nature of the impairment in their report.\n\nThe other options listed ( B, C, and D) do not necessarily require a qualified opinion as long as the auditor has performed the necessary audit procedures and found no significant issues that would warrant such an opinion. For example, if management prevents the auditor from observing the entity's inventory, the auditor may still issue an unqualified opinion but with an emphasis of matter paragraph explaining the limitation. Similarly, omitting the statement of cash flows is a violation of accounting standards, but the auditor can still issue an unqualified opinion if other aspects of the financial statements are properly audited. Referringing to the work of an actuary does not inherently require a qualified opinion unless it directly impacts the financial statements' accuracy or completeness."
