Apes have been able to use the words they know to express novel concepts.\n\nThis ability to use known words or symbols to convey new or previously uncommunicated ideas is indicative of a more complex form of communication, akin to human language. It suggests an understanding of the symbolic nature of language and the capacity for abstract thought, which are are key components of human language. While options A, B, and C provide evidence of communication skills in animals, they do not necessarily indicate the same level of sophistication or complexity as the ability to express novel concepts."
