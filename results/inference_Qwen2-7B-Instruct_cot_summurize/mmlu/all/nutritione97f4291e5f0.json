This storage plays a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose levels by releasing glucose into the bloodstream when needed.\n\nLet's briefly address the other options:\n\nA. A key step in the synthesis of glycogen is the formation of UDP-glucose: This statement is partially correct. UDP-glucose (Uridine Diphosphate Glucose) is involved in glycogen synthesis, but the key step involves the addition of glucose-1-phosphate to UDP-glucose by an enzyme called UDP-glucose:glycogen glucosyltransferase.\n\nB. In muscle in the fasting state, glycogen is broken down to glucose 6-phosphate, then free glucose: This statement is incorrect. During fasting, muscle glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate, which is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate before being released into the bloodstream as glucose. However, this process also involves the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase, and then to glucose by glucose-6-phosphatase.\n\nD. Glucagon increases the synthesis of glycogen: This statement is incorrect. Glucagon actually stimulates the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, not its synthesis. The hormone insulin promotes glycogen synthesis."
