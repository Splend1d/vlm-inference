The homeowner received 10 bids. The first nine offered to paint the house for amounts ranging from $10,000 to $12,500. The 10th bid was sent by telegram and was supposed to be for $10,000. However, the telegraph company made a mistake and transmitted the bid as $1,000. The homeowner immediately accepted the 1 0th bid, but the 1 0 painter refused to perform. The I 0th painter's best defense in an action for breach of contract by the homeowner would be\n\nA. that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistaken transmission, because of the disparity between its bid and the others.\nB. that the telegraph company should be liable as an independent contractor.\nC. that the homeowner was under an affirmative duty to investigate all submitted bids.\nD. that the mistake made the contract unconscionable.\n"

As an independent contractor responsible for delivering the message, the telegraph company may be held liable for the error. The painter cannot be held responsible for the mistake made by the telegraph company, especially since the painter relied on the correct information provided in the bid they received.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the laws regarding contract formation and the role of third parties (such as telecommunications companies in such situations can vary by jurisdiction. In some legal systems, the painter might still face liability if the homeowner can prove reliance on the bid and the painter's intent to enter into a contract based on that bid. The specific defenses available would depend on the applicable law and the details of the contract or agreement between the painter and the homeowner."
