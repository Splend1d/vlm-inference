We do not have enough information to infer this conclusion.\n\nB. \\( \\neg\\neg C \\)\n\nThis simplifies to \\( C \\), but it does not match any of the options and does not directly follow from the given premises either. This step involves double negation elimination, which is not a one-step deduction based on the provided premises.\n\nC. \\( C \\lor D \\)\n\nThis is a direct consequence of the first premise \\( (A \\lor B) \\supset ( (C \\lor D) \\). Since we know that \\( A \\lor B \\) is true (from premise 2), we can apply modus ponens with the first premise to conclude that \\( C \\lor D \\) must also be true.\n\nD. \\( (A \\lor B) \\supset D \\)\n\nThis proposition does not follow directly from the given premises. While the original implication is \\( (A \\lor B) \\supset ( (C \\lor D) \\), there is no information provided about \\( D \\) that would allow us to deduce \\( (A \\lor B) \\supset D \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. C \u2228 D**, as it is a direct consequence of the given premises without requiring additional logical steps."
