Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nStuffing a pillow with chicken feathers might be considered unconventional or perhaps unsanitary by some, but it's not generally seen as morally wrong unless there's an explicit rule against it or it causes harm to someone else. For example, if it was done secretly without permission and it caused discomfort or health issues for others due to allergens, then it could be viewed negatively.\n\nLeaving toxic material within reach of small children, however, is clearly morally wrong. It poses a significant risk of harm to minors, which is a clear violation of parental responsibility and care for the safety and well-being of children. This action could result in serious injury or even death, and is therefore morally reprehensible."
