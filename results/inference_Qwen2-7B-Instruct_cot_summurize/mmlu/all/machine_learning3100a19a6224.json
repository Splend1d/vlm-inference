When data is mapped into a higher-dimensional space (feature space Q) using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, it can become easier to separate with a linear classifier like 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN), even if the data was not easily separable in its original space. This is because the RBF kernel implicitly maps the data into a space where it becomes linearly separable. However, it's important to note that while this transformation can often improve performance, it isn't guaranteed due to factors like overfitting or the specific characteristics of the data.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is false. The VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension of a model measures its capacity to learn from data. A Perceptron, which is a type of linear classifier, has an infinite VC dimension because it can shatter any finite set of points in the plane (or higher dimensions). On the other hand, a simple linear SVM (Support Vector Machine) also has an infinite VC dimension since it can also classify any finite set of points perfectly by choosing the right margin and support vectors. Thus, both models have the same VC dimension when considering linear separability, and the concept doesn't directly compare their capacities for non-linearly separable cases since SVMs can use kernels to handle such cases."
