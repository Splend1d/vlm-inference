Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character can be evaluated based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Slamming on brakes to avoid hitting an animal is generally considered a responsible and ethical action. It demonstrates concern for animal welfare and the safety of other drivers on the road. There is no clear wrongdoing here, assuming no other harm was caused and the action was necessary to prevent a more significant accident.\n\nScenario 2: Breaking into one's own home when one has lost their keys could be seen as a breach of property rights, especially if the individual has access to alternative means of entry such as a spare key or a neighbor who could help. However, given the context provided (that this happened late at night with no other options available, the act might be justified out of necessity. In many cases, breaking into one's own home under such circumstances would not be considered morally wrong, particularly if it was done to prevent potential damage or to retrieve essential items needed for immediate safety or health reasons. Nonetheless, it is still technically illegal, and the legality may depend on local laws regarding self-help measures. Thus, while it might not be strictly \"wrong\" from a moral standpoint, it certainly goes against legal norms."
