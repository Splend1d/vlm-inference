A police officer noticed her and, on a hunch, conducted a random search. He found a variety of jewelry with price tags and no receipts. A jewelry store owner in the vicinity stated that the jewelry was stolen a few minutes earlier, and the girl may have been a customer at that time. She was arrested for theft. The girl's counsel filed a motion to suppress the evidence. Will the judge likely order suppression of the evidence?\n\nA. Yes, there was no reasonable suspicion or probable cause for the officer to stop and search her.\nB. No, authorities are always allowed to \u0080\u0098stop and frisk' anyone to see what they are carrying.\nC. No, the search was legal because a teenager carrying bags on a downtown street is a suspicious person.\nD. Yes, the officer did not get a search warrant even though he had probable cause.\n"

In this scenario, the officer conducted a search without any reasonable suspicion or probable cause, which are both necessary justifications for a police officer to conduct a search under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The fact that the officer searched the girl based solely on a \"hunch\" does not meet these legal standards. Therefore, the judge would likely order the suppression of the evidence obtained during the unlawful search. \n\nOptions B and C incorrectly suggest that a police officer can search anyone based on general suspicions or the location of the person. This is not supported by the Fourth Amendment, which requires specific evidence or reasonable suspicion to justify a search. Option D also does not apply, as the issue here is not whether the officer had probable cause (which he did, according to the information provided), but rather whether he had the authority to conduct the search in the first place without violating the girl's constitutional rights."
