High temperature and low pressure\n\nAt high temperatures, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, causing them to move faster and spend less time interacting with each other. At low pressures, the molecules have more space to move around and interact with fewer other molecules. These conditions reduce the deviations from ideal behavior that occur due to intermolecular forces and volume effects in real gases. Therefore, a real gas will most closely behave as an ideal gas under these conditions.\n\nA is incorrect because at high pressure, the intermolecular forces become more significant, deviating from ideal behavior.\nC is incorrect because increasing the volume (at constant pressure) doesn't change the density of the gas, so the intermolecular forces still play a role.\nD is incorrect because at low temperature, the molecules move slower, increasing their interactions, and at low pressure, they are not densely packed enough to overcome the intermolecular forces significantly."
