Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, the act of shooting a panther because it annoyed the main character's son is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action involves unnecessary harm and violence towards an animal without any justifiable cause or self-defense.\n\nIn scenario 2, pouring a bowl of cereal for one's young son is not considered morally wrong. It is a typical and benign action performed by a caregiver for a child.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong."
