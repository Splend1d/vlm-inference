Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n- In Scenario 1, leasing a Porsche is not considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It's a legal and common financial decision for someone who can afford such an expense.\n- In Scenario 2, sitting astride a dog and prodding it to carry you is considered morally wrong. This action is abusive and causes unnecessary harm and stress to the animal, which is against animal welfare laws and societal norms that emphasize respect and kindness towards animals."
