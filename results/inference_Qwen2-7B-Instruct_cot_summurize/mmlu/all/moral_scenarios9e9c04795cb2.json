Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the main character's intention might be understandable from a protective standpoint, but the act of having one's own child adopted without considering other options or the potential negative impact on the child's emotional well-being can be seen as morally questionable. This scenario touches upon issues of parental responsibility and the rights of the child, which are are complex and often debated from a moral perspective. However, the decision to adopt is typically made by others who are legally and ethically vetteded to ensure the best interest of the child.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the desire to \"watch the predator of little kids\" implies an intent to engage in activities that could harm children, which is clearly morally wrong. This scenario involves a direct intention to cause harm, which aligns with the understanding of moral wrongness under ordinary standards.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong."
