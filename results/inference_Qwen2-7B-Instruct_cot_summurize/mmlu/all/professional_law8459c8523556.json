The defendant approached the bank teller, pointed her unloaded pistol at him and said, \"This is a stick-up. . . give me your money and no one will get hurt. \"While the teller was handing the money to the defendant, the victim, a bank patron who was in line, saw the defendant pointing the gun at the teller and fainted. He fell backward and cracked his head on the marble floor. This resulted in a fatal head injury. Moments later, the defendant left the bank with the money. Thereafter, the defendant was arrested.

However, for the charge to stand, there must be a sufficient connection between the felony and the death. In this scenario, the defendant's actions led to the victim fainting and subsequently dying from a head injury, but the question is whether the death was a foreseeable result of the robbery or if it was an unintended consequence.\n\nIf the court determines that the death was not a direct or foreseeable result of the robbery, but rather an unforeseeable accident (like the victim fainting and hitting their head, then there might not be a sufficient connection under the felony murder rule. This would likely lead to the defendant being acquitted of felony murder charges."
