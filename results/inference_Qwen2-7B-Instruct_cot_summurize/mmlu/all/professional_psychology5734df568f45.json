This is because data points in a time series are often not independent; observations taken close together in time tend to be more similar to each other than those taken further apart. This violates one of the key assumptions of many statistical models, which require that errors (or residuals) be independent. Autocorrelation can lead to biased standard errors, making it difficult to accurately assess the significance of relationships in the data."
