The brothers took the wife hostage, pointed a gun at her head, and demanded that she drive them in her car to their hideout. As the wife was driving down the street, a woman pushing her baby in a stroller suddenly stopped in the middle of the intersection. In order to avoid hitting the woman and her child, the wife veered the car to the left, and intentionally struck a bystander, instantly killing him.

In this scenario, the wife is being forced to drive to the hideout with the kidnappers pointing a gun at her head, which is a situation of extreme duress. Although the wife caused the death of the bystander, she did so to avoid potentially much greater harm to herself and possibly others (her own life and the life of the president's wife. Therefore, under the principle of duress, she might be found not guilty as she acted out of necessity to protect herself and others from the imminent threat posed by the kidnappers."
