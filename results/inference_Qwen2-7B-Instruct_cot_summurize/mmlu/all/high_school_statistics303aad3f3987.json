A distribution of all the values taken by a statistic from all possible samples of a given size\n\nA sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a statistic obtained from a large number of samples drawn from a specific population. It describes how the statistic ( like mean, median, standard deviation etc., varies from sample to sample. This concept is fundamental in statistical inference as it allows us to make predictions about the population parameters based on sample statistics.\n\nFor example, if you repeatedly take random samples of a certain size from a population and calculate the mean for each sample, the distribution of those sample means would form a sampling distribution. This helps in understanding the variability of the sample means around the true population mean."
