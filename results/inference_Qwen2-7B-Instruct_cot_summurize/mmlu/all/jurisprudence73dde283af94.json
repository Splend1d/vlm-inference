A command confers power to change one's legal status.\n\nAustin's theory of commands and sanctions primarily focuses on the relationship between commands, their intended effect (sanctions, and the consequences for non-compliance. Statements A, B, and C all align with the core tenets of Austin's theory regarding commands and sanctions. They discuss the presence of sanctions within commands, the logical connection between commands and sanctions, and the distinction between commands and mere wishes based on the inclusion of sanctions.\n\nIn contrast, statement D introduces an element outside of Austin's framework. While it is true that commands can have legal implications and potentially alter one's legal status, this aspect is not specifically tied to the concept of sanctions as Austin defines them. Austin's theory does not directly address the legal consequences of commands beyond the sanctions themselves. Therefore, statement D is the least likely to follow logically from Austin's argument about sanctions being the smallest chance of incurring the smallest evil."
