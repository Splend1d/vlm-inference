Let's denote:\n\n- \\(x\\) as the distance between the foot of the ladder and the building,\n- \\(y\\) as the height of the ladder on the building,\n- \\(l = 26\\) feet as the length of the ladder.\n\nAt any given time, we have:\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = l^2\\]\n\nWe are given that \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 3\\) feet per second ( (the rate at which the foot of the ladder moves away from the building), and we want to find \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\) when \\(x = 10\\) feet.\n\nFirst, let's differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time \\(t\\):\n\\[2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\\[2(10)(3) + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\\[60 + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nSolve for \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\):\n\\[2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = -60\\]\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{60}{2y}\\]\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{30}{y}\\]\n\nWe also know that when \\(x = 10\\), we can find \\(y\\) using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[10^2 + y^2 = 26^2\\]\n\\[100 + y^2 = 676\\]\n\\[y^2 = 576\\]\n\\[y = 24\\] ( (since \\(y\\) represents height, we take the positive root)\n\nSubstitute \\(y = 24\\) into the equation for \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\):\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{30}{24}\\]\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{5}{4}\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the height is decreasing. Thus, the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down when the foot of the ladder is 10 feet from the building is \\(-\\frac{5}{4}\\) feet per second.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 5/4**."
