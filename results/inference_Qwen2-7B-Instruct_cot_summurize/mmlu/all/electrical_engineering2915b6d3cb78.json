This means they have enough versatility to generate the outputs of AND, OR, NOT, and other gates when combined appropriately.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. NOR, NAND.\n\nThese two types of gates (NOR and NAND are considered universal because using just them, you can create all other types of logic gates. For example, an OR gate can be created by inverting the output of a NAND gate, and a NOT gate can be created by using a NOR gate with both inputs connected together.\n\nSo, the answer that correctly identifies the universal gates from the options provided is A."
