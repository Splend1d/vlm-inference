It implies a form of violence or aggression towards another person, which is generally viewed as morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, leaving town without picking up one's child from school is considered morally wrong. This action neglects parental responsibility and could potentially put the child at risk or cause significant distress to the child and other family members.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is morally wrong."
