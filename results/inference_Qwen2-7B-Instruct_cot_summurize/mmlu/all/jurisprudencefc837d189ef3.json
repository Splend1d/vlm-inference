This means they felt formalism oversimplified the process of legal decision-making and did not adequately account for the complexities and nuances involved in judicial rulings. \n\nRealists contended that judges' decisions are often influenced by factors beyond strict legal rules and formal logic, such as personal experiences, societal values, and practical outcomes. They argued that legal decisions are are not less important than legislation, nor do they necessarily base their decisions solely on formal logic (A and C. Instead, they emphasized the role of judges in interpreting and applying laws within the context of real-world situations, which can sometimes lead to outcomes that may seem inconsistent with formal legal principles. Thus, realists challenged the notion that the structure of legal reasoning is inherently flawed, but rather argued that the existing legal framework could be improved by acknowledging the dynamic and interpretive nature of law."
