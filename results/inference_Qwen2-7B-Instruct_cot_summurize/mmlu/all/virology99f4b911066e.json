This particle is significant in virology as it represents the structure of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV. The Dane particle consists of two main components: an outer envelope which is derived from the host cell, and an inner core that contains the viral DNA and proteins. The outer envelope is lipid-based and the inner core is made up of a series of nested spheres, with the viral DNA at the center."
