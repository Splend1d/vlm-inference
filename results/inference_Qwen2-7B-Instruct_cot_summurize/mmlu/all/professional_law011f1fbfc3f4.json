However, certain erotic material can reach a point where it steps over the boundaries of First Amendment protection. The Supreme Court has held that if material is obscene it does not mandate First Amendment protection. Which of the following most accurately represents one of the prongs of the three-pronged test enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court's for determining whether a film, book, video or pictorial is obscene and therefore not subject to protection?\n\nA. Whether the work, taken as a whole and judged by contemporary community standards, would be seen by a sensitive or vulnerable person to appeal to the prurient interest.\nB. Whether the work depicts, in a direct or indirect way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state obscenity law.\nC. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\nD. Whether the work has been properly judged from a national standard to offend sensitive standards of community morals.\n"

One of these prongs is indeed represented by option C: \"Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\"\n\nTo provide a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Prurient Interest**: The first prong asks whether the material, as a whole and judged by contemporary community standards, appeals to the prurient interest. This refers to an interest in sex that is beyond curiosity and is considered to be morbid or unhealthy.\n\n2. **Lack of Serious Value**: The second prong considers whether the material lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. This prong evaluates the content on a deeper level, considering its contribution to society in any of these areas.\n\n3. **Appeal to Sexually Exciting Material**: The third prong asks whether the work, taken as a whole, depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer that most accurately represents one of the prongs of the three-pronged test for determining whether a film, book, video, or pictorial is obscene and thus not protected by the First Amendment is **C. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value**."
