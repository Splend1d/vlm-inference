Asking students to use pencils to measure the length of a desk\n\nThis activity will best introduce students to nonstandard units of measurement as it involves using an object (pencils) that is not a standard unit of measurement (like inches, centimeters, or meters). It encourages hands-on learning and understanding of relative sizes, which are fundamental concepts when introducing measurement to young learners."
