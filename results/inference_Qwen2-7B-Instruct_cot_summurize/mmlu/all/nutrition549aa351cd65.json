However, the closest correct answer to your options provided would be:\n\nD. Prohibiting the introduction into commerce food containing contaminants at levels greater than a specified level - a risk-based MRL or tolerance.\n\nThis approach involves setting maximum residue limits (MRLs) or tolerances for specific contaminants in food. These levels are established through risk assessment which considers the potential health effects of exposure to the contaminant and the amount present in the food. The goal is to ensure that the risk to human health does not exceed an acceptable level.\n\nOptions A, B, and C either oversimplify or misrepresent common practices in food safety and risk management. Banning all contaminants based on manufacturer's capabilities or banning any food with detectable amounts of contaminants could lead to overly restrictive policies that might not be scientifically justified or practical. Similarly, allowing all levels of contamination based on manufacturers' beliefs doesn't ensure public safety and could lead to unnecessary risks."
