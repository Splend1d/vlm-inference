Defining criteria are subjective and differ among researchers.\n\nPerceptual or vernacular regions are challenging to identify because their boundaries and definitions can be highly subjective and vary greatly among different researchers, experts, or individuals. These regions are based on human perceptions, cultural affiliations, and everyday experiences rather than on formal geographic or political boundaries. Different people might emphasize various aspects such as language, customs, history, economy, or social interactions when defining these regions, leading to inconsistencies and disagreements about where one region ends and another begins. This subjectivity makes it difficult to establish universally accepted and consistent criteria for identifying and delineating vernacular regions boundaries."
