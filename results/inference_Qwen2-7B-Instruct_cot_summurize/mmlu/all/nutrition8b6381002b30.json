This process releases energy which is captured in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). \n\nIn the process of aerobic respiration, this yields approximately 32-34 ATP per glucose molecule under optimal conditions. The exact number can vary slightly depending on the efficiency of the cell's metabolic pathways.\n\nSo, among your options, D. 32 is the most accurate representation of the ATP yield from the complete oxidation of glucose."
