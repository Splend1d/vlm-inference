This implies that option A, \"abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament,\" is not a justifiable stance based on his viewpoint.\n\nOptions B and D propose more radical actions: legal abolition of aid agencies and accepting the absence of negative duties towards the poor, respectively. These actions are likely not supported by Ashford's argument, as they would remove existing mechanisms for assistance and deny moral obligations to help those in need.\n\nOption C, adopting a social contract approach to global economic justice, align with Ashford's argument. A social contract theory posits that societies agree to certain rules and obligations for mutual benefit. In the context of global economic justice, this could imply establishing fair agreements and responsibilities between nations to address issues like poverty, inequality, and aid dependency. Such an approach would consider the interconnected nature of global economies and the moral responsibilities we hold to each other, especially in helping those in extreme poverty.\n\nIn conclusion, Ashford's argument most likely supports option C, advocating for a social contract approach to address global economic justice, rather than abandoning aid efforts, legally abolishing aid agencies, or denying moral responsibilities towards the poor."
