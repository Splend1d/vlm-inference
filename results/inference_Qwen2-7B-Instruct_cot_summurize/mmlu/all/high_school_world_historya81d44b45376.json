It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following is a treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. that is similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E.?\n\nA. Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies.\nB. Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\nC. Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.\nD. Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\n"

Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\n\nTacitus describes the Germanic tribes being used as soldiers against others, driven by hatred, plunder, or divine favor. This practice of using barbarian groups as military assets is consistent across time periods. For example, during the Roman Empire (600 BCE-600 CE, barbarian groups such as the Goths, Franks, and Visigoths were recruited into the Roman army. Similarly, in the later period (6600-1450 CE, Germanic tribes like the Franks under Clovis I or the Saxons in England were integrated into the military of their respective kingdoms. Thus, the treatment of barbarians as soldiers is a consistent theme throughout these historical periods when civilizations interacted with groups outside their cultural sphere."
