Higher consumer prices and a misallocation of resources away from efficient producers\n\nImport quotas limit the quantity of a good that can be imported into a country, which typically leads to higher prices for consumers as domestic producers face less competition. This can also result in a misallocation of resources, as production may shift towards goods that are now more profitable due to the quota, even if other goods might have been produced more efficiently or at a lower cost."
