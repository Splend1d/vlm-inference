Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, the act of grabbing one's own son without his consent, especially in a public place like a mall, is considered morally wrong. This action can be seen as inappropriate physical contact and a violation of personal boundaries, both of which are are not acceptable under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, checking out someone else while on a date with one's spouse is generally not considered morally wrong. It could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, but it does not necessarily involve harm or wrongdoing towards another person. This behavior might be frowned upon socially, but it is not universally condemned as morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: \"Wrong, Not wrong.\""
