Typically, for a step-up chopper, the output voltage would be less than the input voltage, and thus the duty cycle should be less than 1.\n\nIf we consider this scenario hypothetically and adjust the question to fit common understanding where the output voltage is less than the input voltage, then let's correct the values slightly to make sense:\n\nIf we assume the correct input voltage was meant to be 150V and output voltage 110V, then the duty cycle would be:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{110}{150} = 0.733 \\]\n\nThis value isn't listed in your options, suggesting there might have been a misinterpretation or typo in the original question. Given the provided options, none of them correctly match with the corrected interpretation based on typical chopper operation principles.\n\nIn the context of the provided choices, assuming a typo in the question or misunderstanding in the setup, the closest value to the hypothetical corrected calculation would be:\n\nB. 0.67.\n\nHowever, please ensure the question accurately reflects the intended scenario, as the standard operation of a step-up chopper doesn't align with any of the provided options under normal circumstances."
