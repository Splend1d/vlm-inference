An \"exudate\" refers to pus or other fluid that may accumulate at the site of inflammation. Therefore, while \"cool to the touch\" might initially seem like an unusual symptom for phlebitis compared to typical signs of warmth and redness, it's not a sign of phleletis. Inflammation usually results in warmth, not coolness."
