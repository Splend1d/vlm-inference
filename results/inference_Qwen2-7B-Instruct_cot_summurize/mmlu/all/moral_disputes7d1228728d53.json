While he generally supports the idea that individuals have natural rights that governments should respect, his arguments can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of the discussion. However, based on Huemer's philosophical work, particularly his stance against what he calls \"the Lockean theory\" which often justifies property rights through labor, Huemer might argue against the idea that the government has an unconditional right to enforce or recognize all natural rights without exception.\n\nGiven this context, none of the options provided (A, B, C, or D directly encapsulate Huemer's exact position without further elaboration. Huemer would likely agree with statements that emphasize the importance of respecting natural rights and that failures by the government to do so could be considered injustices (option D. However, his views might not fully align with options A, B, or C without additional clarification about the specific circumstances under which he might consider the government's disregard of natural rights acceptable or justifiable.\n\nFor instance, Huemer might argue that while the government should strive to protect natural rights, there might be exceptional cases where collective action is necessary, such as preventing harm to others, which could be seen as a form of self-defense by the state. This would lean more towards option C, but it would depend on how the scenario is framed within the broader ethical and political considerations that Huemer discusses.\n\nTo accurately reflect Huemer's views, it would be important to refer to his detailed arguments and theories presented in his works, such as \"Moral Knowledge and Ethical Understanding\" and other publications where he discusses the nature of rights, justice, and the role of the state."
