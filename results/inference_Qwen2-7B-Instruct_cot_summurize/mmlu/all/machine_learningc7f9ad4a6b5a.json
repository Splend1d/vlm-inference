If the learning rate is too high, the network might overshoot the optimal solution during training. Conversely, if it's too low, the network might take a long time to converge or get stuck in a suboptimal solution. Therefore, choosing an appropriate learning rate is crucial for efficient and effective training of a neural network.\n\nStatement 2 is false: Dropout does not multiply randomly chosen activation values by zero. Instead, it randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. The units are not completely disabled but their contribution to the gradient is reduced, effectively averaging the outputs of many networks."
