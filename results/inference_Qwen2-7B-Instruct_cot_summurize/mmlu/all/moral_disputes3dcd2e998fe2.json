Instead, Hardin focuses on the concept of the \"tragedy of the commons,\" which describes a situation where individuals acting in their own self-interest deplete a shared resource, leading to its eventual collapse.\n\nIn his essay, Hardin argues that when individuals have unrestricted access to a shared resource, they tend to overuse it because each person considers only the immediate benefits without considering the long-term consequences. This leads to the depletion of resources and can ultimately result in their inability to sustainably support the community.\n\nSo, the answer to your question would be C. It would lead to a \"tragedy of the commons.\" Hardin does not explicitly address points A and B in the context of \"sharing ethics\" within his essay."
