However, the absolute value of 2 indicates that demand is relatively elastic. This means that a small change in price leads to a proportionally larger change in quantity demanded.\n\nThe price increase led to a decrease in quantity demanded, suggesting that consumers are sensitive to price changes for beef, which supports option A: \"demand for beef is price elastic and consumer spending on beef is falling.\" \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. demand for beef is price elastic and consumer spending on beef is falling.**"
