However, based on his critique of global justice and his concept of \"structural injustice,\" it seems that he might argue for an element of both A and B. \n\nA. Imposing on them the lasting effects of historical crimes - Pogge argues that wealthy nations and corporations often benefit from practices that exploit poorer countries, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality. These actions can have lasting negative impacts on the poor, even if the exploitation occurred historically.\n\nB. Keeping them below welfare in the state-of-nature - This refers to the idea that without intervention or societal structures, humans would naturally organize themselves into a state where wealth disparities are exist. Pogge would likely disagree with this notion when it comes to the global scale, as he sees current economic and political systems as maintaining and exacerbating inequalities.\n\nSo, the most accurate answer might be:\n\nC. Both A and B\n\nThis reflects Pogge's argument that affluent citizens and nations contribute to global structural injustices through their economic practices and policies choices, which can lead to the perpetuation of poverty and exploitation."
