Marital Communication Privilege.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, there is a marital communications privilege that protects certain confidential communications between spouses from being introduced as evidence in court. This privilege aims to encourage spouses to share freely without fear that their communications will later be used against each other. The exact scope and application of this privilege can vary by state or country, but it generally excludes statements made during the course of marriage, even if they might be relevant to the case at hand.\n\nIn this scenario, if the statement was made during their marriage and was intended to remain private, the judge might rule that allowing its use as evidence would violate the marital communications privilege. However, it's important to note that the applicability and specifics of such a privilege depend on the laws of the jurisdiction in question."
