                    "text": "A 10-year-old girl decided to go sledding during a heavy snow and ice storm. She planned to go sledding down Hill Street, a steep and winding thoroughfare. Hill Street, which was located around the corner from the girl's home, was a popular sledding site because of its precipitous incline. The girl's parents had given her permission to sled down Hill Street. On the way to Hill Street, the girl met a classmate, who was 12, and asked if she wanted to join her. The classmate agreed, and the two girls walked to the top of Hill Street together. There, the youngsters mounted the sled. The girl was sitting in front and controlling the steering mechanism while the classmate was behind her. They started their descent at a relatively good speed. As they were about halfway down the road, they approached the intersection of Hill Street and Maple Drive. A driver, who was driving his car along Maple Drive, entered the intersection at the same time as the girls on the sled. When the classmate saw the driver's auto cross into their path, she shouted to the girl to fall off the sled. The girl became frightened and refused to jump off. Just before the sled collided with the car, the classmate pushed the girl off the sled. Her push caused the girl to fall and break her leg. The classmate couldn't get off the sled in time and was struck and injured by the driver's car. If the girl's parents, on behalf of their daughter, assert a claim against the classmate to recover damages for the girl's broken leg, will they prevail?\n\nA. No, if the classmate believed that the girl was in imminent peril when she pushed her off the sled.\nB. No, unless the classmate acted unreasonably when she pushed the girl off the sled.\nC. No, if the driver was driving negligently.\nD. No, because the classmate had the girl's implied consent to act in an emergency.\n"

No, unless the classmate acted unreasonably when she pushed the girl off the sled.\n\nIn this scenario, the classmate's actions would be evaluated under the principle of \"implied consent\" and the duty to prevent harm to others. Implied consent generally means that one person has the other's permission to take certain actions under specific circumstances. However, the extent to which this applies in the case of a sudden emergency depends on various factors, including the immediacy of the danger and the reasonableness of the actions taken.\n\nIf the classmate's decision to push the girl off the sled was a reasonable response to the perceived danger posed by the oncoming vehicle, it might be considered an exercise of implied consent to prevent greater harm. However, if the classmate's actions were deemed unreasonable\u2014such as if the danger could have been avoided by other means or if the push resulted in additional injury to the girl\u2014the classmate may not have the legal protection of implied consent.\n\nThe girl's parents seeking damages for their daughter's broken leg would likely need to prove that the classmate's actions were unreasonable under the circumstances, and that this unreasonableness led to the injuries sustained. This would involve demonstrating that there was a lack of justification for the push, considering the alternatives available to the classmate to prevent the collision without causing further injury."
