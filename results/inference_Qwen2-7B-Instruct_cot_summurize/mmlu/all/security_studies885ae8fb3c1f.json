An increase in non-traditional security threats.\n\nWhen states engage in inefficient balancing or buckpassing, they may fail to effectively manage their security responsibilities or share burdens with other nations. This can lead to power vacuums, miscalculations of regional dynamics, and the emergence of new security challenges that traditional military alliances might not address adequately. Non-traditional security threats such as terrorism, cyber attacks, pandemics, and environmental disasters can take advantage of such vulnerabilities, leading to an increase in these types of threats."
