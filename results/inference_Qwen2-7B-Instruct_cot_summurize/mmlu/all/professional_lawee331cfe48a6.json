The university contacted a coach who had a strong reputation as a person who cottld \"turn around\" a program and produce winning teams. The university offered the coach an annual salary of $250,000 to coach its basketball team, but the coach declined the offer, hoping to find another institution that would pay him a higher salary. Thereafter, a wealthy booster, who was interested in enhancing the university's basketball program, contacted the coach and told him that if he would sign a coaching contract with the university, the booster would pay him $50,000 a year as an unpublished supplement to his salary. Furthermore, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund every time the basketball team won a game under the coach's tutelage. The coach thereupon signed a three-year contract as the head basketball coach at the university at an annual salary of $250,000. During the coach's first year as coach, the university basketball team compiled a record of 18 wins and 12 losses. The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund. Assume that the agreement between the coach and the booster does not violate any rule of the university or of any intercollegiate athletic association. The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. Is it likely that the university will prevail in this contract action?\n\nA. Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.\nB. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\nC. No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.\nD. No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.\n"

Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\n\nIn this scenario, the university entered into a contract with the coach based on the assumption that the booster would provide additional funding to the university athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. The university hired the coach specifically due to this promise, which can be considered detrimental reliance. Detrimental reliance occurs when one party changes their position in reliance on the promises of another, and the promisor then fails to fulfill those promises. This reliance justifies the university's right to seek damages from the booster for the breach of contract.\n\nWhile option A ( the university being an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster, might also apply since the university indirectly benefited from the promise, it is not the primary reason why the university would prevail. The key factor here is the detrimental reliance on the promise, which makes option B the most appropriate choice.\n\nOptions C and D do not apply in this case. Option C incorrectly suggests that the promise is illegal or against public policy, which is not given as a fact in the scenario. Option D states that the promise was made to the coach rather than to the university, but this distinction does not invalidate the claim for breach of contract against the booster for the university's benefit."
