The molecule has a net unpaired electron, which leads to a total of five equivalent unpaired electrons due to the presence of two nitrogen atoms, each with one unpaired electron. Each unpaired electron can be in one of two spin states: up or down. Therefore, for each electron, there are 2 possible states, leading to $2^5 = 32$ possible combinations.\n\nHowever, this calculation includes states that result in zero magnetic moment ( when both spins of an electron pair are aligned in the same direction, which does not contribute to the EPR signal. Since there are two pairs of electrons (one per nitrogen atom), we need to exclude these 2 states from our count, leaving us with $32 - 2 = 30$ possible states that contribute to the EPR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among your options (A. 21, B. 3, C. 7, D. 24. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the options provided. The correct number of lines in the EPR spectrum, considering no overlap and excluding the states with zero magnetic moment, would be 30."
