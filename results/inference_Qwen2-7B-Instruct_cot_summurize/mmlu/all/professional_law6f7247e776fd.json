                    "text": "During the final days of his presidency, many of the President's Cabinet members began leaking rather embarrassing stories about the President to the press. In one such story, which appeared in a newspaper, an unidentified Cabinet member was quoted as saying that the President pardoned the owner of a professional baseball team, for a previous felony conviction because the owner promised to give the President a lifetime pass to all future games. Upset by these news \"leaks,\" the President, in his last official act, issued an executive order banning all executive employees from having conversations with members of the press unless prior permission had been obtained from an administrative supervisor. The executive order called for the dismissal of any employee willfully in violation of that order. After the President left office, the press made repeated references to the executive order and derisively referred to it as the President's legacy. Nonetheless, after the new President took office he promised to abide by the order. Thereafter one of the Vice President's senior advisers, leaked a story to a magazine stating that the Vice President told staff members that the only reason he visited a city following an earthquake was because he wanted to play golf at a nearby golf course. The magazine printed the story and named the senior adviser as the source. In compliance with civil service regulations, a hearing was conducted and the senior adviser was found to have violated the executive order barring unauthorized conununications with print media. Subsequently, the senior adviser was summarily dismissed from his executive staff position. The senior adviser brings an appropriate action seeking reinstatement and challenges the constitutionality of the executive order. If this case reaches the U. S. Supreme Court, the justices should rule the executive order is\n\nA. constitutional, because governmental employment is a privilege and not a right.\nB. constitutional, because the President has plenary power to set forth employment regulations for executive department employees.\nC. unconstitutional, because Congress, not the President, has authority to regulate the terms and conditions of federal employment.\nD. unconstitutional, because the President cannot broadly limit all executive employees' freedom of speech and association.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. unconstitutional, because the President cannot broadly limit all executive employees' freedom of speech and association.\n\nIn the United States, the Constitution guarantees certain fundamental rights to its citizens, including freedom of speech and association. These rights are protected under the First Amendment. When it comes to government employees, particularly those in the executive branch, there may be restrictions on their speech and association, but these restrictions must still comply with constitutional principles.\n\nIn this case, the executive order issued by the President aims to restrict all executive employees' ability to communicate with the press without prior approval. Such a broad restriction on the freedom of speech and association of executive employees would likely run afoul of the First Amendment. The First Amendment does not provide absolute protection for all forms of speech, especially when the speaker is acting in a capacity that involves public duties or responsibilities, but it does generally protect speech that is not directly related to the performance of public duties.\n\nMoreover, the President's power to regulate the conduct of executive branch employees is subject to the constraints of the Constitution, including the First Amendment. While the President can set standards of conduct for executive branch employees, those standards must be reasonable and narrowly tailored to serve a legitimate government interest, and they cannot infringe upon constitutionally rights unnecessarily.\n\nGiven the nature of the executive order and the implications for the First Amendment rights of executive branch employees, the U.S. Supreme Court would likely find the executive order unconstitutional if challenged, particularly if the senior adviser successfully argues that the order is overly broad and infringes upon their First Amendment rights without serving a compelling government interest."
