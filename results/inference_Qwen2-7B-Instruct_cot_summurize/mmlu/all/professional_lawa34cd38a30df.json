                    "text": "The owner of a drug store hired an independent contractor to renovate the store. Among other things, the renovations included installing a new front door made of plate glass. The contractor purchased the door from a glass door company. The sales representative of the glass door company told the contractor and the owner that plate glass was \"super safe\" and could withstand considerable pressure. The contractor installed the door, completed the other renovation work, and the store reopened for business later that same month. A few weeks later, a shopper and her 9-year- old son went to the drug store to purchase some merchandise. As they approached the store, the son was skipping ahead of his mother. Until he was within a few steps of the door, he thought it was open. When he realized it was, in fact, closed, he slowed down and, while still \"going faster than walking,\" pushed his hand against the handle to push open the door. His hand slipped off the handle and, at the same time, there was a \"kind of exploding noise. \" Due to a defect, the glass shattered and broke, cutting the son's hand and wrist. A subsequent inspection revealed that the glass door had been negligently installed by the contractor. If the shopper, on behalf of her son, asserts a claim against the glass door company based on strict products liability, the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the glass door was defective.\nB. prevail, because the sales representative represented the plate glass as being \"super safe. \"\nC. not prevail, because the contractor negligently installed the plate glass door.\nD. not prevail, because the son negligently pushed open the glass door.\n"

                    "text": "In this scenario, the claim brought by the shopper on behalf of her son against the glass door company would likely be evaluated under the principles of strict products liability. Strict products liability is a legal doctrine that holds manufacturers liable for any harm caused by their products, regardless of whether the manufacturer was negligent or not. This liability can arise if the product is found to be defective.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\n1. **Defectiveness**: The glass door was found to have a defect (\u2014 it shattered due to negligence in installation. This suggests that the product did not meet the standard of safety expected of a product when used as intended.\n\n2. **Representation of Safety**: The sales representative told the contractor and the owner that the plate glass was \"super safe.\" This could be seen as an express warranty of safety, which could potentially make the manufacturer liable under strict products liability if the glass failed to perform as advertised.\n\n3. **Negligent Installation**: The issue here is that the glass door was negligently installed by the contractor. However, under strict products liability, the focus is primarily on the product itself rather than the actions of third parties like the installer.\n\n4. **Son's Negligence**: The son's action in pushing the door at a speed faster than walking contributed to the injury. However, under strict products liability, the fault typically lies with the manufacturer or seller of the product, not the user.\n\nConsidering these points, **option B** \u2014 \"prevail, because the sales representative represented the plate glass as being 'super safe'\" \u2014 might be the most compelling reason for the plaintiff to prevail, especially if the court interprets the sales representative's statement as an express warranty of safety. The defectiveness of the product and the representation of its safety by the sales representative could lead to a finding of strict products liability on the part of the glass door company.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific outcome would depend on the jurisdiction's laws regarding strict products liability, the strength of the evidence presented, and the application of legal doctrines such as the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur ( (the thing speaks for itself), which may imply negligence on the part of the manufacturer or seller based on the circumstances.\n\nIn summary, without more detailed legal analysis and considering the specific legal framework of the applicable jurisdiction, option B presents a strong argument for the plaintiff's potential success in a strict products liability claim."
