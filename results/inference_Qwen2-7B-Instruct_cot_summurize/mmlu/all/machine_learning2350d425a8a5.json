Models such as ResNets and their variants often achieve over 98% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is a standard dataset for evaluating image classification algorithms.\n\nStatement 2 is false. The original ResNets (introduced by He et al. in 2015) were indeed optimized using the Adam optimizer. This optimizer was chosen for its efficiency in handling large mini-batch sizes, which is particularly beneficial when training deep networks."
