Passive, active, and interactive.\n\n1. **Passive Scanning**: This type of scanning does not involve sending any data packets or exploiting vulnerabilities. It involves monitoring and analyzing network traffic to detect patterns, anomalies, or information that can be used for security purposes. It's less intrusive but may miss some vulnerabilities that require active interaction.\n\n2. **Active Scanning**: In this method, scanners send out data packets to test network connectivity and identify open ports, services running on those ports, and potential vulnerabilities. It can provide more comprehensive results than passive scanning but might trigger firewalls or intrusion detection systems (which could raise alerts.\n\n3. **Interactive Scanning**: This term is not commonly used in the context of scanning types as described in options A, B, and D. However, it could imply a scenario where an interactive process is involved, possibly meaning that human intervention is required to confirm findings or to proceed with certain actions based on the results of the scan. It's more about the method of execution rather than a distinct category of scanning. \n\nOptions A, B, and D refer to aspects of scanning rather than types. \"Port, network, and services\" refers to elements that might be scanned; \"network, vulnerability, and port\" also refers to elements but might be misinterpreted; and \"server, client, and network\" doesn't categorize scanning types effectively."
