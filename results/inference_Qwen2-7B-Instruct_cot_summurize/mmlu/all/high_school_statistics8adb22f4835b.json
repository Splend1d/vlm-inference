The null hypothesis (H0) typically states that there is no significant difference between the sample mean and the claimed value ( in this case, 300 mg. The alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that there is a significant difference.\n\nGiven the data: 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303 mg, we first calculate the sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) and the standard deviation (s). \n\nLet's calculate:\n\nSample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)):\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303}{7} = \\frac{2110}{7} = 301.43\n\\]\n\nStandard deviation (s):\nFirst, find the variance (s\u00b2:\n\\[\ns^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{(299-301.43)^2 + ( (300-301.43)^2 + ( (305-301.43)^2 + ( (302-301.43)^2 + (299-301.43)^2 + (301-301.43)^2 + (303-301.43)^2}{7-1}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{(-2.43)^2 + (-1.43)^2 + (3.57)^2 + ( 0.57)^2 + (-2.43)^2 + (-0.43)^2 + (1.57)^2}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{5.89 + 2.04 + 12.73 + 0.32 + 5.89 + 0.18 + 2.46}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{32.3}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 5.3833\n\\]\n\nNow, s (standard deviation:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{s^2} = \\sqrt{5.3833} \\approx 2.32\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the t-statistic using:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s/\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{301.43 - 300}{2.32/\\sqrt{7}} \\approx \\frac{1.43}{0.89} \\approx 1.61\n\\]\n\nHowever, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication because the provided options use a t-value of 1.54, which doesn't match our calculation based on the data given. Given the options and assuming they might refer to a hypothetical or incorrectly calculated scenario, we would look for the correct interpretation of the t-distribution table or formula used to derive the P-value.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. P(t > 1.54) with df = 6  \nB. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6  \nC. P(t > 1.54) with df = 7  \nD. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7  \n\nWe know the degrees of freedom (df = n - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 for a single-sample t-test. The P-value is typically found in a t-distribution table or using statistical software. However, since our calculated t-statistic is approximately 1.61, not 1.54, and given the options, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in providing the exact t-statistic used for the calculation.\n\nGiven the options are based on a different t-statistic (11.54), the correct choice depends on whether the P-value corresponds to a one-tailed or two-tailed test. If the test is two-tailed (testing for any difference from the claimed value, not just if the sample mean is less than or greater than the claimed value), then:\n\nB. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6 or D. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7 would be correct, as it accounts for the probability in both tails of the distribution.\n\nWithout recalculating the exact P-value based on the given t-statistic (1.54"
