A high voltage battery with resistors arranged in parallel.\n\nIn a parallel circuit, each resistor has its own path for the current to flow through, meaning the total current can be divided among all the paths. This allows more current to flow compared to a series circuit where the current has only one path to follow. \n\nBetween options A and B, option B has a higher voltage, which directly affects the amount of current a circuit can draw from the battery (current = voltage / resistance, assuming the same total resistance. Therefore, a combination of high voltage and parallel resistors would result in the highest possible current in a circuit."
