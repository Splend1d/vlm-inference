Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\nThe Aurignacian culture, which emerged around 40,000 years ago, is characterized by its sophisticated stone tools and is considered part of the Upper Paleolithic period. These tools were often made from flint or other hard stones and included a variety of shapes, such as blades, burins, and scrapers. One significant difference between Aurignacian and earlier Mousterian technologies lies in the efficiency and utility of the tools surfaces. Aurignacian tools tend to have larger usable surfaces compared to Mousterian tools, which could lead to greater efficiency in tasks like butchering animals or processing plant foods.\n\nMousterian technology, associated with Neanderthals, generally produced tools types like hand axes, cleavers, and scrapers. While these were effective for their time, they often had less surface area that could be used for practical purposes compared to Aurignacian tools. The development of more efficient tool-making techniques during the Aurignacian period suggests advancements in cognitive abilities and possibly the use of new technologies like pressure flaking, which allowed for thinner, sharper edges on tools blades."
