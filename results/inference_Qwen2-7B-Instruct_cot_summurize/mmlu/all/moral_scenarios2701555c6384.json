Friendly fire is a term used in military contexts where there is an accidental injury or damage caused by one's own side during combat operations. It can be a tragic outcome of a conflict but is not something that can be pursued as a hobby. The use of the term as a hobby could be seen as insensitive or inappropriate, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless it involves causing harm or distress to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving students an F for the semester for answering questions correctly is clearly morally wrong. According to educational and ethical standards, grading should reflect a student's understanding and performance based on the criteria established at the beginning of the course. Giving an F for correct answers suggests that the teacher has imposed an arbitrary or unfair grading policy, which is not only unethical but also potentially illegal in many jurisdictions where education laws protect students from such practices."
