They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment\u2026.But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.\"\nThomas Jefferson, 1816\nWhich of following Amendments to the Constitution is most directly an example of the sentiments expressed above?\n\nA. The First Amendment, which guaranteed the right to free speech\nB. The Tenth Amendment, which allows powers not granted to the federal government be granted to the states\nC. The Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed all women the right to vote\nD. The Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the prohibition of alcohol\n"

Among the options provided, the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the prohibition of alcohol, best exemplifies this concept.\n\nThe Eighteenth Amendment, ratified in 1919, introduced the prohibition of the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors. This was a significant shift in policy aimed at addressing social issues such as alcohol abuse and corruption related to alcohol sales. However, it proved to be largely ineffective and was met with widespread lawbreaking and the emergence of organized crime networks involved in illegal alcohol distribution.\n\nIn response to these challenges and public dissatisfaction, Congress passed the Twenty-first Amendment, which was ratified in 1933. This amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment, effectively ending national prohibition and allowing states to regulate the sale and consumption of alcohol within their borders. The Twenty-first Amendment demonstrated the willingness of the U.S. Constitution to adapt to changing societal values and circumstances, reflecting Jefferson's belief in the need for laws and institutions to evolve alongside human progress and enlightenment."
