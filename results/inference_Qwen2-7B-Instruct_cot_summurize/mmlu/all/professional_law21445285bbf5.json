A man's record showed four prior convictions for nonviolent crimes involving theft or bad checks, each one pertaining to property or cash in excess of $100 but not in excess of $500. On the fifth conviction, after conviction of passing a $100 bad check, the court sentenced him to life without parole under a repeat offender statute. He challenged the sentence and the statute based on the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. Will the Court likely invalidate the sentence on these facts?\n\nA. Yes, because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, none of which involved bodily injury, and there is no possibility of parole.\nB. Yes, because life imprisonment can never be an appropriate punishment for criminality that does not take human life.\nC. No, because theft and passing bad checks has become a national emergency warranting tough remedial action to protect the economy, institutions and persons being victimized.\nD. No, because it is improper for the courts to attempt to interject their value judgments into a state's ostensibly reasonable legislative sentencing schemes.\n"

However, given the nature of the case and the arguments presented, I believe option D is the most likely outcome:\n\nD. No, because it is improper for the courts to attempt to interject their value judgments into a state's ostensibly reasonable legislative sentencing schemes.\n\nIn Eighth Amendment cases, the Supreme Court often defers to the legislature's judgment regarding what constitutes an appropriate punishment for a particular offense. The Court has historically been reluctant to second-guess a state's policy choices regarding sentencing unless those choices are so severe as to be categorically unreasonable or to shock the conscience. In this case, if the state legislature has determined that five-time offenders of theft or passing of bad checks involving over $100 should receive life imprisonment without parole, the Supreme Court may uphold this law if it finds that such a penalty is not categorically unreasonable or violates the principle of proportionality that the Eighth Amendment embodies. \n\nThat said, the Court could potentially find the sentence disproportionate if it concludes that the severity of the punishment (life without parole) does not adequately reflect the gravity of the crime, especially considering the non-violent nature of the offenses and the absence of any evidence suggesting the defendant poses a significant risk to public safety. However, the Court would likely require a very strong argument to invalidate a sentence that align with the state's policy on recidivist offenses."
