Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the action of considering forcefully pushing the blind and deaf man out of the way of an oncoming train would be considered morally wrong. This is because it involves actively causing harm to another person, even if the intention is to prevent a greater harm that could occur if the man were hit by the train.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving customers coffee with spit in it is also morally wrong. This act intentionally harms others, as it involves contaminating food or drink that they are paying for and consuming. It goes against basic principles of honesty, fairness, and respect for other people's' well-being and property."
