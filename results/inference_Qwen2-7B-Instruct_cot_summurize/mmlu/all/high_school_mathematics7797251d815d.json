In Kristen's opinion, there are 5 vowels ( (a, e, i, o, u). \n\nTo find the probability of selecting a vowel in each person's opinion, we divide the number of vowels by the total number of letters in the alphabet:\n\n- Wayne's probability: \\( \\frac{6}{26} \\)\n- Kristen's probability: \\( \\frac{5}{26} \\)\n\nThe difference in probabilities is:\n\n\\( \\frac{6}{22} - \\frac{5}{22} = \\frac{1}{22} \\)\n\nTo convert this difference into a percentage increase from Kristen's perspective, we divide the difference by Kristen's probability and multiply by 100:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{\\frac{1}{22}}{\\frac{5}{22}} \\right) * 100 = \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right) * 100 = 20\\% \\)\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected letter out of the 26-letter alphabet will be a vowel is 20% greater in Wayne\u2019s opinion than in Kristen\u2019s opinion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 20%."
