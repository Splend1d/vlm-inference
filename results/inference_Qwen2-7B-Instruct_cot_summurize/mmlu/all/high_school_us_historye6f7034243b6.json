Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people\u2014these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency.\n\"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . .\"\n\u2014Port Huron Statement, 1962\nThe Port Huron Statement, excerpted above, can most clearly be seen as an important document in which of the following movements?\n\nA.

This statement, formally known as \"A Call to Action\" or the \"Port Huron Statement,\" was released by the Students for a Democratic Society ( (SDS) in 1962. It outlined the concerns, goals, and vision of a generation of young Americans who were disillusioned with the political establishment and eager to challenge the status quo, particularly in response to issues like civil rights and the Cold War.\n\nThe New Left encompassed various social movements, including civil rights, anti-war protests, and opposition to the Vietnam War, which were all addressed in the Port Huron Statement. The document reflects the growing dissatisfaction among young people with the existing political order and their desire for a more equitable and democratic society."
