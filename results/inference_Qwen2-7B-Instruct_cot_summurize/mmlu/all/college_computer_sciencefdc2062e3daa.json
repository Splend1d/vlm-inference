P_1 can be solved in polynomial time but P_2 is not known to be solvable in polynomial time**.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### Problem P_1: Finding a Shortest Simple Path\nThis problem can indeed be solved in polynomial time using algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm for graphs with non-negative edge weights or Bellman-Ford algorithm which can handle negative edge weights but not negative cycles. These algorithms have time complexities that are polynomial in the number of vertices \\(|V|\\) and edges \\(|E|\\), typically \\(O(|V|^2)\\) for Dijkstra's algorithm and \\(O(|V||E|)\\) for Bellman-Ford algorithm when implemented naively, but optimized versions exist that reduce the complexity further.\n\n#### Problem P_2: Finding a Longest Simple Path\nFinding a longest simple path in an undirected graph between two vertices is significantly more challenging than finding the shortest path. This problem is NP-hard. The reason is that it can be used to solve other known NP-hard problems, such as the Hamiltonian Path problem, by setting up constraints on the lengths of paths and using binary variables to represent the presence or absence of edges in the path. Since the Hamiltonian Path problem is NP-complete, and it is a special case of finding the longest path where all vertices must be visited exactly once, this implies that finding the longest path is at least as hard as solving any problem in NP. Therefore, there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for solving this problem, and it is not known if one exists.\n\nIn summary, while P_1 can be efficiently solved using known algorithms, the complexity of P_2 places it outside the class of problems that are known to be solvable in polynomial time."
