While he was handing his money to the store clerk at the cash register, a police officer entered the store. The taxi driver had received several traffic tickets from the police officer, and he felt that the police officer had been very rude to him. Seeking to gain some revenge, the taxi driver immediately began to taunt and berate the police officer, calling him a variety of profane and insulting names. The police officer was going through a series of personal difficulties and was feeling very emotionally fragile. As the taxi driver's insults rained down on him, the police officer suddenly snapped. He whipped out his gun and fired a shot at the taxi driver. The bullet missed the taxi driver but hit the store clerk, who was standing behind the taxi driver. The clerk survived the shooting but suffered a gunshot wound to his shoulder. In an action by the injured clerk against the taxi driver to recover for his personal injuries, plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. recover, because the taxi driver's conduct was the proximate cause of the clerk's injuries.\nB. recover, because it was foreseeable that the taxi driver's conduct would result in the clerk being shot.\nC. not recover, because the shooting was not a foreseeable consequence of the taxi driver's conduct.\nD. not recover, because the police officer intended to shoot the taxi driver, not the store clerk.\n"

In this scenario, the taxi driver's taunting and berating of the police officer was not intended to cause harm to the clerk or lead to a shooting. The actions of the police officer, who was emotionally fragile and reacted violently, were an unforeseeable and independent event.\n\nThe law generally does not hold one person responsible for the actions of another unless there is a direct causal link between the two actions, and that link is foreseeable. In this case, the taxi driver's behavior towards the police officer did not logically predict the police officer's reaction of drawing his gun and shooting. Therefore, the court is unlikely to find that the taxi driver's conduct was a legal cause of the clerk's injury based on the principle of foreseeability."
