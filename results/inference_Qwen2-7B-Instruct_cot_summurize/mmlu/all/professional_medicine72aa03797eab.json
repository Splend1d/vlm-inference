He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. Treatment with a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms?\n\nA. Decreasing myocardial contractility\nB. Dilating the coronary arteries\nC. Peripheral vasodilation\nD. Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs\n"

This can help decrease the oxygen demand of the heart muscle, making it easier for the heart to meet its oxygen needs during physical activity or periods of stress. In a patient with a history of myocardial infarction, this can be particularly beneficial in managing angina (chest pain triggered by exertion) by reducing the workload on the heart and potentially preventing further ischemia or damage."
