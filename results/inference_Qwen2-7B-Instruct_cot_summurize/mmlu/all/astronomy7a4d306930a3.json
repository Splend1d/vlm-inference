What happened to this \"lost\"water?\n\nA. it was stripped away by the magnetic field when it rapidly decreased in strength\nB. it was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape\nC. it was consumed by a civilization of thirsty Martians\nD. it was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape\n"

Mars' thin atmosphere, combined with its lower gravity, makes it easier for gases like water vapor to escape into space. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun can break water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The lighter hydrogen atoms have less mass and are more likely to escape the planet's gravity compared to heavier oxygen atoms. This process has led to the loss of a significant amount of Mars' water over time."
