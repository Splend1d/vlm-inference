Physical examination shows numerous lacerations and ecchymoses over the face. His vision is normal. Ocular, facial, and lingual movements are intact. The gag reflex is present. Sensation to pinprick is absent over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin. Sensation also is absent over the right side of the tongue. X-rays of the skull show fractures of the orbit, zygomatic arch, and infratemporal fossa. The most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting which of the following locations?\n\nA. Foramen lacerum\nB. Foramen ovale\nC. Foramen rotundum\nD. Foramen spinosum\n"

Foramen ovale**\n\nThis is because the foramen ovale is located near the zygomatic arch ( and the infratemporal fossa. It is part of the floor of the middle cranial fossa and communicates with the infratemporal fossa. A fracture at this location can lead to damage to the surrounding structures, including sensory nerves that supply the face and parts of the tongue, as well as structures related to the eye and facial muscles. The absence of sensation over the right side of the face and tongue, along with the presence of lacerations and ecchymoses over the face, are consistent with this type of injury."
