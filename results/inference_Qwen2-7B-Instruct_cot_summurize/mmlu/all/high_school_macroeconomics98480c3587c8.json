Economic growth is critical in determining the standard of living in a nation. \n\nEconomic growth refers to the increase in the total output or value of goods and services produced over time within an economy. It is typically measured using metrics such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP, which reflects the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.\n\nWhile economic growth does not necessarily mean that it is shared equally among the population ( making option B incorrect, and while GDP can be influenced by government spending, which makes option D a partial truth but not the most comprehensive explanation, it's important to note that economic growth directly impacts the standard of living in a nation. Higher economic growth generally leads to increased income levels, more jobs, improved infrastructure, better healthcare, education, and overall quality of life for citizens. This is why option C is the correct answer."
