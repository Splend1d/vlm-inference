The collapse of the Soviet Union and its satellite states resulted in a power vacuum, which contributed to instability and ethnic conflicts. Borders that had been defined during the era of communism were redrawn or questioned, leading to tensions over territorial claims and minority rights. This period saw the rise of nationalist movements and the emergence of new nation-states, which often resulted in ethnic conflicts as different groups sought recognition and autonomy."
