They have a strong regional identity and language, and there have been movements advocating for greater autonomy or independence from both Spain and France.\n\n- The Bretons are a Celtic people living in Brittany, a region in northwestern France. They also have a distinct culture, language (Breton), and have historically sought greater autonomy.\n\n- The Kashmiris are a community primarily inhabiting the disputed region of Kashmir, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan. They advocate for self-determination or statehood within either India or Pakistan, depending on the political perspective.\n\n- The Tamils are a major ethnic group found predominantly in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. They have a rich cultural heritage and have advocated for greater autonomy, particularly in Sri Lanka where tensions exist between the Tamil majority and the Sinhalese majority.\n\nIt's important to note that not all regionalist groups necessarily engage in violence or terrorism, but some may resort to such methods if negotiations fail or to garner attention for their cause. However, the term \"terrorist groups\" specifically refers to organizations that use violence as a means to achieve their goals, which doesn't universally apply to all regionalist groups mentioned here."
