                    "text": "Wellman's argument suggests that if one were to deny a country's right to freedom of association, they might face certain unpalatable implications. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The inability to explain why it would be wrong to force Canada to join NAFTA: If a country's freedom of association is denied, it implies that other countries have the right to compel another nation to participate in certain international agreements or organizations against its will. This could lead to the argument that if a country can be forced to join an organization like NAFTA (against its wishes, then there might not be a principled reason why another country, such as the United States, couldn't forcefully annex another nation like Canada.\n\nB. The inability to explain why it would be wrong for the United States to forcefully annex Canada: This point follows logically from the first implication. If denying freedom of association leads to the conclusion that one country can coerce another into joining a group or organization, then it might also imply that one country can forcefully take over another territory against its will. This could justify actions that many people would find morally reprehensible, such as annexation.\n\nC. Both A and B: This option combines the two previous points, suggesting that denying a country's freedom of association leads to justifying both forcing a country to join an organization and forcefully taking over a country's territory.\n\nD. Neither A nor B: This option argues that denying a country's freedom of association does not inherently justify either forcing a country to join an organization or forcefully taking over a territory.\n\nGiven Wellman's argument, it seems likely that he would argue for option C, both A and B, because denying freedom of association could lead to justifying both situations. However, without specific information about Wellman's exact stance, we can only infer based on the logical implications presented in the question."
