Capacity for long-distance dispersal\n\nA biological attribute that allows a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution is its ability to disperse over long distances. This could be through various means such as wind, water currents, animal transport, or human activity. Species with this capacity can spread across different environments and continents, potentially leading to a wide global distribution. \n\nOptions A, B, and C are not conducive to becoming cosmopolitan:\n- A. Extreme habitat specialization would limit a species' ability to adapt to new environments and thus restrict its distribution.\n- B. K-selected reproductive rate refers to species that have a slower growth rate, invest heavily in fewer offspring, and tend to live in stable environments. These species might not easily adapt to new or changing environments.\n- C. Limited dispersal abilities would hinder the species from spreading widely and adapting to different habitats, thus limiting its cosmopolitan potential.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice."
