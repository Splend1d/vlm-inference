P(A|B) decreases**: The conditional probability \\(P(A|B)\\) represents the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. If \\(P(A, B)\\) decreases while \\(P(A)\\) increases, it doesn't necessarily mean \\(P(A|B)\\) decreases. In fact, if \\(P(A)\\) increases significantly compared to \\(P(A, B)\\), \\(P(A|B)\\) could potentially increase if the decrease in \\(P(A, B)\\) is not proportionate to the increase in \\(P(A)\\). So, this statement isn't necessarily true without additional context.\n\n- **B. P(B|A) decreases**: Similar to the analysis for A, \\(P(B|A)\\) represents the probability of B given A. If \\(P(A, B)\\) decreases while \\(P(A)\\) increases, \\(P(B|A)\\) could decrease if the decrease in the joint probability \\(P(A, B)\\) outpaces the increase in \\(P(A)\\). However, this also depends on how much \\(P(A)\\) increases relative to its joint occurrence with \\(B\\).\n\n- **C. P(B) decreases**: This is not necessarily true. The change in \\(P(A, B)\\) and \\(P(A)\\) does not automatically imply that \\(P(B)\\) decreases. \\(P(B)\\) could remain unchanged, increase, or decrease depending on whether events A and B are independent, mutually exclusive, or dependent in other ways.\n\nGiven the nature of conditional probabilities and the information provided, none of the options can be conclusively determined as universally true without further specifics about the relationship between events A and B ( beyond their joint probability decreasing and A's probability increasing. Therefore, the most accurate response based on the information given would be that none of the above statements must necessarily be true without additional context or conditions specified. \n\nHowever, if we must choose from the given options considering the principles of probability theory, option D \"All of above\" would not be correct because at least one of the statements (A and B specifically, might under certain conditions be true, but the conditions under which they are true are not guaranteed by the information provided alone. The key is understanding that changes in individual and joint probabilities do not necessarily dictate the direction of conditional probabilities without knowing more about the specific relationships between the events."
