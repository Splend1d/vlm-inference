She says her heart is \"racing\" and she is coughing up a small amount of bloodstreaked sputum. Medical history is significant for hypothyroidism, for which she takes levothyroxine. An intravenous catheter is placed. Vital signs are temperature 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse 132/min, respirations 32/min, and blood pressure 135/78 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen via nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Auscultation of the lungs discloses decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally. Cardiac examination discloses an irregularly irregular rhythm, an indistinct point of maximal impulse, and a loud S1. A grade 3/6, low-pitched, diastolic, rumbling murmur is audible at the apex; a distinct snapping sound precedes the murmur. Fetal heart rate is 144/min. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the findings in this patient?\n\nA. Chronic mitral regurgitation secondary to rheumatic heart disease\nB. Coarctation of the aorta\nC. Congenital aortic stenosis\nD. Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation\n"

                    "text": "The most likely cause of the findings in this patient is D. Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Chronic mitral regurgitation secondary to rheumatic heart disease: This would typically present with symptoms like dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and heart failure, but not specifically with wheezing or coughing up blood-streaked sputum, which are more indicative of pulmonary edema associated with mitral stenosis.\n\nB. Coarctation of the aorta: This condition involves narrowing of the aorta, leading to high blood pressure above the narrowing and low blood pressure below it. It does not directly correlate with the symptoms described such as wheezing, coughing up blood-streaked sputum, or the presence of an irregular heart rhythm.\n\nC. Congenital aortic stenosis: This would typically involve a narrow opening in the aortic valve that limits blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. Symptoms can include chest pain, fainting, and exercise intolerance, but do not usually present with the symptoms mentioned here.\n\nD. Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation: Mitral stenosis involves a narrowed mitral valve, causing reduced blood flow through the heart and potentially leading to backflow into the left atrium (a condition known as mitral regurgitation. This can lead to pulmonary congestion and edema. The patient's symptoms such as wheezing, coughing up blood-streaked sputum, and an irregularly irregular heart rhythm (indicative of atrial fibrillation, are consistent with these conditions. Atrial fibrillation complicates mitral stenosis by further increasing the risk of pulmonary edema due to the chaotic and ineffective pumping action of the atria.\n\nThus, given the patient's symptoms, the medical history, and the physical examination findings, mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation seems to be the most likely diagnosis."
