Yes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury.\n\nIn federal civil trials, the number of jurors is set forth in the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Typically, a federal civil jury consists of 12 jurors. If the jury is reduced below this number due to illness or other circumstances, the trial may need to be retried with a full jury of 12 members. Therefore, if the case proceeded with a jury of less than 12 members, it would likely violate the legal requirements for a federal civil jury trial, justifying the granting of a motion for a new trial based on the size of the jury."
