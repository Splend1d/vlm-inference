When the gate is open, pain signals can pass through and reach the brain, causing pain perception. However, when the gate is closed, pain signals are blocked from reaching the brain, which can result in a decrease or cessation of pain sensation. In the case of vigorous scratching, the increased activity may be closing the gate and thus reducing the pain signal transmission to the brain, providing temporary relief."
