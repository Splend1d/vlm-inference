It would imply that the oil drop has a smaller positive charge than a single electron. Given that the charge of an object tends to be a multiple of the electron's charge, having a charge less than an electron's charge is highly unlikely for most physical scenarios. Therefore, D. \\(2.4 \\times 10^{-19} C\\) should be rejected as highly unlikely to be correct in the context of measuring the charge on an oil drop in a laboratory setting."
