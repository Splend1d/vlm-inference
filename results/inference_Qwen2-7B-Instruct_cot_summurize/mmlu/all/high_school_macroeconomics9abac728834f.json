A higher rate of inflation relative to other nations.\n\nWhen a country experiences higher inflation than its trading partners, it makes its currency relatively less valuable compared to others. This makes imports cheaper for foreign buyers and exports more expensive for domestic consumers, which can lead to an increase in imports and a decrease in exports. As a result, this can worsen the nation's trade deficit. \n\nLower wages (A), lower taxes on corporate profits (B), and higher interest rates (C) might affect other aspects of the economy, such as competitiveness, investment, and savings, but they do not directly worsen a trade deficit in the way that higher inflation does."
