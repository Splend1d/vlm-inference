The marginal product of labor (MPL) is the additional output produced by hiring one more unit of labor. \n\nWhen the marginal product of labor decreases, it means that each additional worker contributes less to the total output than the previous one. This implies that, for a given wage rate, firms can produce the same amount of output with fewer workers. As a result, firms are willing to hire less labor at any given wage rate, shifting the demand curve for labor to the left.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C lead to different effects on the demand for labor:\n\nA. An increase in the price of the good which the labor is producing would typically increase the demand for labor, as higher prices lead to higher profits and thus more incentive to hire more workers.\n\nB. An increase in demand for the good which the labor is producing also increases the demand for labor, as more units of the good need to be produced to satisfy the higher demand.\n\nC. An increase in the wage rate paid to workers might reduce the quantity of labor demanded if it becomes too expensive for firms to hire as many workers, but this effect depends on the elasticity of demand for labor and the firm's ability to pass on costs through price increases or productivity improvements. In some cases, firms might still demand more labor despite higher wages if they expect increased productivity or sales from the higher-quality labor."
