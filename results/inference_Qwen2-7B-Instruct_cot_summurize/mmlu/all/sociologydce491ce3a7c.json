This means that the document should be genuine, with clear evidence of its origin and creation. Authenticity in this context also implies that the document has not been tampered with, altered, or forged in any way that would compromise its integrity or credibility.\n\nWhile the other options may be desirable qualities for a document, they do not necessarily define authenticity in the way Scott (1990 defines it. Option A refers to the sincerity and accuracy of the content, which is related to the document's reliability but does not directly address its authenticity. Option B suggests that an authentic document represents a group or set of similar documents, but this is not a standard criterion for authenticity. Option C mentions that an authentic document has both a literal and an interpretable meaning, which is important for understanding the document but does not specifically address its authenticity."
