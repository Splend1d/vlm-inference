Complex\n\nResearch has shown that complex reaction times, which involve more cognitive processing and decision-making, tend to show the largest age differences between younger and older adults. This is because complex tasks require the integration of multiple pieces of information and can be more sensitive to declines in working memory, attention, and processing speed that are often associated with aging."
