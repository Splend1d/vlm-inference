The landowner, who is a resident of the state, has been informed by his attorney that his sales agreement with the farmer is null and void under state law.

The contract clause prohibition against a state from enacting any law that will impair the obligation of contracts.\n\nThis argument is based on the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution, found in Article I, Section 10, which states: \"No State shall ... pass any ... Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or making any Thing, whereby Debts become Invalid.\" This clause was intended to protect private contracts from legislative interference after the states had begun passing laws that interfered with existing debts and contracts during the Revolutionary period.\n\nIn this case, the state law appears to impair the obligation of a contract (between an out-of-state farmer, who is a U.S. citizen, and a landowner within the state. The law seems to prohibit the fulfillment of the contract based on residency requirements, which could be seen as an impairment of the contractual agreement between the parties.\n\nThe other options provided may not directly address the issue at hand:\nB. The privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment deals with the rights of citizens of one state when they enter another state, but it does not necessarily apply to contracts made before the state law was enacted.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause under Article IV, Section 2 concerns the privileges and immunities of citizens of one state in another state, but it does not specifically address contracts or state laws that impair their obligations.\nD. The national property power provision under Article IV, Section 3 refers to the power of Congress to define citizenship and to make uniform laws on certain matters related to citizenship and property rights across states, but it does not directly address the Contract Clause or the specific issue of state laws impairing contracts."
