Over 75% of respondents said that if they had it to do over again, they would not have children. The columnist concludes that most parents are sorry that they had children. For which of the following reasons is her conclusion not valid?\n\nA. Her participants were not randomly assigned in her study.\nB. The number of respondents from across the country was too small.\nC. The study was not replicated.\nD. Her sample may not have been representative of the population.\n"

Her sample may not have been representative of the population.\n\nThe columnist's conclusion might not be valid because the sample she collected (over 28,000 responses from newspaper readers who chose to respond to a specific column and expressed regret about having children, is likely not representative of the general population of parents. This type of sample is prone to bias, as it includes individuals who felt strongly enough about the topic to respond, potentially skewing the results towards more negative sentiments. Without random assignment or a broader, more diverse sample, the findings cannot reliably be generalized to all parents."
