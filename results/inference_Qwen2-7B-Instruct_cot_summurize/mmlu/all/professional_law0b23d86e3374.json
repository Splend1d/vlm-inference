A man then filed a claim against the estate, alleging that he was the son and heir of the testator. At the trial on the man's claim, the man was unable to produce any proof of a ceremonial marriage, but established the following by undisputed evidence: (a) that his mother and the testator had cohabited for a number of years; and (b) that his mother had predeceased the testator by one day. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the man's attorney called a clerk at a winter resort hotel. The clerk testified that the testator and the man's mother had come to the hotel for many years and he often saw the testator sign the hotel register as \"Mr. and Mrs. Testator. \"The trial court should rule the clerk's testimony\n\nA. admissible, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.\nB. admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.\nC. inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is not the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, under the Dead Man's Statute.\n"

In this case, the man has a direct interest in the litigation as he claims to be the heir of the testator, and his testimony would involve communications between himself and the deceased testator, specifically regarding their relationship. The testimony of the hotel clerk, while potentially relevant to the relationship between the testator and the man's mother, does not directly involve the testator and the man communicating about the man's paternity or inheritance rights. \n\nHowever, the Dead Man's Statute could apply to the man's own testimony if it involves communications he had with the deceased testator regarding the estate or their relationship. The clerk's testimony is likely more relevant to the cohabitation aspect of the case rather than the paternity claim. Therefore, the court should rule the clerk's testimony admissible under the hearsay exception for statements of public records and routine business activity, and not under the Dead Man's Statute. \n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect as it incorrectly identifies the exception to the hearsay rule, and options A and C are incorrect as they incorrectly identify the admissibility of the clerk's testimony based on the Dead Man's Statute."
