A formal professional development plan should be made and updated annually.\n\nThis option is true because lifelong learning and ongoing professional development are crucial for school psychologists to stay updated with new research, methodologies, laws, and educational trends. Developing and updating an annual plan allows for continuous improvement and ensures that the psychologist remains competent and effective in their role. \n\nB. Textbooks from graduate school should be reread annually.\nThis statement may not always be true, as reading textbooks annually might not necessarily provide the most current information or practical applications. School psychologists should engage in more contemporary resources and workshops rather than solely relying on outdated textbooks.\n\nC. A degree in another field should be pursued.\nThis statement is generally false. While having a broad knowledge base can be beneficial, school psychology requires specialized training and expertise in both psychology and education. Pursuing a degree in another field does not necessarily translate into the necessary qualifications and competencies required for school psychology practice.\n\nD. A graduate education program should offer adequate preparation for professional practice, so no further training will be needed.\nThis statement is false. Even after completing a graduate program, school psychologists need to continue learning and developing new skills through various forms of professional development, such as workshops, conferences, and mentoring, to adapt to changes in the field and improve their practice continuously."
