Involuntary Manslaughter. \n\nInvoluntary manslaughter typically occurs when a person causes the death of another through criminal negligence or reckless behavior. In this case, the defendant's intent was to intimidate the bartender rather than cause harm, but the actions resulted in the bartender's death due to gangrene. This situation fits the legal definition of involuntary manslaughter because the defendant's conduct was reckless and led to an unintended fatal outcome. \n\nBattery ( would not be the correct answer as it refers to the unlawful and intentional use of force or harmful contact, which does not necessarily result in death. Assault with a deadly weapon ( could also potentially apply if the defendant's actions were intentional, but the fact that the death occurred unintentionally makes involuntary manslaughter the more appropriate charge. Murder requires a specific intent to kill, which is not present in this case."
