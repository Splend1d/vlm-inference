Should the state court hear the case?\n\nA. No, because cases arising under federal law must be decided in federal court.\nB. No, because state courts must abstain in cases arising under federal law until a federal court has decided the federal issue.\nC.

Yes, because the parties cannot proceed in federal court since there is no diversity of citizenship.\n"

Yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\n\nUnder the principle of \"comity,\" state courts generally do not refuse to hear cases involving federal law simply because they could be heard in federal court. This is based on the idea that state and federal courts should work together harmoniously, and one should not refuse to hear a case just because it could be heard in the other forum. However, this does not mean that state courts must automatically hear such cases; it depends on the specific circumstances and applicable laws.\n\nIn this scenario, since the plaintiff's cause of action arises under a federal statute, the state court should not refuse to hear the case solely based on the fact that it could also be heard in federal court. However, the decision might also depend on factors such as the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal court over certain matters (e.g., if the federal statute grants exclusive jurisdiction to federal courts), or whether the case involves issues that have not been interpreted by federal courts yet, which might necessitate a more nuanced analysis.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest an absolute rule that does not necessarily apply in all situations. Option D is incorrect because while diversity of citizenship might be required for a federal court to have jurisdiction under the doctrine of diversity jurisdiction, it does not necessarily preclude a state court from hearing a case where one party sues another under a federal statute."
