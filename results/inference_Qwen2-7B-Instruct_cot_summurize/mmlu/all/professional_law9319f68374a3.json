The principal gave the assistant all of the materials to set up a table with the principal's cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists and even some order forms with businessperson's logo on them. In addition, the assistant represented to third parties that she was there officially representing the principal and that she was authorized to execute contracts on his behalf. The assistant negotiated a deal for the businessperson with a third party, which the businessperson refused to honor because he did not like the terms that were negotiated. Will the third party likely prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson?\n\nA. Yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\nB. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.\nC. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\nD. No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n"

Here's how each option might apply:\n\nA. Yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\n\nThis option assumes that the jurisdiction follows the principle of apparent authority, where an agent has the power to bind their principal if they reasonably appear to have the authority to do so. If the third party had relied on the assistant's representations of authority and acted in good faith, they could argue that they had reasonable grounds to believe the assistant was authorized.\n\nB. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.\n\nThis option implies that under certain circumstances (such as when an employer sends an employee to negotiate on their behalf or participate in business activities, the employer is presumed to be bound by the actions of the employee within the scope of their employment. However, this would depend on whether the principal actually intended for the assistant to have such authority.\n\nC. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\n\nThis option suggests that the third party should have exercised due diligence in verifying the assistant's authority before entering into a contract. If the third party failed to check the principal's official documentation or seek confirmation of the assistant's authority, they may not be able to enforce the contract against the principal.\n\nD. No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n\nThis option highlights the importance of due diligence in the digital age. It suggests that the third party should have easily been able to verify the principal's authorization through online resources or by contacting the principal directly before entering into the contract.\n\nIn practice, the answer would depend on the specific laws and precedents in the jurisdiction where the contract was formed and enforced. Factors such as the nature of the business, the relationship between the principal and the assistant, and the steps taken by the third party to verify the assistant's authority would all influence the outcome."
