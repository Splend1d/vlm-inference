Rights: Obligations often arise from respecting and upholding others' rights. For example, one has an obligation not to infringe upon someone else's property rights.\n\nB. Freely made commitments: People often enter into agreements or make promises with others, which create obligations to fulfill certain actions or refrain from certain behaviors. For instance, a contract between two businesses or a promise between friends can give rise to legal or moral obligations.\n\nC. Special relations: Obligations may also stem from specific relationships or roles, such as those found in family dynamics, employment, or social hierarchies. For example, children have duties towards their parents, employees have responsibilities towards their employers, or leaders have obligations towards their followers or constituents.\n\nTherefore, all these options can potentially be sources of obligations, depending on the context and nature of the relationship or situation involved."
