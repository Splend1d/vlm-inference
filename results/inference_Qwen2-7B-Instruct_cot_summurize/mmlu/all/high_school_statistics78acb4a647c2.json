Niacin lowers cholesterol an average of 18 points, while Lipitor lowers cholesterol an average of 41 points.\nB. There is a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual.\nC.

This means we are 95% confident that the true difference in mean cholesterol lowering between Lipitor and Niacin lies somewhere between 18 and 41 points. Therefore, there is a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform Niacin by at least 23 points ( (since the minimum difference is 18 points).\n\nLet's explain why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. This option incorrectly states the average cholesterol lowering for each medication. The confidence interval provides information on the difference between the two medications, not their individual effects.\n\nB. This statement conflates the concept of a confidence interval with the probability of a single outcome. The confidence interval gives us a range within which the true difference likely falls, but it does not provide the probability that any given individual will show a specific cholesterol lowering from either medication.\n\nD. Since option C is correct, this option cannot be the right choice."
