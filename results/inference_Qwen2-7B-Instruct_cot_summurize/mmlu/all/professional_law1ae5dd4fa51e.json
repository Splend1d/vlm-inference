The suspect was later arrested for murder; he filed for suppression of the gun. Will the suppression court throw out the gun?\n\nA. No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.\nB. No, the entry did not require an arrest warrant because the authorities already had established probable cause.\nC. Yes, the entry was a violation of the knock and announce rule.\nD.

No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.\n\nIn this scenario, the law enforcement officers had probable cause to believe the suspect committed murder. When they arrived at the suspect's residence and knocked without receiving any response, they proceeded to forcibly break open the door and enter the house. This action can be justified under exigent circumstances, where there is a reasonable belief that immediate action is necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence or to protect someone from harm. In this case, the officers found and seized a handgun in plain view upon entering the house, which they were legally entitled to seize as evidence related to the suspected murder.\n\nThe suspect's subsequent filing for suppression of the gun would likely fail, as the entry and seizure of the weapon were justified under the exigent circumstances doctrine and the plain view doctrine."
