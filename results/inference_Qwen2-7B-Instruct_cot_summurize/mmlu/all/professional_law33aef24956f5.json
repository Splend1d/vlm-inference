The fee shall be $10 per hour, with a maximum fee of $50;Section 3: Permits shall be issued on a first come basis; provided that the police chief shall deny any application if, after hearing the applicant, it is his considered judgment that (a) the meeting would create serious traffic congestion, or (b) interfere with public enjoyment of the park, or (c) speakers at the meeting would advocate the commission of crime. \"A foreign exchange student planned to hold a demonstration at park in the city. Although the student's previous protest rallies attracted fewer than 25 demonstrators, he decided to apply for a permit pursuant to city ordinance 172. After meeting with the student, the chief of police denied his permit application because he believed that the demonstration would incite the protestors and threaten imminent violence or serious disorder. Subsequently, the student and his fellow demonstrators staged their rally at the park. The rally attracted only about 20 protestors and was conducted peacefully. As the student was making his final remarks to the gathering, the police arrived at the park and arrested the student and his fellow demonstrators charging them with violating ordinance 172. Which of the following would be the most accurate statement with regard to the arrest of the student and the other demonstrators?\n\nA. The police were justified in arresting the student, because he and his fellow demonstrators violated the ordinance by staging the rally.\nB. The police were justified in halting the rally and arresting the demonstrators, because of the threat of imminent physical disturbance.\nC. The police were not justified in arresting the student and the demonstrators, because they did not violate the ordinance.\nD. The police were not justified in arresting the student, because the group was not required to comply with the ordinance.\n"

The police were not justified in arresting the student and the demonstrators, because they did not violate the ordinance.\n\nThe reasoning behind this choice is as follows:\n\n- The student applied for and received a permit under City Ordinance 172, even though previous rallies had attracted fewer than 50 people, thus technically complying with the ordinance's requirement for a permit for gatherings of 50 or more.\n- The police chief denied the permit based on the belief that the demonstration would incite violence, but the denial was not based on the criteria outlined in the ordinance itself (specifically, the denial did not address whether the meeting would create serious traffic congestion, interfere with public enjoyment of the park, or if speakers would advocate the commission of crime.\n- Since the rally was peaceful and attracted only about 20 protestors, there was no violation of the conditions for denying the permit as outlined in the ordinance.\n- The police arrested the student and demonstrators for violating the ordinance, but given that they had a valid permit, the arrest was not justified under the terms of the ordinance.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most accurate statement."
