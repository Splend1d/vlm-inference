The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?\n\nA. Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.\nB. No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.\nC. No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.\nD. Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.\n"

Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.\n\nThe rationale behind this choice is based on the principle of comity, which involves mutual respect between different levels of government and legal systems. When a person seeks declaratory relief that could impact ongoing state actions ( such as arrests, it may lead to disruption or interference with those proceedings. Additionally, the doctrine of collateral estoppel may apply, preventing a person from relitigating issues that have already been decided in another proceeding (in this case, the ongoing state prosecution. The Supreme Court has recognized these concerns and has generally been reluctant to allow declaratory relief that would interfere with state criminal proceedings unless there is a clear and immediate threat of enforcement. The fact that the law student has left the situation to avoid arrest but his companions were arrested suggests that the state's actions are already underway, making the declaratory relief potentially problematic under principles of comity and avoiding interference with ongoing state proceedings."
