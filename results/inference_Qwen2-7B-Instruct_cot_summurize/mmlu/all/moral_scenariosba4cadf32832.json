Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nRushing to the store and smashing the window with rocks is considered vandalism and is clearly morally wrong as it involves intentional damage to property without permission or justification. On the other hand, wiping silverware with a clean towel and putting them in a drawer is generally not considered morally wrong, assuming there was no intention to cause any harm or disturbance to others. This action is part of normal household hygiene practices."
