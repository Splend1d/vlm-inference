So, for these initial shapes, he used \\(9 \\times 5 = 45\\) straws.\n\n2. **Additional Straws**: He then used an additional 15 straws to make more shapes.\n\n3. **Total Straws Used**: To find the total, we add the straws used for the initial shapes to the additional straws: \\(45 + 15 = 60\\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of straws Conor used to make all the shapes is 60.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 60**."
