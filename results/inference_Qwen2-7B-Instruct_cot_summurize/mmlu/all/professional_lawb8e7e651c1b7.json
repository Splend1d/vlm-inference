The boat owner was navigating his craft toward shore when heavy rain and wind gusts began to rock the boat. Unable to reach his own slip, the boat owner docked his boat on a pier owned by a resident who lived in a nearby house. The resident objected to the boat owner's entry onto his private property. The boat owner explained that due to the storm it would be highly dangerous to be at sea. He requested permission to temporarily dock his boat until the storm subsided. The resident refused and cut the rope tying the boat to the dock. As a result, the boat drifted out to sea. The boat was battered by the rocky waves and high winds. Trying to prevent the boat from capsizing, the boat owner fell and broke his leg. The boat was extensively damaged in the storm, as well. The boat owner has sued the resident, seeking to recover damages for his personal injury, as well as damage to the boat. The boat owner should\n\nA. recover for the damage to the boat, but not recover for his personal injury.\nB. recover for his personal injury, but not recover for the damage to the boat.\nC. recover both for damage to the boat and for his personal injury.\nD. not recover for either damage to the boat or his personal injury.\n"

The resident, by cutting the rope without just cause during a storm, acted negligently, leading to the boat drifting out to sea and causing extensive damage to the boat. Additionally, the resident's actions potentially contributed to the boat owner's fall and subsequent injury.\n\nThe boat owner can argue that he had a reasonable expectation of safety on the pier and that the resident's actions breached this expectation. The boat owner could also argue that the resident's actions were foreseeable given the storm conditions and thus the resident should be held liable for any damages caused by these actions.\n\nRegarding the personal injury, the boat owner might have grounds for a negligence claim if the resident's actions (or lack thereof in securing the boat properly) led to the boat owner falling and breaking his leg. The boat owner would need to prove that the resident's actions were a direct cause of the injury.\n\nTherefore, under most legal systems, the boat owner could likely recover for both the damage to the boat and the personal injury, assuming they meet the necessary legal criteria for each claim."
