However, these percentages can fluctuate based on different polls and timeframes. If you're asking for a specific percentage like one of the options provided, it's important to note that none of those exact percentages (A. 79%, B. 98%, C. 33%, D. 57% directly match historical data. The closest is likely option D, which at 57% might represent an average or an estimate given the variability in public opinion at the time. For precise historical data, consulting original sources or databases that track public opinion during that period would be necessary."
