The existing mechanisms for monitoring and treating infectious disease within the international system are capable of effectively containing pandemic outbreaks.\n\nThis statement does not characterise our understanding of disease pandemics within the contemporary international political system because it presents an overly optimistic view. In reality, while there are international mechanisms like the World Health Organization ( (WHO) that monitor and respond to outbreaks, these systems often struggle to effectively contain pandemics due to various challenges such as funding shortages, lack of global cooperation, differing national policies, and the rapid evolution of diseases."
