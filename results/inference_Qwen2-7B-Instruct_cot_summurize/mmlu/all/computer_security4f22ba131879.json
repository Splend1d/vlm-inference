True, False.\n\nTiming attacks exploit the fact that cryptographic operations can take slightly different amounts of time depending on the data being processed. This variability can be used to infer information about the data or keys involved in the operation.\n\n- **Repeated squaring and Sliding windows ( (RS)**: This optimization is related to exponentiation operations, which are vulnerable to timing attacks because the time taken for exponentiation depends on the bits of the exponent. If RS is turned off, it would help mitigate the timing channel attack by making the exponentiation process more consistent regardless of the exponent's bit pattern.\n\n- **Montgomery Representation ( (MR)**: This optimization is designed to speed up modular multiplication, which is a fundamental operation in many cryptographic algorithms. However, it does not inherently prevent timing attacks since the underlying operations (like multiplication and addition) can still exhibit timing variations. Turning off MR might not directly close the timing channel attack.\n\nTherefore, turning off RS but keeping MR on would not necessarily close the timing channel attack described in the paper. The attack could still be feasible due to the inherent variability in operations like multiplication and addition, which are are not mitigated by MR alone."
