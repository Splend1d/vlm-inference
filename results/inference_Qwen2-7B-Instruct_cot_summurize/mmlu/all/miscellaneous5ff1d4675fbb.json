From year 1 to year 2, the spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5.\n\nThe spending multiplier formula is \\( \\frac{1}{1 - MPC} \\), where MPC stands for the marginal propensity to consume. \n\nIn year 1, with an MPC of 0.75, the spending multiplier was:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \\]\n\nIn year 2, with an MPC of 0.80, the spending multiplier was becomes:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1 - 0.80} = \\frac{1}{0.20} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the spending multiplier indeed increased from 4 to 5 between year 1 and year 2."
