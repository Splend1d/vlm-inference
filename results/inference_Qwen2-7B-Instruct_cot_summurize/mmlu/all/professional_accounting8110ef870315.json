Start with the reported book income before federal income taxes: $300,000.\n2. Subtract the non-deductible expense for term life insurance premiums on corporate officers: $20,000.\n\nSo, $300,000 - $20,000 = $280,000.\n\nHowever, the question includes corporate bond interest income of $17,000 which is tax-exempt at the corporate level. This means that this amount should not have been deducted from the total income when calculating taxable income. Therefore, the correct taxable income is $280,000 + $17,000 = $297,000.\n\nBut given the options provided, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation or the question setup. Based on standard accounting principles and tax rules for corporations, the correct answer considering the provided data points should be:\n\nC. $283,000\n\nThis could imply a minor typo or error in the provided options since the calculation based on the information should lead to $297,000, not $283,000. However, given the options and assuming some potential misinterpretation or error in the question or options, the closest correct answer would be C. $283,000."
