For example, pollution from a factory can impose a cost on nearby residents (the environmental damage and potential health problems), but the factory itself does not pay for this cost because it is not borne by the factory's customers or owners. This can lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, as the market equilibrium will not reflect the true social cost or benefit. Thus, the presence of an externality means the equilibrium doesn't maximize the total benefit to society."
