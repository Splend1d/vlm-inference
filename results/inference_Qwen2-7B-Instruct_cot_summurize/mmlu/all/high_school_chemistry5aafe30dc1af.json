When inhaled, it can decay within the lungs, potentially emitting alpha particles that damage lung tissue. This process can increase the risk of lung cancer. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. it is a gas that can be inhaled and then it may decay to a solid that resides in the lungs\n\nIt's important to note that while radon is a gas, it does not become a solid once it decays; rather, the decay products can remain in the lungs. Radon does not dissolve easily in the bloodstream or target specific organs like the thyroid or bones based on chemical similarity."
