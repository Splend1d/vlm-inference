The four tenets you mentioned encapsulate key aspects of his theory:\n\n1. **Self-regulating psyche**: This refers to Jung's belief in the innate ability of the psyche ( or soul - to regulate itself towards health and balance. It suggests that the human psyche has a natural tendency to seek harmony and wholeness.\n\n2. **The unconscious**: Jung emphasized the importance of the unconscious mind, which includes not only repressed memories and emotions but also archetypes, collective unconscious patterns, and personal complexes.\n\n3. **Therapist\u2013patient relationship**: Jung believed that the therapeutic relationship between the patient and the therapist was crucial for the patient's psychological growth. This relationship should foster trust, empathy, and a supportive environment where the patient can explore their unconscious processes.\n\n4. **Stages of self-improvement**: This component suggests that personal development involves various stages where the individual faces challenges, integrates aspects of the unconscious, and evolves towards a more integrated self. This process is seen as essential for overcoming psychological difficulties and achieving a state of psychological health and maturity.\n\nJung's approach contrasts with Freudian psychoanalysis by placing greater emphasis on the collective unconscious, archetypes, and the individuation process, which is the journey towards becoming a whole and balanced individual."
