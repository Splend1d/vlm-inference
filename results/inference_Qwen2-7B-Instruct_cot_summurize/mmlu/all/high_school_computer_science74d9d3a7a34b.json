Here's a breakdown of each option:\n\nA. **0, 2, 5, 20**\n- This option covers the minimum range (0 < w \u2264 2 with $4.00.\n- It also includes the transition points between price brackets: 2 < w \u2264 5 ($8.00) and 5 < w \u2264 20 ($15.00).\n- However, it does not include any negative numbers or zero, which might be considered valid input in some contexts but not necessarily required for this specific scenario.\n\nB. **1, 4, 16**\n- This option covers the minimum range for the second bracket 2 < w \u2264 5 ($8.00) and the maximum range for the third bracket 5 < w \u2264 20 ($15.00).\n- It does not cover the first bracket 0 < w \u2264 2 ($4.00) and lacks an explicit test case for the transition from the second to the third bracket.\n\nC. **\u22121, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20**\n- This option includes negative numbers, which are would not be valid inputs according to the given rules.\n- It covers the minimum range for the second bracket 2 < w \u2264 5 ($8.00) and the maximum range for the third bracket 5 < w \u2264 20 ($15.00).\n- It also includes the minimum weight within the first bracket (0 < w \u2264 2 ($4.00).\n\nD. **\u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20, 22**\n- This option includes negative numbers, which are would not be valid inputs according to the given rules.\n- It covers the minimum range for the first bracket 0 < w \u2264 2 ($4.00), the minimum range for the second bracket 2 < w \u2264 5 ($8.00), and the maximum range for the third bracket 5 < w \u2264 20 ($15.00).\n- It also includes the minimum weight within the first bracket and the maximum weight within the third bracket, but it includes a weight beyond the allowed limit (w > 20.\n\n**Best Set of Data:**\n\nOption **C** (-1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20) is the best choice because it covers all the essential weight ranges, including the transition points between price brackets, without including invalid inputs like negative numbers. It ensures that the program is tested for all critical scenarios without testing cases that could potentially cause confusion or errors due to non-valid input values."
