The product of 5 x 2 is even because both of the factors are even.\n\nThis statement is true, but it's important to clarify that for a product to be even, at least one of the factors must be even. In this case, since one of the factors (2 is even, the product will indeed be even.\n\nLet's analyze the other statements:\n\nB. The product of 4 x 4 is not odd because both of the factors are even. This statement is false. When you multiply two even numbers together, the result is always even.\n\nC. The product of 2 x 7 is not even because both of the factors are odd. This statement is false. Even though one of the factors is even, the product would still be even.\n\nD. The product of 5 x 3 is not odd because both of the factors are odd. This statement is false. While it's true that multiplying two odd numbers usually results in an odd number, the premise of the statement is incorrect; the product would actually be odd. \n\nTherefore, only statement A is correct."
