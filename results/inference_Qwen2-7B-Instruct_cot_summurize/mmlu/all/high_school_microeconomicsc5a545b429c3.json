When a firm is earning a normal profit from the production of a good, it means that its total revenue (TR) equals the sum of its explicit costs (EC) and implicit costs (IC). In other words, the firm covers all its costs, including both the direct monetary expenses (explicit costs, such as wages and rent, and the opportunity costs associated with using resources owned by the firm, which are constitute the implicit costs. At this point, there is no additional profit or loss; the firm's earnings exactly offset its costs."
