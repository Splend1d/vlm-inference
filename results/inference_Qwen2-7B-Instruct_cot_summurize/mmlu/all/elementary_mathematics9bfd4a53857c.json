Since there are 3 boxes, you then multiply this result by 3: \\(28 \\times 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct expression to find the total number of shirts is:\n\nC. \\(28 \\times 3\\)\n\nNone of the options exactly matches this calculation directly, but based on the given choices and understanding the question's intent, it seems there was a misinterpretation in constructing the options provided. Given the correct interpretation of the problem and the provided options, the closest match to the correct calculation process would actually align with creating an option that reflects the total calculation accurately, which is not directly listed as provided.\n\nGiven the structure of the provided options, none of them exactly matches the correct calculation path based on the original description. However, if we were to adjust for clarity and correctness in the options:\n\n- A. \\(12 \\times 3\\) would imply starting from the total per box without breaking down into packages first.\n- B. \\(12 \\times 7\\) similarly starts from a different base assumption than the described method.\n- C. \\(28 \\times 4\\) incorrectly suggests multiplying the per-box total by the number of packages instead of the number of boxes.\n- D. \\(28 \\times 7\\) incorrectly multiplies the per-box total by the number of shirts in a package again.\n\nNone of these options correctly represent the process described in the question. The correct approach should have been represented as \\(28 \\times 3\\), which isn't listed among the provided choices."
