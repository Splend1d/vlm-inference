The wife obtained a divorce from the husband after learnitg that he was engaging in an extramarital love affair with one of his co-workers. Following the divorce, the husband was arrested and charged with embezzling funds from his employer during a two- year period. In preparing for trial, the prosecuting attorney interviewed the wife, who stated that during their marriage, the husband admitted committing the embezzlement. This jurisdiction has adopted both the common-law marital and spousal privileges. At the husband's trial, the wife is called to testify regarding statements the husband made to her during the marriage regarding commission of the crime. Upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's testimony will be\n\nA. admissible, under both the marital and spousal privileges.\nB. admissible, under the spousal privilege but not admitted under the marital privilege.\nC. admissible, under the marital privilege but not admitted under the spousal privilege.\nD. inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.\n"

In this case, the wife's testimony about her husband admitting to the embezzlement could potentially help defend him against the charges, so it would likely be protected under the spousal privilege.\n\nHowever, the marital privilege generally prevents one spouse from testifyinging against the other in most situations. It is designed to promote open communication within a marriage by protecting the privacy of marital communications. Since the husband is being to testify against himself (by admitting to the crime through his wife's testimony), the marital privilege does not apply in the same way as it would if the wife were testifyinging against her husband in a situation where she had no knowledge of the crime.\n\nTherefore, the wife's testimony would be admissible under the spousal privilege, which protects her from being compelled to testify against her husband in this case, but not under the marital privilege, which typically would prevent her from testifyinging against her husband at all in most circumstances."
