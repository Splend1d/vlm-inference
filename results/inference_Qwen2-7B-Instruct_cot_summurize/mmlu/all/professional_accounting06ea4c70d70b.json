Auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.\n\nStratification involves dividing the population into distinct, non-overlapping subgroups (strata) based on specific characteristics. This technique allows auditors to allocate resources more effectively and ensure that larger or more significant items receive more attention. Therefore, when an auditor intends to give greater representation to large recorded amounts, stratifying the population can help achieve this objective by ensuring that these significant items are appropriately represented in the sample. \n\nA. The suspicion of management fraud does not necessarily dictate the use of stratification; rather, it might lead the auditor to use other techniques such as analytical procedures, interviews, or additional testing of transactions or balances.\n\nB. The desire to assess control risk at a lower level than the prior year may involve increasing the sample size or using a different sampling method, but stratification itself is not directly tied to adjusting the assessed level of control risk.\n\nC. Attribute sampling is a type of sampling technique where the auditor is interested in determining whether a certain number of items in the population meet a specific criterion (e.g., whether invoices have been properly authorized. The choice of sampling technique should align with the audit objective, and while stratification could be part of an attribute sampling approach, it's not a defining characteristic of attribute sampling per se."
