It is converted to urea, which can then be excreted through urine. In individuals with a deficiency in the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), this process is impaired, leading to an accumulation of ammonia in the blood. This condition is known as hyperammonemia and can cause neurological symptoms if not treated promptly."
