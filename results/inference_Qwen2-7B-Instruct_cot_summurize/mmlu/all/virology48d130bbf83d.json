Here's how NGS is most often used:\n\nA. To identify a newly discovered virus: NGS is indeed used to sequence viral genomes to help identify new strains or species of viruses. This is crucial for understanding the genetic makeup of viruses, tracking outbreaks, and developing targeted treatments.\n\nB. To search for drug resistant mutants: NGS plays a significant role in identifying mutations that confer drug resistance in pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. By sequencing the genome of these organisms, researchers can pinpoint specific genetic changes that allow them to resist treatment with antibiotics or antiviral drugs, guiding the development of more effective therapies.\n\nC. To identify quasi-species viruses: Viruses like HIV and Hepatitis C are exist as a population of genetically diverse variants, collectively known as quasi-species. NGS enables the detection and characterization of this genetic diversity, which is essential for understanding viral evolution, drug resistance mechanisms, and designing vaccines and treatments that can target multiple viral strains simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, all of the options A, B, and C describe legitimate uses of NGS. Option D is incorrect because NGS is a widely applicable technology used in various scientific research areas."
