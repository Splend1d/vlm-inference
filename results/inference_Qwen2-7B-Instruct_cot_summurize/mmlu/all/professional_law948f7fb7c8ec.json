The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the regulations set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:\"Each purchaser, by the acceptance of a deed therefore, promises to pay the community association an annual assessment or charge to be determined on the basis of the valuation of each individual lot and the improvements thereon. Nonpayment of any annual assessment or charge when due shall result in a lien upon the parcel of the property. \"A gardener, the owner of lot 29 in the development, sold his land to a landscaper with a deed containing no restrictions. The community association, pursuant the Declaration of Covenants, sues the landscaper to collect the annual assessment for lot 29. Which of the following is the best argument for the landscaper?\n\nA. There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.\nB. Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.\nC. There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.\nD. There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.\n"

There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.\n\nIn legal terms, \"privity of estate\" refers to a direct relationship between two parties concerning the ownership of property. When property is transferred, the new owner generally inherits the rights and obligations that come with it, including those established by contracts or agreements related to the property. However, this inheritance only occurs if there is a direct connection between the parties involved in the transfer.\n\nIn this case, the community association's claim against the landscaper for the unpaid annual assessment might be based on the original agreement made between the housing corporation and the previous owner (the gardener. The Declaration of Covenants binds the current owner (the landscaper, because they have taken possession of the property, but only if there is a direct contractual link between them.\n\nThe argument that there is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper suggests that the landscaper does not have a direct legal obligation to pay the assessments as the original agreement was made between the housing corporation and the gardener. This argument assumes that the community association cannot enforce the covenants directly against the landscaper without a valid chain of title linking the landscaper to the original agreement.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific laws and jurisdictional details can significantly impact the outcome of such a case, and legal counsel would be necessary to provide a definitive argument."
