This is because resources are not always perfectly adaptable between the production of different goods.\n\nAnswer B correctly identifies this concept:\n\nB. is the result of resources not being perfectly adaptable between the production of two goods.\n\nThis means that as you allocate more resources to the production of one good (like guns or butter, the efficiency with which those resources can be used decreases, leading to higher costs per additional unit produced.\n\nAnswers A, C, and D do not accurately describe the law of increasing costs:\n\nA. The law of increasing costs applies to all goods, including guns and butter. It's not an exception for specific commodities.\n\nC. While it's true that the law of increasing costs can lead to rising costs in production, it does not necessarily imply that prices will rise universally. Prices depend on many factors, including supply, demand, and market dynamics.\n\nD. The production possibilities frontier (PPF) being a straight line suggests that the opportunity cost of producing one good over another remains constant, which contradicts the law of increasing costs. In reality, if there were increasing opportunity costs due to increasing costs of production, the PPF would typically curve inward, reflecting the trade-offs between goods."
