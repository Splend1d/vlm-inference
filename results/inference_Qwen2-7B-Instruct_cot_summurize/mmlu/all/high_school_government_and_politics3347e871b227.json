A national election recalling an unpopular judge\n\nNational elections do not have the direct power to recall individual judges or limit the influence of the federal courts. This power lies with the legislative and executive branches, as well as through the process of judicial review and potential constitutional amendments.\n\nA. A constitutional amendment to the contrary of a court decision can limit the influence of the federal courts by changing the law that the courts interpret.\nB. The impeachment of a federal judge is a political process that can lead to a judge being removed from their position, thus limiting their influence on future cases.\nC. A governor's failure to enforce a court decision can limit the practical impact of a court ruling within their state, though it does not directly affect the court's jurisdiction or authority."
