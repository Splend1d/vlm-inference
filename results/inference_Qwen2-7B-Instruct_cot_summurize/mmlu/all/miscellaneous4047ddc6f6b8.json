The division of a country's power into national and subnational units\n\nFederalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units, such as states or provinces. Each level of government has its own constitution, laws, and budgets, with the powers of each level being clearly defined and limited by the constitution. This allows for a balance of power and helps to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful."
