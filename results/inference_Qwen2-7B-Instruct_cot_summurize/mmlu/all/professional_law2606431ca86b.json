The seller answered the complaint and included as a separate defense an allegation that the purchaser had brought and lost a similar contract claim against a different seller three years earlier, and that this history represented a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits. The purchaser believes that the earlier lawsuit was factually completely different from the current one and is therefore irrelevant. What is the purchaser's best response to the seller's answer?\n\nA. File a reply that includes a denial of the separate defense.\nB. Move for sanctions against the seller for asserting a frivolous defense.\nC. Move to amend the complaint to add allegations about the differences between the lawsuits.\nD. Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n"

File a reply that includes a denial of the separate defense.\n\nThe purchaser should respond by denying the separate defense in their answer or reply to the seller's answer. This directly addresses the seller's claim and allows the court to assess the relevance and validity of the defense on its own merits. If the court determines that the seller's defense is not relevant or lacks sufficient factual support, it may rule against the seller on this point. \n\nMoving for sanctions (B, moving to amend the complaint C, or moving to strike the defense D could be considered if the situation warrants further action, but initially addressing the defense with a denial is the most straightforward course of action."
