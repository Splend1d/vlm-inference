The U.S. Supreme Court declared these districts to be unconstitutional, as improper racial gerrymanders. In response to this ruling, Congress passed a new statute that explicitly denies the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over all future cases challenging the constitutionality of action taken under the authority of the federal voting rights statute. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument for the constitutionality of the new statute restricting the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction?\n\nA. Article III of the Constitution explicitly states that the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is subject to such exceptions and regulations as Congress shall make.\nB. The constitutional principle of separation of powers authorizes Congress to pass statutes calculated to reduce the effects of Supreme Court decisions that interfere with the exercise of powers that have been delegated to the legislative branch.\nC. The establishment and apportionment of congressional districts directly affect interstate commerce, and the Constitution authorizes Congress to use its plenary authority over such commerce for any purpose it believes will promote the general welfare.\nD. The Fifteenth Amendment authorizes Congress to enforce the amendment's voting rights provisions by appropriate legislation, and Congress could reasonably determine that this restriction on the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is an appropriate means to that end.\n"

It specifically empowers Congress to enforce the amendment through appropriate legislation. The new statute, which restricts the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction over cases challenging the constitutionality of actions taken under the authority of a federal voting rights statute, can be seen as an exercise of Congress's enforcement power under the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nThis argument is compelling because it directly ties the legislative action to a specific constitutional provision that grants Congress broad powers to enforce voting rights. By doing so, it suggests that the restriction on the Supreme Court's jurisdiction serves as a means to ensure that Congress can effectively implement and enforce voting rights laws without judicial interference that may undermine their intended purpose.\n\nOptions A, B, and C, while potentially relevant to broader discussions about the role of Congress, the separation of powers, and the impact of court rulings, do not directly address the specific authority granted to Congress under the Fifteenth Amendment. Therefore, option D provides the strongest basis for arguing the constitutionality of the new statute."
