Subsequently, the woman sued the driver of the vehicle to recover damages for her injuries. At trial, the woman calls a police officer to testify that a few minutes after the accident, a driver stopped him and said, \"Hey, officer, I just saw an accident involving a red truck that hit this girl who was riding a bicycle. The truck left the scene of the accident and I followed it to a warehouse. \" The police officer then testified that he immediately drove to the warehouse and saw the defendant sitting in a red truck that was parked in the lot. The driver is available to testify at trial. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the police officer's testimony regarding the driver's statement should be\n\nA. admissible as a statement of recent perception.\nB. admissible as a present sense impression.\nC. inadmissible, because the driver was available to testify at trial.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Hearsay is generally inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence and other similar rules in various jurisdictions unless it falls within one of the recognized exceptions.\n\nThe police officer's testimony would likely not fall under the exceptions for recent perception or present sense impression, as those exceptions generally refer to statements made soon after an event occurred while the witness had a heightened awareness or impression of the event itself, rather than statements about events observed by another person. Additionally, since the driver is available to testify at the trial, there is no need for the hearsay statement to be admitted to provide information that the live testimony could not."
