By analyzing the star's spectrum, astronomers can detect tiny wobbles in the star's motion caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. These wobbles cause small changes in the wavelengths of light emitted by the star, which can be measured as a Doppler shift. This method has been highly successful in discovering numerous exoplanets, especially those in close proximity to their stars."
