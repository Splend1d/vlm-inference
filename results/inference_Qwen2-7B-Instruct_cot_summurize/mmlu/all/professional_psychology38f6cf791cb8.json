This includes respecting participant autonomy and well-being. If the principal investigator suggests actions that could potentially harm participants or compromise the integrity of the study, it's appropriate to address this concern through open communication. Writing a letter detailing the ethical issues and offering to discuss them can help facilitate a constructive conversation aimed at resolving any discrepancies while maintaining the professional relationship."
