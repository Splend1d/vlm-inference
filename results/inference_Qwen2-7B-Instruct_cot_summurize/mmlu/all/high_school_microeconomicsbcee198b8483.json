This flexibility leads to a higher elasticity of supply, meaning that a small change in price will cause a relatively large change in the quantity supplied. \n\nOn the other hand, when producers have fewer alternative goods to produce (A), operate near the limits of their production (C), or have less time to respond to price changes (B), their ability to adjust production in response to price changes is limited. This results in lower elasticity of supply, as a change in price will not cause a significant change in the quantity supplied."
