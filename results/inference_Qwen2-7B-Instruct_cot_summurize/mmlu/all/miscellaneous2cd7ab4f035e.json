This is based on the principles of triangulation in geometry. Each station provides a possible circle or sphere around its location where the epicenter could be, based on the time it takes for seismic waves to arrive. With three stations, these circles or spheres will intersect at a single point, which is the epicenter. \n\nIf only two stations were used, there would be two possible solutions because two circles can intersect at two points. Using just one station doesn't provide enough information to pinpoint a location."
