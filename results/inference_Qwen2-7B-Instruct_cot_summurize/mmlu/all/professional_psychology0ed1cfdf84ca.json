Family A\u2019s infant will cry for longer periods of time at night.\n\nAccording to classical conditioning and reinforcement theory, if an infant's cries are not consistently followed by attention or comfort, they may learn that their cries do not reliably lead to relief. This can result in the infant crying more frequently or for longer periods when they are distressed, anticipating but not receiving the desired response. In contrast, an infant who consistently receives attention upon crying is likely to have learned that their cries are effective in obtaining what they need, which might lead to less persistent crying or shorter crying spells. However, it's important to note that this is a simplification of complex developmental processes and individual differences."
