Within an abdominal crease.\n\nThe placement of a stoma, often seen in patients who have undergone surgery for conditions like colorectal cancer or Crohn's disease, is typically within an abdominal crease. This location helps to minimize the visibility of the stoma and reduces the risk of skin irritation around the opening. It also makes it easier for the patient to manage and care for the stoma."
