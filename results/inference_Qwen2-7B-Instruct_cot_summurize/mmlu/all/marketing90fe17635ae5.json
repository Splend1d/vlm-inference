In their model, they propose that:\n\nB. Advertising has a direct and positive influence on total industry (market) sales.\n\nThis means that when companies spend more on advertising, it can lead to increased awareness, preference, and ultimately, sales within the industry or market. However, it's important to note that this relationship is part of a broader model that also considers other factors such as consumer demand, product quality, and price elasticity, among others."
