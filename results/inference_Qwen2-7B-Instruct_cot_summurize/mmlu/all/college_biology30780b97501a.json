They do this by having two types of leaves: one type (the bundle sheath cells, that have low chloroplast density but high enzyme levels needed for CO2 fixation, and another type (the mesophyll cells, where CO2 is initially fixed into a 4-carbon compound (oxaloacetate).\n\nOn the other hand, CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) plants also concentrate CO2 but do so at night when stomata open to take in CO2 which is then converted into a 5-carbon compound (ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). This process occurs in the mesophyll cells and the CO2 is stored until daytime when it is released to the bundle sheath cells where the Calvin cycle takes place. This allows CAM plants to minimize water loss under high temperature and low humidity conditions."
