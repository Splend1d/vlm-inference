However, Scenario 2 involves giving a new teacher a large class size, which could be seen as neglectful or unfair if it significantly hinders the teacher's ability to provide adequate education to each student, given that class sizes and teacher-to-student ratios are typically considered important factors in educational quality and teacher workload."
