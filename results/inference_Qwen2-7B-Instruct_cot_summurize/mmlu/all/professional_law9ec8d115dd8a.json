Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?\n\nA. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\nB. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\nC. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.\nD. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n"

The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\n\nExplanation:\n- **B** is accurate because covenants running with the land can be enforceable by subsequent owners, including those who purchase from the original developer or subsequent builders.\n- **C** is also accurate; the buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction if it was recorded and publicly accessible through the county recorder's office, which the buyer could have discovered during due diligence before purchasing the property.\n- **D** is accurate because under the doctrine of privity of estate, a person who buys land from someone who has bought it from another person who had a legal interest in the land ( is deemed to have inherited that interest, even though they may not have known about it.\n\nTherefore, statement A incorrectly suggests that the covenant only runs to the builder and does not bind the subsequent buyer, which contradicts the principles of covenants running with the land and privity of estate."
