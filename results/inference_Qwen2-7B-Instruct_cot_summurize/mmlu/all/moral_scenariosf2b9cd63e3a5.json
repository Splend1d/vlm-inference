While honesty is usually valued, this scenario might not necessarily be considered morally wrong unless there's a direct consequence that harms others or is dishonest about the actual state of health.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is acting against the safety and well-being of others by restricting access to a potentially life-saving item (the gun safe) while his parents are sleeping. This action can be seen as morally wrong because it poses a risk to the safety of others and violates their rights to secure their property and belongings without interference.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
