Consequentialist theory\n\nConsequentialist theory, also known as utilitarianism, would approach the morality of abortion by considering the outcomes or consequences of the action. This theory would evaluate whether the overall intrinsic value that results from an abortion outweighs the intrinsic value of the potential life being terminated. It would focus on maximizing happiness or well-being for the greatest number of people involved."
