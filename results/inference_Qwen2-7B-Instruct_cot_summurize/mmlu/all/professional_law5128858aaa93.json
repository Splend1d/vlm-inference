The government charged the gun dealer and the friend with conspiracy to commit bank robbery. Can the charge of conspiracy to commit bank robbery be upheld against the gun dealer?\n\nA. Yes, he conspired to help the friend commit some unknown criminal act.\nB. Yes, he is held to the foreseeability that the friend was going to commit a crime.\nC. No, there was no agreement to conspire to rob a bank.\nD. No, a conspiracy would have required that the gun dealer go to the bank with the friend.\n"

Yes, he is held to the foreseeability that the friend was going to commit a crime.\n\nUnder the doctrine of joint enterprise or aiding and abetting, a person can be held criminally responsible for the actions of another if they had a shared intent or agreement to commit a crime. In this case, even though the gun dealer may not have had direct knowledge of the specific plan to rob a bank, he could still be charged with conspiracy to commit bank robbery if it can be shown that he had reason to foresee that his friend's use of the machine gun was intended for illegal purposes, specifically committing a bank robbery.\n\nThe foreseeability requirement means that the gun dealer must have been aware that his friend might use the machine gun for an unlawful purpose and that such a use would facilitate a crime like bank robbery. If the government can prove this, then the gun dealer could be held liable for the conspiracy to commit bank robbery."
