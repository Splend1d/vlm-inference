According to Newton's third law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( m = 100 \\) kg as the mass of the heavier person,\n- \\( m' = 50 \\) kg as the mass of the lighter person,\n- \\( F \\) as the force exerted by the heavier person on the lighter one.\n\nWhen the heavier person pushes the lighter one with a force \\( F \\), according to Newton's third law, the lighter person exerts an equal and opposite force \\( -F \\) on the heavier person.\n\nNow, let's calculate the acceleration of both persons using Newton's second law of motion \\( F = ma \\), where \\( F \\) is the net force, \\( m \\) is the mass, and \\( a \\) is the acceleration.\n\nFor the heavier person:\n\\[ F_{heavier} = ma_{heavier} \\]\n\\[ a_{heavier} = \\frac{F}{m} \\cdot F \\]\n\nFor the lighter person:\n\\[ F_{lighter} = m'm_{lighter} \\]\n\\[ a_{lighter} = \\frac{m'}{m'} \\cdot F \\]\n\nSince the force exerted by the heavier person on the lighter one is \\( F \\), the force exerted by the lighter person on the heavier one is \\( -F \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ a_{heavier} = \\frac{100}{100} \\cdot (-F) \\]\n\\[ a_{heavier} = -F \\]\n\nAnd for the lighter person:\n\n\\[ a_{lighter} = \\frac{50}{50} \\cdot F \\]\n\\[ a_{lighter} = F \\]\n\nComparing the accelerations:\n\n\\[ |a_{heavier}| = |-f| = f \\]\n\\[ |a_{lighter}| = F \\]\n\nThe magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person (\\( |a_{lighter}| \\)) is twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person (\\( |a_{heavier}| \\)):\n\n\\[ |a_{lighter}| = 2|a_{heavier}| \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person**. \n\nHowever, based on the calculations, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of options provided, as the correct statement should align with option C rather than D. The calculation supports that the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person is indeed twice that of the heavier person, not half."
