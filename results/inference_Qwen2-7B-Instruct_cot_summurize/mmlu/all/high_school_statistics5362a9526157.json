She selects a random sample of students and collects information about their family income. A 95 percent confidence interval computed from this data for the mean income per family is ($35,095, $45,005). Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?\n\nA. 95 percent of the students in her school are from families whose income is between $35,095 and $45,005.\nB. There is a 95% probability that the families of all the students in this school have an income of between $35,095 and $45,005.\nC. If we were to take another sample of the same size and compute a 95 percent confidence interval, we would have a 95% chance of getting the interval ($35,095, $45,005).\nD. There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.\n"

There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.\n\nThis means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times and calculate a confidence interval each time, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean income per family in the school. \n\nIt's important to note that the confidence interval does not tell us anything about the distribution of individual incomes among the students' families or the probability that any particular family falls within the interval. It pertains to the estimate of the population mean based on the sample data."
