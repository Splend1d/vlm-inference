The diagonal VECH model does not ensure a positive-definite variance-covariance matrix\n\nIn the diagonal VECH model, while it ensures positive-definiteness for the conditional variances (the diagonal elements), it may not guarantee positive-definiteness for the full covariance matrix due to the way the off-diagonal elements are constructed. This can lead to issues in estimation and forecasting, as a non-positive-definite covariance matrix is not meaningful in statistical terms.\n\nThe BEKK (Baba, Engle, Kraft, and Kroner) formulation addresses this issue by constructing the covariance matrix in a way that ensures positive-definiteness, making it more suitable for practical applications in financial econometrics."
