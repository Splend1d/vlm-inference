Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, calling 911 for a personal convenience when your friend is a police officer could be considered misuse of emergency services and is morally wrong. This action could divert critical resources away from genuine emergencies and could potentially cause harm if it delays actual police response to an emergency call.\n\nIn scenario 2, holding someone's head under water is a clear violation of their physical safety and well-being. It is a form of physical abuse and can cause serious injury or even death, which is morally reprehensible. \n\nThus, both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
