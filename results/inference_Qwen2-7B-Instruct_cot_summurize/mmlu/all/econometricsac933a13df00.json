However, the term \"minimum variance\" does not automatically imply that the estimator is unbiased. An estimator could have minimum variance but still be biased, meaning it systematically overestimates or underestimates the true value.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Such an estimator will always be unbiased"
