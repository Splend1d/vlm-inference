This involves the restoration of ion concentrations across the neuron's membrane and the reset of the neuron's electrical properties. The action potential itself is generated by the rapid influx of sodium ions (Na+ and the efflux of potassium ions K+ through specific ion channels in the neuron's membrane. Following this event, the neuron undergoes repolarization, where the membrane potential returns to its resting state, typically around -70 millivolts (mV). This is followed by a period of hyperpolarization, where the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential, making it harder for another action potential to occur immediately. Over time, the neuron will return to its resting potential, ready for the next stimulus."
