These benefits can be considered as \"externalities\" because they extend beyond the direct transaction or consumption of the good ( in this case, education. For example, a more educated population tends to lead to higher productivity, better-informed voters, and potentially better parenting and citizenship.\n\nSince these external benefits are enjoyed by society at large and not just the individual, the market might not provide enough incentives for individuals to invest in education on their own. This underinvestment could lead to an inefficient allocation of resources. To correct this inefficiency and ensure that society realizes the full benefits of education, economists often argue for government intervention in the form of subsidies. Subsidizing education helps to internalize some of the external benefits, encouraging more people to pursue educational opportunities than would otherwise do so if left solely to market forces."
