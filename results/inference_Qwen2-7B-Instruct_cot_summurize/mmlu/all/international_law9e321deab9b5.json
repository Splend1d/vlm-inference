Treaties may 1) codify customary law, 2) 'crystallise' customary law, 3) lead to the emergence of customary law\n\nExplanation:\n\nCustomary international law refers to rules that have developed through consistent practice by states followed by a sense of legal obligation. Treaties law, on the other hand, consists of agreements made between states.\n\nTreaties provisions can relate to customary law in several ways:\n\n1. **Codification**: A treaty might explicitly codify existing customary international law. This means that a treaty will state its provisions based on what has already been established as customary law through state practice and opinio juris ( (the belief that one is acting legally).\n\n2. **Crystallisation**: Sometimes, a treaty might help to crystallize or formalize an emerging or ambiguous area of customary law. By agreeing to certain terms in a treaty, states might solidify their understanding of what constitutes customary law in a particular area.\n\n3. **Leading to the Emergence of Customary Law**: In some cases, a treaty might lead to the creation of new customary law. If a significant number of states agree to abide by certain principles in a treaty, this might signal a shift in international practice and opinio juris, potentially leading to the development of new customary norms.\n\nIt's important to note that while treaties can influence and contribute to the development of customary international law, they do not create international law ex nihilo. The law still emerges from state practice and opinio juris, which must precede any codification or crystallization in treaty form."
