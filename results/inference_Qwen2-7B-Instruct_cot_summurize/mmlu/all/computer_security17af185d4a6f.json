Ben Bitdiddle notes that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code. Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe; that is, he thinks validation is not needed. Ben is wrong. Circle the types of x86 machine instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code. Please ignore trampoline and springboard code.\n\nA. all instructions that modify segment state\nB. all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32\nC. all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)\nD. all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)\n"

The other options ( modifying segment state (A) and accessing memory not divisible by 32 (B) are not as critical for sandboxing purposes because they do not directly enable arbitrary memory access or execution flow control."
