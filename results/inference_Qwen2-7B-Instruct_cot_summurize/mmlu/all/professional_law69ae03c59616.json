During its manufacturing operations, the manufacturer negligentlyallowed quantities of this substance to leak into the soil. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) orderedthat the premises, now owned by an appliance repair shop, be decontaminated. This order, and the subsequent cleanup efforts, received a high level of attention in the local media. An employee of the appliance repair shop has sued the manufacturer in negligence for damages for emotionaldistress. The employee claims to have suffered the distress as a consequence of learning that she has beenexposed for five years, while employed by the appliance repair shop at the premises affected by the EPA order,to the toxic contamination that has existed there. Her complaint does not allege that her emotional distress issevere, that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has suffered any physicalconsequences. In that action the manufacturer has filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief maybe granted. What is the manufacturer's best argument in support of that motion?\n\nA. The repair shop employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe.\nB. The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. The complaint does not allege that the repair shop employee suffered any physical consequences.\nD. The repair shop employee's proper remedy is in a claim against the repair shop, the occupier of thepremises during the period of her alleged exposure.\n"

The repair shop employee's proper remedy is in a claim against the repair shop, the occupier of the premises during the period of her alleged exposure.\n\nThis argument focuses on the concept of \"last clear chance\" and \"contributory negligence,\" which suggests that if the repair shop had knowledge of the hazardous conditions on the premises and failed to take reasonable steps to protect its employees from the risk, then the employee might not be able to hold the manufacturer solely liable for her emotional distress. Instead, she may need to pursue a claim against the repair shop, as it could be argued that the repair shop had the last opportunity to prevent harm to its employees through remedial actions like providing personal protective equipment or relocating work areas away from the contaminated area.\n\nAdditionally, this argument could also suggest that since the employee did not suffer any physical consequences, her claim for emotional distress might not meet the legal threshold for recovery under certain jurisdictions' laws regarding the severity of emotional distress required for compensation. However, the specific legal arguments will depend on the jurisdiction's laws and precedents related to environmental exposure claims and the standards for proving emotional distress in negligence cases."
