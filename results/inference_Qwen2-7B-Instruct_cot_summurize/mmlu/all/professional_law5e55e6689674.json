This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nA. invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\nB. invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\nC. valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\nD. valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely invalid because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution voids inconsistent state action. The Supremacy Clause establishes that the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties made under the authority of the United States are the supreme law of the land, and thus take precedence over conflicting state laws.\n\nIn this case, the federal statute forbidding the state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende falls within Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. Since pitchblende is a mineral that can be used for various purposes, including the production of nuclear energy, its extraction and sale across state lines can potentially impact interstate commerce. Therefore, Congress has the authority to regulate or even ban state taxation on the extraction of such minerals to ensure a uniform market and prevent economic distortions that could harm interstate commerce.\n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the balance of powers between Congress and the states as established by the Constitution. Option D is incorrect because while Congress cannot place one state on an unequal footing with others, it can regulate activities that affect interstate commerce, which includes the taxation of certain resources like pitchblende that can cross state lines."
