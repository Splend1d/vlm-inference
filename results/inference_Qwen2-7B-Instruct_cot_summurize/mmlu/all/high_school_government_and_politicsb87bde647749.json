Grant reprieves and pardons**.\n\nThe President of the United States has the power to grant reprieves and pardons for federal offenses, except in cases of impeachment. This power does not require congressional approval.\n\n- **B. Appoint Supreme Court justices**: The President nominates Supreme Court justices, but the appointments require Senate confirmation.\n- **C. Negotiate and ratify treaties**: While the President negotiates treaties, they must be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the Senate.\n- **D. Declare war**: Congress has the constitutional authority to declare war; the President can only initiate military action through executive orders or in response to a congressional declaration of war."
