                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a solid melts, it transforms into a liquid. This process typically involves an increase in disorder (which is represented by an increase in entropy ( entropy change is positive). Simultaneously, this transformation often requires energy from the surroundings, which means that the system's energy increases (this is represented by a positive enthalpy change. Therefore, both the entropy change and the enthalpy change are expected to be positive when a solid melts.\n\nLet's also clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. negative entropy change and a negative enthalpy change: This would imply that melting decreases disorder and releases energy back to the surroundings. Neither of these outcomes aligns with the typical behavior of matter during melting.\n\nC. negative entropy change and positive enthalpy change: A negative entropy change suggests that the system becomes more ordered, which contradicts the concept of melting. Melting typically increases disorder, hence entropy should increase positively.\n\nD. negative enthalpy change and positive entropy change: A negative enthalpy change indicates that the system loses energy, which is not the case when a substance melts as it generally absorbs heat from the surroundings."
