                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The probability that the next toss will again be even is 0.5.\n\nIn this scenario, we're dealing with the concept of independence in probability. Each roll of a fair die is an independent event, meaning the outcome of one roll does not affect the outcomes of subsequent rolls. The probability of rolling an even number (2, 4, or 6) on a fair six-sided die is 1/2 or 0.5, regardless of previous outcomes. Thus, after observing three consecutive even numbers, the probability that the next roll will also be even remains at 0.5.\n\nLet's briefly address why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of trials increases, the average of the outcomes approaches the expected value. However, it does not influence the outcome of individual trials. The probability of rolling an even number on the next toss is still 0.5.\n\nB. While conditional probability can be used to describe the likelihood of an event given some information about other events, in the case of dice rolls, each roll is independent. Given that three rolls have been even, the conditional probability of the next roll being even is still simply the unconditional probability of rolling an even number, which is 0.5.\n\nC. Dice do not have \"memories\"; they lack the ability to retain information from past events. Therefore, the outcomes of future rolls are not influenced by previous rolls.\n\nThus, the only true statement is D: The probability that the next toss will again be even is 0.5."
