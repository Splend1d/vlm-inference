In this case, the argument suggests that since Professor Jones said the class was the best he had ever had, no one in the class should have failed. However, just because the class as a whole performed exceptionally well doesn't necessarily mean that every individual student performed at the same high level. Each student's performance could be evaluated independently, and failing grades might reflect personal issues with the material, study habits, or other factors, not necessarily the quality of the entire class. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Fallacy of Composition"
