So, 2 is indeed a factor of 38.\n\nB. \\(38 \\div 3\\) does not result in a whole number, so 3 is not a factor of 38.\n\nC. \\(38 \\div 4\\) does not result in a whole number, so 4 is not a factor of 38.\n\nD. \\(38 \\div 8\\) does not result in a whole number, so 8 is not a factor of 38.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. 2**."
