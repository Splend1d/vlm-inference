The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases. \n\nWhen the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, it means that at any given price level, firms are willing to supply less output. This shift represents a decrease in total supply in the economy. As a result, to reach the new equilibrium, the price level must increase to incentivize more production (as per the assumption that the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, indicating that as prices rise, firms are willing to supply more output. However, despite the higher price level, the overall quantity of output supplied in the economy decreases because the shift to the left in the aggregate supply curve implies less total production capacity is available at each price level."
