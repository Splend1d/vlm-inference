Poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding.\n\nThe nurse might think a patient could not use an inhaler effectively due to poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding. These factors can impact the correct administration of the medication and therefore its effectiveness in managing symptoms such as asthma attacks or other respiratory issues. Severe leg ulcers (A), previous recovery from an acute exacerbation of asthma B), and forthcoming surgery C) do not directly preclude the use of an inhaler, but they might require additional considerations for patient care or medication management."
