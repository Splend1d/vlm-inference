Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n- In Scenario 1, selling books that you borrowed from the library is considered wrong because it involves taking items not legally or ethically yours and depriving the library of revenue that supports its services.\n- In Scenario 2, selling someone else's guitar without their knowledge or consent is also considered wrong. This action violates trust and property rights, as you are making decisions about another person's belongings without their explicit permission."
