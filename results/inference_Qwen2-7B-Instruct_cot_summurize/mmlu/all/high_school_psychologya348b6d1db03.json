Its main function is to increase the speed at which electrical signals, or nerve impulses, travel along the axon. This is achieved by creating segments of insulation that allow the electrical signal to \"jump\" from one segment to the next, rather than traveling continuously through the axon. This process, known as saltatory conduction, significantly speeds up the transmission of neural signals."
