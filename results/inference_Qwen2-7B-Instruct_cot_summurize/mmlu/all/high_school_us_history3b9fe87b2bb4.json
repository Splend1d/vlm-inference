Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865\nTo address the problems identified in Federalist #15, Hamilton proposed\n\nA. abandoning an isolationist approach to foreign policy and adopting a more aggressive and interventionist stance.\nB. adopting a new constitution in order to create a more national government.\nC. forging alliances with American Indian nations to present a united front to European powers.\nD. increasing spending on military forces and cutting spending on social programs.\n"

                    "text": "The statement provided by Col. Samuel Thomas in his congressional testimony in 1865 refers to the conditions and attitudes towards African Americans (freedmen) post-Civil War in the United States. This quote highlights the systemic racism and discrimination prevalent at the time, where many whites still viewed African Americans as inferior property rather than free citizens with rights.\n\nRegarding Hamilton's proposal in Federalist #15, the context of that essay was written in the early years of the United States, specifically during the debate over ratifying the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton advocated for a stronger federal government with broad powers, particularly in the area of taxation. He argued that a strong central authority was necessary to manage the national economy effectively and to maintain order and unity among the states.\n\nNone of the options A through D directly correspond to the context of Hamilton's proposal in Federalist #15. Instead, option B is closest to what Hamilton was proposing:\n\nB. Adopting a new constitution in order to create a more national government.\n\nHamilton believed that the Articles of Confederation, which governed the United States before the Constitution, were too weak and that a stronger federal government was needed to ensure stability, economic growth, and the ability to manage the nation's affairs effectively. Thus, he supported the creation of a new constitution that would establish a federal system with a stronger central authority, including a powerful executive branch, a bicameral legislature, and a robust judiciary."
