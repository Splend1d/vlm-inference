It indicates how much the price exceeds the marginal cost. A higher markup implies that the firm has more pricing power and faces less competition, as it can charge a premium over its production costs without losing many customers. \n\nTo clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. (MC-P)/MC: This represents the inverse of the markup, which is not used to measure market power.\n\nB. (MC-P)/P: This formula gives the inverse of the markup percentage, essentially showing the ratio of price to marginal cost minus one, but it's not typically used as a direct measure of market power.\n\nC. (P-MC)/P: This formula calculates the profit margin as a percentage of price, but it does not specifically indicate market power or monopoly pricing; it merely shows profitability."
