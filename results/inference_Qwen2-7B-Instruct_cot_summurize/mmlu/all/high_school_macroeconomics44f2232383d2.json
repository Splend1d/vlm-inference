Interest rates increase and the dollar appreciates.\n\nExplanation: Contractionary fiscal policy, which involves reducing government spending or increasing taxes, leads to a decrease in aggregate demand. This can result in lower inflation expectations, prompting central banks (such as the Federal Reserve) to raise interest rates to combat potential deflation or to maintain their inflation target. Higher interest rates make the country's financial assets more attractive to foreign investors, leading to increased demand for the domestic currency. As a consequence, the value of the dollar tends to appreciate against other currencies."
