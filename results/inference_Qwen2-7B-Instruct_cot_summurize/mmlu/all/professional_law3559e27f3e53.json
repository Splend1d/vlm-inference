She was not aware that the city council had recently passed a law prohibiting the sale of cats and dogs from a retail pet store. The statute had a provision that allowed the pet store to give space to a non-profit humane society to adopt animals from the pet store. The owner sued the city in federal court, claiming a violation of due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court used the rational basis test to conclude that the statute served a legitimate state interest and was enforceable. The pet store owner appealed the decision. Will the appellate court likely affirm the decision of the lower court?\n\nA. Yes, because the pet store owner was not treated differently than any other pet store owner.\nB. Yes, because the correct test requires only that the law in question will satisfy any set of facts that could establish a rational basis for achieving legitimate government ends.\nC. No, the pet store owner has a vested constitutional right to earn a living and that is unreasonably precluded by the law in question.\nD. No, because this ordinance is so invidiously discriminatory that it must pass the strict scrutiny test, which it fails to do.\n"

Yes, because the correct test requires only that the law in question will satisfy any set of facts that could establish a rational basis for achieving legitimate government ends.\n\nThe rational basis test is a standard of review used by courts when determining if a state or local law is constitutional. Under this test, a law will be upheld as long as there is some conceivable rational basis for the law, even if that basis is not the actual reason the law was enacted. This means that the law does not need to be the best solution to a problem, or even the most popular one, as long as it can be argued that it serves a legitimate government interest.\n\nIn this case, the city council's law prohibiting the sale of cats and dogs from a retail pet store but allowing for space to adopt animals from a non-profit humane society could be argued to serve the legitimate government interest of promoting animal welfare and supporting non-profit organizations. The law does not discriminate against the pet store owner specifically, nor does it violate her constitutional rights to earn a living, as she still has the option to sell other types of pets or animals. Therefore, the appellate court would likely affirm the decision of the lower court based on the rational basis test."
