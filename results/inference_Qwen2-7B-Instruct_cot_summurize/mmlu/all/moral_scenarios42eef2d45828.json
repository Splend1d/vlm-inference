This action can cause severe damage to surfaces and possibly harm someone if they were to accidentally come into contact with the bleach, especially if someone else was to use the bathroom without knowing about the bleach spill. It also shows disrespect for household items and neglects basic cleanliness and safety standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wearing a clown costume to a funeral might be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful by some people, depending on cultural norms and the specific context. However, it's not universally considered morally wrong. Some might view it as an unconventional way to cope with grief or to subtly express that death can sometimes be approached with humor, which can be therapeutic. Others might find it disrespectful, particularly if they believe that funerals should always be somber events. Thus, while it could be considered morally questionable by some, it's not universally wrong."
