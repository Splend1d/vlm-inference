                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Autoimmune factors are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes but not type 2 diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, leading to a complete lack of insulin production. This requires individuals with type 1 diabetes to take insulin injections or use an insulin pump to manage their blood sugar levels.\n\nType 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is characterized by the body's inability to effectively use insulin (insulin resistance) and often involves a reduced ability of the pancreas to produce enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes can be managed through lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, and sometimes medication to help the body better utilize its insulin or produce more insulin. However, unlike type 1 diabetes, it does not involve the destruction of beta cells due to autoimmune factors.\n\nLet's clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Persons with type 2 diabetes may need insulin therapy, especially when their condition progresses and becomes uncontrolled. It's not necessarily about needing lower doses compared to type 1 diabetes; rather, the need for insulin therapy varies among individuals based on their specific health status and management needs.\n\nB. While both types of diabetes can lead to chronic complications over time, type 1 diabetes typically develops more rapidly than type 2 diabetes. However, this statement implies that type 1 diabetes always leads to complications more quickly than type 2 diabetes, which isn't universally true. Both types of diabetes can lead to complications like cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and blindness if not well managed.\n\nD. Oral hypoglycemic agents (also known as blood sugar-lowering drugs classes such as metformin\u2014are used to treat type 2 diabetes to help the body better utilize insulin. They do not help increase endogenous insulin production in people with type 1 diabetes, who already have no beta cells left to produce insulin. Instead, these medications might be used in conjunction with insulin therapy in some cases."
