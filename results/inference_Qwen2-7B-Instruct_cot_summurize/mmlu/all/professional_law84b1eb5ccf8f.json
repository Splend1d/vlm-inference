Murder.\n\nInitially, the friend demanded money from the victim, and when the victim refused, the friend threatened him with a gun provided by the defendant. The friend then shot the victim to death. After realizing the victim was dead, the defendant took the opportunity to shoot the victim again, even though the victim was already deceased. This second act of shooting, while not resulting in the victim's death, would still constitute an attempt to commit murder (the defendant's intent to kill was clear.\n\nGiven that the defendant supplied the weapon used in the crime, his actions could also potentially lead to additional charges related to the unlawful possession or distribution of a weapon, but these charges would typically be considered less severe than the murder charge.\n\nTherefore, considering the defendant's direct involvement in providing the means for the murder and participating in an attempted killing after the initial fatal shooting, the most serious charge he can be convicted of is murder."
