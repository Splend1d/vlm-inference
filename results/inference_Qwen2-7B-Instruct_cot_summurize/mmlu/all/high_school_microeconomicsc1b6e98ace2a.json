Highly elastic demand curve.\n\nIn an oligopoly, if rival firms follow a price decrease but do not match a price increase, it suggests that the demand is highly responsive to price changes. Consumers and other firms are more likely to switch to alternatives when prices increase, making the demand curve very elastic. This means that a small change in price leads to a relatively large change in quantity demanded."
