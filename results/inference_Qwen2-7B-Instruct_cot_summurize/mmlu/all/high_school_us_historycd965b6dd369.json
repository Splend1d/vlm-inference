After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nSettlement houses like Hull House expressed a desire of reformers to do which of the following?\n\nA. Convert immigrants to Christianity\nB. Prevent political radicalism\nC. Provide cheap labor for industry\nD. Improve conditions in urban neighborhoods\n"

Improve conditions in urban neighborhoods.\n\nHull House, founded by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr in Chicago in 1889, was part of a broader movement known as the settlement house movement. This movement emerged in the late 19th century in response to the rapid urbanization and industrialization that occurred in cities across the United States. The settlement houses aimed to improve the lives of the urban poor by providing a range of services and educational opportunities.\n\nSettlement houses like Hull House sought to:\n\n1. **Provide Education:** They offered classes in subjects such as English language learning, art, music, and physical education to help residents improve their skills and broaden their horizons.\n\n2. **Social Services:** They provided direct assistance through programs like day nurseries, adult education, and legal aid to address the immediate needs of the community.\n\n3. **Community Building:** Settlement houses organized social events and clubs, including the boarding club mentioned in the excerpt, to foster a sense of community among the residents.\n\n4. **Advocacy and Reform:** They advocated for policies changes that would benefit the urban poor, such as better housing conditions, improved sanitation, and fair labor laws.\n\n5. **Cultural Preservation:** They supported cultural activities and helped preserve immigrant traditions, ensuring that new arrivals maintained connections to their heritage while also assimilating into American society.\n\nThus, the primary goal of settlement houses like Hull House was to improve the living conditions and quality of life in urban neighborhoods, particularly those inhabited by the poor and newly arrived immigrants."
