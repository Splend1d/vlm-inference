Interrupts are not necessarily generated when memory cycles are \"stolen\". An interrupt occurs when some event requires immediate attention from the CPU, such as input/output operation completion, hardware error, or user input.\n\nB. Interrupts are not used in place of data channels. Data channels are a method for transferring data between different parts of a computer system, whereas interrupts are a mechanism for handling events that require the CPU's attention.\n\nD. Interrupts can be generated by various events, including arithmetic operations. For example, a divide-by-zero exception would generate an interrupt, even though it involves an arithmetic operation."
