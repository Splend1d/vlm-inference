That there is no moral duty to obey an unjust law.\n\nHart's statement suggests that while legal systems can create and certify laws as valid within their own frameworks, the ultimate moral validity of these laws should still be questioned and judged. This aligns with the concept that a law, even if it is legally valid, might not be morally justifiable. Thus, one is not necessarily morally obligated to obey laws that are deemed unjust, challenging the notion of legal positivism which holds that the validity of law is separate from its moral correctness."
