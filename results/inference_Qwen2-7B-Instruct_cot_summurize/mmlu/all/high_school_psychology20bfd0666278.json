These symptoms may include thought disorders that manifest in speech as a lack of structure, coherence, or organization.\n\nWhile disorganized language can also be found in other conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (A), dissociative identity disorder (C), and bipolar disorder (D), it is most notably associated with schizophrenia in the context of cognitive and linguistic impairments. However, it's important to note that any of these conditions might involve disorganized language depending on the specific symptoms and presentations of each individual case."
