However, since we are looking for an immediate one-step consequence, let's focus on the implications directly:\n\nPremise 1 states that if \\(A\\) is true, then both \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) must be true (\\(A\\) implies \\(B \\cdot C\\)). Premise 2 tells us that \\(B \\cdot C\\) is not the case, meaning at least one of \\(B\\) or \\(C\\) is false.\n\nSince \\(A \\supset ( (B \\cdot C)\\), and we know \\(B \\cdot C\\) is false, it follows that \\(A\\) cannot be true under these conditions. If \\(A\\) were true, then \\(B \\cdot C\\) would also have to be true, which contradicts premise 2. Therefore, the only way for the implication \\(A \\supset ( (B \\cdot C)\\) to hold when \\(B \\cdot C\\) is false is if \\(A\\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. ~A**."
