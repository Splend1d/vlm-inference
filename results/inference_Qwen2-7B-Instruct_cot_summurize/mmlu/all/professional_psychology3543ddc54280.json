Its main purposes include:\n\nA. Matching the right person with the right job: Job analysis helps organizations understand the skills, knowledge, and abilities required for a particular role, which can aid in hiring decisions and creating effective job descriptions.\n\nB. Setting wages and salaries: By understanding the responsibilities, qualifications, and market demand for a position, organizations can determine fair compensation packages for employees.\n\nC. Establishing safety standards: Job analysis assists in identifying potential hazards associated with specific tasks or environments, allowing companies to implement appropriate safety measures and procedures.\n\nD. Determining underutilization in the workforce is not a direct use of job analysis. While job analysis can provide insights into employee skill sets and job requirements, it does not specifically target identifying underutilization within the workforce. Underutilization might be addressed through workforce planning, training, or reassignment strategies based on the findings from job analysis, but it is not its primary purpose."
