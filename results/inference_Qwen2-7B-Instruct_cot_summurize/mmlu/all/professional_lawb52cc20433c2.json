Knowing that his parents were giving a dinner party that evening, the boy filled a bucket with ice-cold water and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, thinking that his father would take the guests' coats there to put them on the bed. The boy then went off to play at a friend's house. The boy's father decided to keep all the guests' coats in the hall closet instead of putting them in the guest bedroom. Later that evening, one of the guests mistakenly wandered into the guest bedroom while searching for a bathroom. As the guest opened the door, the bucket fell and hit his head, causing a severe cut that required a dozen stitches. If the guest sues the boy for negligence, the most likely result is\n\nA. the boy wins, because a child's conduct cannot be negligent.\nB. the boy wins, because the guest unreasonably assumed the risk of entering an unfamiliar room rather than asking for directions to the bathroom.\nC. the boy loses, because this \"practical joke\" posed a risk of severe harm and, therefore, the boy had a duty to exercise as much care as a reasonable adult.\nD. the boy loses, because he did not act with the amount of care that one would expect from a 12-year-old child.\n"

In legal terms, a child can indeed be held liable for negligence if their actions foreseeably cause harm to others. The fact that the boy was playing a practical joke does not automatically exonerate him; rather, the focus is on whether a reasonable person, regardless of age, would have foreseen the potential for harm and taken steps to prevent it.\n\nIn this situation, the boy knew or should have known that placing a bucket of ice-cold water on a partially open door could cause injury when someone opens the door. By doing so, he breached his duty of care by creating a foreseeable risk of harm to those entering the room. Given that the injury was severe and required medical attention, it is highly likely that a court would find that the boy's actions were negligent, even though he was a minor."
