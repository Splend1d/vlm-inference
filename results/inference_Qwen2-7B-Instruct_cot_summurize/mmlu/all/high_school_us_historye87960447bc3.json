Government subsidy of the railroads enabled markets to expand and for production to become more efficient.\n\nThe American rail system played a crucial role in the nation's economic development during the 19th century. The government did provide subsidies and support for the construction of railroads, which helped to facilitate their expansion across the country. This infrastructure allowed for faster and more reliable transportation of goods, making markets more accessible and enabling industries to grow more efficiently. Railroads also contributed to the settlement of the western territories, facilitated the movement of troops and supplies during times of conflict, and played a significant part in the overall modernization and industrialization of the United States."
