The boy was mostly a benchwarmer who played only an inning or two during the game. One night, the father hid behind some shrubbery in front of the coach's home. Armed with a baseball bat, the father intended to break the coach's kneecaps when he came home from work. A man, who resembled the coach, was walking down the street. The father mistakenly believed that this man was the coach. The father jumped out of the bushes and hit the man in the kneecaps with the baseball bat. The man, who was a hemophiliac, died as a result of the injuries suffered in the beating. The father is\n\nA. guilty of attempted murder of the coach and the murder of the man.\nB. guilty of attempted murder of both the coach and the man.\nC. guilty of attempted manslaughter of the coach and murder of the man.\nD. guilty of attempted battery of the coach and murder of the man.\n"

This resulted in the death of this man due to being being a hemophiliac. Since the death occurred during the act of committing the attempted murder against the coach, it is considered part of the same criminal act under the felony murder rule or under the doctrine of transferred intent, depending on legal jurisdiction. Therefore, the father is also guilty of murder for the accidental killing of the man.\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not accurately reflect the legal consequences based on the given scenario. Option B incorrectly counts the man as a separate attempted murder victim, while option C separates the charges in a way that doesn't align with the theory of transferred intent. Option D focuses only on attempted battery, which does not account for the resulting death of the man."
