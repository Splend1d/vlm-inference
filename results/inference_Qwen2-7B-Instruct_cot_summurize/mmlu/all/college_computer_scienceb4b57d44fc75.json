Consider a simple directed acyclic graph with two vertices, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and an edge from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). In this case, \\(A\\) has an incoming edge but no outgoing edge, while \\(B\\) has no incoming edges but also has no outgoing edges. This example shows that it's possible for a graph to lack a vertex with no incoming edge.\n\n### Statement II: G has a vertex with no outgoing edge.\n\nThis statement is also not necessarily true. Similar to the previous counterexample, if we have a graph with two vertices and an edge from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), then \\(A\\) has an outgoing edge but no incoming edges, while \\(B\\) has an incoming edge but no outgoing edges. Thus, it's possible for a graph to lack a vertex with no outgoing edge.\n\n### Statement III: G has an isolated vertex, that is, one with neither an incoming edge nor an outgoing edge.\n\nThis statement must be true for any directed acyclic graph with more than zero edges. Here\u2019s why:\n\n- **Understanding Directed Acyclic Graphs**: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) has no directed cycles. That is, there is no way to start at a vertex and follow a sequence of directed edges that eventually loops back to the starting vertex.\n\n- **Counting Edges**: Since \\(G\\) has more than zero edges, let's consider the minimum number of vertices needed to ensure that there exists at least one vertex without an incoming or outgoing edge. If every vertex had both an incoming and an outgoing edge, we would need at least three vertices to form a simple cycle (which contradicts the acyclic property of \\(G\\). Therefore, in any DAG with more than one vertex, there must be at least one vertex that either has no incoming edge or no outgoing edge.\n\nGiven this, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. III only**\n\nThis is because the presence of a directed acyclic graph with more than zero edges guarantees the existence of an isolated vertex."
