This statement is incorrect because when the debt is negative, it typically means that the government has more assets than liabilities, which is not a common scenario for government finances. It does not relate directly to the concept of a budget deficit.\n- B. This statement is incorrect because when the debt is positive, it means the government owes money, and the deficit can still be increasing if the government spends more than it earns during a fiscal year.\n- C. This statement is incorrect because the deficit refers to the amount by which government spending exceeds revenue in a given fiscal year, while the debt is the total amount of money owed by the government at any point in time. The deficit does not accumulate from past debts; rather, past deficits contribute to the overall debt.\n- D. This statement is correct because when the budget deficit is negative ( meaning the government has a surplus where revenues exceed spending, this excess can be used to pay down the national debt, reducing its size."
