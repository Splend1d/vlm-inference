This type of training increases the efficiency of the mitochondria in muscle cells, allowing for more efficient burning of both fat and carbohydrates as energy sources. While it can also improve the speed of contraction (option A) and the breakdown of phosphocreatine (option B), these are are not primary outcomes of endurance training. Lastly, while it does generate energy anaerobically to some extent (option D), the focus is more on aerobic metabolism."
