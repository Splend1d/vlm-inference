The CIA plays a crucial role in providing policymakers with the information they need to make informed decisions regarding international affairs. \n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI focuses more on domestic security, law enforcement, and counterintelligence within the United States. It does contribute to national security by investigating threats both domestically and internationally, but its primary focus is not on gathering foreign intelligence for policymakers. \n\nThe National Security Council (NSC coordinates the development of national security and foreign policies. While it oversees various aspects of national security, including intelligence activities, it does not directly gather or interpret intelligence. Its role is more administrative and strategic, overseeing the coordination among different agencies that do collect intelligence.\n\nTherefore, option A is the most accurate answer as it correctly identifies the CIA as the agency primarily tasked with the role described."
