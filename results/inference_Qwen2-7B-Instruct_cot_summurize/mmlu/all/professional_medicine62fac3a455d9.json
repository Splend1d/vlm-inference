Transient lactase deficiency\n\nThe symptoms described, including recent hospitalization for enteritis and dehydration, persistent watery diarrhea after being discharged, and now presenting with signs of dehydration ( such as dry mucous membranes, suggest that the issue might be related to the infant's digestive system adjusting to the cow milk formula. Cow milk can sometimes cause gastrointestinal issues in infants, especially if they lack the enzyme lactase to properly digest lactose, the sugar found in milk.\n\nTransient lactase deficiency is a common condition in infants, often occurring when the body is unable to produce enough lactase to digest the lactose in milk. This typically resolves on its own by around 2 years of age. Signs include watery diarrhea, bloating, and gas. \n\nFructose intolerance would present differently, usually with abdominal pain, bloating, and loose stools within minutes or hours of consuming foods high in fructose, like some fruits.\n\nMagnesium deficiency could lead to symptoms like constipation, muscle cramps, and irritability, but it is less likely to present with watery diarrhea as a primary symptom.\n\nRegional enteritis refers to inflammation of part of the intestine, often associated with conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, which is not directly linked to diet in the same way lactase deficiency is.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, option B ( Transient lactase deficiency seems to be the most appropriate answer."
