When considering rights, a utilitarian would argue that a right is justified if recognizing and respecting it leads to an increase in overall well-being or happiness for the majority. This does not mean that rights are inherently valuable in themselves, but rather that their value is derived from their contribution to maximizing utility (or total happiness. Therefore, a utilitarian recognizing rights would likely view them as tools to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number, rather than as absolute, inherent entitlements."
