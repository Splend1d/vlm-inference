Price rises, but quantity is ambiguous.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe increased use of pesticides by apple growers suggests that there might be an environmental or health concern associated with the apples. This could lead to a decrease in demand as consumers may choose to avoid apples due to safety concerns. However, the rise in the price of pears (a substitute for apples) implies that apples might become relatively cheaper compared to pears, which could increase their demand as consumers switch to apples.\n\nThe overall impact on price and quantity is ambiguous because these opposing forces (decreased demand due to safety concerns and increased demand due to the relative affordability compared to pears - will interact. If the increase in demand due to affordability outweighs the decrease in demand due to safety concerns, we might see an increase in both price and quantity. Conversely, if the decrease in demand due to safety concerns is more significant, we might see a decrease in quantity, with the price depending on the supply dynamics.\n\nTherefore, while it's reasonable to predict that the price of apples might rise due to the affordability factor, the exact change in quantity is ambiguous without more specific information about consumer behavior and market supply conditions."
