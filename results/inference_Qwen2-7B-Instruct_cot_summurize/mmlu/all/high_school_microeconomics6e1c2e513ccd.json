This typically results in a higher wage compared to a monopsony market due to the absence of market power on the employer side.\n\nHowever, when a monopsony labor market transitions to perfect competition, the new equilibrium wage will be lower than the monopsony wage because the single buyer (the monopsonist) now faces a perfectly competitive market for labor. The monopsonist, seeking to minimize costs, will hire more workers at this lower wage rate to maximize profits. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The wage would fall, but employment would increase."
