The particles could have the same sign of charge ( positive-positive or negative-negative) to experience an attractive force, but for the net force to be exactly 0, they would need to be balanced in terms of magnitude and direction. This could happen if both charges are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, or if one charge is much larger than the other but in the opposite direction to perfectly balance the force.\n\nB. If the distance between the particles changes, the force will indeed change according to Coulomb's law (F = k * |q1*q2| / r^2, where F is the force, k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges, and r is the distance between the charges. Thus, altering the distance would alter the force.\n\nC. The particles do not necessarily have to have the same mass for the net force to be zero. The force depends on the charges, not the masses of the particles.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect because it is theoretically possible to have two charged particles with a net force of 0 N under certain conditions, such as when they have equal and opposite charges of the same magnitude, regardless of their masses."
