Attempt to contact the 32 who did not respond and get the information from them.\n\nThis approach aims to maintain the original sample size and ensures that the results are not biased by only analyzing the responses from the graduates who chose to participate. However, this might not always be feasible or cost-effective, depending on the resources available and the time constraints.\n\nIf contacting the nonresponders is not feasible, then option A ( using the 88 who did respond, but acknowledging the potential for selection bias due to the smaller sample size compared to the intended 120, could be considered if there's no other viable option. \n\nOption B ( using the 88 who did respond with the original intended sample size of 120 in the analysis, does not accurately reflect the sample size and could lead to overestimating the precision of the results.\n\nOption D: Selecting 32 more graduates at random and using them to replace the nonresponders, might introduce new biases if the characteristics of these additional participants differ significantly from those who did not respond initially. This could also complicate the analysis since it involves both an increase in sample size and a change in composition.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice under normal circumstances is C, unless there are are significant barriers to contacting the nonresponders, in which case A might be the best compromise."
