Because the architect had a history of substance abuse problems, the parties agreed that the developer's duty to accept and pay for the plans was conditioned on the architect's abstaining from drinking alcohol during the six months it would take to do the work. After two months, the architect began having several alcoholic drinks each day. The developer became aware of the architect's drinking before the architect showed the developer the preliminary plans. When the developer saw the preliminary plans, the developer told the architect that the concept was impressive and that he looked forward to seeing the final plans. The architect continued to have several alcoholic drinks each day and completed the plans within the specified contract period. However, the developer declined to review, accept, or pay for the final plans and stated that it was because of the architect's continued use of alcohol. The architect has sued the developer for breach of contract. Which of the following arguments best supports the architect's claim?\n\nA. The alcohol use was not a material breach of contract by the architect, since it did not affect the quality of the work.\nB. The developer waived the condition of no alcohol use.\nC. The no-alcohol term was functionally a penalty clause and therefore was unenforceable.\nD. The no-alcohol term would be interpreted as a promise and not a condition.\n"

The developer waived the condition of no alcohol use.\n\nIn contract law, waiver occurs when one party (the \"aggrieved party\" fails to enforce a specific term of the contract despite having the right to do so. In this case, the developer initially agreed to the condition that the architect must abstain from drinking alcohol during the work period. However, after becoming aware of the architect's drinking, the developer still expressed approval of the preliminary plans, indicating that they were willing to overlook the architect's violation of the no-alcohol condition at that point in time. This action could be seen as the developer waivinging the condition, especially if the developer proceeded to show enthusiasm for the architect's work and did not explicitly rescind the condition at the time of awareness.\n\nThe other options are less likely to support the architect's claim:\n\nA. The quality of the work does not directly address the issue of whether the condition was breached. The condition was about abstinence from alcohol, not the quality of the plans.\n\nC. A penalty clause is typically unenforceable because it imposes an excessively harsh sanction for a breach. However, in this scenario, the condition is more akin to a condition precedent (a requirement that must be met before the developer's obligations become due. Whether it is a penalty or a condition depends on the specifics of how it was framed in the contract.\n\nD. Whether the no-alcohol term is interpreted as a promise or a condition would depend on the language of the contract. If the contract clearly states that the developer's duty to accept and pay for the plans is contingent upon the architect's abstention from alcohol, then it is a condition. However, without the exact wording of the contract, it's hard to definitively say which interpretation would prevail. The focus on waiver here is more relevant to the argument presented."
