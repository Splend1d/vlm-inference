The increase is $200 ($400 - $200). To find the percentage increase:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Increase}}{\\text{Original Price}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{200}{200} \\right) \\times 100 = 100\\% \\]\n\nHowever, the question seems to imply that the CPI has doubled, which would be incorrect based on the information provided. If the price went from $200 to $400, the CPI would actually be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Price in Current Period}}{\\text{Price in Base Period}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI} = \\left( \\frac{400}{200} \\right) \\times 100 = 200 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer based on the calculation provided in the question stem would be D. equals 200 in the current period. However, considering the logic behind calculating CPI and the typical interpretation, the actual percentage increase from $200 to $400 is indeed 100%, not 50%. The question might have been aiming for a different calculation or context."
