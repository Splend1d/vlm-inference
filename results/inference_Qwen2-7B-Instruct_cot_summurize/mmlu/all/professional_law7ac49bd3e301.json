She found no disturbance but did witness the two male residents engaging in consensual sexual relations with each other. She arrested and charged them with \"deviate sexual intercourse\", a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations. After conviction and unsuccessful appeals in the state courts, the men appealed to the United States Supreme Court. What is the likely holding and reasoning of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\nB. The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality.\nC. The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment.\nD. The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.\n"

The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\n\nThis is based on the precedent set by several landmark Supreme Court decisions that have recognized a fundamental right to privacy and personal autonomy, including in sexual relationships. These cases include Griswold v. Connecticut ( (1965), which struck down a state law prohibiting the use of contraceptives by married couples as an infringement on their privacy rights; Loving v. Virginia ( (1967), which invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage; and finally, Lawrence v. Texas ( (2003), which overturned the Texas anti-sodomy law and reinforced the idea that states cannot ban consensual sexual activities between adults in private.\n\nIn Lawrence v. Texas, the Supreme Court held that the Texas law violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stating that the law interfered with \"an individual's autonomy to define at least some of the essential attributes of his person.\" This decision reinforced the idea that there is a fundamental right to engage in intimate, consensual relationships, which includes sexual activity between adults, as long as it does not involve coercion or violence against others.\n\nTherefore, if the Supreme Court were faced with a similar case today, it would likely rule that the state's prohibition on consensual same-sex sexual conduct violates the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process, protecting the fundamental right to privacy and personal autonomy in intimate relationships."
