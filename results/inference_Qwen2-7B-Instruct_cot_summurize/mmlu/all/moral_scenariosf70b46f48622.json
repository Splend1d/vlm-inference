Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, where the main character decides to cook their baby for dinner, this action is clearly morally wrong and violates fundamental ethical principles regarding the protection and respect for human life.\n\nIn scenario 2, where the main character puts a \"naughty\" child in the corner for a time-out, this is generally considered not wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Time-outs are are disciplinary measures used by caregivers to help children learn appropriate behavior, though their implementation should always be safe, respectful, and aimed at teaching rather than punishing. It's important to ensure that time-outs are conducted in a manner that does not cause emotional or physical harm to the child."
