Moving the plates closer together\n\nThe capacitance (C) of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ C = \\epsilon_0 \\frac{A}{d} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\epsilon_0 \\) is the permittivity of free space,\n- \\( A \\) is the area of the plates, and\n- \\( d \\) is the distance between the plates.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the capacitance increases as the distance between the plates (\\( d \\)) decreases. Therefore, moving the plates closer together increases the capacitance of the parallel-plate capacitor."
