An increased risk of low birth weight babies: Cocaine use during pregnancy has been linked to premature labor, which can result in a baby being born before they have fully developed, potentially leading to low birth weight.\n\nB. Poorer growth and lower intelligence: Prenatal exposure to cocaine can affect fetal development, leading to underdevelopment and potentially impacting cognitive abilities later in life. This can manifest as lower intelligence quotients (IQs) and other developmental issues.\n\nC. Smaller head circumference: Research suggests that babies born to mothers who used cocaine during pregnancy may have smaller head circumferences than those born to mothers who did not use the drug. This can indicate developmental delays or anomalies.\n\nIt's important to note that these effects can vary widely among individuals and depend on various factors including the frequency and amount of cocaine use, the stage of pregnancy when use occurred, and other health factors of the mother."
