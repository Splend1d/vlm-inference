All of the above\n\nBoth bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa involve significant disturbances in eating behaviors, but they differ in specific aspects of those behaviors. Here's a brief overview of each feature you mentioned:\n\n1. **Purging**: This refers to behaviors that individuals with bulimia nervosa use to counteract binge eating episodes. Purging can include self-induced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, or other methods like excessive exercise or fasting.\n\n2. **Maintaining a normal body weight**: Anorexia nervosa is characterized by an individual maintaining a significantly low body weight for their age, sex, and height, despite being being underweight or having a low body mass index (BMI. In contrast, bulimia nervosa involves binge eating followed by purging behaviors, which often helps individuals maintain a more normal body weight or even above average for their age, sex, and height.\n\n3. **Bingeing**: This is one of the core symptoms of bulimia nervosa. It involves consuming large amounts of food in a short period of time, often feeling a lack of control over eating during these episodes. Anorexia nervosa typically does not involve binge eating; instead, it is characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image leading to severe food restriction.\n\nTherefore, all of these features play a crucial role in differentiating these two disorders from one another."
