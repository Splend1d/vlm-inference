If the per unit price of labor increases, this directly raises the cost of producing each additional unit of output, hence shifting the MC curve upwards. \n\nAFC (Average Fixed Cost) would not be directly affected by changes in labor price because it is determined by total fixed costs divided by quantity produced and does not change with the level of output when considering the impact of labor price alone.\n\nMPL (Marginal Product of Labor) refers to the change in total output resulting from a one-unit increase in labor, holding all other factors constant. It doesn't directly relate to the cost changes but rather to productivity.\n\nATC (Average Total Cost) would also rise if the MC rises, since ATC = TC/Q where TC is Total Cost and Q is quantity produced. The increase in MC implies an increase in TC, thus an increase in ATC. However, among the options provided, only D correctly identifies the direct effect on MC."
