The federal government at the time was implementing a thaw in relations with the Cuban government. The U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba. A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council. Is the federal court likely to grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the state law was consistent with the federal law and with federal policy on Cuba.\nB. No, a state has the sovereign right to pass its own laws concerning its policies toward foreign countries.\nC. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it denies equal protection to citizens of other states.\nD. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.\n"

Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.\n\nWhen a state law conflicts with federal foreign policy, the Supreme Court has held that the federal government's foreign affairs powers take precedence under the principle of preemption. In the case of the state law in question, it appears to conflict with federal policy towards Cuba, as evidenced by the federal government's implementation of a thaw in relations with the Cuban government. Therefore, the federal court is likely to find that the state law illegally interferes with the foreign affairs powers of the federal government and declare it unconstitutional."
