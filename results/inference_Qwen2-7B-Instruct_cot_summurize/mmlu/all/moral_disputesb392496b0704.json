This intervention into nature and human biology undermines our sense of humility and respect for the complexity and mystery of life.\n\nB. **Responsibility**: Genetic enhancement raises questions about who is responsible for the outcomes of these interventions. If enhancements lead to disparities in health, intelligence, or social status, there could be concerns about fairness and justice. Individuals might feel responsible for the benefits they receive, while others may feel responsible for the burdens they bear due to not having access to such enhancements.\n\nC. **Solidarity**: Sandel suggests that eugenics and genetic enhancement could erode our sense of solidarity with others. If some individuals or groups are genetically enhanced, it could lead to a hierarchy where the \"enhanced\" are seen as superior, potentially justifying discrimination against those without such enhancements. This could undermine the social bonds and mutual obligations that define our collective humanity.\n\nThus, Sandel's argument is that these practices can be morally problematic from a secular perspective because they threaten fundamental aspects of human dignity, morality, and society."
