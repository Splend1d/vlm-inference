The property consisted of a single-family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. During her occupancy, the boss paid $3,500 each year in insurance and property taxes. In addition, the premises on the property had a fair market value during this period of $1,500 each year. Following her mother's death, the boss's daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. As the administratrix of the boss's estate, the daughter sought to collect from the co-worker one- half of the cost of insurance and property taxes that the boss paid. Conversely, the co-worker claimed that he was not liable for any of the expenses. Furthermore, the coworker's attorney advised him that the daughter did not own any interest in the property and that since the boss's death, he (the co-worker) owned the entire property. The attorney also informed the co-worker that the daughter owed him rent for the entire period of her occupancy, and if she continued to occupy the premises, then she would be liable for insurance and property taxes as well. In an appropriate action to determine the title of the property, what, if any, interest does the daughter have in the said property?\n\nA. None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship.\nB. An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.\nC. An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.\nD. An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.\n\nTenancy by the entirety is a type of joint ownership between spouses or domestic partners where the property cannot be divided against the will of the other owner. When one spouse or partner dies, their interest in the property automatically passes to the surviving spouse or partner without going through probate. However, the decedent can make a testamentary disposition, which means they can leave their interest in the property to someone else in their will.\n\nIn this case, the deceased boss left her interest in the property to both her co-worker and herself as community property. This indicates that they were likely tenants by the entirety, given the context provided. Therefore, upon her death intestate, her interest in the property would pass to her heir, her daughter. Since the property was initially held as community property and later as tenants by the entirety, the daughter would inherit an undivided one-half interest in the property, assuming there were no other agreements or laws that would affect the inheritance differently.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not accurately reflect the legal principles at play here:\n\nA. None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship: This option is incorrect because it does not account for the testamentary disposition made by the deceased boss, which would affect the distribution of her interest in the property.\n\nB. An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs: This option incorrectly applies the concept of tenants in common, which does not apply to the scenario described where the property was initially held as community property and later as tenants by the entirety.\n\nD. An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole: This option incorrectly conflates joint tenancy with tenancy by the entirety. While both involve joint ownership, joint tenancy does not apply when discussing the rights of spouses or domestic partners, and it does not account for the testamentary disposition made by the deceased boss."
