                    "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends zinc supplementation for several groups of people, based on specific health needs:\n\n1. **Pregnant and lactating women**: Zinc is crucial for fetal development and the prevention of low birth weight. It also supports maternal health and reduces the risk of infections.\n\n2. **Children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea**: Zinc plays a critical role in growth and development, and it helps in healing wounds and fighting infections. In children suffering from severe acute malnutrition or severe diarrhoea, zinc supplementation can significantly reduce the duration and severity of these conditions.\n\n3. **All children in low-income areas with high prevalence of stunting**: Stunting refers to the impaired physical and mental development in children due to poor nutrition and health conditions. Zinc deficiency is one of the contributing factors to stunting. Supplementing with zinc can help prevent and reverse this condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would likely encompass all these groups, as the WHO's recommendations suggest that zinc supplementation can be beneficial across various populations with specific health vulnerabilities. However, given the format of the question, which seems to ask for distinct groups, the most comprehensive answer would be a combination of all options, indicating that zinc supplementation is recommended for pregnant and lactating women, children with severe malnutrition or diarrhea, and all children in low-income areas with high prevalence of stunting. This reflects the broad application of zinc supplementation to address global health challenges related to malnutrition and its consequences."
