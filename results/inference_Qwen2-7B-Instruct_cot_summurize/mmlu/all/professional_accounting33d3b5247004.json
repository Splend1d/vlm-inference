A statement referring to standards established by the AICPA.\n\nWhen a practitioner conducts an engagement involving agreed-upon procedures, they should include a statement in their report indicating that the procedures were performed in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ( (AICPA). This statement serves as evidence that the work was carried out in conformity with recognized professional guidelines.\n\nExplanation of other options:\n\nA. A statement that the practitioner performed an examination of prospective financial statements: This would not be appropriate for a report on agreed-upon procedures, which typically involve specific tasks rather than an overall examination of financial statements.\n\nB. A statement of scope limitation that will qualify the practitioner\u2019s opinion: While it may be relevant in certain circumstances, a statement of scope limitation is not necessarily required or included in every practitioner's report on agreed-upon procedures. It depends on whether there were any limitations to the procedures that could affect the outcome.\n\nD. A statement of negative assurance based on procedures performed: Negative assurance is generally not provided in engagements where agreed-upon procedures are being performed. Agreed-upon procedures engagements are limited in nature and do not provide assurance that no material misstatements exist in the subject matter."
