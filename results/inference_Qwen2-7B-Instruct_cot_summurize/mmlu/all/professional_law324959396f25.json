This income tax exempts taxable income earned outside of the state by photographers who live in the state. Moreover, resident-photographers of the state are not taxed on their in-state earned income. A photographer who operates a studio in the state but is a resident of another state, challenges the constitutionality of this tax. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The commerce clause.\nD. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\n"

The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis clause ensures that states do not deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. In this scenario, the tax applies differently based on residency status, potentially violating the principle of equal protection if it's perceived as treating residents and non-residents unequally under the law. Specifically, the tax discriminates against non-resident photographers compared to resident photographers and those earning income outside the state, which could be seen as unequal treatment under the law."
