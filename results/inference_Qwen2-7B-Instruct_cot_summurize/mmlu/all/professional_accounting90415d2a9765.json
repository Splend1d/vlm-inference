This principle is based on the tax rule that gifts of property generally do not increase the recipient's basis in the property. Therefore, even though the fair market value of the securities at the time of the gift was $9,000, which might suggest that the child's basis could be adjusted to reflect this value, the actual basis remains at the parent's adjusted basis of $10,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $10,000"
