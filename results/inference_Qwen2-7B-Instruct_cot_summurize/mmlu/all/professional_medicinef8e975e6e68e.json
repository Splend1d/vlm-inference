He has been functionally independent in activities of daily living and is employed doing inventory control in a local sporting goods store. He has maintained continence through periodic self-catheterization. The patient is paraplegic, has recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones, and recent onset of incontinence secondary to detrusor and bladder neck dysfunction. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. Aside from paraplegia, lower extremity muscle atrophy, and lower abdominal surgical scars, the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. He had an episode of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy during a previous operation for functional expansion of his bladder through a bowel anastomosis. Which of the following is most important to consider in the care of this patient?\n\nA. Administration of injectable medications with disposable syringes\nB. Preparation of food by outside contractors\nC. Type of cleaning agents used to sterilize bed linens\nD. Use of rubber urethral catheters\n"

Use of rubber urethral catheters\n\nGiven the patient's history of latex allergy, it is crucial to avoid any medical devices or materials that may contain latex, including rubber urethral catheters. This is because exposure to latex can trigger an allergic reaction, potentially leading to anaphylaxis in this patient. Therefore, healthcare providers should use alternative catheters made from materials other than latex, such as silicone or polyurethane, to ensure the patient's safety. \n\nOptions A, B, and C might also be important considerations depending on the specific details of the patient's care, but they are not directly related to the patient's latex allergy. For instance, A relates to medication administration, which could involve non-latex syringes; B pertains to food preparation, which typically does not have a direct connection to latex allergies unless there is a risk of cross-contamination; and C involves cleaning agents, which may or may not contain latex, but their impact on the patient would depend on the nature of the cleaning tasks and the patient's specific needs."
