Shows a logical progression from egocentric thought to broad moral principles\n\nKohlberg's theory of moral development suggests that individuals progress through a series of stages in their understanding of morality, moving from more self-centered and rule-bound perspectives to broader, more socially and ethically conscious viewpoints. This progression involves understanding different levels of moral reasoning, which include pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional stages. \n\nIn the pre-conventional stage, individuals base their moral decisions on rewards or punishments and on avoiding punishment. In the conventional stage, they follow rules and laws because of a desire for social acceptance or to maintain social order. Finally, in the post-conventional stage, individuals base their moral decisions on abstract ethical principles, which they believe should apply universally.\n\nThis theory does not suggest that morality develops independently of outside influence ( (option A), nor does it claim that morality cannot be rationalized in every instance ( (option B). Moreover, Kohlberg did acknowledge that morality is influenced by emotions, although his focus was more on the cognitive processes involved in moral reasoning ( (option C).\n\nTherefore, the statement most consistent with Kohlberg's theory is option D: morality shows a logical progression from egocentric thought to broad moral principles."
