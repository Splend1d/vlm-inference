This occurs when a company sponsors an event, organization, or individual, and as a result, the audience perceives the sponsor in a more positive light due to their association with something desirable or prestigious. The halo effect happens because people often view the sponsor as having similar values, qualities, or characteristics as the event or organization they've chosen to support. This can lead to increased brand awareness, customer loyalty, and a more favorable public image for the sponsoring company."
