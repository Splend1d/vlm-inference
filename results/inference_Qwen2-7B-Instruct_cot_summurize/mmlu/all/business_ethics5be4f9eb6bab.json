A theory which states that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number\n\nUtilitarianism, as developed by philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, is a form of consequentialist ethics that suggests that the morality of an action is determined by its outcome or consequence. Specifically, according to utilitarian principles, an action is considered morally right if it leads to the greatest overall happiness or well-being for the largest number of people affected by that action. This approach often involves calculating and compare the potential benefits and harms resulting from various actions in order to determine which course of action would produce the most favorable outcome."
