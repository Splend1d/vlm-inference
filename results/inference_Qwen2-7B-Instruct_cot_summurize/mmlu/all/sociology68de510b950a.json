It involves two key ideas: disengagement and disenchantment.\n\nDisengagement refers to the decline in participation in religious institutions and activities. As societies become more secular, people tend to participate less in religious rituals, services, and organizations.\n\nDisenchantment involves a loss of belief in supernatural explanations for the world. This can be seen as a decline in religious faith or a shift towards more naturalistic explanations for phenomena that were traditionally attributed to divine intervention.\n\nSo, while disengagement is about reduced involvement in religious life, disenchantment is about a shift away from supernatural beliefs. Both contribute to the overall trend of secularization in society."
