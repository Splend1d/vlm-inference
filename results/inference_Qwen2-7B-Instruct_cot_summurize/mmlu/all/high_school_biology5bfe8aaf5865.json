H+ would increase inside the intermembrane space (the compartment between inner and outer membranes).\n\nOligomycin inhibits ATP synthase, which is responsible for the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate in the mitochondrial inner membrane. By blocking this process, protons (H+ ions) cannot exit the matrix through the ATP synthase complex. This results in a proton gradient buildup within the intermembrane space. The increased concentration of H+ ions in the intermembrane space is one of the key factors driving the function of the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis under normal conditions. Without this mechanism being active due to oligomycin's inhibition, the proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis is disrupted, leading to the buildup of H+ ions in the intermembrane space as the first expected response."
