The water forms a puddle in the street, which freezes over during the night. Early the next morning, a car driving on the street slides on the ice and crashes into a tree. If the driver of the car sues the man and asserts that the man was negligent per Se, which of the following additional facts would help the man the most?\n\nA. The man was not aware of the ordinance.\nB. The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.\nC. The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.\nD. The driver is not a resident of the city.\n"

The man was not aware of the ordinance.\n\nThis is because negligence per se typically refers to a violation of a statute or regulation that is so clearly designed to protect against a certain harm that anyone who violates it is presumed to have acted negligently. If the man did not know about the ordinance, he could argue that he had no way of knowing that his actions were illegal and potentially negligent.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that laws vary by jurisdiction, and the specific application of negligence per se may differ. In this case, it's also worth considering whether the ordinance applies to personal property like vehicles ( and whether the man's actions in violating the ordinance contributed to the harm caused by the accident. Additionally, other factors such as the foreseeability of the harm, the reasonableness of the man's actions, and the city's responsibility for maintaining safe streets might also play a role in the outcome of the case."
