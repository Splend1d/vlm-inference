Hart criticized Fuller's notion that all law must be morally valid. He argued that legal systems can have internal rules for validity (what he termed the \"rule of recognition\" - which determines what counts as valid law within that system - that may not necessarily correspond to moral standards. In the case of Nazi Germany, Hart might argue that their system had its own internal logic and criteria for validity, even if those criteria were morally reprehensible."
