However, the builder must subtract the value of the materials he was able to resell.\n\nThe cost of work completed: $9,000 (  \nCost of materials purchased: $1,000  (  \nValue added to the homeowner's property: $3,000  \n\nAdding these amounts gives us $13,000. However, we must also consider the builder's expected profit from completing the project, which was estimated at $5,000. This is typically included in calculating damages when a contractor is unjustly prevented from completing a job. So, adding the expected profit:\n\n$13,000 + $5,000 = $18,000\n\nHowever, the builder sold the unused materials for $1,000, reducing his potential loss by that amount. So, we subtract the resale value from the total:\n\n$18,000 - $1,000 = $17,000\n\nNone of the options exactly matches this calculation, suggesting there might be a slight misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the provided options. Based on the reasoning provided:\n\nC. $14,000, the total cost expended by the builder ($10,000) plus the builder's expected profit ($5,000), minus the loss avoided by the resale of the unused materials ($1,000).\n\nThis option closely aligns with the calculation process, though it slightly underestimates the correct amount. A more precise answer based on the information given would be $17,000, not listed among the choices."
