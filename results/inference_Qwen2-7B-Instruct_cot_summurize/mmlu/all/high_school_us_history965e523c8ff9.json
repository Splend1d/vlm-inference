Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.

                    "text": "The statement you've provided is an excerpt from the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education ( et al., which was decided in 1954. The case ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, thus overturning the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson ( (1896).\n\nOut of the options given, \"states' rights\" does not directly correspond to a social movement inspired by the Civil Rights Movement. While the Civil Rights Movement sought to challenge discriminatory laws and practices at both the federal and state levels, the concept of \"states' rights\" refers to the belief that the Constitution grants individual states certain powers or privileges independent of the federal government. This concept has historically been used by those who wish to resist or limit the authority of the federal government, particularly in cases involving civil rights legislation.\n\nIn contrast, the other options:\n\nA. Women's rights: Movements like the feminist movement have been inspired by the broader civil rights struggle, seeking to address gender inequality and discrimination through legal and societal changes.\n\nB. Gay and lesbian rights: The LGBTQ+ rights movement has roots in the civil rights era, with early activists often drawing parallels between their struggles against discrimination and those fought by the civil rights movement.\n\nC. Native American rights: The Native American rights movement has also been influenced by civil rights principles, advocating for recognition of indigenous sovereignty, land rights, and cultural preservation.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. states' rights, as it does not represent a social movement specifically inspired by the Civil Rights Movement in terms of its goals or methodology."
