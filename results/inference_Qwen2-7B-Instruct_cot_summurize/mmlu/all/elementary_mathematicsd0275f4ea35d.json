So, it seats \\(200 - 20 = 180\\) people.\n\n3. **Green Section**: Seats 2 times as many people as the blue section. Therefore, it seats \\(180 \\times 2 = 360\\) people.\n\nNow, add the capacities of all three sections to get the total seating capacity:\n\\[200 + 180 + 360 = 740\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who can sit in the baseball park is **740**. \n\nThe correct answer is **D. 740**."
