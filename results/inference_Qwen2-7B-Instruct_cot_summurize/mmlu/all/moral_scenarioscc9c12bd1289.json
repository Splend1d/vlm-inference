It is an action that might be necessary and appropriate when someone needs to identify a deceased relative or friend. However, the context is quite sensitive, so it would depend on how this was done (e.g., without permission if it wasn't your relative, etc.\n\nScenario 2: Whispering romantic sweet nothings into one's wife's sister's ear could be considered morally wrong if it involves inappropriate boundaries or actions, especially if there is a lack of consent or if it's perceived as disrespectful to the sister. In many contexts, especially in close-knit families or where there is a relationship of trust and respect, such behavior might not be tolerated and could be seen as crossing personal boundaries."
