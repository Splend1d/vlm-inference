According to his work, particularly his theory on modes of experience, schizophrenia can be characterized by a specific cognitive mode.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. Parataxic Distortion Mode**: dealing with others as if they are're from early life experiences. \n\nIn this mode, individuals perceive others based on their early life experiences rather than as separate, independent entities. This can lead to distorted perceptions and relationships, which are central to the symptoms of schizophrenia. The other options you mentioned do not specifically align with the cognitive experience that characterizes schizophrenic behavior according to Sullivan's theory. \n\n- A. Parataxic Mode involves private symbols and causal connections, but it does not specifically describe the way others are perceived.\n- C. Prototaxic Mode refers to a state of experience before the development of language and structured thought, which is not directly linked to the cognitive distortions seen in schizophrenia.\n- D. Basic anxiety pertains to a sense of helplessness or isolation in a perceived hostile world, which is more about emotional states rather than a specific cognitive experience in schizophrenia."
