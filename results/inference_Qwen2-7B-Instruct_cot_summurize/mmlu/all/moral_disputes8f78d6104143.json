Hardin, the philosopher and ecologist who coined the term \"tragedy of the commons,\" argued that common resources (like the atmosphere or the ocean) are often overused and depleted because individuals acting in their own self-interest can deplete them faster than they can be replenished. In the context of establishing world food banks, Hardin might argue that the concept is inherently flawed due to the same principle. If everyone assumes that someone else will contribute to the food bank or that there will always be enough food available, then there may not be sufficient motivation for individuals or nations to contribute generously or consistently. This could lead to the depletion of the food bank's resources over time, leaving those in need without the support they require when it's most needed."
