This supports the Out of Africa theory which posits that anatomically modern humans originated in Africa and then migrated to other parts of the world. The discovery does not demonstrate simultaneous evolution in Africa and Europe, nor does it specifically show the development of a larger brain before the first evidence for tool making."
