The contract contained a provision wherein the supermarket promised to purchase \"as many oranges as required, but at a minimum 100 bushels per month at a price of $20 per bushel for the next year. \" The agreement also provided that any modifications must be in writing. On February 1, the produce company shipped the supermarket 70 bushels of oranges, which were accepted and paid for. On March 1, the produce company tendered 80 bushels of oranges, which the supermarket accepted and paid for. On April 1, the produce company delivered 100 bushels of oranges to the supermarket. This shipment was accepted and also was promptly paid for. On April 2, the manager of the supermarket became concerned because a Florida drought had resulted in a sharp increase in the price of oranges. Consequently, the manager consulted the supermarket's attorney, who advised him to demand adequate assurances that the produce company would perform its obligations under the terms of the contract. Heeding the attorney's advice, the manager sent a letter on April 3 to the produce company, expressing his concern and requesting an adequate assurance of due performance for the balance of the contract. This letter was received by the produce company on April 4. Which of the following best states the supermarket's legal rights against the produce company?\n\nA. Cancel the contract on May 1, cover immediately and then sue for damages.\nB. Wait until the May 1 shipment; if it doesn't comply, demand adequate assurances, and not obtaining them, then sue for damages.\nC. Wait until the end of the contract and then sue for damages.\nD. Wait a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days; if adequate assurances are not received, cancel the contract, cover immediately and then sue for damages.\n"

The supermarket is justified in seeking adequate assurance of the produce company's future performance under the contract.\n\nThe Uniform Commercial Code ( (UCC) provides guidance in such situations, particularly under Article 2, which deals with sales of goods. Section 2-608 of the UCC specifically addresses the right to demand adequate assurance of performance when there is reasonable grounds for insecurity.\n\nGiven the context:\n\nD. Wait a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days; if adequate assurances are not received, cancel the contract, cover immediately and then sue for damages.\n\nThis option seems to align with the recommended course of action under the UCC guidelines. It allows the supermarket to give the produce company a reasonable period to demonstrate its ability to fulfill the contract terms, after which the supermarket can legally terminate the contract, mitigate its losses through alternative sourcing (covering), and then seek damages in court.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not necessarily follow the steps prescribed by the UCC or the principle of giving the breaching party a chance to cure their breach before taking further legal action. Option A involves immediate cancellation and potential cover without giving the other party a chance to rectify the situation. Option B suggests waiting until the next shipment before demanding assurances, which might prolong the issue. Option C implies waiting until the end of the contract term to take action, potentially allowing for more substantial damage to occur.\n\nTherefore, based on standard legal principles and the UCC, option D appears to be the most appropriate course of action for the supermarket."
