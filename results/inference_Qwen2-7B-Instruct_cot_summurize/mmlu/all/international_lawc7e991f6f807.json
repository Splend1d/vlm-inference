Treaties do not create obligations or rights for third States without their consent.\n\nTreaties law generally operates on the principle of pacta sunt servanda ( or \"agreements must be kept\", which means that states are honor and perform their treaty obligations. However, these obligations and rights are primarily towards the parties to the treaty. Non-party states (third states) are not bound by the treaty unless they have given their consent to be bound in some way. This could happen through being party to the treaty themselves, or through a specific agreement with one of the treaty parties where they accept the treaty's obligations or benefits.\n\nFor example, a treaty might confer certain rights on a third state if it adheres to the treaty's provisions or if the parties to the treaty agree to extend those rights. Alternatively, a third state might assume obligations under a treaty if it agrees to them separately, perhaps through a protocol, annex, or separate agreement. \n\nTherefore, treaties typically do not automatically create obligations or rights for third states unless the third state consents to them."
