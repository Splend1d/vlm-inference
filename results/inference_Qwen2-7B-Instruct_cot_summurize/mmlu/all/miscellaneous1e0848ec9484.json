Ocean floor topography and the shape of the coastline serve to amplify tidal flow at specific localities.\n\nTidal ranges can vary significantly between different locations due to several factors, including ocean floor topography, the shape of the coastline, and the presence of bays or inlets which can trap and amplify the tidal waves. These geographical features can lead to much larger tidal ranges compared to areas with more open, unobstructed coastlines. The Coriolis effect does influence the direction of tidal currents but does not directly cause differences in tidal range. The position of the Sun and the Moon relative to a given location affects the magnitude of tides ( (spring tides and neap tides), but it does not explain why some places have larger tidal ranges than others. Trade winds can affect the surface currents, but they do not significantly influence the tidal range either."
