Therefore, the probability of both events occurring together (i.e., their intersection) is simply the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet's clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. A and B may or may not be mutually exclusive. Independence and mutual exclusivity are two different concepts. Two events can be independent without being being mutually exclusive, and vice versa. Mutually exclusive events cannot occur at the same time, whereas independent events can.\n\nC. A and B must be mutually exclusive. This statement is false for the reason explained in option B.\n\nD. \\(P(A| B) = P(B| A)\\). This statement is also true but not the defining characteristic of independence. It correctly states that the conditional probability of A given B is the same as the conditional probability of B given A, which is a property of independence. However, it's not what makes events independent; it's a consequence of independence. The defining characteristic of independence is the equation \\(P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)\\), which is covered in option A."
