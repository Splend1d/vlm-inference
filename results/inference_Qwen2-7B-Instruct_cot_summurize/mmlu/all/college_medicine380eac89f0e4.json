Ingestion of carnitine during exercise.\n\nWhile the use of supplements like carnitine might have some benefits for athletic performance, it is not universally accepted as a factor that significantly influences overall success in sports. Success in sports generally depends on a combination of innate talent, skill development, strategic understanding (tactics), physical conditioning, nutrition, and mental fortitude. However, the impact of carnitine specifically can vary greatly among individuals and is not a guaranteed factor for success. It's important to note that athletes should consult with professionals before using any supplements to ensure they are safe and appropriate for their needs."
