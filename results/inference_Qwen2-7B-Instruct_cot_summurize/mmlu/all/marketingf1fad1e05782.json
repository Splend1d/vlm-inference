Framing.\n\nFraming, in the context of communication, refers to the process of presenting information in a way that influences how the audience interprets and understands it. It involves selecting certain aspects of a communication message and making them more salient ( or prominent, while downplaying others. This can shape the audience's perception, attitudes, and decision-making processes by setting up the 'frame' within which they interpret the information. \n\nSo, when you present persuasive communication and audiences interpret it to assimilate it into their existing understanding, this entire process is framed by your presentation strategy and the way the message is structured and communicated."
