Overfitting indeed occurs more frequently with a smaller set of training data because there's less information for the model to learn the underlying patterns rather than memorizing the noise in the data. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n\nStatement 2 is false. The hypothesis space refers to the set of all possible models that can be selected by the learning algorithm. A smaller hypothesis space typically means that the model is less complex and has fewer parameters. This usually reduces the risk of overfitting as the model is less likely to fit the noise in the training data. Thus, a smaller hypothesis space generally leads to better generalization on unseen data."
