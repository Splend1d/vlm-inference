It is particularly adept at evaluating individuals who may have difficulty expressing themselves verbally due to language deficits, cognitive impairments, or other communicative challenges.\n\nGiven the options provided, the scale would be most useful for measuring the intelligence of:\n\nC. children with hearing impairments.\n\nThis is because the Leiter scale relies on visual stimuli and does not require verbal responses, making it suitable for assessing intelligence in individuals who may have difficulties with language-based assessments. However, it's important to note that the scale can be used effectively for a wide range of populations, including those with visual impairments, as well as for assessing adults with varying levels of cognitive ability, including those who are mentally retarded, though specific adaptations or considerations might be necessary for such populations. For children under the age of two, traditional non-verbal IQ tests like the Leiter might not be appropriate due to developmental stages and the need for more age-appropriate assessments."
