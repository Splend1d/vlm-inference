Lignin provides structural support, allowing plants to grow tall. \n\nLignin is a major component of plant cell walls and provides rigidity and strength to plant tissues. This allows plants to grow upright and maintain their structure against the forces of gravity and wind, which is crucial for their survival and evolutionary success in terrestrial environments."
