This statement is true. The order of the internal direct product \\(G \\times H\\) is indeed \\(|G||H|\\), assuming both \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) are are finite groups. This is because each element in \\(G \\times H\\) can be uniquely represented as an ordered pair \\((g, h)\\) where \\(g \\in G\\) and \\(h \\in H\\), and since \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) are disjoint except for the identity elements under the internal direct product, the total number of unique elements in \\(G \\times H\\) is simply the product of the number of elements in \\(G\\) and \\(H\\).\n\nStatement 2: The statement proposes that if \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\), then the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n\\) has a subgroup isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s\\). This statement is false. While it's true that there can be subgroups of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n\\) with orders related to \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) under certain conditions, it does not necessarily mean that a subgroup isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s\\) will always exist within \\(\\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n\\). For instance, if \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) have a common divisor greater than 1, then a subgroup isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s\\) might exist, but this depends on the specific values of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(r\\), and \\(s\\), and not solely on divisibility conditions. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. False, True** for the statements provided. However, it's important to note that the explanation for Statement 2 could be more nuanced depending on the precise conditions under which such an isomorphic subgroup would or would not exist."
