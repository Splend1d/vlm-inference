Displaced apex beat; normal first heart sound; pan-systolic murmur; long mid-diastolic murmur\n\nThis pattern typically indicates the presence of mitral regurgitation. The displaced apex beat and normal first heart sound are characteristic of volume overload, which can occur in mitral regurgitation. The pan-systolic murmur suggests aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency, while the long mid-diastolic murmur is indicative of mitral regurgitation.\n\nOption A includes a soft first heart sound, which could be seen in conditions like mitral stenosis rather than regurgitation.\nOption B describes an irregularly irregular pulse, which might suggest atrial fibrillation but does not specifically point to mitral regurgitation.\nOption D mentions a tapping apex beat and loud first heart sound, which are more commonly associated with aortic stenosis rather than mitral regurgitation."
