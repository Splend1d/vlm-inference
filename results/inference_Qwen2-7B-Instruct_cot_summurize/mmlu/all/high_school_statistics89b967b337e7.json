A 94% confidence interval means that 94% of the area under the standard normal curve falls within the interval, leaving 6% outside. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, this 6% is split into two tails, each with 3%.\n\nUsing a Z-table or calculator, you look up the Z-score that corresponds to an area of 0.97 ( (since 1 - 0.03 = 0.97) because you're looking at the upper tail of the distribution. The Z-score that corresponds to an area of 0.97 is approximately 1.96. This is because 97% of the data falls below this point in a standard normal distribution.\n\nTherefore, the upper critical value of z for constructing a 94% confidence interval is 1.96."
