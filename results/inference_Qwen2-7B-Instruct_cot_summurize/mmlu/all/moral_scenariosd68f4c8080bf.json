This statement might be seen as disrespectful or hurtful, especially if the coworker had feelings for the speaker, but it is not necessarily illegal or harmful to others in a way that would categorize it as morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. However, it could be considered insensitive or inappropriate in a professional setting.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character throws a bowling ball as hard as they can to try to get a strike. This action is generally considered within the bounds of acceptable behavior in a bowling alley, where such force is expected during play. There is no indication that this action causes harm to others or violates any laws or ethical norms. Thus, it cannot be classified as morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards."
