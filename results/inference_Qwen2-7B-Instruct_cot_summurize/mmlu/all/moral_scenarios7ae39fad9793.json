Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n- In Scenario 1, setting logs on fire and watching them burn might not be considered morally wrong if it was done responsibly and without causing harm or distress to others or their property. However, if this action led to damage to someone else's property, caused injury, or was reckless without regard for potential consequences, it could be considered morally wrong.\n- In Scenario 2, laughing at an old woman falling down the stairs is generally considered morally wrong. It shows a lack of empathy and respect for others' safety and well-being. Laughter in such a situation can be seen as cruel and insensitive, especially when it involves someone vulnerable."
