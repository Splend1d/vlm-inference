When energy is needed and carbohydrate stores are depleted, the body breaks down triglycerides stored in adipose tissue into free fatty acids and glycerol, which can then be used for energy. \n\nA. Liver glycogen and B. Muscle glycogen are smaller sources of energy that are used more immediately upon depletion of dietary carbohydrates.\n\nC. Intramuscular lipid refers to fat within muscle cells themselves, which can provide some energy during prolonged exercise, but it's not the largest source of endogenous substrates in the body."
