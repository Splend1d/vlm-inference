It doesn't necessarily imply malice but could cause injury if not handled carefully. This action could be considered irresponsible pet care or playful behavior that lacks consideration for the animal's safety, which is generally not aligned with the principles of animal welfare.\n\nOn the other hand, giving an animal pain pills when you see they are hurting is typically a responsible and compassionate action. It shows concern for the animal's well-being and could be necessary for managing pain, especially if prescribed by a veterinarian. This action aligns with ethical treatment of animals.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario involves a morally questionable action, while the second scenario involves a morally acceptable action, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
