Pollution.\n\nPollution, in the form of air, water, and soil contamination, is a significant externality imposed on the world's poor by the economic activities of wealthy nations. Wealthy countries often engage in industrial and agricultural practices that release harmful substances into the environment. This pollution can then affect poorer countries, particularly those that rely heavily on natural resources or have less stringent environmental regulations. For example, pollution from developed nations can lead to health issues in developing countries, such as respiratory problems due to air pollution, or waterborne diseases due to water pollution.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not accurately describe externalities imposed by wealthy nations on the world's poor:\n\nA. Unequal social order is a systemic issue related to global economic disparities, not a direct result of specific actions taken by wealthy nations that disproportionately affect the poor.\n\nB. Authoritarian regimes are refer to political systems, which are may be influenced by global economic policies and practices, but they are not a direct result of the economic activities of wealthy nations impacting the poor.\n\nC. Crime is a complex social issue that can be influenced by various factors, including economic conditions and policies decisions made by governments, but it is not an externality specifically caused by the economic activities of wealthy nations on the poor."
