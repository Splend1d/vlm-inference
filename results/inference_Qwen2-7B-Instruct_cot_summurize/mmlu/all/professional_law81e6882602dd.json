In this case, the parrot's statements (\"George don't.\") would likely be considered hearsay because they are beinging presented as evidence of who the murderer is, rather than the speaker's own knowledge or observation. However, the parrot's statements might not technically qualify as hearsay if it's argued that the bird's actions (hovering over the body and repeating the phrase - are an excited utterance, an exception to the hearsay rule that allows for spontaneous statements made under stress or excitement. \n\nThe other options are also potential issues, but in the context provided, A ( hearsay is the most directly applicable and compelling objection:\n\nB. Irrelevance: This would be a less strong argument since the bird's actions could potentially suggest something about the defendant's presence at the scene or relationship with the victim, even though the bird's words themselves are hearsay.\n\nC. Opinion testimony: This could apply if the witness's testimony included the interpretation of the parrot's behavior, but the direct repetition of the parrot's words is more relevant to this issue.\n\nD. Self-serving: This refers to a situation where a witness's testimony benefits them personally, which doesn't seem to be the case here unless there's additional information suggesting the witness has a motive to lie for personal gain. Without such information, it's not the primary objection to the testimony."
