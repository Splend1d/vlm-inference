He is approached by a graduate student, Marla M., age 36, who asks him if he\u2019d like to attend a baseball game on Friday night. Dr. Carlson is divorced and finds Marla to be a very attractive woman. In terms of ethical guidelines, if Dr. Carlson accepts Marla\u2019s invitation, he will be:\n\nA. clearly violating ethical guidelines.\nB. acting ethically since he is not the one who initiated a potential relationship.\nC. acting ethically as long as Marla is a student in a department other than the psychology department and will not be taking any classes in the psychology department.\nD. acting ethically as long as he does not become sexually involved with Marla until she is no longer affiliated with the university.\n"

Clearly violating ethical guidelines.\n\nIn the context of professional psychology, especially when there's a power dynamic involved such as that between a professor and a graduate student, maintaining clear boundaries is crucial to avoid conflicts of interest and potential exploitation. Accepting an invitation from a student under these circumstances could potentially compromise the objectivity and integrity of the professional relationship, setting a precedent for preferential treatment based on personal relationships rather than professional standards. This situation also raises concerns about undue influence, where the professor might inadvertently or intentionally affect the student's academic opportunities or evaluations based on their personal interactions outside of the professional setting. Therefore, accepting the invitation would likely violate ethical guidelines established by professional organizations standards, such as those set by the American Psychological Association ( (APA), which emphasize the importance of avoiding dual relationships that could impair professional judgment or create a risk of harm to the client/student."
