The decline in vision with advanced age.\n\nIt is a common condition that occurs as people age, typically starting around middle age (around 40-45 years old. As presbyopia develops, an individual may notice that they have difficulty seeing objects up close, such as reading materials or small print. This happens because the lens of the eye becomes less flexible, making it harder to focus on near objects. The condition does not affect the ability to see distant objects. Corrective lenses, such as bifocals or reading glasses, can help manage the symptoms of presbyopia."
