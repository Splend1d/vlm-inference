It sends signals to the spinal cord and other parts of the central nervous system, which then activate the appropriate muscles. Since the motor cortex is organized in a way that corresponds to the body's layout (with the left side controlling the right side and vice versa), it results in the contraction of muscles on the opposite side of the body from the area being stimulated."
