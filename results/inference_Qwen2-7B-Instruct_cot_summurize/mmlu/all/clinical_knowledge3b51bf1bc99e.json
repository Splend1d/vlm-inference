Therefore, statement A is not true. \n\nThe presence of telangiectasia (visible dilated blood vessels on the skin's surface) can be an early sign of systemic sclerosis, but it's not specific enough to clinch the diagnosis on its own. Other conditions can also cause telangiectasias. So, statement B is not entirely accurate.\n\nArachnodactyly, which refers to long, thin fingers resembling those of a spider, is not a feature of systemic sclerosis. This condition is more characteristic of Marfan syndrome, another connective tissue disorder. So, statement C is incorrect.\n\nPatients with systemic sclerosis often present with symptoms like Raynaud's phenomenon, skin changes, joint pain, and various internal organ involvement. Some may develop a \"beaked\" nose, referred to as rhinophyma, due to skin thickening and inflammation over time, but it's not a defining characteristic for all patients. The term \"waxy skin\" isn't typically used to describe the skin changes in systemic sclerosis. Therefore, statement D is not universally true either.\n\nIn summary, none of the statements provided accurately describes a true characteristic of systemic sclerosis."
