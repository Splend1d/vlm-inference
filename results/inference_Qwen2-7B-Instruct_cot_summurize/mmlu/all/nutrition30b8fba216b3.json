The Institute of Medicine (IOM) provides guidelines for appropriate weight gain based on a woman's prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), but these recommendations can evolve as new evidence emerges.\n\nB. Both inadequate and excessive weight gain during pregnancy have been associated with poorer maternal and infant health outcomes. Inadequate weight gain may lead to low birth weight, which is associated with an increased risk of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Excessive weight gain can contribute to gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and the risk of cesarean delivery, among other complications.\n\nC. Excessive maternal weight gain during pregnancy has been linked to obesity in the offspring. This is often referred to as the \"fetal origins of adult disease\" hypothesis, which suggests that the environment in the womb can influence the development of health conditions later in life, including obesity.\n\nTherefore, all of the statements provided are accurately reflect current understanding and research in the field of obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine."
