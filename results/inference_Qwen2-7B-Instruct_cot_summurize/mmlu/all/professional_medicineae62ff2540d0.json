Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. \n\nHypogonadotropic hypogonadism refers to a condition where the pituitary gland does not produce enough gonadotropins ( hormones that stimulate the sex glands ( to produce normal levels of estrogen and testosterone. This can lead to irregular or absent menstrual cycles, which in turn may result in amenorrhea.\n\nThe patient's history, including her recent weight loss and current low body mass index (BMI), as well as her physical examination findings of low heart rate and low blood pressure, suggest potential secondary causes such as anorexia nervosa or other eating disorders. These conditions often disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\nHyperthyroidism ( A. could potentially affect menstrual cycles but is less likely given the absence of hyperthyroid symptoms and signs such as weight loss, rapid heartbeat, and heat intolerance.\n\nHypothyroidism C. would typically be associated with delayed menarche rather than premature cessation of menstruation, as the patient had already experienced menarche at age 12.\n\nPolycystic Ovarian Syndrome ( D. is characterized by menstrual irregularities, obesity, hirsutism, and acne, which do not fit the patient's presentation."
