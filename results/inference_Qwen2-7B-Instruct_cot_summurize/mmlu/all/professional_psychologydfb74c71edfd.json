In this scenario, the colleague has engaged in a dual relationship with a client that could potentially harm the therapeutic process and violate ethical guidelines.\n\nThe correct course of action would be to:\n\nC. Discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take. This allows for an opportunity for the colleague to reflect on the situation, consider any necessary steps, and potentially rectify any ethical breaches before taking formal action.\n\nIt's important to approach this conversation with empathy and professionalism, emphasizing the need for adherence to ethical standards in psychology. If the colleague does not take appropriate action or if the situation poses an immediate risk to the client, then proceeding to inform the ethics committee might be necessary, but this decision should ideally be made after consulting with supervisors, colleagues, or ethics experts to ensure the best course of action is taken while respecting all parties involved."
