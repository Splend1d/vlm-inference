This was a significant step in the process of Henry breaking away from the Catholic Church and establishing the Church of England under his own authority. The act declared Henry to be \"the only Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England.\"\n\nFrom the passage and its historical context, we can infer that the Act was not specifically designed:\n\nA. To prevent the spread of Protestantism in England. While it did pave the way for further Protestant reforms, its primary purpose was to address ecclesiastical issues within the Church of England.\n\nB. To solve Henry VIII's financial problems. Although religious reforms could lead to changes in the financial structure of the church, the immediate motivation seems to be more about royal authority than fiscal concerns.\n\nC. To legitimize Henry VIII's only heir. This act did not directly relate to the succession or legitimacy of Henry's children. It was more about establishing the king's authority over the church, which indirectly affected the succession as it influenced the religious policies of his reign.\n\nD. To ally England with the Holy Roman Emperor. There is no evidence suggesting that the Act of Supremacy was aimed at forging a political alliance with the Holy Roman Empire. Instead, it was focused on internal religious matters and consolidating power within England.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate inference from the passage and historical context is that the Act of Supremacy was an attempt to:\n\nC. Legitimize Henry VIII's authority over the Church of England, which had implications for the succession and religious policies during his reign."
