Collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members.\n\nCollective rights refer to rights that are attributed to a group or community rather than to individual members of that group. These rights can include cultural, political, economic, and social rights that are essential for the survival, development, and flourishing of the group as a whole. For example, the right to self-determination, which allows a nation to decide its own political status and pursue its own economic, social, and cultural development, is considered a collective right. Similarly, the right to education and healthcare can also be seen as collective rights, as they are essential for the well-being of the group and its members."
