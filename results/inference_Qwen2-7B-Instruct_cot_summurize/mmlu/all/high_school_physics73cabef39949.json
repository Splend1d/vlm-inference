                    "text": "The correct answer is D. If the force of gravity between the Moon and the Earth were to stop, the Moon would stop being pulled towards the Earth by that force. This means it would no longer orbit or revolve around the Earth. However, the Moon's rotation on its axis would continue due to its own internal forces and previous angular momentum unless acted upon by external forces such as friction from the Earth's atmosphere or tidal interactions with the Earth.\n\nTo summarize:\n- A: Incorrect because stopping the gravitational force would also stop the Moon's orbit around the Earth.\n- B: Incorrect because the Moon's rotation depends on its own internal forces and would not be immediately affected by a cessation of gravitational pull from the Earth.\n- C: Incorrect for the same reason as B; stopping the gravitational force would not stop the Moon's rotation without an external force causing this to happen.\n- D: Correct because removing the gravitational force removes both the Moon's orbital motion around the Earth and its rotational motion on its axis if these motions were not already sustained by other means.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the Moon would stop both rotating on its axis and revolving around the Earth."
