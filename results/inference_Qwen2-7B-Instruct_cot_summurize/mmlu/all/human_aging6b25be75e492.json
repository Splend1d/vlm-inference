Suicide: Men are also more likely to die by suicide compared to women.\n\nA and D: The risk of dying from septicemia or influenza is typically higher for older adults regardless of gender, but there might not be a significant difference between men and women in terms of mortality rates due to these conditions. \n\nIt's important to note that these are general trends and individual risk factors can vary greatly from person to person."
