                    "text": "Marquis's argument against abortion can be quite complex and multifaceted, but based on your options, let's analyze them:\n\nA. Showing that a fetus is a person with full moral rights, including the right to life: This argument posits that once a fetus reaches a certain level of development, it should be considered a full moral agent with rights equivalent to those of an existing adult human. This perspective often relies on philosophical or religious grounds to argue for the intrinsic value of all human life.\n\nB. Appealing to the fact that a fetus is biologically human and arguing that it is presumptively morally wrong to kill biologically human beings: This argument hinges on the biological status of the fetus as a human being from the moment of conception. It suggests that because the fetus has the same genetic material and potential for human characteristics as any other human being, it is morally wrong to terminate its life.\n\nC. Showing that a fetus is sentient and that it is morally wrong to harm and kill sentient creatures: This argument focuses on the capacity of the fetus to experience pain or suffering (sentience. It argues that once the fetus reaches a point where it can feel pain, it becomes morally impermissible to cause it harm or death, given our ethical duty to avoid causing unnecessary suffering to sentient beings.\n\nD. None of the above: This option implies that Marquis does not base his argument solely on one of these points. Marquis's views on abortion could incorporate elements of all these arguments or others, depending on the specific ethical framework he uses. For example, he might argue from a deontological perspective (where actions are themselves are right or wrong regardless of their consequences ( focusing on the inherent rights of the fetus, or from a consequentialist perspective, evaluating the outcomes of abortion in terms of overall happiness or well-being.\n\nIt's important to note that different individuals and groups may draw upon various combinations of these arguments or other ethical considerations when discussing the morality of abortion."
