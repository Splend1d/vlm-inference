Because all of the seats were occupied, the rider stood in the subway car and grabbed a pole to secure his balance. As the subway car was proceeding downtown, the rider glanced at a girl standing next to him. Suddenly, the subway car made an unexpected stop. The rider momentarily lost his balance and grabbed the girl around the waist (to avoid falling). Once the rider regained his balance, he removed his hands from the girl's waist and grasped the pole again. In a civil action instituted by the girl against the rider, he will most likely be found\n\nA. liable for battery.\nB. liable, because the rider believed that the girl consented to the contact under the circumstances.\nC. not liable, because the rider's conduct was socially acceptable under the circumstances.\nD. not liable, because the girl was not harmed by the contact.\n"

Given the context, where both individuals were standing and the rider had no intention of causing harm or making unwanted contact, it is reasonable to conclude that the act was socially acceptable under the circumstances. Therefore, the rider would most likely not be held liable for battery, which requires the intent to cause harmful or offensive contact without consent."
