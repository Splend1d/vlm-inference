                    "text": "Entropy typically increases when a reaction leads to an increase in the number of moles of gaseous species and/or an increase in disorder. Conversely, entropy decreases when there's a decrease in the number of moles of gas or a more ordered state is formed.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \u2192 NaCl(aq) + H2O(l) - This is a neutralization reaction between an acid and a base resulting in a salt and water. There's no change in the number of gaseous molecules, so entropy doesn't change significantly.\n\nB. CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l) - Here, one molecule of gas (CH4(g) reacts with two molecules of gas (O2(g) to produce one molecule of gas (CO2(g) and two molecules of liquid H2O(l). The total number of gas molecules decreases, which would result in a decrease in entropy.\n\nC. C(s) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) - In this combustion reaction, solid carbon reacts with oxygen gas to form carbon dioxide gas. The number of gas molecules increases from 1 to 1, but the overall entropy change depends on the energy released during the reaction. Since the formation of gas is usually associated with increased entropy, we might expect entropy to increase, but it also depends on the specifics of the reaction.\n\nD. 2 SO2(g) + O2(g) \u2192 2 SO3(g) - This is a synthesis reaction where sulfur dioxide and oxygen react to form sulfur trioxide. The number of gas molecules remains the same, but since more complex molecules are formed, the overall entropy typically decreases due to the increased molecular complexity.\n\nComparing these options, option B ( CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l), has the greatest decrease in entropy because it results in the least amount of gas molecules overall, going from three to one."
