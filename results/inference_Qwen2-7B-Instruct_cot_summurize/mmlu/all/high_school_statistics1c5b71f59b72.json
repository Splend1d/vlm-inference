The registrar decides to take a random sample of 150 students from the current directory of students and determine the number of students with the correct addresses on record. He then uses this information to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements must be true?\n\nA. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\nB. Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.\nC. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.\nD. The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.\n"

The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval constructed 95 percent of the time.\n\nThis means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, each time constructing a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of students with the correct address, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true proportion. \n\nLet's clarify why the other options are not necessarily true:\n- A. This statement is not guaranteed to be true because the confidence interval gives us an estimated range for the true proportion, not the exact value.\n- B. This statement is incorrect because the confidence interval is not a statement about the proportion of all students in the university; it is an estimate of where the true population proportion lies based on the sample data.\n- D. This statement is not accurate because the confidence interval pertains to the true population proportion, not the sample proportion. The sample proportion is used to calculate the confidence interval, but it is not itself contained within the interval in the sense described."
