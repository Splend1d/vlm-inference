This will give us the nullity of the matrix, which corresponds to the dimension of the null space.\n\nLet's start by finding the RREF of matrix A:\n\nMatrix A:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & -9 \\\\\n-6 & -4 & 18 \\\\\n12 & 8 & -36\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 3 to have a non-zero element at the top-left corner.\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n12 & 8 & -36 \\\\\n-6 & -4 & 18 \\\\\n3 & 2 & -9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Add \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) times Row 1 to Row 2 to eliminate the negative element in Row 2's first column.\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n12 & 8 & -36 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 2 & -9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nStep 3: Subtract \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) times Row 1 from Row 3 to eliminate the element in Row 3's first column.\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n12 & 8 & -36 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\]\n\\]\n\nThe matrix is now in row echelon form. We can see that there are two rows of zeros, indicating that this matrix has only one pivot (in the first column. Therefore, there are no free variables, and the null space consists only of the zero vector.\n\nHence, the dimension of the null space (nullity(A) is 0.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. 0**."
