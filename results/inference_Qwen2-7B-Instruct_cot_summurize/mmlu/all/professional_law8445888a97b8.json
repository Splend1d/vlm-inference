A hooded sweatshirt and bandana concealed the rest of his face. A few days later, while the victim waited to be interviewed, she observed the defendant being escorted through the courthouse, in jail clothing, and restrained by handcuffs and leg irons. She identified him as the perpetrator shortly thereafter. Will the court allow that identification into evidence?\n\nA. No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.\nB. No, because prior statements of identification are considered hearsay and never allowed into evidence.\nC. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.\nD. Yes, because the witness' recognition of someone is all that is needed; the reliability or credibility of it is subject to cross examination.\n"

Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.\n\nThe admissibility of eyewitness identifications is typically determined by whether the identification process was fair and reliable, rather than solely on the basis of how many physical features were seen by the witness. In this case, the victim was able to identify the perpetrator based on the distinctive feature of his eyes, which suggests a level of reliability that would likely be considered sufficient for the court. However, it's important to note that the specifics of eyewitness identification procedures can vary significantly depending on the legal system and jurisdiction, so this response is given under general principles and may not directly apply in every situation."
