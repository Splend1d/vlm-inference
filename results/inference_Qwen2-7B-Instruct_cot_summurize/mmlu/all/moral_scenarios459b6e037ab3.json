Not wrong, Wrong. \n\nIn Scenario 1, allowing a drunk friend to drive home could be considered morally wrong because it involves knowingly putting others at risk of harm due to the friend's impaired state. This action potentially endangers not only the friend but also other road users, which is against the moral principle of not causing harm or risking harm to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cheating by reciting answers during a test is generally considered morally wrong as it violates academic integrity and the fair assessment of knowledge and skills. It undermines the trust between students and educators and can lead to unfair advantages for the cheater over those who have earned their grades honestly.\n\nTherefore, while both scenarios involve actions that might be seen as morally questionable in different contexts, the clear-cut morally wrong scenario is when the main character allows their friend to drive while drunk."
