Someone repeatedly buzzes his apartment ringer outside the building, but he doesn't answer it because he is very tired and wants to sleep. Later he hears the door to his apartment being kicked in and he is immediately accosted by a man with a gun, who waves the gun at him and says, \"You are getting me your cash or else.\" The man opens his safe and turns over the money. The perpetrator absconds with the money but is picked up by the police a few minutes later. What common law crimes has the perpetrator probably committed?\n\nA. Burglary and attempted murder.\nB.

Robbery and burglary.\n\nRobbery typically involves taking property from a person's immediate possession through force or threat of force. In this scenario, the use of a gun constitutes an element of force or fear, which is central to the definition of robbery.\n\nBurglary involves entering a dwelling unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime inside. In this case, the perpetrator entered the apartment (with the intent to take money, which is a crime inside the dwelling.\n\nAlthough there was an attempt to harm the man, resulting in an \"else\" clause, this does not necessarily constitute an attempted murder charge. An attempted murder requires an intention to cause death, and the specific circumstances may not have included a clear intention to kill rather than simply threaten or intimidate for the purpose of taking property. Therefore, while the threat of violence is present, it might not meet the legal threshold for an attempted murder charge without additional evidence suggesting such an intent. \n\nSo, based on the information provided, the most accurate answer would be D: Robbery and burglary."
