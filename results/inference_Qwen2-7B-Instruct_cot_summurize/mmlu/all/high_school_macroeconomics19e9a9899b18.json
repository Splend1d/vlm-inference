In this case, since the price level has risen, nominal GDP would have increased.\n\nHowever, if production of goods and services has remained constant, it means that real GDP has not changed. Real GDP measures the value of all finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period without being adjusted for price changes. Since production is constant, real GDP does not change.\n\nSo, based on the given information:\n\n- Nominal GDP increased\n- Real GDP did not change ("
