Theoretically, in a vacuum (which can be considered as air under certain conditions - such as at high altitudes or in extremely dry environments - the dielectric constant is exactly 1. In practical applications, however, the value is often considered to be around 1 due to the presence of water vapor and other trace gases in the air, which slightly increase the effective dielectric constant."
