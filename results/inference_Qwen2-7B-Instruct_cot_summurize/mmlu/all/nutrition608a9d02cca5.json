Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6.\n\nTransamination is a biochemical process that involves the transfer of an amino group (from one amino acid to a keto acid, forming a new amino acid and pyruvate. This process requires enzymes known as transaminases, which often utilize a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6 ( also known as pyridoxal phosphate or PLP. \n\nA. This statement is incorrect because both essential and non-essential amino acids can undergo transamination.\nB. This statement is incorrect because transamination is reversible in some cases; it's not necessarily an irreversible reaction in amino acid catabolism.\nC. This statement is incorrect because transaminases do not require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B12; they use a different coenzyme."
