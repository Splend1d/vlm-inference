This kind of fossil accumulation allows researchers to analyze variations in morphology, size, and other physical characteristics among the individuals, which can provide insights into the genetic diversity, growth patterns, and potential behavioral traits of the species. It is not suggesting that the individuals represent different species ( (eliminating option A), nor does it indicate evidence of interbreeding between two different species (eliminating option C). Furthermore, given the large number of remains, it would actually provide substantial evidence for examining diversity within the species ( rejecting option D)."
