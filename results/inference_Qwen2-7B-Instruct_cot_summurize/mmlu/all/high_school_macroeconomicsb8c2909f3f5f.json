Decrease spending and Sell government securities.\n\nExplanation:\n\nFiscal Policy:\n- Decrease spending: This action reduces the amount of money the government puts into circulation, which can help curb inflation by decreasing aggregate demand.\n- Sell government securities: When the central bank sells government securities, it withdraws money from the economy, reducing the money supply and helping to control inflation.\n\nMonetary Policy:\n- Increase the reserve ratio: This action requires banks to hold more money as reserves, which reduces the amount of money available for lending and spending in the economy. This can help decrease inflationary pressures.\n- Buy government securities: This action increases the money supply, which can lead to higher inflation if not managed properly. It's not an effective way to reduce inflation in this scenario.\n\nThus, option C combines elements of both fiscal and monetary policy that are likely to effectively reduce the threat of inflation."
