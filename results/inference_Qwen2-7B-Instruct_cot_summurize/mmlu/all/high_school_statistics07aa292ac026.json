This is the probability of getting an oil change minus the probability of getting both services:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Oil Change} \\cap \\text{Not Tire Replacements}) = P(\\text{Oil Change}) - P(\\text{Both}) \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{Oil Change} \\cap \\text{Not Tire Replacements}) = 0.6 - 0.1 = 0.5 \\]\n\nNow, we plug this into our conditional probability formula:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Not Tire Replacements} | \\text{Oil Change}) = \\frac{0.5}{0.6} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 0.5**."
