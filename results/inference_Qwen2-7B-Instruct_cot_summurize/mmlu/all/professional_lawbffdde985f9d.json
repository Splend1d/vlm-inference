The first item the man put up for bid was an antique Baldwin grand piano. The man announced that the bidding would be \"without reserve\" and said, \"What's the opening bid on this beautiful Baldwin grand piano?\" A woman opened the bidding with $100. The man then commented, \"This piano is worth at least $5,000. What other bids am I offered?\" When the man did not receive any other bids, he informed the woman that he would not accept $100 and was removing the piano from the sale.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the seller cannot withdraw an item before it is sold. The term \"without reserve\" typically means that the seller has given up their right to reject a bid, but it does not prevent them from removing an item from the auction before the sale is concluded. In this case, the man had the right to remove the piano from the sale if he did not find the opening bid acceptable. Therefore, the woman may not have a strong legal argument for breach of contract based solely on the fact that the auction was advertised as \"without reserve.\""
