The gravitational force ( \\(F\\) between two masses can be described by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the masses of the two objects,\n- \\(r\\) is the distance between their centers.\n\nHowever, when comparing gravitational forces on different celestial bodies, it's often simpler to use the relationship that the gravitational acceleration \\(g\\) is proportional to the mass of the planet divided by the square of its radius:\n\n\\[ g \\propto \\frac{M}{R^2} \\]\n\nGiven that the moon has 1/80th the mass of the Earth (\\(M_{moon} = \\frac{1}{80} M_{Earth}\\)) and 1/4th the radius (\\(R_{moon} = \\frac{1}{4} R_{Earth}\\)), we can calculate the gravitational acceleration on the moon relative to that on the Earth as follows:\n\n\\[ g_{moon} = \\frac{M_{moon}}{R_{moon}^2} g_{Earth} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{80} M_{Earth}}{(\\frac{1}{4} R_{Earth})^2} g_{Earth} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{80}}{\\frac{1}{16}} g_{Earth} = \\frac{1}{5} g_{Earth} \\]\n\nThis means the gravitational acceleration on the moon is 1/5th of that on Earth.\n\nNow, given that the weight of the box on Earth is \\(80\\,N\\), which is \\(mg_{Earth}\\) where \\(m\\) is the mass of the box, we can find its weight on the moon using the relation for gravitational acceleration:\n\n\\[ W_{moon} = mg_{moon} = \\frac{1}{5} mg_{Earth} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 80\\,N = 16\\,N \\]\n\nTherefore, the weight of the box on the moon is \\(16\\,N\\), making the correct answer:\n\nC. 16 N"
