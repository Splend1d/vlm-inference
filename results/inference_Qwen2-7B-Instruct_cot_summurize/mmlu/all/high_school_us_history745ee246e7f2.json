The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business.\"\n\u2014The New York Times, October 15, 1905\nThe scenario described in the passage above is most directly reflected in the ideas of which of the following?\n\nA. Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nB. Equal Rights Amendment.\nC. Pure Food and Drug Act.\nD. Interstate Commerce Act.\n"

Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nThe passage discusses how economic necessity has led to significant changes in women's roles and societal norms, particularly in terms of their participation in the workforce and dining out. This reflects the broader push for gender equality and rights that was part of the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA), which sought to ensure equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex. The other options listed do not directly address the transformation of gender roles and societal expectations that the passage highlights:\n\n- A. Civil Rights Act of 1964: This law addressed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, but it did not specifically target gender roles or societal norms in the context described in the passage.\n- C. Pure Food and Drug Act: This legislation aimed to protect consumers from harmful food and drug products, not to influence gender roles or societal norms related to women's employment or dining habits.\n- D. Interstate Commerce Act: This act regulated trade between states and did not directly address gender roles, societal norms, or women's participation in the workforce or dining culture."
