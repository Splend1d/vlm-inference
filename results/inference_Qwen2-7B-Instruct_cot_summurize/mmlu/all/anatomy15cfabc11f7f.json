This involves making an incision through the cricothyroid membrane (which separates the vocal cords and is located at the level of the cricoid cartilage, the lowest ring of the trachea (- the windpipe). By piercing this membrane inferior to the cricoid cartilage, it creates an opening that allows air to pass through to the lungs, thus providing a temporary airway bypass until more definitive measures can be taken."
