According to rule consequentialism, the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on whether that action is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule whose consequences are the best. In other words, it evaluates actions based on their outcomes and the overall good they produce. \n\nLet's briefly look at why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. This option refers to legal rules, which are do not necessarily determine the moral rightness or wrongness of an action. Legal rules are about what is legally permissible or required within a given jurisdiction, but they do not necessarily align with ethical considerations.\n\nB. Logical consistency behind motives of actions of the same type does not necessarily determine the morality of an action. Consequentialism focuses on the outcomes of actions, not just the consistency of motives.\n\nC. Whether a virtuous person would endorse a rule is subjective and can vary from person to person. What one person considers virtuous might differ from another's standards, making this approach too personal and subjective for determining the rightness or wrongness of actions universally.\n\nTherefore, rule consequentialism evaluates actions based on the best possible outcomes they produce, considering the rules that lead to those outcomes."
