Possible effects on the entity\u2019s financial statements.\n\nWhen an auditor has substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern, it primarily raises concerns about the reliability and validity of the financial statements. This is because the going concern assumption (which underlies the preparation of financial statements according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP or IFRS) assumes that the company will operate in the foreseeable future and will not be liquidated or cease operations in the near term. If there is doubt about this assumption, it may impact the company's ability to meet its obligations and could lead to misstatements in the financial statements.\n\nThe auditor would need to evaluate whether management's plans to mitigate the doubt are reasonable and feasible, and if not, consider the implications for the audit opinion. The auditor might also need to perform additional procedures to gather evidence about the viability of the entity, such as reviewing management's forecasts, assessing the entity's access to financing, and considering other factors that could influence the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThus, option D accurately reflects the auditor's primary concern in this scenario."
