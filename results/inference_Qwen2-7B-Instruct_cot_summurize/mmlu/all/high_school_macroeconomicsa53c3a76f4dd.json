An increase in government spending with no change in taxes\n\nWhen the economy is operating at full employment, there's already minimal unemployment, meaning that most resources are already being utilized. Thus, increasing government spending with no change in taxes would lead to a situation where demand exceeds supply in the economy. This imbalance can result in higher prices for goods and services, leading to inflation. \n\nAn increase in government spending directly increases aggregate demand without any offsetting increase in aggregate supply ( since taxes have not been raised. This imbalance between increased demand and unchanged or even reduced supply pressures pushes prices up, creating inflationary pressure in the short run."
