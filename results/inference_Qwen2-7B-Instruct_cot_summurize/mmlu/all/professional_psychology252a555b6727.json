Program evaluation uses unique quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect data. These methods are different from those that are used in traditional research.\nC. Traditional research and program evaluation have different aims. Traditional research aims to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation aims to collect information important for timely decision-making.\nD. Both traditional research and program evaluation may incorporate rigorous and systematic ways of collecting data in order to address their aims.\n"

Program evaluation uses unique quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect data. These methods are different from those that are used in traditional research.\n\nThis statement is not entirely accurate because both traditional research and program evaluation can utilize a variety of quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect data, depending on the specific goals and context of the study. While they might emphasize different aspects or have different priorities (e.g., program evaluation might focus more on practical outcomes and stakeholder perspectives), the choice of methodology is not inherently unique to one field over the other."
