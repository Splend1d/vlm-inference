This format organizes information in a way that allows readers to quickly understand the main point or story without needing to read the entire piece. The most important information is placed at the beginning, and subsequent paragraphs provide additional detail or context.\n\nHere's how the pyramid structure works:\n\n1. **Lead (**This is the first sentence or paragraph, which includes the most important details and the \"who, what, when, where, why, and how\" of the story.\n2. **Body.** Following the lead, the body provides more detailed information, expanding on the initial points.\n3. **Conclusion.** The conclusion summarizes the main points and provides a final perspective or action.\n\nIn contrast, personal writing, business writing, and promotional writing often use different structures depending on the purpose and audience of the text. For example, personal writing might follow a narrative arc, while business writing typically follows a logical argument or process flow."
