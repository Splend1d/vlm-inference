At the grand jury, a witness was asked the following question by the prosecuting attorney: \"Is it not true that 20 minutes after the accident you told the police that the defendant's car went through the red light?\" He answered, \"Yes. \"The defendant was also subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. The defendant was represented by counsel at the grand jury hearing. During questioning he was shown the witness's statement from his testimony. No objection was made to the introduction of the witness's statement. At the defendant's trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce into evidence the witness's statement from the deposition taken at the grand jury hearing. The defendant's attorney objects to this proffer of evidence. The objection at trial will be\n\nA. granted, because the statement is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. granted, because the questioning of the witness was leading.\nC. denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the witness's testimony was hearsay.\nD. denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the questioning of the witness was leading.\n"

Hearsay refers to out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. For the statement to be admissible in court, it would need to fall under one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule, such as for present sense impression, business records, or statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment. Without knowing the specifics of the case or whether these exceptions apply, it is reasonable to assume that the judge would not allow the statement as it stands, unless it fits within an exception. The fact that the defendant's attorney objected at the trial indicates that they are challenging the admissibility of the statement, which aligns with the option stating that the objection would be granted due to the statement being hearsay without an applicable exception."
