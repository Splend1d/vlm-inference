This income tax exempts taxable income earned by city residents outside of the state. Moreover, residents of the city were not taxed on their in-city earned income. A commuter who works in the city but is a resident of a neighboring state, challenges the constitutionality of this statute. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIV.\nD. The commerce clause.\n"

The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis clause requires that states treat similarly situated individuals equally under the law. In the context of taxation, it ensures that all taxpayers within a jurisdiction are treated alike, without discrimination based on factors such as residency status or where income is earned. The commuter's challenge likely focuses on the unequal treatment between residents (who are not taxed on their in-city earned income) and non-residents (who may face a tax on their city-derived income, potentially up to 3% regardless of the tax imposed by their state of residence.\n\nThe other options might also have some relevance in certain aspects of the case:\n\nB. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause could apply if the commuter argues that the tax law violates procedural fairness or substantive fairness in terms of how it was enacted or applied.\n\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV addresses states' obligations to each other's citizens, but it does not directly relate to taxation within a single state.\n\nD. The commerce clause deals with interstate and international commerce, which might be relevant if the tax disproportionately affects interstate commuters, but it's less likely to be the primary focus compared to the equal protection clause given the specifics of the question."
