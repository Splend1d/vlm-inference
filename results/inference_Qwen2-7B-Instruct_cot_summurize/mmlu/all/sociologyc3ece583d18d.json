The working class often lived in the inner cities, where industrial jobs were concentrated, while the middle classes tended to move outwards into suburban areas that developed around railway lines and other forms of public transport. This pattern of urban development was influenced by various factors including employment opportunities, housing availability, and access to amenities. As industrial jobs declined in the inner cities, many middle-class residents moved further out to new developments in the suburbs, creating distinct residential patterns based on class."
