Niche objectives\n\nWhen firms operate in a market dominated by a major competitor and have limited financial resources, they might find it challenging to compete on a large scale. In such scenarios, adopting niche objectives can be particularly effective. A niche strategy involves focusing on a specific, underserved segment of the market. This approach allows a company to carve out a unique position by offering specialized products or services tailored to the needs of this niche group. By doing so, the firm can differentiate itself from competitors, potentially avoid direct confrontation with the dominant player, and achieve sustainable growth within its chosen market segment. This strategy is resource-efficient and can lead to profitability, especially if the niche market has high demand and low competition."
