The Mesolithic period, which lasted from around 10,000 to 4,000 BCE, was saw the transition from the Paleolithic hunter-gatherer lifestyle to the Neolithic agricultural lifestyle. Key innovations during this time included the development of canoes for water navigation, the domestication of animals, and the widespread use of the bow and arrow in Europe. However, complex irrigation systems typically emerged much later, during the Neolithic or even the Bronze Age in some regions."
