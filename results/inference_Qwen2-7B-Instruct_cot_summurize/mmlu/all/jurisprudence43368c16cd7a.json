                    "text": "C. The majority held that the abortion law of Texas was unconstitutional because it violated a woman's right to privacy.\n\nRoe v. Wade, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court on January 22, 1973, established a constitutional right to abortion. The case arose from a Texas law that prohibited abortions except when necessary to save the life of the mother. The Supreme Court ruled that this law infringed upon a woman's constitutional right to privacy, as found in several amendments to the U.S. Constitution, including the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The court held that this right includes a woman's ability to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy, and that the state's interest in potential life does not outweigh a woman's liberty interest in personal autonomy until the fetus is viable outside the womb ( typically considered to be around the 24th week of pregnancy. \n\nThis decision sparked significant controversy and has been the subject of much political debate ever since. It also led to the passage of the landmark 1976 federal law, the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is endangered. \n\nIt's worth noting that the reasoning behind the Roe v. Wade decision has evolved over time, with some critics arguing that the original ruling was overly broad and that the court should have provided clearer guidelines for when states could regulate abortions. Additionally, opponents of abortion rights argue that the decision fails to consider the rights of the unborn child or the role of the father."
