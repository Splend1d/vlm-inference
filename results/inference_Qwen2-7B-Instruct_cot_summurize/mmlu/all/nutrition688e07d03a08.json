This phenotype typically includes:\n\nA. Reduced levels of HDL, a high proportion of small dense LDL and raised triglycerides\n\nThis means individuals with an ALP profile have lower levels of high-density lipoprotein ( (HDL, often referred to as \"good cholesterol\"), higher levels of low-density lipoprotein ( (LDL, often referred to as \"bad cholesterol\") in a form that is more harmful (smaller and denser particles), and higher triglyceride levels. All these factors contribute to an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease."
