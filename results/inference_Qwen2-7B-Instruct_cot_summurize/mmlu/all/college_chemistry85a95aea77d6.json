This might be due to rounding differences or slight variations in the values used. However, based on the calculation, the correct answer should be closer to 172 MHz rather than 2167 MHz. Given the choices provided, there seems to be an error in either the question or the options. Typically, for phosphorus-31 in a 20.0 T magnetic field, the expected NMR frequency would be around 172 MHz, not 2167 MHz."
