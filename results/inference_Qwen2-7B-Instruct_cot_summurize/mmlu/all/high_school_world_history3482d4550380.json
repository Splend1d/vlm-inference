The Columbian Exchange\n\nThis term refers to the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World ( (Europe, Africa, and Asia) after Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas in 1492. The passage you've cited highlights how European explorers and settlers introduced new crops and plants to the Americas, while American crops like maize, potatoes, and tomatoes were taken back to Europe, among other exchanges. This exchange significantly influenced agriculture, diet, and societies on both continents."
