Given that \\(a = 9\\) and the common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression is constant, we have:\n\n\\[b = a + d = 9 + d\\]\n\\[c = b + d = ( (9 + d) + d = 9 + 2d\\]\n\nwhere \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\nThe given condition states that after adding 2 to the second term and 20 to the third term, these three numbers form a geometric progression. So, we have:\n\n\\[a' = a + 2 = 11\\]\n\\[b' = b + 2 = 9 + d + 2 = 11 + d\\]\n\\[c' = c + 20 = 9 + 2d + 20 = 29 + 2d\\]\n\nFor these numbers to form a geometric progression, the square of the middle term must equal the product of the outer terms:\n\n\\[(b')^2 = a' \\cdot c'\\]\n\\[(11 + d)^2 = 11 \\cdot ( (29 + 2d)\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[121 + 22d + d^2 = 319 + 22d\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(22d\\) from both sides and rearranging gives:\n\n\\[d^2 = 319 - 121\\]\n\\[d^2 = 198\\]\n\nThus, \\(d = \\sqrt{198}\\) or \\(d = -\\sqrt{198}\\).\n\nNow, let's find the third term of the geometric progression using \\(c'\\):\n\n\\[c' = 29 + 2d\\]\n\nIf \\(d = \\sqrt{198}\\):\n\n\\[c' = 29 + 2\\sqrt{198} \\approx 29 + 2*14 = 29 + 28 = 57\\]\n\nIf \\(d = -\\sqrt{198}\\):\n\n\\[c' = 29 - 2\\sqrt{198} \\approx 29 - 28 = 1\\]\n\nAmong the options provided, the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is **1**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 1**."
