The price of crude oil, a raw material for gasoline, rises.\n\nExplanation: When the price of a raw material like crude oil increases, the cost of producing gasoline also increases. This leads to a decrease in the supply of gasoline at the current price level. As a result, to maintain equilibrium, the price of gasoline must rise to a new level where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. Therefore, an increase in the price of crude oil is most likely to increase the price of gasoline."
