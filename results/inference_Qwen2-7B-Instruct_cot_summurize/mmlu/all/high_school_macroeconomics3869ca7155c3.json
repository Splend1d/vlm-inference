This process leads to money creation through lending and spending in the economy.\n\nHere's how the calculation works:\n\n1. The initial deposit is $500.\n2. The bank keeps 10% of this deposit as reserves ($500 * 10% = $50).\n3. It can then lend out the remaining 90% ($500 - $50 = $450).\n4. When the loan is used for spending, it becomes a deposit at another bank.\n5. That bank will also keep 10% of this new deposit as reserves and lend out 90% of it, creating more money.\n6. This process repeats, with each new deposit leading to more lending and spending.\n\nHowever, after a few rounds of this process, the total amount of money created will stabilize because each bank will eventually lend out the maximum allowed by the reserve ratio. \n\nIn this case, the total amount of money created can be calculated using the formula: Total Money Created = Initial Deposit / Reserve Ratio = $500 / 10% = $5000. \n\nBut this formula represents the total potential money that could theoretically be created over many rounds of the process, not the exact amount created after just one cycle of deposits and loans. The precise amount depends on how many times the process repeats until the total reserve held reaches 100% of the new total deposits.\n\nSo, after the first cycle (the maximum amount of money created would be the original deposit plus the amount the bank lent out, which equals $500 + $450 = $950. However, since we're asked about the maximum amount created based on the options given, and understanding the question might be asking for the potential limit of money creation in a simplified scenario, the closest answer to the theoretical maximum amount created within a single cycle is $4,500, considering the options provided. \n\nThus, the correct choice from the options given is B. $4,500, assuming the question is framed around the maximum possible amount created in a single cycle before the reserve ratios prevent further lending."
