It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following would most directly result from the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph?\n\nA. The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers\nB. The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment\nC. The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism\nD. The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies\n"

The focus is on the proper use of foreign investment for the benefit of the state itself, rather than the return for the foreign investor.\n\nGiven this context, the option that most directly results from the foreign investment mentioned would likely be:\n\nD. The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies\n\nWhile foreign investment can contribute to economic growth and development, which might indirectly lead to political stability, the primary concern here seems to be aligning the investment with the state's interests and avoiding situations where foreign powers wield too much influence or control, which could lead to political instability or unrest. Therefore, the aim would be to use foreign investment to strengthen the state's sovereignty and reduce external pressures that could destabilize the country."
