This typically leads to increased consumer spending, which in turn stimulates aggregate demand in the economy. As equilibrium real GDP is currently below full employment levels, this increase in aggregate demand can push the economy towards its full employment level of output without causing significant inflation ( at least initially. The economy might experience some inflation as it approaches full employment, but if the increase in aggregate demand is gradual and matched by an increase in aggregate supply, the inflation could be kept relatively low or moderate. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that unemployment falls with little inflation."
