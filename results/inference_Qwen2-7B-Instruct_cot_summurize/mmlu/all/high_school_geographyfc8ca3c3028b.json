This term is often used in geography to describe a city that significantly outpaces other urban centers in terms of population and economic activity, often exerting a dominant influence over the country's economy, politics, and culture. For example, Tokyo is a primate city in Japan, Paris is a primate city in France, and New York City is a primate city in the United States."
