A large central square surrounded by government and administrative buildings\n\nThis characteristic is commonly found in many East European cities, particularly those with a rich history dating back to the medieval times when they were often centers of political power. Central squares, also known as \"piazzas\" or \"placze\" in some languages, were typically the heart of these cities where important government buildings, such as town halls, palaces, and churches, were situated. This layout reflects the historical importance of these cities as administrative centers within their respective empires or kingdoms."
