When the goods along the axes of the PPF are perfect substitutes, it means that they can be used interchangeably without affecting their respective utility or value to the consumer. In this scenario, the opportunity cost of producing one good over another remains constant, which results in a linear PPF. This is because moving along the line only requires reallocating resources between the two goods without needing to adjust the overall level of resources, leading to a constant slope for the PPF."
