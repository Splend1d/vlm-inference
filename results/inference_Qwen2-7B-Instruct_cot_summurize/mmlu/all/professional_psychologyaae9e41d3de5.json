This is because moderate arousal helps to enhance cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and decision-making. When individuals are neither overly calm nor overly excited, they tend to be more alert and focused, which can lead to better performance and deeper learning. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the optimal level of arousal can vary from person to person, and for different tasks. For some individuals or tasks, higher levels of arousal might be beneficial, while for others, lower levels might be more effective."
