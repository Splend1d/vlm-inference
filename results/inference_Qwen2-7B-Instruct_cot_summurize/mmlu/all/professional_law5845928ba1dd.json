A political group got a proposition on the ballot, and a majority of the people voted to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry. The proposition did not affect any of the other rights that same-sex couples may have possessed from existing state law. Persons affected sued the state government for unconstitutionally taking away the rights that they had and doing it for no legitimate purpose, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Will the court grant the requests of the lawsuit and declare the proposition void and reinstate the rights of same-sex couples to marry?\n\nA. Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.\nB. Yes, because under the Fourth Amendment it would be an illegal interference against the right of privacy guaranteed to everyone.\nC. No, because the people voted to take a provision out of the existing constitution and when that is done by public vote it cannot be altered.\nD. No, because the ballot proposition was properly placed on the ballot and all statutory procedures were followed, thus precluding the courts from taking adverse action.\n"

Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.\n\nThis option is most likely the correct answer based on current legal precedent. The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled in cases like Obergefell v. Hodges ( (2015) that same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry. This ruling established that denying marriage rights to same-sex couples violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The fact that the proposition does not affect other rights of same-sex couples suggests that the court would view the specific restriction as targeting a fundamental right without sufficient justification.\n\nThe other options do not align with established legal principles:\nB. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, not decisions regarding civil rights like marriage.\nC. While a public vote can alter the constitution, the issue at hand involves constitutional rights, which cannot be arbitrarily eliminated without due process.\nD. The courts can still intervene if they determine that the proposition violates constitutional rights, even if it was put on the ballot through a democratic process."
