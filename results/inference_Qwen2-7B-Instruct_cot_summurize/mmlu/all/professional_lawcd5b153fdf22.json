Reports of the drug being tied to cases of premature dementia surfaced, and a number of lawsuits were filed by injured consumers, alleging strict liability for a defective product. At trial, the manufacturer proved that thorough testing was done but that new scientific discoveries, not then available, now show a vulnerability in certain people to the drug. Is the company strictly liable to the victims even though the medical knowledge was not available when the product was developed and put on the market?\n\nA. Yes, strict liability applies to pharmaceutical companies and questions of knowledge of defects is irrelevant.\nB. Yes, the manufacturer must assume the cost of compensating those innocent victims who took the defective drug.\nC. No, the company has no duty to conduct research to determine a product's safety.\nD. No, when the medical or scientific information regarding a defect has not yet been discovered, the company will not be held strictly liable for putting that product on the market.\n"

No, when the medical or scientific information regarding a defect has not yet been discovered, the company will not be held strictly liable for putting that product on the market.\n\nStrict liability in product liability cases typically holds manufacturers responsible for harm caused by their products regardless of fault, but this generally applies when the manufacturer knew or should have known about a defect at the time of production. In the case where new scientific discoveries reveal issues with a previously approved product, the manufacturer may argue that they exercised due diligence in the absence of such information at the time of product development and marketing. This could potentially absolve them from strict liability if it can be proven that they acted in accordance with the best available knowledge and standards at the time."
