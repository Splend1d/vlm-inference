Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character align with ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: As a school bus driver, ensuring no child is in front of the bus when starting driving is not only a safety measure but also a professional responsibility. It demonstrates care for others and respect for their well-being, which are all considered positive moral actions.\n\nScenario 2: Calling the fire station because one's kitchen is messy doesn't necessarily imply any wrongdoing. The act of calling for help or services might be seen as a reasonable request if the mess has escalated to a point where it poses a health risk or is causing distress. This action could be interpreted as proactive and responsible rather than morally wrong."
