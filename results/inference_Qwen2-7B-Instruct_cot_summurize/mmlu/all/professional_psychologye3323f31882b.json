By performing multiple ANOVAs, there is an increased risk of committing a Type II error due to the multiplicity issue. MANOVA, by contrast, considers all dependent variables simultaneously, thus providing better protection against Type II errors.\n\n2. **Handling of Multiple Dependent Variables**: Since the research involved ten scales of the WISC-R, MANOVA allows for the examination of the relationship between these multiple dependent variables and one or more independent variables (in this case, learning disability status). This approach can provide insights into whether there are are differences in the combined pattern of performance across the scales rather than just on individual scales.\n\n3. **Statistical Power**: MANOVA generally has more statistical power than multiple ANOVAs when the dependent variables are correlated. This means that MANOVA is more likely to detect true differences between groups if they exist.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Interpretation**: MANOVA provides a more comprehensive interpretation of the data since it takes into account the intercorrelation among the dependent variables. This is particularly useful in understanding how the learning disability affects the overall cognitive profile as measured by the WISC-R scales.\n\n5. **Avoidance of Multiple Comparison Issues**: While MANOVA does involve multiple comparisons implicitly, it does so in a way that controls for the family-wise error rate, reducing the risk of Type I errors ( which is not addressed adequately when conducting multiple univariate ANOVAs without adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly states that MANOVA usually offers greater protection against Type II error, making it the most appropriate choice in this context."
