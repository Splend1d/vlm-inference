In general, cannulas can be left in place for up to 96 hours (four days), but this is not a hard and fast rule. It is important to regularly assess the cannula site for signs of complications such as infection, phlebitis, or infiltration, and to replace the cannula when necessary. Always follow the most current guidelines from your healthcare institution or professional organization."
