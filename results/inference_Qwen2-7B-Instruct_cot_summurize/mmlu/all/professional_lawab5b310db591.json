It was addressed to the manager. He read it, put it in a private drawer, and did not read it again. Later, he tried to sue the competitor for defamation as a result of the letter. Will the court likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, and on what grounds? Base your answer on the common law definition of defamation.\n\nA. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.\nB. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the language is not damaging to the manager's reputation.\nC. No, it will not dismiss because the circumstances show that all of the elements of defamation are all present.\nD. No, it will not dismiss because a plaintiff in a defamatory action has an absolute right to a jury trial to prove defamation.\n"

Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, defamation requires that the false statement is communicated to a third party or to someone other than the person making the claim ( - this is known as \"publication.\" In this case, since the defamatory letter was only addressed to the manager and did not reach any other individuals, there may not have been sufficient publication for defamation to occur. This is often referred to as \"private defamation\" or \"non-publication\" defense. \n\nIt's important to note that laws can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another, so this answer is based on general principles of common law defamation. The specific laws in force in the relevant state or country would need to be consulted for a definitive answer."
