This type of bonding involves the sharing of electrons between atoms to form strong covalent bonds, which can result in a three-dimensional network structure that holds the atoms together very strongly. This kind of structure leads to high melting points as the molecules need a lot of energy to be separated from each other. Additionally, such substances often do not conduct electricity well because the free electrons required for electrical conduction are not mobile within the rigid structure of the network. Furthermore, they typically do not dissolve easily in water due to the difference in polarity between the substance and water molecules."
