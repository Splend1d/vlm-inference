This option was not defined by Giddens in 1998 as part of New Labour's 'third way'. \n\nGiddens' 'third way' was a political philosophy that sought to combine elements of both traditional left-wing policies and right-wing policy. It emphasized social justice, equality, and community, while also supporting free markets, economic growth, and individual responsibility.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each of the options:\n\nA. The democratization of the family: This refers to the idea of empowering individuals within families and promoting greater participation and decision-making in family life. Giddens advocated for this concept as part of his third way, emphasizing the importance of personal autonomy and self-fulfillment.\n\nC. Positive welfare: 'a hand up, not a hand-out': This principle focuses on providing support and assistance to individuals in need in a way that promotes their long-term well-being and self-sufficiency. Giddens argued that welfare systems should be designed to help people achieve independence rather than perpetuating dependency.\n\nD. Strengthening civil society: Giddens believed in the importance of civil society - the voluntary sector and non-governmental organizations - as a key component of a healthy democracy. He advocated for policies measures that would support and enhance the role of civil society in addressing social issues and promoting civic engagement."
