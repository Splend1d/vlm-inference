The trial court denied the defendant's request and instead instructed the jury that the defendant had the burden of proof to establish the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence. After she was convicted by the jury, the defendant claims on appeal that the jury instructions regarding duress violated the due process clause. Were the jury instructions correct?\n\nA. No, because the prosecution bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements and defenses produced at trial by a defendant.\nB. No, because the jury instruction impermissibly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant.\nC. No, because the defense of duress is no longer a recognized defense in federal prosecutions, although it was recognized at common law, and is recognized in most state courts.\nD. Yes, because the defense has the burden of proving the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n"

Yes, because the defense has the burden of proving the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nIn criminal cases, the standard of proof for the prosecution to meet is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" for each element of the crime charged. However, when it comes to the burden of proof for a defendant's affirmative defenses (like duress in this case), the standard is typically \"a preponderance of the evidence.\" This means the jury must believe that it is more likely than not that the defense is true. Therefore, the jury instructions given by the trial court were correct according to standard legal practices."
