Because to know something that is false is to know no real thing, nothing (i.e., not to know at all).\n\nThis choice aligns with Plato's philosophy, which posits that knowledge is fundamentally tied to truth. If something is known and it turns out to be false, then one could argue that the act of knowing was in fact not a true knowledge but rather a misrecognition or ignorance. This perspective emphasizes that knowledge should not only be true but also justified, meaning there should be a valid reason or evidence supporting its truthfulness. If there is no justification, or if the justification later fails to hold, then what was once considered knowledge may not meet the criteria of being \"justified\" and therefore cannot be properly classified as knowledge.\n\nWhile options B, C, and D might present other challenges to the concept of knowledge, they do not directly address the core issue of knowingability when dealing with falsehoods under Plato's framework. Option B focuses on the basis of knowledge, option C addresses the lack of justification, and option D considers the dynamic nature of knowledge versus the unchanging Forms, none of which specifically capture the essence of why something false cannot be truly known."
