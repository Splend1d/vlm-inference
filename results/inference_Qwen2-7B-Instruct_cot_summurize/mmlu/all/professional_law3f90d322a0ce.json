The cutoff switch had functioned well for a year after he purchased the snowblower but failed after the machine had been improperly repaired by a mechanic. The snowblower's operating manual contained a clear and prominent warning against making the very alteration to the switch mechanism that was made by the mechanic. The mechanic, however, did not have a manual available when he repaired the snowblower. Does the homeowner have a viable claim against the manufacturer of the snowblower for damages?\n\nA. No, because the homeowner was contributorily negligent in failing to furnish the snowblower's manual to the mechanic.\nB. No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration of the snowblower by a third party. a third party.\nC. Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel.\n"

Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.\n\nThe homeowner's claim would likely be valid under several legal principles:\n\n1. **Design Defect**: The fact that the cutoff switch failed despite having worked properly for a year suggests there might have been a design defect. The snowblower should have been designed in such a way that it would continue to function safely even if subjected to the alteration that the mechanic performed.\n\n2. **Manufacturing Defect**: The failure occurred only after the snowblower was improperly repaired by a mechanic, indicating that there might have been a manufacturing defect in the switch or its installation instructions.\n\n3. **Negligence**: The manufacturer may be liable for negligence if they failed to provide adequate instructions or warnings about the potential hazards of altering the switch mechanism. Even though the mechanic did not have access to the manual, the manufacturer still has a duty to ensure that the product is safe for use as intended.\n\n4. **Substantial Factor in Cause of Injury**: The malfunctioning of the snowblower due to the faulty switch is a direct cause of the homeowner's injury. This would satisfy the requirement that the manufacturer's product was a substantial factor in causing the injury.\n\nTherefore, the homeowner may have a viable claim against the manufacturer for damages resulting from the snowblower's defective design or inadequate instructions/warnings."
