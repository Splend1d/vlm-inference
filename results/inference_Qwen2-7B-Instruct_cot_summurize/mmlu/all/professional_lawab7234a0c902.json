C. training, the student was required to spend three weeks at a camp for Marine Corps. summer field exercises. While at the camp, the student was given a new synthetic helmet to wear during her basic training. An agency purchased the new high-technology helmets for the Army and Marine Corps. to replace the old \"steel pot\" headgear worn for decades by U. S. soldiers. These new synthetic helmets were manufactured by a corporation and were made of Kevlar, an extremely tough fiber material with high energy-absorbing qualities that made it stronger in some ways than steel. When the student received her helmet from the Marine Corps. , it was packaged in the original carton supplied by the corporation. On the box, there was a picture that depicted an off-duty marine wearing the helmet while riding a bicycle. One afternoon after training, the student decided to take a ride on her bicycle. Believing that it could be used as a bicycle helmet, the student decided to use it for that purpose. During the ride, the student hit a deep pothole that caused her to be thrown headfirst from the bicycle. As she was flying through the air, the strap from her helmet came loose, and the helmet fell off her head. The student landed on a lawn and was temporarily knocked unconscious. She suffered serious head injuries. If the student asserts a claim against the corporation to recover damages for her injuries, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur negligence can be inferred from the fact that the helmet came off the student's head.\nB. prevail, because the original package depicted a picture of a cyclist wearing the helmet.\nC. not prevail, because the student was not using the helmet for its intended purpose.\nD. not prevail, because the helmet had been properly designed by the corporation for its intended use by the Army and Marine Corps.\n"

However, this doctrine does not apply simply because the helmet came off during use; rather, it would need to be shown that there was a defect in the helmet or how it was manufactured, leading to the accident. In this case, the helmet was designed for military use, not cycling, which suggests that the helmet was not improperly designed. \n\nGiven the facts provided:\n\n1. The helmet was intended for military use, not for bicycle riding.\n2. The strap came loose, but without further evidence indicating a manufacturing defect or design flaw specifically to the helmet, it's hard to argue negligence.\n3. The packaging included a picture of someone using the helmet in a context different from its intended use ( this might not be relevant to proving negligence if the helmet itself was not defective.\n\nThus, unless the student can prove that the helmet was defective in a way that led to its failure when used for cycling, she would likely not prevail in her claim. The defense could argue that the helmet was used inappropriately and, therefore, the manufacturer cannot be held liable for an unforeseeable misuse."
