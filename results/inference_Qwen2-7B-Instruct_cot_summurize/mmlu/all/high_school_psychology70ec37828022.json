According to this theory, we feel emotions based on how our bodies respond to certain stimuli or events. In Susan's case, the pill causes physical reactions such as increased blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. These physiological responses then lead to feelings of anger or amorousness, depending on the context.\n\nIn contrast, the other options do not fit the scenario:\n\n- A. The adaptation-level phenomenon refers to the idea that after repeated exposure to a stimulus, the response becomes less intense over time.\n- B. Two-factor theory ( is often associated with Walter Cannon, who proposed that there are two factors contributing to the experience of emotions: bodily changes (and cognitive interpretation of those changes.\n- D. The Cannon-Bard theory proposes that emotional and physiological responses occur simultaneously and independently of each other, which contrasts with the sequential process suggested by the James-Lange theory."
