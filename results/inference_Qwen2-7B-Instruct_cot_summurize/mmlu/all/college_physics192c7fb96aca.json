Electron\n\nThe negative muon, denoted as \u03bc^-, is most similar to an electron because they both belong to the lepton family in the Standard Model of particle physics. Both particles have similar charges (the electron carries a negative charge, while the muon carries a negative electric charge as well, but with a much larger mass. The other options listed ( mesons, photons, and bosons - do not share these properties with the muon."
