Semantic segmentation assigns a label to each pixel in an image, whereas multiclass image classification predicts the category or class of the entire image.\n\nB. **A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to $96\\%$ would likely be considered at true positive.** This statement is also true. Intersection over Union (IoU is a measure used to evaluate the overlap between a predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. An IoU of 96% indicates a high degree of overlap, suggesting that the prediction is likely correct, hence it would be considered a true positive.\n\nC. **When a predicted bounding box does not correspond to any object in the scene, it is considered a false positive.** This statement is false. By definition, a false positive occurs when the model predicts the presence of an object where there is none. However, if a predicted bounding box misses an object that is present in the scene, it is considered a **false negative** rather than a false positive. The confusion arises from the terminology used; in this context, not detecting an existing object correctly should be labeled as a false negative.\n\nD. **A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to $3\\%$ would likely be considered at false negative.** This statement is true. An IoU of 3% indicates a very low overlap, suggesting that the prediction significantly misses the target object, which would be considered incorrect and thus a false negative.\n\nTherefore, the false statement among the options provided is **C**: \"When a predicted bounding box does not correspond to any object in the scene, it is considered a false positive.\""
