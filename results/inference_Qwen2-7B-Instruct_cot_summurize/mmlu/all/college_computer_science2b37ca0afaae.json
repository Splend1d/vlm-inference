This means that \\(c\\) must be a factor of both numbers. \n\n- **Option A**: \\(\\{-6, -2, -1, 1, 2, 6\\}\\) includes positive factors (1, 2, and 6 ( (which I'll assume was meant to be 6 based on context), and their negative counterparts. This set correctly represents possible common divisors because if a number is a divisor of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), its negative counterpart would also be a divisor if the original condition holds for both positive and negative values within the context of being being divisors.\n\n- **Option B**: \\(\\{-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6\\}\\) includes 0. However, by definition, a divisor cannot be zero since division by zero is undefined in mathematics. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n- **Option C**: \\(\\{-9, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6\\}\\) includes 9, which is not a divisor of any other number in the set, making it impossible for these numbers to be common divisors of two integers where each number divides another.\n\n- **Option D**: \\(\\{-9, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6\\}\\) similarly includes 0, which as explained, cannot be a divisor due to the undefined nature of division by zero.\n\nTherefore, **Option A** is the correct choice because it includes valid common divisors ( \\(1, 2,\\) and \\(6\\) ( and their negatives, adhering to the definition of common divisors."
