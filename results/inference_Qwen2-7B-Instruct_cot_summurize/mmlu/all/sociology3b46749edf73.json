This concept is most closely aligned with option B: \"characteristic of professionals and skilled workers, whose work interests spilled over into leisure time.\" \n\nIn this context, Parker observed that professionals and skilled workers often carry their work-related interests and activities into their leisure time. This can include continuing professional development, engaging in hobbies related to their field, or even socializing with colleagues outside of work hours. The extension pattern highlights how the division of labor, particularly in modern industrial societies, has led to a permeation of work into non-work domains, affecting how individuals perceive and allocate their time."
