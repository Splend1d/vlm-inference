Folate deficiency in older people is less prevalent in countries with mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid.\n\nFortification of food with nutrients, such as folic acid, can significantly reduce the prevalence of nutrient deficiencies in populations. This is particularly important for folate, which plays a crucial role in preventing neural tube defects in newborns and reducing the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. In countries where flour is fortified with folic acid, the population's intake of this nutrient tends to be higher, thereby reducing the risk of deficiency, especially among older adults who might have limited dietary variety or absorption issues."
