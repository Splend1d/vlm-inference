Does not support self-efficacy for change\n\nMotivational interviewing (does support self-efficacy for change by encouraging patients to believe in their ability to make changes. It involves helping individuals to explore and resolve ambivalence about change by building motivation, generating personalized strategies, and reinforcing client-generated change talk.\n\nB. Empathy through reflective listening is a key component of motivational interviewing, allowing the therapist to understand and empathize with the patient's feelings and perspectives.\n\nC. Rolling with resistance is another core principle of motivational interviewing, which involves acknowledging and accepting the patient's resistance or ambivalence without judgment and working with it rather than against it.\n\nD. While motivational interviewing avoids direct confrontation, it does not mean it does not support change. Instead, it focuses on collaboration and partnership, using open-ended questions, affirmations, and reflections to guide the conversation towards the patient's own motivations for change."
