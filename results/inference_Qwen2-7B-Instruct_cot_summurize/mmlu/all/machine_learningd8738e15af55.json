False, True\n\nExplanation:\n\nStatement 1: The claim that the SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis with respect to its objective function is generally true. SVMs use a convex optimization problem which ensures that any local minimum is also a global minimum. Therefore, the optimization process is reliable and will converge to the best possible solution given the data and constraints.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is true but with a clarification. The Perceptron algorithm works well in linearly separable data spaces. When the data is not linearly separable, mapping it into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function like the radial basis function ( (RBF) can sometimes enable the Perceptron to find a decision boundary that separates the classes. However, this does not guarantee better classification performance. It depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, the choice of kernel, and the parameters used for the kernel mapping. The RBF kernel, for example, can create very complex decision boundaries, potentially leading to overfitting if not properly controlled."
