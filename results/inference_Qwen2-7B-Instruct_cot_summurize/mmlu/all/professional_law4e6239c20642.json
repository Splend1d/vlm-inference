Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the widow died leaving no heirs. In her will, the widow left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the widow died, the tenant, having learned of her death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America organization was unaware that the widow made a gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the cottage. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when\n\nA. the widow died.\nB. the tenant discontinued paying rent.\nC. the tenant's lease with the widow expired.\nD. the tenant subjectively believed that he no longer had permission to possess the cottage.\n"

                    "text": "The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when:\n\nB. the tenant discontinued paying rent.\n\nExplanation: Adverse possession refers to a legal doctrine that allows a person to gain legal ownership of property by occupying and using it openly, notoriously, and continuously for a certain period of time, typically much longer than the standard lease or property ownership terms. In this scenario, the key event that could potentially trigger the start of the adverse possession period is when the tenant stops paying rent, as it indicates a lack of payment under the lease agreement, which is a form of adverse action against the rightful owner (in this case, the Boy Scouts of America through their claim over the widow's estate.\n\nOption A ( \"the widow died\" does not necessarily start the adverse possession clock because the widow did not directly own the property anymore at the time she died; the Boy Scouts of America claimed ownership through her will. Option C \"the tenant's lease with the widow expired\" is not the correct answer because the lease itself is not the starting point for adverse possession, but rather the actions taken by the tenant post-lease expiration that might qualify for adverse possession. Option D \"the tenant subjectively believed that he no longer had permission to possess the cottage\" is not the legal threshold for adverse possession; the critical factor is the tenant's overt actions, such as non-payment of rent, rather than subjective beliefs."
