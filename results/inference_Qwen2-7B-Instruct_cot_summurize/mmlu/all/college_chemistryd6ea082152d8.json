The chemical shift is usually expressed in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS, which is used as a reference point. However, the frequency you've provided (1.55 kHz) needs to be converted into Hz (1.55 kHz = 1550 Hz) to compare it appropriately.\n\nThe relationship between the chemical shift (\u03b4 (in ppm), the magnetic field strength (B (in Tesla), and the Larmor frequency (\u03c9 (in Hz) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\delta = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi B} \\]\n\nGiven that the Larmor frequency at 12.0 T is:\n\\[ \\omega = 2\\pi \\times 12.0 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for \u03b4 (for each compound. The chemical shifts for CH3F, CH3Cl, CH3Br, and CH3I are approximately:\n\n- CH3F: \u03b4 \u2248 17.6 ppm\n- CH3Cl: \u03b4 \u2248 19.4 ppm\n- CH3Br: \u03b4 \u2248 22.5 ppm\n- CH3I: \u03b4 \u2248 26.8 ppm\n\nConverting these ppm values to Hz using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\omega_{\\text{CH3F}} = 2\\pi \\times 12.0 \\times 17.6 \\approx 1124 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\\[ \\omega_{\\text{CH3Cl}} = 2\\pi \\times 12.0 \\times 19.4 \\approx 1246 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\\[ \\omega_{\\text{CH3Br}} = 2\\pi \\times 12.0 \\times 22.5 \\approx 1385 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\\[ \\omega_{\\text{CH3I}} = 2\\pi \\times 12.0 \\times 26.8 \\approx 1467 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nNone of these calculated frequencies exactly match the provided frequency of 1550 Hz. It's possible there might have been a misunderstanding or error in the question's setup since the calculated values do not align with the given frequency. Typically, the chemical shifts for these compounds would fall within the specified range when converted to Hz based on the given magnet strength, but the exact match does not occur here.
