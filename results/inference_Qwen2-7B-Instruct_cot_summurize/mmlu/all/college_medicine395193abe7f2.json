It can remove incorrectly paired nucleotides bases and replace them with the correct ones. After the RNA primer is removed, DNA polymerase I steps in to ensure the accuracy of the DNA strand. It checks each newly added nucleotide against the template strand and if there's a mismatch, it will excise the incorrect nucleotide and add the correct one.\n\nThe mismatch repair mechanism (C, works after DNA replication is completed and is not involved in the immediate correction of errors during replication. Endonuclease repair (D involves enzymes that cut out damaged or incorrectly paired segments of DNA, but it does not necessarily involve the replacement of the removed segment with the correct sequence as DNA polymerase I does."
