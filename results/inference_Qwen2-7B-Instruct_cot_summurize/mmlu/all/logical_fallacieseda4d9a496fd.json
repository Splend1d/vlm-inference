It doesn't fit precisely into the standard logical fallacy categories but is akin to a form of ridicule or mockery that undermines the argument rather than addressing its merits. \n\nPlease note that while \"horse laugh\" isn't an officially recognized logical fallacy, it encapsulates the spirit of the sarcastic dismissal you described.
