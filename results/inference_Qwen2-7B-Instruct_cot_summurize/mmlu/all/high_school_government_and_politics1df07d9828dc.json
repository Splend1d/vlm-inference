Young adults are less likely to vote than senior citizens.\n\nThis statement is often considered to be least true because voter turnout among young adults has been increasing over time, particularly since the 2018 midterm elections, as evidenced by studies and data from various sources including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement ( (CIRCLE). There has been a growing awareness and mobilization efforts targeting young voters, which have contributed to higher participation rates among this demographic. Therefore, while historically there might have been a gap in voting rates between young adults and senior citizens, contemporary trends suggest that this gap may not be as pronounced as previously believed."
