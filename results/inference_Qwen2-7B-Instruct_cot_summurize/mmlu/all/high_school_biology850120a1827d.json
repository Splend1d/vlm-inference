The appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue.\n\nThis statement detracts from the claim that the appendix is purely vestigial because it suggests that the organ still has some functional purpose, specifically in terms of its immune function. Vestigial organs are typically remnants of structures that were useful in ancestral forms but are no longer necessary in the current species. The presence of lymphatic tissue indicates that the appendix may play a role in the body's immune system, which contradicts the idea that it serves no real function."
