Projection.\n\nProjection is a psychological defense mechanism where an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or motives to someone else. In this context, blaming Jews and other minorities for the financial and social problems of Germany was a form of projection, as the German populace was projecting their own fears, anxieties, and frustrations onto these groups. This allowed them to deflect responsibility for their own issues onto others who were seen as inherently different or inferior."
