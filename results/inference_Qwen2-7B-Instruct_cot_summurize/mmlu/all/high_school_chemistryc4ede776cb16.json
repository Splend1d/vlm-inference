                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Rate = k[A]^-1.\n\nThe reasoning behind this choice involves understanding how different orders of reactions appear on various concentration-time graphs:\n\n- **Option A ( Rate = k[A]**: If the reaction was first-order with respect to A, the plot of [A] vs. time would show a linear decrease over time. However, since this is not the case for option A, we can eliminate it.\n\n- **Option B Rate = k[A]^2**: If the reaction was second-order with respect to A, the plot of [A] vs. time would not be linear, but rather show a curve that suggests the concentration decreases faster at the beginning and slows down over time. This matches the description given for option B, where the graph of [A] versus time is curved.\n\n- **Option C Rate = k[A]^0**: A zero-order reaction would have a constant rate regardless of the concentration of A. Therefore, the plot of [A] versus time would not show any particular pattern, which contradicts the given information about the graph being curved.\n\n- **Option D Rate = k[A]^-1**: For a reaction that is first-order with respect to the inverse of A ([1/A]), the plot of 1/[A] vs. time would indeed show a straight line. This is because in a first-order reaction with respect to [1/A], the rate of the reaction increases as the concentration of A decreases, leading to a linear decrease in 1/[A] over time when plotted against time.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is **D** because it matches the behavior described for the graph of 1/[A] versus time being giving a straight line."
