This places him in the top 3% of the population in terms of intelligence as measured by this IQ test. \n\nGiven this information, we can infer that Jonathan's IQ score is significantly above average. Among the options provided:\n\n- A. 85: This score is below average and would not place someone in the 97th percentile.\n- B. 100: This is considered the average IQ score. While it is slightly above average, it is not high enough to be in the 97th percentile.\n- C. 130: This score is considered \"very superior\" or \"gifted.\" It places an individual in the top 2.5% of the population, making it a reasonable option for being in the 97th percentile.\n- D. 150: This score is considered \"exceptional\" or \"prodigious.\" It places an individual in the top 0.6% of the population, which is much more extreme than what is needed to be in the 97th percentile.\n\nGiven the percentile ranking, the most likely score for Jonathan is:\n\n**C. 130**"
