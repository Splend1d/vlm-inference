The echo comes back to the driver after the siren has passed the point where the echo wass created. So, the police car will be moving away from the point where the echo is created when the echo reaches the driver again. Therefore, we should use the Doppler effect formula for a moving source towards a stationary observer for the echo:\n\n\\[ f'' = \\frac{v + v_o}{v + v_s} f' \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(f''\\) is the frequency of the echo heard by the driver,\n- \\(v\\) is the speed of sound ( (350 m/s),\n- \\(v_o\\) is the velocity of the observer ( (the police car moving at 3.5 m/s),\n- \\(v_s\\) is the velocity of the source ( (the siren now moving away from the driver),\n- \\(f'\\) is the frequency of the siren as heard by the driver ( (606.37 Hz).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ f'' = \\frac{350 + 3.5}{350 - 3.5} * 606.37 \\]\n\\[ f'' = \\frac{353.5}{346.5} * 606.37 \\]\n\\[ f'' \u2248 609.8 Hz \\]\n\nThe frequency of the echo heard by the driver is thus closest to **612 Hz** ( (option C)."
