Therefore, the probability of their union is simply the sum of their individual probabilities.\n\n\\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\\]\n\nGiven \\(P(A) = 0.3\\) and \\(P(B) = 0.2\\),\n\n\\[P(A \\cup B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5\\]\n\n**Answer for Mutually Exclusive:** 0.5\n\n### 2. **Independent Events**\n\nFor independent events, the probability of their union is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)\\]\n\nGiven \\(P(A) = 0.3\\) and \\(P(B) = 0.2\\),\n\n\\[P(A \\cup B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - ( (0.3)(0.2) = 0.5 - 0.06 = 0.44\\]\n\n**Answer for Independent:** 0.44\n\n### 3. **B is a Subset of A**\n\nIf \\(B\\) is a subset of \\(A\\), then every outcome in \\(B\\) is also an outcome in \\(A\\). This means that \\(A\\) includes all outcomes of \\(B\\) plus potentially others. In this case, the probability of \\(A\\) includes the entire set \\(B\\), so:\n\n\\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A)\\]\n\nGiven \\(P(A) = 0.3\\),\n\n\\[P(A \\cup B) = 0.3\\]\n\n**Answer for B being a Subset of A:** 0.3\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer choice is **B. .44, 0.5, 0.3**, corresponding to the probabilities for independent, mutually exclusive, and when \\(B\\) is a subset of \\(A\\) respectively."
