Causal research aims to establish cause-and-effect relationships between variables, which in this case would involve understanding how changes in price affect sales volume or revenue in each location. By conducting experiments or quasi-experiments that manipulate price and measure the resulting outcomes, the company can determine the relationship between price and sales performance.\n\nDescriptive research simply describes phenomena as they occur, without attempting to explain why they occur.\nExploratory research is used when there is little known about a topic, aiming to uncover new insights and generate hypotheses rather than test specific ones.\nEthnographic research involves observing and interviewing people in their natural settings, often used to understand cultural contexts or consumer behavior in detail but not specifically for establishing price sensitivity."
