This tradition dates back to the early 19th century in the United States, when the practice of giving specific gifts on certain anniversaries was popularized by publishers Allen & Co. The idea behind the silver gift is to celebrate the enduring value and significance of a long-lasting marriage. Silver, being both beautiful and durable, symbolizes the strength and resilience that couples often exhibit over two decades together."
