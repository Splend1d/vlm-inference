As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.\"\nThomas Jefferson, 1816\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate regarding the existence of political parties in the early United States?\n\nA.

Political parties did not exist until the War of 1812, when Federalists asserted control over foreign policies with France and Britain.\nD.
