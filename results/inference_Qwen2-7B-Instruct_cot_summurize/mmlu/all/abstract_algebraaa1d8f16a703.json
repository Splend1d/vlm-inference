An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. However, it does not imply that the polynomial ring \\(R[x]\\) over an integral domain \\(R\\) will also be an integral domain. A counterexample can be found by considering \\(R = \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}\\), which is an integral domain since it has no zero divisors other than 0 itself. However, the polynomial ring \\(\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\) contains polynomials like \\(x^2 + x\\), which when multiplied together yield 0 (since \\(x^2 + x = x(x+1)\\) and in \\(\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}\\), both \\(x\\) and \\(x+1\\) can be non-zero but their product is 0 due to the properties of \\(\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}\\). This shows that \\(R[x]\\) is not necessarily an integral domain even if \\(R\\) is.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"If \\(R\\) is a ring and \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are in \\(R[x]\\), then \\(\\deg(f(x)g(x)) = \\deg(f(x)) + \\deg(g(x))\\).\"\n\nThis statement is **True**. The degree of the product of two polynomials in a ring \\(R[x]\\) is indeed the sum of their individual degrees. This property follows directly from how we define multiplication of polynomials. When you multiply two polynomials, the highest degree term in the product comes from multiplying the highest degree terms of each polynomial, and this degree is the sum of their original degrees. This property holds as long as we consider the operations within the ring \\(R[x]\\) and assume that \\(R\\) allows for the necessary operations to define the degree of a polynomial and perform multiplication.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. False, True**"
