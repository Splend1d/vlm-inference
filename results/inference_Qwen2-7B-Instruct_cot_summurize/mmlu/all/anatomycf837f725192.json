These nerves control the movement of the diaphragm, which is crucial for breathing and also helps in peristalsis of the oesophagus. \n\nB. The splanchnic nerves do not accompany the oesophagus through the diaphragm.\nC. The sympathetic trunks are part of the autonomic nervous system but do not accompany the oesophagus through the diaphragm.\nD. The vagus nerves do accompany the oesophagus through the diaphragm but their role is more related to the control of the digestive tract rather than just passing through the diaphragm."
