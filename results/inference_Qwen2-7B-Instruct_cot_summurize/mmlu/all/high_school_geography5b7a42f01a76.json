However, among the options provided, the most direct answer to creating a star-shaped city pattern would be:\n\nB. Interstate highways that link cities\n\nInterstate highways, being part of the larger network of highways in the United States, often radiate outwards from major urban centers or hubs, connecting different cities. This layout can lead to a star-like configuration where cities are connected by radial routes emanating from a central point.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific shape and layout of a city can be influenced by a combination of factors including geography, history, and economic development, not just transportation systems. The other options listed ( high-speed rail, streetcar and trolley lines, and beltways also play significant roles in shaping urban landscapes but do not necessarily create a star-shaped pattern as directly as interstate highways."
