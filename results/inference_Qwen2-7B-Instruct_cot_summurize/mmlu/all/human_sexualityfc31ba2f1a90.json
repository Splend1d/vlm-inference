In women, it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID, which can lead to:\n\n- Tubal pregnancies: This is also known as ectopic pregnancy, where the fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tubes instead of the uterus. It's often dangerous and requires immediate medical attention.\n\n- Premature delivery: Chlamydia infection can lead to preterm labor and premature birth, which can have significant health risks for the baby.\n\n- Spontaneous abortion: Chlamydia may increase the risk of miscarriage, especially during early pregnancy.\n\nTherefore, it's crucial for pregnant women to undergo chlamydia testing to prevent these potential complications."
