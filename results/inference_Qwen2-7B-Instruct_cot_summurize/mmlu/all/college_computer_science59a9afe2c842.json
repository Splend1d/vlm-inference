To determine the hardware address of a given IP address.\n\nAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used in networking to resolve an IP address to a hardware (MAC) address. It's particularly useful when you need to send data to a device but only have its IP address. ARP works on Layer 2 of the OSI model and uses a table-based approach to map IP addresses to MAC addresses for devices on the same network segment.\n\nTo summarize the other options:\nA. DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names to IP addresses, not the other way around.\nB. The Domain Name System (DNS performs this function, translating host names to IP addresses.\nC. This is incorrect because ARP is responsible for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses, not vice versa."
