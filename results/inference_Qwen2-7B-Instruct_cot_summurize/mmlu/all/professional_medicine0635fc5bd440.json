His symptoms began shortly after a camping trip, and he now is unable to climb stairs, walk long distances, comb his hair, or dress himself. His mother says that she was careful to apply his sunscreen on the trip and can recall no tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants. His only medication is a topical corticosteroid for several dry, scaly patches of the skin. He appears weak and lethargic. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight; he has had no change in his weight since his last examination 9 months ago. His temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 28/min. Examination of the skin shows a purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles. There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Dermatomyositis\nB. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy\nC. Eczema\nD. Lyme disease\n"

Dermatomyositis.\n\nDermatomyositis is an inflammatory disorder that affects both the skin and muscles. It often presents with skin rashes and muscle weakness. The purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles are consistent with the skin manifestations of dermatomyositis. The generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles also align with the muscle involvement seen in this condition. \n\nDuchenne's muscular dystrophy (B is a genetic disorder that leads to progressive muscle degeneration, but it typically does not present with the specific skin findings mentioned. Eczema (C is a type of skin inflammation that usually results in redness, itching, and scaling, but it does not generally cause muscle weakness or the specific rash described. Lyme disease  D is caused by a bacterial infection and often presents with migratory joint pain, fever, headache, and a characteristic bullseye rash called erythema migrans. While fatigue and muscle pain can occur in Lyme disease, the presentation does not match the skin and muscle symptoms as closely as dermatomyositis."
