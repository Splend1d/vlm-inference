It does not load the circuit at all.\n\nA potentiometer method of measuring DC voltage works by comparing the unknown voltage with a known standard voltage, rather than directly measuring it. This is achieved by creating a closed loop between the power supply, the known standard resistance (R0, and the unknown resistance (Rx (which represents the voltage to be measured). A third wire connects the midpoint of R0 and Rx to the point where the potential difference is to be measured. \n\nIn this setup, no current flows through the unknown resistance Rx since the circuit is essentially balanced, meaning that the voltage drop across R0 equals the voltage drop across Rx. This method does not load the circuit being measured because there is no current flowing through it, thus providing a more accurate measurement as it does not alter the conditions of the circuit under test. \n\nVoltmeters, on the other hand, do have some internal resistance, so when they are connected to measure a voltage, they draw a small amount of current from the circuit being measured, which can change the actual voltage being measured."
