One can make funeral and estate plans with the loved one.\n\nAn expected death, often referred to as a terminal illness or a life-limiting condition, allows individuals and their loved ones time to prepare for the inevitable. This preparation can include making arrangements for funeral services, ensuring legal documents such as wills and powers of attorney are are in order, and addressing any financial or personal affairs that need attention. It also provides a chance for family members to come together, express their feelings, and create a sense of closure. \n\nOptions A, C, and D involve ethical, emotional, and potentially illegal considerations. Grieving is a natural process that usually occurs after the loss, not before. Attempting to assist someone in speeding their death is not only ethically controversial but is also illegal in most jurisdictions. Finally, trying to avoid experiencing the same type of death for oneself is unrealistic and not a practical consideration in dealing with expected deaths."
