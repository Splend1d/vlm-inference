Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nWearing a fake moustache to a costume party is generally not considered morally wrong, as it is part of the spirit of dressing up and having fun at such events.\n\nWatering your neighbor's lawn without being paid for it, especially if you were supposed to be paid for the whole summer, would be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is because you have violated the agreement or contract with your neighbor by not performing the service they paid for."
