Here's a brief overview of each method:\n\n- **Smelting**: This is the process of extracting a metal from its ore by heating it to a high temperature, which causes impurities to separate from the metal and rise to the surface, where they can be removed. The pure metal then sinks to the bottom of the container. This process was likely used by ancient South American cultures to extract copper, gold, and silver.\n\n- **Hammering**: Once the metal has been extracted or smelted, it can be hammered into shape. This involves shaping the metal by applying force with hammers and anvils. This technique would have been used to create tools, jewelry, and other items made from copper, bronze, and possibly gold and silver.\n\n- **Casting**: This process involves pouring molten metal into a mold and allowing it to cool and harden. The mold can be made of sand, clay, or even wood. The advantage of casting is that it allows for more intricate designs and shapes than hammering alone. Bronze and possibly gold and silver would have been cast into various objects like weapons, tools, and ceremonial items.\n\nEach of these techniques played a crucial role in the development of metallurgy in South America, contributing to the creation of sophisticated tools, weapons, and artifacts that were integral to the societies of the time."
