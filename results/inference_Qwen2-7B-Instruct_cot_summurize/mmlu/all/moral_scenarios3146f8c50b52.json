Telling a hurtful joke at a funeral is generally seen as disrespectful and insensitive. Funerals are typically solemn occasions where people gather to mourn the loss of a loved one, and telling jokes that could potentially upset or offend others would not align with the expected norms of behavior during such events.\n\n2. Wringing the wet salamander causes physical harm to an animal, which is also considered morally wrong. Animals have intrinsic value and deserve to be treated with care and respect. In most places, it would also likely be illegal to cause unnecessary harm to wildlife."
