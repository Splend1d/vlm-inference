The test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion\n\nThis criterion suggests that if a selection test discriminates against a racial group, it would likely reject a higher percentage of applicants from that group compared to other racial groups. If the test rejects applicants from all racial groups in approximately the same proportion, it might indicate that the test is not discriminating based on race. However, it's important to note that this is just one aspect to consider when evaluating fairness and potential discrimination in selection tests, and it should always be evaluated alongside other factors such as content validity, fairness, and impact on different demographic groups."
