A culture characterized by friendship, where force and violence is eschewed in favour of cooperation in matters of security.\nD. A culture within which survival relies on military power, security dilemmas abound, and security is a zero-sum game.\n"

A culture characterized by friendship, where force and violence is eschewed in favor of cooperation in matters of security.\n\nWendt's three cultures of anarchy refer to different ways states perceive their interactions with others in the international system. The Lockean culture, named after John Locke, is one of these cultures. In this culture, actors believe in a social contract where they can trust each other and rely on mutual cooperation and peaceful resolution of conflicts. They generally avoid violence and prioritize cooperative solutions for security concerns."
