The two legislative bodies form a conference committee. \n\nWhen the Senate and House of Representatives pass different versions of the same bill, they cannot both be sent to the President for signature in their current forms. Instead, a conference committee is formed. This committee consists of members from both the House and the Senate who come together to reconcile differences between the two versions of the bill. They work to create a single, unified version of the bill that both chambers can agree upon. Once this compromise bill is agreed upon by the conference committee, it is then sent back to both the House and the Senate for a final vote. If it passes both chambers again, it can then be signed into law by the President."
