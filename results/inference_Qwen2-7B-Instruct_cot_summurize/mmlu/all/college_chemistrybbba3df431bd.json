Instead, the relative occupancy of each spin state is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{N_{\\alpha}}{N_{\\beta}} = \\frac{e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}}}{e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} + 1} \\]\n\nSince we're dealing with the g-factor, we'll adjust our approach slightly. The g-factor (g, relates to the ratio of the magnetic moment of an electron in the spin state to its classical value, and it also relates to the energy splitting between the two spin states:\n\n\\[ \\frac{N_{\\alpha}}{N_{\\beta}} = \\frac{g}{g + 1} \\]\n\nGiven that g = 2.05:\n\n\\[ \\frac{N_{\\alpha}}{N_{\\beta}} = \\frac{2.05}{2.05 + 1} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{N_{\\alpha}}{N_{\\beta}} = \\frac{2.05}{3.05} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{N_{\\alpha}}{N_{\\beta}} = 0.6724 \\]\n\nThis result is not among your options, which suggests there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question as presented. Given the information provided, the correct relative occupancy would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{N_{\\alpha}}{N_{\\beta}} = 0.6724 \\]\n\nHowever, none of your options match this calculation. It's possible that either the g-factor value was misstated or there's an additional context or nuance missing from the question that could affect the final answer. If you have more details or if there's a specific aspect of the question you'd like further clarification on, please provide additional information so I can assist you more accurately."
