There are 6 minutes in an hour, so \\(2\\) hours is \\(2 \\times 6 = 120\\) minutes.\n\nNow plug the values into the formula:\n\n\\[ N = 10.00 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{120}{36}} \\]\n\n\\[ = 10.00 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3.\\overline{3}} \\]\n\n\\[ = 10.00 \\times \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{0.\\overline{3}} \\right) \\]\n\nSince \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3} = \\frac{1}{8} \\), and \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{0.\\overline{3}} \\) represents an infinite geometric series which converges to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), \n\n\\[ = 10.00 \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10.00}{24} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{5.00}{12} \\]\n\n\\[ = 0.4166... \\]\n\nRounding off to three significant figures, the answer would be approximately \\(0.417\\) grams. However, this value doesn't exactly match any of the options provided. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in either the calculation or the options. The closest option to our calculated result (0.417 grams is not listed among A through D. Please verify the question or the options provided."
