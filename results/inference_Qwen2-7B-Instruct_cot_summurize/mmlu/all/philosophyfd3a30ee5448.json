According to Aristotle, this essence does not exist independently of the individual things that embody it. It is realized through the individual entities that instantiate the essence. \n\nGiven this understanding, the correct answer to the question about what happens to the essence or form of a species when all its members are destroyed is D: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or nature of things.\n\nThis means that the essence or form of a species is not something that exists separately and can be destroyed along with the individuals. Instead, the essence is realized in the existence of the individuals, and without those individuals, there is no realization of the essence. Therefore, the essence itself does not cease to exist just because the individuals do. It is not a separate entity that could be destroyed; rather, it is realized through the existence of the individuals, and thus, it continues to exist as long as there are instances of the species in the world."
