Severe Atopic Dermatitis: This is a common symptom in children with cow's milk allergy. The skin may become inflamed, itchy, red, and may develop patches of dry, scaly skin.\n\nB. Enterocolitis: This term refers to inflammation of the intestine and colon. In the context of a cow's milk allergy, enterocolitis may manifest as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.\n\nC. Diarrhoea: This is another typical symptom in children with cow's milk allergy. The stool may be loose and watery, which can lead to dehydration if not managed properly.\n\nTherefore, all of these symptoms (severe atopic dermatitis, enterocolitis, and diarrhea - can occur in infants and children with a suspected cow's milk allergy or intolerance. It's important to note that a proper diagnosis should be made by a healthcare professional based on a thorough medical history, physical examination, and possibly allergy testing."
