However, given our current understanding and technology, we can make some estimations:\n\nAs of now, human civilization has been sending out significant radio signals since the late 20th century ( with the advent of satellite communications and the establishment of various deep space communication systems. But it's important to note that most of these transmissions are confined within our own solar system or have a limited range in interstellar space.\n\nThe observable universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion light years in diameter. Given the vastness of this scale and the fact that Earth's radio transmissions have not reached beyond our solar system, the percentage of the observable universe that has received such signals would be incredibly small.\n\nHowever, considering the sheer size of the observable universe and the limited distance our signals have traveled, option A ( \\(10^{-24}\\%\\) seems like the most reasonable choice based on our current understanding. This represents an extremely tiny fraction, highlighting just how vast the universe is compared to the reach of our current technological capabilities.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is a speculative answer, as it's difficult to quantify the exact percentage without more information about the specific characteristics of extraterrestrial receiver technology and the full extent of human radio emissions. Additionally, this calculation does not take into account potential future advancements in both human technology and the potential capabilities of extraterrestrial civilizations."
