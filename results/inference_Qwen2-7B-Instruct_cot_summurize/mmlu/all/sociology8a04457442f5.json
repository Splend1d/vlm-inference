Students who passed the 11+ exam with high scores were eligible for admission to these schools.\n- Technical schools: Also known as \"modern schools,\" these focused more on vocational and technical education. They were designed for students who demonstrated skills or interests in areas such as engineering, science, or business but did not necessarily excel academically in the traditional sense.\n- Secondary modern schools: These were for students who did not pass the 11+ exam. They provided general education without the focus on academic subjects required for entry into grammar schools.\n\nThis system was controversial because it created a rigid division between what were seen as 'academic' and 'vocational' streams of education, potentially limiting opportunities for many students based on their performance on one exam at age 11."
