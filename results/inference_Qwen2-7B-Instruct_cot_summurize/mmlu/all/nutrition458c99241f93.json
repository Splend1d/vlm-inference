Chylomicrons and HDL.\n\nCholesterol and fatty acids absorbed from the intestinal lumen are packaged into chylomicrons and secreted from the enterocytes into the lymph. Chylomicrons are large, lipid-rich particles that transport dietary triglycerides from the intestines to other parts of the body. HDL ( or high-density lipoprotein, is another type of lipoprotein that plays a role in transporting cholesterol back to the liver for excretion or re-utilization."
