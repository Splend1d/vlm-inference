Therefore, the mass of the sand bag would still be 5kg.\n\nHowever, the weight of an object is a measure of the force exerted by gravity on that object, and it changes depending on the strength of the gravitational field. The weight of the sand bag on a planet with half the gravity compared to Earth would be half of its weight on Earth.\n\nTherefore, the weight of the sand bag on this planet would be \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 50N = 25N \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Mass 5kg weight 25N"
