By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nWhat traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?\n\nA. That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies\nB. That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation\nC. That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts\nD. That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change\n"

This contrasts with the perception that China lagged behind Europe in adopting and benefiting from gunpowder technology."
