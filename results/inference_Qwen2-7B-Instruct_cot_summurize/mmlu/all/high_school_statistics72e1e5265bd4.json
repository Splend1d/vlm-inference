The significance level \u03b1 represents the probability of making a Type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In contrast, a Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.\n\nThe relationship between \u03b1 and \u03b2 depends on various factors including the specific alternative hypothesis, the sample size, the variability in the data, and the true state of nature (i.e., whether the alternative hypothesis is indeed true or not. Without these details, it's impossible to calculate the probability of a Type II error.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question."
