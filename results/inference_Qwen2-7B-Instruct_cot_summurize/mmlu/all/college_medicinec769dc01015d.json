Metaphase \u2014 formation of two distinct nuclear membranes ( (This is actually a description of anaphase, not metaphase)\nB. Cytokinesis \u2014 separation of sister chromatids to their respective poles - This is incorrect, sister chromatids separate during anaphase, not cytokinesis. Cytokinesis refers to the physical division of the cytoplasm.\nC. Telophase \u2014 Formation of the equatorial plate - The equatorial plate doesn't exist in telophase. In telophase, chromosomes reach the poles and new nuclear membranes form around them.\nD. Anaphase \u2014 Separation of the cytoplasm and organelles - This is incorrect. Anaphase involves the separation of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the cell.\n\nCorrect matches:\n\nProphase - Dissolution of nucleoli\nMetaphase - Chromosomes align at the cell's equator ( (No specific component mentioned)\nTelophase - Formation of two distinct nuclear membranes and chromatin condenses into chromosomes\nAnaphase - Separation of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the cell"
