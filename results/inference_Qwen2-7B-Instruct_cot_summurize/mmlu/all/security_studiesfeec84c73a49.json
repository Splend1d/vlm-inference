The foundations for decisions not to allow female participation are commonly based on arbitrary and discriminatory rationale that can limit women's participation in civil society in other ways.\n\nFeminist scholars often argue against the exclusion of women from the military sphere or from armed combat because they believe that such exclusions are often based on arbitrary and discriminatory rationales. These rationales can include stereotypes about women's physical capabilities, roles in society, or even historical prejudices that have led to gender biases in military policies. Such exclusions can limit women's opportunities for leadership, influence, and engagement in critical areas of public life, which is a core concern for feminist theories of equality and justice. Feminists advocate for inclusive policies that recognize and accommodate the diverse capacities and contributions of all individuals, regardless of gender, to promote fairer and more equitable societies."
