This suggests that for every unit of \u03b1 from DMSO, there are three units of \u03b1 from ACN. \n\nIf we denote the concentration of DMSO as [DMSO] and the concentration of ACN as [ACN], then we can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{[\\text{DMSO}]}{[\\text{ACN}]} = \\frac{\\alpha}{3\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the concentrations [DMSO]:[ACN] is 1:3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 1:3."
