You have been the patient's physician for the past 6 years and know she is prepubescent. It is most appropriate to counsel the patient that if she wishes to have a family she will need to do which of the following?\n\nA. Adopt\nB. Have amniocentesis if she gets pregnant\nC. Have an operation\nD. Receive genetic counseling\n"

This can affect fertility, as women with TS typically cannot produce eggs successfully. Therefore, if the patient wishes to have children in the future, it might be necessary for her to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments using donor eggs, or consider adoption.\n\nGenetic counseling would be essential in this situation. A genetic counselor can provide detailed information about the condition, discuss the options available, help understand the risks and benefits associated with each option, and support the family throughout the decision-making process. They can also explain the possibility of using egg donation or surrogacy, if the patient decides to pursue biological parenthood."
