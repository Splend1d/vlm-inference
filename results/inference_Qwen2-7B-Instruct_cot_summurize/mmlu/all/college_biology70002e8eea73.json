These linkers are typically shorter than the DNA wrapped around the histone octamer core of a nucleosome and are more accessible to enzymes like DNase I.\n\nHistones themselves are not easily degraded by DNase because they are protected within the nucleosome structure. The nucleosome core, which consists of the histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, and the DNA wrapped around them, is also protected from DNase activity. The H1 histone, which can connect nucleosomes into higher order structures, is also protected similarly within its own environment within the chromatin fiber."
