Partitioning based clustering: This type of algorithm divides the dataset into a set of k groups, where k is predefined. Algorithms like K-means clustering belong to this category.\n\nB. K-means clustering: It's a partitioning technique that aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between points and their corresponding cluster centroids.\n\nC. Grid based clustering: This approach quantizes the object space into a finite number of cells that form a grid structure. Algorithms like STING (Statistical Information Grid and CLIQUE (CLustering In QUEst) are examples of grid-based clustering techniques. \n\nTherefore, all three options A, B, and C can be considered as spatial clustering algorithms."
