It was a late autunm afternoon, and the football team was practicing for its upcoming game against its archrival. While the team was practicing, the skies darkened as a storm approached. Minutes later, it began to rain heavily. Even though the storm intensified, the coach did not stop the practice because he had no reason to believe the storm presented a danger to his players. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck and killed the team's star player. This jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity, and a school board may be sued as a private entity. If the player's parents bring a wrongful death action against the coach and the high school board, will they prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the player was injured while engaged in a school activity.\nB. Yes, because under the circumstances the coach would be strictly liable.\nC. No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.\nD. No, because lightning is an act of God.\n"

                    "text": "If the jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity, the answer to whether the player's parents can prevail in their wrongful death action against the coach and the high school board depends on the specific facts and applicable laws. Generally, the outcome would depend on whether the coach's actions or omissions were found to be negligent or if the incident falls under an exception like an \"act of God.\"\n\nGiven the scenario:\n\nA. Yes, because the player was injured while engaged in a school activity: This option might seem plausible, but the key factor here is whether the coach's decision to continue practice during a severe storm amounted to negligence. The mere fact that the player was injured while participating in a school activity does not automatically lead to liability.\n\nB. Yes, because under the circumstances the coach would be strictly liable: Strict liability would apply only if there is a legal basis that imposes liability without regard to fault. Without more information about the legal framework and whether strict liability applies in such situations, this option is speculative.\n\nC. No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice: This answer is potentially correct if the coach exercised reasonable judgment in continuing the practice despite the worsening weather conditions. However, determining negligence requires a detailed analysis of the coach's knowledge, the foreseeability of harm, and adherence to reasonable safety standards.\n\nD. No, because lightning is an act of God: While natural disasters can sometimes provide a defense in negligence cases ( due to the difficulty of predicting such events or the inherent risks involved, the doctrine of \"acts of God\" is typically limited. It would not automatically absolve the coach or the school of liability if they failed to exercise reasonable care in light of the circumstances.\n\nTo determine if the parents will prevail, one would need to examine the specific legal standards applicable in the jurisdiction, including whether the school board is treated as a private entity, whether the coach's actions were unreasonable given the circumstances, and whether any other defenses or exceptions to liability apply. In most jurisdictions, the question would boil down to whether the coach breached a duty of care owed to the player, which could involve proving negligence based on the standard of care expected of a reasonable person in similar circumstances."
