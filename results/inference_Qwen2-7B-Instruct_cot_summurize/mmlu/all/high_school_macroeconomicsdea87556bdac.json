This high level of economic activity often leads to inflationary pressures as demand for goods and services outpaces the supply. The greatest threat to the macroeconomy during this phase is therefore likely to be inflation, as it can erode purchasing power, disrupt financial markets, and potentially lead to a decrease in investment and consumer spending if not managed properly by central banks through monetary policy adjustments."
