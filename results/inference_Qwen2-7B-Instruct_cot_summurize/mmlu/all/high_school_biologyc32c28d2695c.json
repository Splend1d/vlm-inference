The similarity of ATP synthase in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts is an example of convergent evolution.\nD.

Mitochondria are derived from ancient aerobic bacteria, and chloroplasts are derived from ancient photosynthetic bacteria.\n\nThis hypothesis best explains the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts based on endosymbiotic theory. According to this theory, early eukaryotic cells engulfed (or took in by endocytosis, smaller prokaryotic organisms (likely aerobic bacteria for mitochondria and photosynthetic bacteria for chloroplasts. Over time, these engulfed bacteria became integrated into the host cell, evolving into the organelles we see today with their own DNA, ribosomes, and membrane structures distinct yet compatible with the host's. The similar ATP synthase structure across these entities suggests they have a common ancestral origin, supporting the idea that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent organisms themselves."
