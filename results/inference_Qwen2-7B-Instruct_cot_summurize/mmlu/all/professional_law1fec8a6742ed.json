On August 1, the widower handed his friend a deed conveying the quarry to his niece and said to the friend, \"Give this to my niece. \" Unknown to the widower, the niece was in Africa. The next week, the friend properly recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office. One month later, the widower died, and in his will he devised the quarry to his daughter. Thereafter, the niece returned from Africa, and a dispute arose between the niece and the daughter regarding ownership of the quarry. In a suit to quiet title to the quarry, the court ruled in favor of the niece. The ruling was most likely based upon which of the following?\n\nA. There was an effective \"causa mortis\" gift.\nB. The delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to the friend.\nC. The delivery was effective when the friend recorded the deed.\nD. The deed was recorded before the devise was effectuated.\n"

                    "text": "The ruling was most likely based upon option B: The delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to the friend.\n\nIn property law, a \"delivery\" typically refers to the physical transfer of the deed from the grantor (in this case, the widower\u2014to the grantee (his friend. This act signifies that the grantor has relinquished all rights and interests in the property to the grantee. In the context of gifts or conveyances, the moment of delivery is often considered the moment when the property interest passes from the grantor to the grantee.\n\nGiven the scenario, the fact that the niece was unaware of the transaction at the time of delivery does not affect the validity of the deed once it was delivered to the intended recipient, who then properly recorded it. Therefore, the court's ruling in favor of the niece suggests that the deed was validly executed upon the widower's delivery of the deed to his friend, making option B the correct choice."
