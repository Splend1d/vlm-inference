Forecasts can indeed be made for both time-series and cross-sectional data, not exclusively for time-series data.\n- B. This statement is true. If a model is mis-specified ( meaning it does not accurately capture the underlying relationships in the data due to omitted variables, incorrect functional form, or other errors, its forecasts will likely be inaccurate.\n- C. The complexity of producing structural forecasts versus time series models is not inherently determined by the type of model but rather depends on the specific nature of the model and the data. Generally, structural models might require more assumptions and potentially more complex estimation procedures.\n- D. In-sample forecasting ability, which refers to how well a model fits the data it was trained on, is often a poor test of model adequacy because it may overestimate the model's predictive power. Models that perform well in-sample may not generalize well to out-of-sample data. More robust measures of model adequacy include out-of-sample testing, cross-validation, and checking for model assumptions like stationarity and independence of errors."
