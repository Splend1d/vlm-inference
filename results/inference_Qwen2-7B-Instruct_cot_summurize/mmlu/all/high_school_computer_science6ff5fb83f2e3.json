Compare the experimental results to the results provided by the simulation.\n\nThis action involves comparing the outcomes of the simulation with actual observations, which is a standard method for validating models. By conducting real-world experiments, you can gather empirical data that can be directly compared to the predictions made by the simulation. This comparison helps determine the accuracy and reliability of the simulation model."
