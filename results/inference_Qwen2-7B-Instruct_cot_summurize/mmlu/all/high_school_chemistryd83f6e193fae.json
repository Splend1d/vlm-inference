However, our calculation gives a much smaller value, suggesting we've made an error in interpreting the result directly from the molar mass.\n\nInstead, let's interpret the question correctly: since helium effuses much faster than the unknown gas, the unknown gas must have a higher molecular mass to cause this effect. The correct approach is to understand that if helium (He effuses faster than another gas, it means that the other gas has a higher molecular mass.\n\n- CO2 has a molecular mass of about 44 g/mol.\n- CH4 has a molecular mass of about 16 g/mol.\n- C5H12 (pentane, has a molecular mass of about 72 g/mol.\n- C8H18 octane, has a molecular mass of about 114 g/mol.\n\nSince helium effuses faster than the unknown gas, the unknown gas should have a higher molecular mass than helium. Thus, the correct answer is D. C8H18 (Octane, as it has the highest molecular mass among the options provided."
