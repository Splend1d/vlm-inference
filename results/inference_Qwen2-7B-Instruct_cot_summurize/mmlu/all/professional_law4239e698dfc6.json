In an attempt to encourage Betty to go on the wagon, Sally conveyed Greenacre to \"Friend and her heirs, but if liquor is ever consumed on the property, then to Betty.\" Sally conveyed Blackacre to \"Associate and her heirs, but if Associate ever consumes alcohol on the property, then to Betty.\" One year later, Friend and Associate both began hosting wine-tasting events on their properties, at which they each personally consumed substantial alcohol. Sally was so shocked that she had a stroke and died. The property interests of the following parcels of land should go to\n\nA. Betty // Betty\nB. Friend // Betty\nC. Betty // Associate\nD.

If liquor is ever consumed on the property, then it reverts to Betty. Similarly, Blackacre is held in trust for \"Associate and her heirs\", but if Associate ever consumes alcohol on the property, then it also reverts to Betty.\n\nIn this scenario, both Friend and Associate consumed alcohol on their respective properties. Therefore, according to the conditions set by Sally Sobriety, Greenacre should revert to Betty and Blackacre should also revert to Betty. However, since the question seems to ask which parcel goes to whom, and considering the structure of the question, the correct interpretation would be that Greenacre and Blackacre should both revert to Betty, as per the conditions set by Sally Sobriety. \n\nSo, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. Friend // Betty ( for Greenacre, and\n\nC. Betty // Associate for Blackacre."
