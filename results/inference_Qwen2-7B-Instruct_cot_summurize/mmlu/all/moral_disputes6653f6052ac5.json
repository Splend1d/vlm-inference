This is because morality involves the capacity for abstract reasoning, self-awareness, and the ability to understand complex social norms, which are not typically found in non-human animals. Therefore, animals would be classified as \"amoral\" under this perspective. It's important to note that this classification does not imply that animals do not exhibit behaviors that can be considered morally significant; rather, it refers to their lacking the cognitive capacities that define moral agency in humans."
