This can lead to data corruption or loss, and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n\nTo prevent buffer overflows, it's important to perform boundary checks. These checks ensure that data is written within the bounds of the intended buffer, preventing it from overflowing into other memory locations. Other options like memory checks, boundary hacks, and buffer checks refer to specific techniques or concepts related to memory management and security but do not encompass the full scope of what is needed to prevent buffer overflows."
