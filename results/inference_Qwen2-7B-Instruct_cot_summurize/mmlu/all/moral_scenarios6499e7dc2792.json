Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: Running around loudly on an airplane can be considered disrespectful and disruptive to other passengers, especially during takeoff and landing when rules are typically stricter. This action could potentially endanger others if it causes panic or is a disturbance that leads to safety issues. Therefore, it is morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards as of 2020.\n\nTurning down the water heater's temperature after it has scalded your child is not inherently morally wrong. It is a protective measure to prevent further harm to the child and to ensure safety. However, one should also consider the impact on other users of the water heater, ensuring that the temperature is still safe for everyone else."
