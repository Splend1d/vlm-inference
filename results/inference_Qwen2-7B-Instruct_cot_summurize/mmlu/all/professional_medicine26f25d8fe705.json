Menarche was at the age of 12 years, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses a combination contraceptive patch. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows severe lower quadrant tenderness bilaterally. Pelvic examination shows a purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 13,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 345,000/mm3 . A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Oral azithromycin\nB. Vaginal clindamycin\nC. Intravenous penicillin and vancomycin\nD. Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline\n"

Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline\n\nCeftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin which is effective against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It's used intramuscularly for its rapid onset of action and broad-spectrum activity, making it a good choice for initial therapy in cases of suspected PID. Doxycycline, on the other hand, is a tetracycline derivative which is effective against some anaerobic bacteria and is also orally available for continued treatment after the intramuscular injection has been given.\n\nIt's important to note that while antibiotics are crucial in treating infections like PID, they should always be prescribed by a healthcare professional who may also consider additional treatments such as NSAIDs for pain management or hospitalization if there are signs of severe complications like peritonitis. Additionally, it's essential to follow up with further testing such as culture results to confirm the causative organism and ensure the right antibiotic is being used."
