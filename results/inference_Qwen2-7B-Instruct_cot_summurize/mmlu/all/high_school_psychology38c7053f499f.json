A newborn gosling will \"attach\" to the first moving object it sees, usually its mother.\n\nImprinting is a type of learning that occurs during a specific sensitive period in development, and is most famously described in birds where chicks follow the first moving object they see after hatching, typically their mother. This behavior is crucial for survival as it ensures the offspring will follow and be cared for by their parent. \n\nOptions A, C, and D describe behaviors indicative of other forms of learning or attachment, but not imprinting specifically. For example:\n\nA. The behavior of a mother eagle flying under her young while they learn to fly is protective instinct rather than imprinting.\n\nC. An infant's indifference to primary caregivers if left alone for long periods could indicate attachment issues, but it's not specifically an example of imprinting.\n\nD. Teaching kittens to clean themselves is a form of parenting or learning through observation, not imprinting."
