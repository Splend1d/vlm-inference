As he consumes more units of a good (in this case, cake), the additional satisfaction (marginal benefit) gained from each subsequent unit decreases, eventually falling below the marginal cost (the opportunity cost or value given up by consuming that extra unit). This is why the ratio of marginal benefit to marginal cost would be less than one once Skylar starts taking additional pieces of cake."
