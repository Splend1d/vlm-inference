A friend of the woman had known the woman for years and knew that she was an easily excitable person. The friend also hated the woman's husband. Knowing that the woman was present, the friend drew a pistol and threatened to kill the husband. The woman suffered severe emotional distress as a result of witnessing this incident and soon afterward had a miscarriage. In an action by the woman against the friend for mental anguish resulting in her miscarriage, the woman will\n\nA. lose, because the friend did not intend for the woman to suffer a miscarriage.\nB. lose, because the friend's actions were directed against the husband, not the woman.\nC. win, because it was highly probable that the friend's extreme and outrageous conduct would cause emotional distress to the woman.\nD. win, because she is the husband's wife.\n"

                    "text": "C. win, because it was highly probable that the friend's extreme and outrageous conduct would cause emotional distress to the woman.\n\nIn tort law, particularly when dealing with claims for emotional distress leading to physical harm (such as a miscarriage in this case), courts often consider whether the defendant's actions were so extreme and outrageous that they would be expected to cause severe emotional distress to a reasonable person. This standard is typically referred to as \"intentional infliction of emotional distress\" ( (IIED).\n\nThe fact that the friend targeted the woman's husband does not automatically exclude the possibility of liability towards the pregnant woman. The court would likely consider the foreseeability of the emotional impact on the pregnant woman, given her known emotional state and the proximity of the incident to her pregnancy. Additionally, the fact that the friend had a prior dislike for the woman may contribute to the argument that the friend should have reasonably anticipated the potential for severe emotional distress in the pregnant woman.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option C seems most appropriate, as it correctly identifies the likely legal outcome given the context and potential for foreseeability of harm to the pregnant woman."
