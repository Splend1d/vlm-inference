However, based on general trends and studies about sexual behavior changes over decades, it's important to note that societal norms, education, and public health campaigns can influence people's behaviors.\n\nIf we consider that there might have been increased awareness about the risks associated with multiple sexual partnerships ( such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the promotion of monogamy, it could be plausible that the number of unmarried adults aged 20 to 45 reporting multiple partners might have declined during that time period.\n\nWithout detailed information, it's difficult to match this trend exactly to any of the options A through D. For a precise answer, you would need to consult a reliable source that provides historical data on sexual behavior trends in the United States from 1988 to 1990.\n\nFor educational purposes, it's worth noting that trends in sexual behavior can vary widely and are often influenced by factors such as technological advancements (like the internet and social media), cultural shifts, and public health initiatives."
