Latent learning refers to the acquisition of information or skills without immediate reinforcement or observable performance. In Kohler's experiments, he observed that bonobos could learn to perform complex tasks after initial attempts failed, suggesting they had stored the information and were capable of using it at a later time when conditions changed or when they were motivated to do so. This was contrary to prevailing theories that emphasized the need for immediate reinforcement for learning to take place."
