The transition to agriculture in Europe, known as the Neolithic Revolution, occurred somewhat later than in the Fertile Crescent (the region in the Middle East that is often considered the birthplace of agriculture. European farmers adopted farming practices and crops brought by migrating or trading groups from the Near East and North Africa. These included grains like emmer wheat and barley, lentils, and flax, which were adapted to European conditions over time. So, while some crops may have been further developed or adapted by European farmers, the original seeds and farming techniques generally came from elsewhere."
