Milton Friedman is a Monetarist.\n\nMilton Friedman was a prominent economist known for his significant contributions to the fields of economics, particularly in the areas of monetary theory and macroeconomics. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1976, which he shared with Ragnar Frisch. The prize recognized their pioneering work on econometric modeling, which involves the application of statistical methods to economic data to test hypotheses, forecast future trends, and develop economic policy. Friedman's work emphasized the role of monetary policy in influencing economic fluctuations and inflation, aligning him with the school of thought known as Monetarism. This perspective contrasts with Keynesian economics, which Friedman criticized for overemphasizing government intervention in the economy."
