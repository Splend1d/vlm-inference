The store clerk refused to sell it to him, because it was a \"house rule\" that the necklace was intended for women only. If the man brings suit against the store for its refusal to sell him the necklace, the man will\n\nA. lose, because the advertisement was intended only as an invitation to make an offer.\nB. lose, because the man did not notii' the store in writing that he intended to accept the offer.\nC. win, because the advertisement should be construed as a binding offer.\nD. win, because it is immaterial whether the man was the first customer to appear at the store to purchase the necklace.\n"

In this case, the advertisement states \"worth $125, now selling for $40,\" which could be interpreted as a clear offer to sell the necklace for $40. The phrase \"first come, first served\" further suggests that the offer is contingent upon who arrives first, making it more likely that the advertisement is an offer rather than just an invitation to negotiate.\n\nThe fact that the necklace was intended for women only does not affect the legal standing of the advertisement itself. The man's gender does not disqualify him from accepting the offer presented in the advertisement. Therefore, if he intended to accept the offer and was denied service based solely on his gender, he may have grounds to bring a lawsuit against the store for discrimination or breach of contract, depending on the jurisdiction and additional context provided. \n\nHowever, the specifics of the outcome would depend on the interpretation of the advertisement by the court, the laws applicable in the jurisdiction where the store is located, and any additional evidence or context that might be brought to light during the legal proceedings."
