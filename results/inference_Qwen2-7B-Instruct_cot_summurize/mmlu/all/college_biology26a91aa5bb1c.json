Photoperiod\n\nIn temperate ecosystems, plants often rely on photoperiod ( the length of the day and night cycle, as their primary environmental cue to trigger flowering. The number of hours of sunlight per day can vary significantly with the seasons, and plants have evolved to use this information to synchronize their growth cycles with seasonal changes. This allows them to flower during optimal times when resources like light, water, and pollinators are are most abundant.\n\nCircadian rhythms, changing air temperatures, and fluctuations in abscisic acid levels also play roles in plant physiology and development, but they do not provide the same reliable seasonal signals that photoperiod does for initiating flowering at the correct time of the year."
