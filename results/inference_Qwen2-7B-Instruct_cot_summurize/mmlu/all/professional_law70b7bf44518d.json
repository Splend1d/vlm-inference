After the son was arrested and given Miranda warnings, he confessed and admitted that he and his father took part in the bank robbery. The prosecution decided to charge the father and son in the same indictment and prosecute them together in a single trial. At trial, the son took the stand and recanted his earlier confession by denying participation in the robbery. The prosecution now seeks to introduce into evidence the son's earlier confession that was videotaped by the police. The son and the father both object to its admissibility. The confession should be\n\nA. admitted against the son only.\nB. admitted against both the son and the father, because they were engaged in a conspiracy.\nC. not admitted against the son or the father, because the confession is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. not admitted against the son or the father, because the son recanted the confession.\n"

The son's confession, being it was made while he was under lawful custody of the police, would typically be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. This exception is known as a statement against interest. The fact that the son later recanted his confession does not automatically render it inadmissible. However, the jury would be instructed to consider the circumstances surrounding the confession and the son's recantation when evaluating its credibility.\n\nRegarding the conspiracy argument (B), if there is evidence suggesting that the father and son were indeed engaged in a conspiracy, this could potentially allow the confession to be admitted against both, but this would depend on the specifics of the case, including the strength of the evidence linking the father to the conspiracy and his knowledge of the son's confession.\n\nOption C ( \"not admitted against the son or the father, because the confession is hearsay not within any recognized exception\" is incorrect because the confession is not hearsay; it is an admission of the defendant. \n\nOption D \"not admitted against the son or the father, because the son recanted the confession\" is also incorrect for the reasons explained above regarding the admissibility of statements against interest and the role of a jury in assessing the credibility of such statements."
