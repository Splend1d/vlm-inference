Contribution refers to the sharing of liability among two or more parties who are jointly and severally liable for a loss. Indemnity, on the other hand, involves compensation for losses suffered by one party due to the actions of another.\n\nIn this case, since the employee was found to be at fault for the accident, the furniture store would be entitled to recover the full amount of the damages awarded to the plaintiff ($25,000), assuming there is no specific agreement between the employee and the employer that limits the store's ability to recover from the employee. This is typically the case when the employee's actions were within the scope of their employment and caused harm to a third party.\n\nTherefore, the furniture store would recover the full $25,000 from the employee, as the employee is legally responsible for the damages incurred due to their own negligence."
