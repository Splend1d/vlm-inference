Total Variable Costs - This is correct because the cost increases or decreases based on the quantity of pizzas produced.\n\nIII. Marginal Cost - This is also correct because marginal cost refers to the cost of producing one additional unit, and the sauce cost would be directly related to producing an additional pizza.\n\nI. Total Fixed Costs - This is incorrect because fixed costs do not change with the level of production, and the sauce cost does change as more pizzas are made.\n\nIV. Total Costs - This is correct because total costs are the sum of both fixed and variable costs, so including the variable cost of sauce in the total cost calculation is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **D. II, III, and IV only**."
