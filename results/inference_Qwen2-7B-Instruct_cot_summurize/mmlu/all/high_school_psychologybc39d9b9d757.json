Myelin sheaths, which are produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, insulate axons. This insulation allows for the efficient propagation of electrical signals along the axon, much like how a power cable with insulation allows electricity to flow more efficiently over longer distances."
