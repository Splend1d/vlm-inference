Fibre sources, such as hemicelluloses, pectins, and inulin, are rapidly fermented to short chain fatty acids, which have a trophic effect on the colon.\n\nExplanation:\n- A) While some fermentation does occur in the gut, the primary products of fiber fermentation are not malic, succinic, and propionic acids; rather, they are primarily acetate, propionate, and butyrate.\n- B) Fermentation studies in vitro show that different types of fibers ( both soluble and insoluble - can take longer than 24 hours to ferment, depending on the type of fiber and the microbial composition of the gut.\n- C) This statement is accurate because many types of dietary fiber, including hemicelluloses, pectins, and inulin, are fermented by gut bacteria, leading to the production of short-chain fatty acids like acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These fatty acids provide nutrients for the cells lining the colon and can help maintain gut health.\n- D) Stool bulking does indeed occur through the action of both soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibers absorb water and help to form a gel-like substance that aids in bowel movements, while insoluble fibers add bulk to the stool by absorbing water and making it easier to pass."
