They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nThe description in the second paragraph of the procedures that Portuguese and other foreigners followed when trading in China supports which of the following inferences about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty?\n\nA. The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise.\nB. The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.\nC. The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity.\nD. The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year.\n"

The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.\n\nThe passage describes specific rules and restrictions that the Portuguese had to follow when trading in China, such as staying for only certain days, having their names recorded upon entering and exiting the city, and being confined to their boats outside of the town. These details suggest that the Ming Dynasty was actively managing foreign trade and interaction, potentially aiming to control commerce, monitor activities, and facilitate tax collection. This aligns with the inference that the dynasty sought strict regulation over trade to manage contact with foreigners."
