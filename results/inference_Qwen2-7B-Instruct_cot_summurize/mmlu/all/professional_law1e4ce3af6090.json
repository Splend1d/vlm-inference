This bid was $30,000 lower than the construction company's next lowest bid for the kitchen work. As a result, the construction company lowered its bid by $20,000 before submitting it to the hospital board. After the construction company was awarded the construction bid and had accepted the subcontractor's offer, the subcontractor discovered that in his preparation of the quotation, he had overlooked some subsidiary kitchen installments required by the plans. Immediately thereafter, the subcontractor brought suit for rescission of the contract. It should\n\nA. prevail, because of the unilateral mistake.\nB. prevail, because the mistake was an essential element of the bargain.\nC. not prevail, unless the construction company knew or should have known of the subcontractor \u0080\u0098s error.\nD. not prevail, because the computation mistake was antecedent to acceptance of the bid.\n"

The subcontractor would not prevail in this situation because the mistake made by the subcontractor was unilateral (meaning it only affected one party (the subcontractor) and was not an essential element of the bargain between the subcontractor and the construction company. Additionally, there is no indication that the construction company was aware or should have been aware of the subcontractor's error prior to accepting the bid.\n\nIn contract law, mistakes can sometimes lead to a voidable contract if they meet certain criteria such as mutual mistake, mistake of a material fact, or reliance on a mistake. However, in this scenario, the mistake was unilateral and did not involve any reliance by the construction company on incorrect information provided by the subcontractor. Therefore, the subcontractor would not be able to rescind the contract based on their own mistake alone."
