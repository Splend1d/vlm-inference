One of her largest spaces was rented on a month-to-month basis at $500 per month by a dance troop which held performances in the facility. The director of the dance troop moved to New York for a starring role Off-Broadway. Unfortunately the troop was unable to find another dance director, so it folded and vacated the space. Sally Sleazy learned of the closure and decided the location would be perfect for a topless strip joint. Sally rented the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month without disclosing her intended use of the space. One month after the strip joint opened, the County Commissioners passed a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally told Loretta the new law made it impossible to operate the business, so she was leaving. If Loretta then sued Sally for breach of the lease contract, the likely outcome is a judgment for\n\nA. Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.\nB. Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.\nC. Loretta, only if she did not know of the use Sally intended for the space.\nD. Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.\n"

Sally**, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.\n\nWhen a party is unable to perform their contractual obligations due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control, such as a change in law that makes the performance illegal or practically impossible, they may argue that the contract has been frustrated. In this case, the new law prohibiting topless strip joints in the neighborhood effectively makes it impossible for Sally to continue operating the business as per the terms of the lease. This is known as \"frustration of purpose,\" where the fundamental reason for entering into the contract is no longer achievable due to external factors.\n\nHowever, the specific legal outcome can depend on the jurisdiction's laws regarding frustration of contracts and the terms of the lease agreement. If the lease contains a clause addressing changes in law or unforeseen events, that could affect the outcome. Without such a clause, the court would likely rule in favor of Sally based on the principle of frustration of purpose.\n\nOption C suggests that Loretta's knowledge of Sally's intended use might affect the outcome, but in the context of frustration of purpose, this is not typically a factor unless there is a specific provision in the lease contract that addresses this scenario.\n\nOption D argues for Sally based on the concept of discharge under impossibility of performance. While Sally might argue this point, the more immediate argument in this case would be frustration of purpose due to the new law. However, both concepts could apply depending on the specifics of the lease and local law."
