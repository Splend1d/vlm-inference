This aligns with option A. \n\nHans Carens, a Canadian philosopher, argues that liberal egalitarian principles, which emphasize justice, equality, and respect for individual rights, should lead to a more welcoming stance on immigration. He critiques the notion that immigration policies should be strictly controlled or limited based on economic or cultural considerations, advocating instead for policies that respects the fundamental rights of individuals to seek asylum and contribute to society.\n\nIn his book \"The Rights of Others: Aliens, Immigrants, and International Responsibility,\" Carens argues that immigration policies should prioritize fairness, justice, and respect for human dignity over concerns about national interests or economic impacts. He contends that liberal egalitarianism requires states to consider the moral obligations they have towards people seeking refuge and that these obligations extend beyond their own borders.\n\nTherefore, while each of the options you've provided may reflect aspects of discussions around immigration and liberal egalitarianism, Carens's main conclusion most closely aligns with option A: that liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees."
