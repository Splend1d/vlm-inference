The presence of free oxygen facilitated the rapid formation of organic molecules.\n\nThis statement is not correct based on our current understanding of the history of life and atmospheric conditions on Earth. The presence of free oxygen actually occurred much later in Earth's history, around 2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event. Before this time, Earth's atmosphere contained little or no oxygen, which allowed for the formation of organic molecules under different chemical conditions than those present with high oxygen levels."
