Physiological tolerance and withdrawal is the strongest evidence of a patient's addiction to a substance. \n\nPhysiological tolerance refers to the body's adaptation to the substance, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect. Withdrawal symptoms occur when the substance is discontinued or reduced in use, indicating physical dependence on the substance.\n\nWhile B ( a positive urine test for the substance can confirm recent or past use, it does not necessarily indicate addiction. \n\nC. Serious occupational impairment might suggest that the substance use has affected the person's work performance, but it could be due to other factors as well.\n\nD. Denial of any involvement with the substance is common in individuals struggling with addiction, as they may deny the problem or minimize its impact, which makes it an unreliable indicator of addiction."
