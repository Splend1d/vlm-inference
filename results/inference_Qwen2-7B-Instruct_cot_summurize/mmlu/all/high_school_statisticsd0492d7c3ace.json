Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that:\n\n- The area to the left of z = -2.53 ( represents the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces.\n\nLooking up -2.53 in a standard normal distribution table, we get a value close to 0.0057.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. 0.0057**."
