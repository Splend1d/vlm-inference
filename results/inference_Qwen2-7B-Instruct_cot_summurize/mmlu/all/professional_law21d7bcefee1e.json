Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. In 2010, the farmer wanted to move back to the tract because he desired to return to the country. Finding the man in possession, the farmer initiated a suit in ejectment against the man. The most probable judicial determination would be\n\nA. the farmer would lose, because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous.\nB. the farmer would lose, because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.\nC. the farmer would win, because the man's possession was not continuous.\nD. the farmer would win, because he is the titleholder of record.\n"

This means he has met the legal requirements to claim ownership through adverse possession. Since the farmer only returned to the property in 2010, after the man had already established his adverse possession, the court is likely to rule in favor of the man, granting him the right to continue occupying the land."
