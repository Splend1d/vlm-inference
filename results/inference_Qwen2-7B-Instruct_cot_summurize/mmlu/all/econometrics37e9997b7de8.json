Use a logarithmic functional form instead of a linear one\n\nWhen dealing with residual non-normality, one common approach is to transform the data to achieve normality or stabilize variance. Taking the logarithm of the dependent variable or some of the independent variables can help address non-normality, especially if the relationship between the variables is not strictly linear but rather multiplicative or exponential. This transformation can also help in stabilizing the variance across different levels of the independent variables, which is another assumption of many statistical models.\n\nThe other options may also have their uses under specific circumstances, but they are not necessarily aimed at addressing non-normality:\n\nB. Adding lags of the variables on the right-hand side of the regression model could help account for autocorrelation in time series data, which might lead to non-normal residuals.\n\nC. Estimating the model in first-differenced form is typically used when there is evidence of non-stationarity or unit roots in the data, aiming to make the series stationary and thus potentially addressing issues like spurious regression results.\n\nD. Removing large outliers from the data might help improve the normality of the residuals, but it can also bias the results if the outliers are not errors but legitimate extreme values that should be accounted for in the analysis."
