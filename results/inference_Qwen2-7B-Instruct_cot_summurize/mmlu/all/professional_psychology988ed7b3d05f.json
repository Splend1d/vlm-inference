Research indicates that ongoing conflict between the parents can negatively impact children's emotional well-being, academic performance, and social functioning. This includes disputes over custody, visitation, finances, or other issues related to the separation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that each situation is unique, and various factors can influence a child's adjustment to divorce. Other options might also play a role in specific circumstances:\n- **Withdrawal of the more disturbed parent** ( could affect the child if the parent is unable to provide necessary support or care.\n- **Residence of the child with the preferred parent** might initially seem like a significant factor, but studies suggest that children often adjust better when both parents remain involved in their lives.\n- **Degree of hostility during the divorce process** can contribute to stress for the children, but its impact might be mitigated by post-divorce parental behavior and support systems in place.\n\nIn summary, while all these factors can influence a child's adjustment, the degree of continued conflict between the parents after the divorce tends to have a notable effect on the child's well-being."
