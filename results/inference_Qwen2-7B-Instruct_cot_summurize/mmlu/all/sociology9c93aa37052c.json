The idea of race is socially constructed through powerful ideologies.\n\nTheories of racialized discourse propose that the concept of race is not based on innate, biological differences among human beings, but rather is a social construct that has been developed and maintained by various powerful ideologies and systems of power. These theories often critique the use of race as a tool for social stratification, discrimination, and inequality. They emphasize the role of historical, political, and cultural factors in shaping racial categories and identities, and argue that these constructs can change over time."
