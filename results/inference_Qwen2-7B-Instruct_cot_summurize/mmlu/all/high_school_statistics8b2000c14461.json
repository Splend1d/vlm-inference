The first study is an observational study, while the second is a controlled experiment.\n\nExplanation:\nAn observational study involves observing the effect of a variable without attempting to influence it. In the first study, researchers compare the weights of two groups ( meat-eaters and vegetarians without influencing their dietary habits. Therefore, this is an observational study.\n\nA controlled experiment, on the other hand, involves manipulating one or more variables to determine if changes in one variable cause changes in another. In the second study, the researchers actively assign participants to either a meat meal group or a vegetarian diet group and then observe the effects over time. This manipulation of dietary habits makes it a controlled experiment."
