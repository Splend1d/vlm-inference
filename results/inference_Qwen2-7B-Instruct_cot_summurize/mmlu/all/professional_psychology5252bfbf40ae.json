For instance, studies have shown that maternal stress during pregnancy can lead to changes in the fetus's cortisol levels, which might impact the baby's stress response system even before birth. This can also affect the baby's growth and development.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the exact nature and extent of these effects are complex and influenced by many factors. The mother's emotional state interacts with other biological and environmental factors to shape the development of the fetus. While maternal emotions can play a role, they do not solely determine the child's emotional orientation or development, as genetics, postnatal environment, and other factors also significantly contribute."
