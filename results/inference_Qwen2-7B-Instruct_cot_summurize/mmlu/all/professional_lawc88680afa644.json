The boss directly suggested that if the defendant did not go out on a date with him, she would be fired in one week. Every day during the remainder of the week, the boss approached the defendant with his demand, and the defendant refused to cooperate. At the end of the week, when the boss called the defendant into his office and again tried to pressure her to go out on a date with him, the defendant knocked him unconscious with a giant stapler and choked him to death. The defendant is tried for murder. In accordance with the following statute, the state relies at trial on the presumption of malice:\"When the act of killing another is proved, malice aforethought shall be presumed, and the burden shall rest upon the party who committed the killing to show that malice did not exist. \"If the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder and challenges her conviction on the grounds of the above statute, on appeal she will\n\nA. win, because the statute is unconstitutional.\nB. win, because the statute violates due process.\nC. lose, because she failed to overcome the presumption.\nD. lose, because the presumption may be rebutted.\n"

According to the provided statute, when the act of killing another is proved, malice aforethought shall be presumed, and the burden rests on the person who committed the killing to show that malice did not exist.\n\nSince the defendant was convicted of murder, it implies that the jury found sufficient evidence to support the state's case that the killing was done with malice aforethought. To overturn this conviction on appeal, the defendant would need to demonstrate that there was a legal error or insufficiency in the evidence presented at trial. The fact that the defendant failed to overcome the presumption of malice does not automatically result in an overturned conviction. Instead, it is part of the state's case against the defendant.\n\nThe defendant's challenge to the conviction would likely focus on whether the state's case met the standard of proof required for a murder conviction, which is \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" This could include examining the sufficiency of the evidence, any errors made by the trial court, or potential flaws in the legal arguments used by the prosecution. Without additional information about the specifics of the trial and the defendant's appeal arguments, it is not possible to definitively predict the outcome of the appeal. However, given the nature of the presumption of malice, the defendant would have a challenging task in overcoming it to successfully argue for acquittal or a reduction in the charge."
