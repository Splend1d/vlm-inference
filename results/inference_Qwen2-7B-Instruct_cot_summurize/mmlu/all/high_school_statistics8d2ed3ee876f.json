The binomial distribution is used when there are two possible outcomes (in this case, a cyclone either becomes a hurricane or does not.\n\nThe formula for the binomial distribution is:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (q^{n-k} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials ( (in this case, 5 cyclones),\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful outcomes ( (we're interested in at least 3 hurricanes, so \\( k = 3, 4, \\) or \\( 5 \\)),\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (the probability of a cyclone becoming a hurricane, which is \\( \\frac{5.1}{8.7} \\)),\n- \\( q \\) is the probability of failure on a single trial ( \\( 1 - p \\),\n- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \\( \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\( p \\):\n\\[ p = \\frac{5.1}{8.7} \\approx 0.586 \\]\n\nThen, calculate \\( q \\):\n\\[ q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.586 = 0.414 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the probabilities for \\( k = 3, 4, \\) and \\( 5 \\):\n\nFor \\( k = 3 \\):\n\\[ P(X = 3) = \\binom{5}{3} (p^3 q^{5-3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} (0.586^3 (0.414^2} \\]\n\\[ P(X = 3) = 10 * (0.586^3 * 0.414^2 \\approx 0.293 \\]\n\nFor \\( k = 4 \\):\n\\[ P(X = 4) = \\binom{5}{4} p^4 q^{5-4} = \\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} (0.586^4 (0.414)^1 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 4) = 5 * 0.586^4 * 0.414 \\approx 0.345 \\]\n\nFor \\( k = 5 \\):\n\\[ P(X = 5) = \\binom{5}{5} p^5 q^{5-5} = \\frac{5!}{5!(5-5)!} (0.586^5 (0.414^0} \\]\n\\[ P(X = 5) = 1 * 0.586^5 \\approx 0.137 \\]\n\nTo find the total probability that at least 3 cyclones become hurricanes, add these probabilities together:\n\\[ P(X \\geq 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) \\]\n\\[ P(X \\geq 3) = 0.293 + 0.345 + 0.137 = 0.775 \\]\n\nIt seems there was a miscalculation in the final step.
