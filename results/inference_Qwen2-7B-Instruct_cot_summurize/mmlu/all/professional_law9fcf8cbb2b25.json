At trial, the jury found each of the drivers liable for negligence. The jury found that the amount of the truck driver's injuries was $10,000, and the amount of the car driver's injuries was $8,000. The jury assigned 50 percent of the fault for the accident to the truck driver and 50 percent of the fault to the car driver. Assume that the jurisdiction has a statute in effect that provides: \"Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action to recover damages for negligence resulting in injury to person or property if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought. Any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. \"Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?\n\nA. The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.\nB. The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\nC. The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.\nD. Neither party recovers anything from the other.\n"

Since both drivers were found to be equally at fault (each with 50% responsibility for the accident, we need to apply this principle.\n\nThe total damages awarded by the jury are $10,000 ( (for the truck driver) + $8,000 ( (for the car driver) = $18,000.\n\nUnder the contributory negligence statute, if the negligence of the plaintiff (in this case, either driver) is less than the defendant's negligence, the plaintiff can still recover damages, but they will be reduced in proportion to their degree of fault.\n\nSince both drivers share equal fault, the damages should be split equally between them, considering the total damages awarded. \n\nThus, each driver's recovery should be half of the total damages awarded, which is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal damages awarded = $18,000\n\nRecovery per driver = Total damages awarded / 2 = $18,000 / 2 = $9,000\n\nHowever, there seems to be a discrepancy in the calculation process due to the provided options, which suggest a reduction in damages based on the percentage of fault (50% for each driver. The correct approach under the given circumstances should indeed reflect a 50-50 split of the total damages awarded, not a reduction based on the percentage of fault as initially explained.\n\nGiven the options, and assuming a misunderstanding in the explanation leading to confusion, the correct answer reflectinging a straightforward 50-50 split of the total damages awarded without additional reductions (would logically be:\n\nA. The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.\n\nThis option directly represents a scenario where each driver receives the total damages awarded to them, divided equally based on the total damages awarded to all parties involved, not adjusted according to the percentage of fault as initially described. The initial explanation inadvertently led to a misinterpretation of how to apply the statute correctly. The correct application here does not involve reducing the damages based on fault percentages after determining the total damages award."
