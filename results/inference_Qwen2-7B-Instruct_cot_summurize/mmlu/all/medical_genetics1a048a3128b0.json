X-linked recessive\n\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, males (who have only one X chromosome\u2014denoted as XY\u2014will exhibit the traits if they inherit the recessive gene on their single X chromosome from their mother. This is because they do not have a second X chromosome to mask the expression of the recessive trait. Females, having two X chromosomes (XX, would need to inherit the recessive gene on both their X chromosomes for the trait to be expressed, which is less common than males inheriting the trait. Therefore, conditions that follow an X-linked recessive pattern can often be transmitted from a carrier female to her son, who will express the trait because he has only one X chromosome."
