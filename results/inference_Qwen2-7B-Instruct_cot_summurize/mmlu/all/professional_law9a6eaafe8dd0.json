The order form expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. In July the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications, but stating that \"shipment will be made in two deliveries, half by August 10 and the other half by August 20.\" When shipment was not made by August 1, the retailer withdrew the order. Will the manufacturer prevail in enforcing a contract?\n\nA. Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.\nB. Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.\nC. No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.\nD. No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.\n"

No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.\n\nThe key here is that the retailer's order form specified that acceptance was limited to the terms of the offer. The manufacturer's confirmation did not meet this condition by indicating a different delivery schedule ( specifically, that it would ship half the order by August 10 and the other half by August 20. This change to the delivery terms constitutes a material alteration of the original offer, which the retailer agreed to by not objecting or withdrawing the order within a reasonable time frame following the manufacturer's confirmation. Since the terms of the acceptance did not align with those of the original offer, no contract was formed under these circumstances."
