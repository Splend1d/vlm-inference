In his thinking, this notion can be seen as incoherent for several reasons, but one key perspective aligns with option A: because dead people no longer exist, and thus cannot benefit from choosing to die. \n\nKass's view on this topic is nuanced and involves complex ethical considerations about the value of life, suffering, and the human condition. He argues that the quality of life is not merely a matter of existence but also of living well\u2014having meaningful experiences, relationships, and personal growth. For Kass, the idea that someone might prefer death over their current situation implies a fundamental misunderstanding of what constitutes a good life. \n\nThe incoherence arises when one considers that the choice to be \"better off dead\" presupposes an ability to experience benefits from death, which is not possible since death entails the cessation of all conscious experience and existence. Thus, for Kass, the concept of being \"better off dead\" conflates the reality of non-existence with the desire for relief from suffering, leading to a logical inconsistency."
