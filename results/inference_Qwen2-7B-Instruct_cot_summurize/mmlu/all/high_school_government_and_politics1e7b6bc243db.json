Typically, the general population is less ideological than the delegates.\n\nExplanation:\nDelegates to presidential nomination conventions are often chosen based on their loyalty to a particular political ideology and candidate within their party. They tend to be more ideologically aligned with the party's platform and the views of the party's leadership. This means that delegates are likely to be more ideological than the average member of the general population, which can be more diverse in its political beliefs."
