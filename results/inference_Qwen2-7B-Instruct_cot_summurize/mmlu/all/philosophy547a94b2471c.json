He doesn't directly align with the options provided in a straightforward manner, but if we interpret these choices in light of his theories:\n\nC. Stevenson would likely identify the meaning of a term with the psychological causes and effects it has a tendency to be connected with. This is because he focuses on the context and the pragmatic implications of speech acts. The meaning of a term is not just about its literal application or synonyms ( as suggested by option A and D, nor solely about internal psychological processes ( as implied by option B.\n\nStevenson's approach to meaning involves understanding how terms function within conversations and how they influence the actions and beliefs of those involved. Therefore, the meaning of a term could be seen as being tied to the potential psychological impacts and the context in which it is used, aligning closely with choice C."
