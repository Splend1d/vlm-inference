At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.\nB. No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the company\u00d5s promise was supported by consideration.\nD. Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.\n"

Yes, because the company's promise was supported by consideration.\n\nIn this scenario, the modification of the contract price from $100 million to $101 million was indeed supported by consideration. Consideration refers to something of value exchanged between the parties in a contract. In this case, the builder provided an additional service (adjusting the price to account for the unforeseen increase in the cost of structural steel - which was not within their control. This adjustment resulted in extra work and potentially higher costs for the builder, thus providing adequate consideration for the modification. Therefore, the builder could argue that they have fulfilled their part of the bargain under the modified contract, and the company should pay the additional $1 million as per the oral agreement.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because even though the modification was not formally written or accompanied by direct monetary compensation, it still involved a quid pro quo ( (\"something for something\") arrangement that is generally sufficient for consideration in many jurisdictions. Option D is also incorrect because the fairness and equity of the situation do not directly determine whether a contract modification is enforceable; rather, the existence of consideration does. However, these factors might be relevant in a court's decision-making process regarding the enforceability of the modification."
