Both the normal distribution and the t-distribution are symmetric about their mean.\n- B. This statement is also true. The t-distribution has heavier tails compared to the normal distribution, which means it's lower at the mean and higher in the tails.\n- C. This statement is correct as well. As the degrees of freedom ( (df) increase, the t-distribution approaches the shape of the standard normal distribution.\n- D. This statement is false. The 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule, applies specifically to normal distributions. It does not accurately describe the spread of t-distributions, especially for small degrees of freedom. The rule becomes less applicable or inaccurate as the degrees of freedom decrease because the t-distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution. Therefore, the 68-95-99.7 rule does not work better for t-models as the degrees of freedom get smaller; it actually becomes less reliable."
