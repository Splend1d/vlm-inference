It might consider using force abroad to promote human rights, democracy, or other \"good\" things as potentially problematic if it involves intervention without the consent of the affected nation or if it infringes on national sovereignty. Idealists generally advocate for international cooperation and moral leadership, suggesting that diplomacy, economic incentives, and soft power should be preferred over military intervention when possible."
