He has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months. Vital signs now are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 78/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is thin and is in no acute distress. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered bilateral basilar crackles. There is mild left hip pain present with both active and passive range of motion. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact. Neurologic examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\n\nA. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head\nB. Herniated nucleus pulposus\nC. Narrowing of the hip joint\nD. Osteoporosis\n"

Avascular necrosis of the femoral head\n\nGlucocorticoids can lead to osteonecrosis, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions like sarcoidosis that may involve the lungs and result in chronic hypoxia or other systemic effects. Avascular necrosis typically presents with pain in the affected limb, particularly with weight-bearing activities, and can be associated with decreased range of motion and potential signs on imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans. \n\nWhile options B ( Herniated nucleus pulposus, C Narrowing of the hip joint (Osteoarthritis, and D Osteoporosis could also potentially cause leg pain, they are less likely given the patient's history and symptoms. Herniated nucleus pulposus would more commonly cause radicular pain and weakness in the leg, narrowing of the hip joint would typically manifest with pain during movement of the hip joint itself, and osteoporosis usually causes more diffuse skeletal pain rather than localized leg pain specifically exacerbated by weight-bearing activities."
