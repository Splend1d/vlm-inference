The longshoreman was an employee of a company that had contracted with the ship's owner to load and unload the ship. The fall occurred at night, when loading work was over for the day, and there was no reason for the longshoreman to have been near the hatch. A negligence action was filed against the ship's owner for the death of the longshoreman. In that action, the owner has moved for summary judgment and has provided unrebutted evidence that it is customary for the crews of ships to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ships. How should the court respond to the motion?\n\nA. Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence.\nB. Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner should win if the longshoreman was improperly near the hatch.\nC. Deny the motion, because the probability of serious injury caused by falling down an open hatch clearly outweighs the burden of keeping the hatch closed.\nD. Grant the motion, because the custom should be considered conclusive on the issue of negligence.\n"

Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence.\n\nIn assessing a motion for summary judgment, the court must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact that preclude granting the motion. In this case, the evidence presented by the ship's owner establishes a custom of opening hatches for ventilation, but this custom does not conclusively establish the ship's owner's lack of negligence in this particular instance. The circumstances surrounding the accident (such as the time of day, the fact that the longshoreman was not performing any work-related duties, and the absence of any reason for him to be near the hatch - suggest that the standard of care might have been breached. \n\nTherefore, the court should deny the motion for summary judgment, allowing the case to proceed to the jury. The jury should be instructed that while the custom of opening hatches is relevant, it is not conclusive evidence of the ship's owner's negligence. The jury will need to consider all the evidence, including the custom, in determining whether the ship's owner was negligent in this specific case."
