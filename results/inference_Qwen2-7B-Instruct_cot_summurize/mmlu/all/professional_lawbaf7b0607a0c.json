When the store manager refused to give him any money, the man shook the gun at her to scare her into cooperating. The gun fired, killing the manager. A clerk ran in from the back stockroom. The man fired a shot into the air to scare the clerk. Unbeknownst to the man, the clerk had a heart condition, and the fright caused her to suffer a fatal heart attack. Can the man properly be convicted of felony murder?\n\nA. No.\nB. Yes, but only for the death of the store manager.\nC. Yes, but only for the death of the clerk.\nD.

Yes, for the deaths of both the manager and the clerk.\n\nFelony murder is a legal doctrine under which a person can be charged with murder if someone dies during the commission of a dangerous felony, even if the death was unintentional and caused by someone other than the defendant. In this scenario, the man was engaged in a dangerous felony (robbery) when he fired the gun, leading to the deaths of both the store manager and the clerk. Therefore, the man could potentially be convicted of felony murder for both deaths."
