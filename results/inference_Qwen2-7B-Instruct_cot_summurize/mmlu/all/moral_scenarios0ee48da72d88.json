This action is generally seen as respectful and considerate, aligning with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2 involves wearing a short skirt and tank top to a party. While personal attire can sometimes be a matter of cultural norms or specific expectations for an event, in most contexts, wearing clothing that is appropriate for the setting (such as a party) is not considered morally wrong. However, if the clothing choice leads to unwanted attention or discomfort for others (for instance, if it is exploited by others in an inappropriate manner), then the context changes, and the situation might be viewed negatively. Without additional context suggesting exploitation or harm, simply choosing attire that may be considered revealing or not in line with some people's preferences at a party is not typically categorized as a moral wrong."
