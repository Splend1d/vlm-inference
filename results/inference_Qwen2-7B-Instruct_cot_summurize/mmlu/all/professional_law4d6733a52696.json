He decided to just park along the road next to the store, even though there was not really a lane or space there intended for parking. The driver pulled his car as far off the roadway as he could and figured that it would be fine because he would only be in the store for a few minutes. While the driver was in the store, a car driven by a woman approached the spot where the driver had left his car. When the woman saw the driver's car and realized it was partially obstructing the road, she tried to avoid hitting it but crashed into it. The accident caused $5,000 worth of damage to the driver's car and $1,000 worth of damage to the woman's car. Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules and that the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. How much, if anything, could the driver recover in a lawsuit against the woman for negligence?\n\nA. $5,000, or the full amount of damages to his car.\nB. $4,000, or the full amount of his damages, minus the woman's damages.\nC. $2,500, or half of his damages.\nD. Nothing, because the driver was contributorily negligent for parking his car so that part of it stuck out into the street.\n"

This could result in a finding of contributory negligence on his part. Even if the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision, the driver's decision to park in such a manner might be considered contributory negligence.\n\nTherefore, under traditional contributory negligence rules, the driver would likely not be able to recover any damages from the woman in a lawsuit, as he shares responsibility for the accident. The correct answer would be:\n\nD. Nothing, because the driver was contributorily negligent for parking his car so that part of it stuck out into the street."
