Since 54,321 is odd, it's not divisible by 2.\n2. **Move to the next prime number**, which is **3**. Divide 54,321 by 3:\n   \\[\n   54,321 \\div 3 = 18,107\n   \\]\n3. **Now, check if 18,107 is divisible by any prime numbers**. We can test for divisibility by primes in order: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. It turns out that 18,107 is divisible by 13:\n   \\[\n   18,107 \\div 13 = 1,393\n   \\]\n4. **Check if 1,393 is divisible by any prime numbers**. Testing for divisibility, we find that 1,393 is divisible by 19:\n   \\[\n   1,393 \\div 19 = 73\n   \\]\n5. **Since 73 is a prime number**, we have completed our prime factorization.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 54,321 is:\n\\[\n54,321 = 3 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 73\n\\]\n\nThe largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321 and considering its prime factors would be the product of all these prime factors since removing any of them would result in a smaller number:\n\\[\n3 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 73 = 18,107\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 18,107**."
