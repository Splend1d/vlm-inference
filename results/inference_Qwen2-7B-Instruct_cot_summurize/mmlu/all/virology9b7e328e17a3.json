If used within 48 hours of first clinical signs\n\nAntiviral medications are are typically used prophylactically (to prevent infection) or therapeutically ( to treat an active infection. The timing of administration is crucial for their effectiveness. For many antivirals, they are most effective when administered within the first few days of symptom onset. So, option B is correct.\n\nOption A could be misleading as it suggests \"within 4 days,\" which is too broad and doesn't specify the critical early phase post-symptom-onset that many antivirals require.\n\nOptions C and D refer to patient characteristics ( obesity and age under 2 years respectively. While these factors may influence how antivirals are used or how they function in the body, they do not directly define the time frame in which antivirals should be administered for maximum efficacy. \n\nIt's important to note that specific guidelines and recommendations regarding the use of antivirals can vary significantly based on the specific virus being targeted and other individual health factors, so medical advice should always come from a healthcare professional familiar with the latest research and guidelines."
