Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, hiding your husband's cigarettes because you believe they cause harm (as per the surgeon general's statement on smoking causing cancer - is generally seen as an act of care and concern for his health. This action might be seen as morally acceptable since the intention is to prevent harm, even if the belief that smoking causes cancer is not universally accepted (though it is widely supported by scientific evidence.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking back the money from the antiques dealer when he gave you too much for an item you traded could be considered wrong under ordinary moral standards. Typically, receiving more than what is due to you in a transaction is seen as an unjust enrichment at the expense of the other party. It's expected that one would return the excess amount or negotiate fairly with the other party.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
