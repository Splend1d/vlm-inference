The stronger the acid, the more easily it can donate a proton (H+. The relationship between electronegativity, bond strength, and acidity is based on the concept that a more electronegative atom will attract the shared electrons in a covalent bond more strongly, leading to a stronger bond and a greater tendency for the atom to donate a proton.\n\nIn this case:\n- **H2S** (has hydrogen bonded to sulfur, which is less electronegative than iodine, bromine, and oxygen.\n- **HI**, **HBr**, and **H2O** have hydrogen bonded to iodine, bromine, and oxygen, respectively.\n- Oxygen is the most electronegative of these elements, followed by bromine, then iodine.\n- The strength of the bond between hydrogen and the non-metal determines the acidity. Therefore, the stronger the bond ( (the more electronegative the non-metal), the stronger the acid.\n\nGiven these points, HI ( has the strongest bond due to the high electronegativity of iodine compared to sulfur, bromine, and oxygen, making it the strongest acid among the given options."
