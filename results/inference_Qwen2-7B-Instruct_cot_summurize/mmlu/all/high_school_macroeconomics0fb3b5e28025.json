Discouraged workers are counted as \"out of the labor force\" thus the unemployment rate is understated making the economy look stronger than it is.\n\nDiscouraged workers, who have given up looking for employment because they believe no jobs are available for them, are not considered part of the labor force. As a result, they are not counted as unemployed, even though they are willing and able to work. This leads to an underestimation of the unemployment rate, potentially giving a misleading impression of a stronger economy than is actually the case."
