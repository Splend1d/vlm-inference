All of these options.\n\nContemporary security studies have indeed seen coercive diplomacy play a significant role, often intertwined with other strategies such as pre-emptive use of force (Option A, particularly within the context of security theories influenced by figures like Henry Kissinger or more recently, the concept of \"offensive realism\". This approach involves states using threats or actual military action to achieve certain outcomes without necessarily engaging in war.\n\nOption B is not entirely accurate; while there might be a perception that softer forms of diplomacy have gained prominence due to increased focus on international law, economic sanctions, and diplomatic negotiations, coercive diplomacy remains a critical aspect of statecraft. It's not so much that it's been side-lined but rather its application and effectiveness can vary depending on the context and the capabilities of the actors involved.\n\nOption C highlights a key element of contemporary security studies where deterrence has often been used alongside coercive diplomacy. Deterrence involves the threat of retaliation to prevent an adversary from taking an unwanted action. In many cases, coercive diplomacy aims to deter aggression or compel a change in behavior by threatening to use force if certain demands are not met.\n\nTherefore, all of these options reflect different facets of how coercive diplomacy has featured in contemporary security studies, showing its complexity and adaptability in various geopolitical scenarios."
