His sister states that he recently saw a psychiatrist for the first time because of hearing voices; he was prescribed a medication, but she is not sure what it is. She says that he has a history of excessive drinking, and she thinks that he has also experimented with illicit drugs. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.3\u00b0F), pulse is 124/min, and blood pressure is 160/102 mm Hg. Examination shows profuse diaphoresis and muscle rigidity. His neck is supple. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Mental status examination shows psychomotor agitation alternating with lethargy. His leukocyte count is 15,600/mm3 , and serum creatine kinase activity is 943 U/L. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?\n\nA. Amphetamine intoxication\nB. Bacterial meningitis\nC. Delirium tremens\nD. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\n"

                    "text": "The most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms based on the information provided would be C. Delirium tremens.\n\nDelirium tremens is a severe and potentially life-threatening complication of chronic alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms can include confusion, agitation, hallucinations, high fever, increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and tremors. The patient's history of excessive drinking, acute illness with high fever, and symptoms such as profuse diaphoresis ( (excessive sweating) and muscle rigidity are consistent with delirium tremens. The increased white blood cell count and elevated creatine kinase activity may reflect inflammation and muscle breakdown, respectively, which can occur during severe withdrawal.\n\nThe patient's recent psychiatric evaluation and medication use do not necessarily point to any of the other options:\n\n- A. Amphetamine intoxication typically presents with symptoms like hyperactivity, euphoria, and insomnia, which might not fit the patient's profile given the other symptoms.\n- B. Bacterial meningitis usually presents with a more acute onset of fever, headache, neck stiffness, and possibly altered mental status, but usually without the specific features of delirium tremens or the laboratory findings mentioned.\n- D. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is associated with antipsychotic medications and presents with symptoms such as muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability, and altered mental status, but is less commonly associated with the described clinical picture and laboratory findings."
