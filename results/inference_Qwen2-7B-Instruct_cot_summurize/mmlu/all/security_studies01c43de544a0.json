Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential.\nB. The hierarchical analysts believe that generally there has been a tendency of officials to have over-inflated the estimation of the levels of violence and wealth generated by their activities. If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced.\nC. Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation.\nD. Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy.\n"

Here's how each of the statements could impact policy:\n\nA. **Territorial Affiliation and Limited Transnational Potential:**\n   - **Policy Focus:** Emphasis would shift towards addressing local and regional threats posed by these networks, with a focus on strengthening border controls, intelligence sharing, and coordination among local law enforcement agencies.\n   - **Resource Allocation:** Resources might be directed more towards community policing, surveillance technologies, and enhancing the capacity of smaller jurisdictions to combat localized criminal activities.\n\nB. **Overinestimation of Threat:**\n   - **Policy Adjustment:** Policies may need to recalibrate the assessment of the actual threat posed by these networks, leading to a more nuanced understanding of their capabilities and impact on the illicit economy.\n   - **Resource Allocation:** There could be a reduction in the allocation of resources to counter the perceived high-level of threat, possibly shifting priorities to more immediate and less speculative risks.\n\nC. **Adaptability and Resilience:**\n   - **Policy Adaptation:** Policies would likely focus on disrupting the operational flexibility and adaptability of these networks through targeted strategies that undermine their organizational structure and leadership.\n   - **Intelligence and Surveillance:** Enhanced use of intelligence gathering and advanced surveillance technologies would be crucial to predict and counteract the dynamic nature of these networks.\n\nD. **Profit-Driven Crimes and Centralized Leadership:**\n   - **Policy Targets:** The focus would be on targeting the financial flows and leadership structures to disrupt the operational capabilities of these networks.\n   - **International Cooperation:** Increased emphasis on international collaboration, including asset recovery, extradition agreements, and joint operations, would be necessary to effectively dismantle these networks.\n\nIn summary, a hierarchical vision of TNCs would necessitate a multifaceted approach to policy-making, emphasizing both local and international cooperation, intelligence-led operations, and a strategic reassessment of resource allocation based on the actual threat posed by these networks. It underscores the importance of adaptability in policy responses to counteract the evolving tactics and structures of TNCs."
