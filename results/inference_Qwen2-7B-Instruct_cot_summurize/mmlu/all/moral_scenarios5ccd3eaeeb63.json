This involves committing a crime, specifically robbery, which is illegal and ethically reprehensible.\n\nIn Scenario 2, \"I graded my students' papers regardless of how I felt about them personally,\" this action is generally not considered morally wrong. Grading papers is part of a teacher's responsibility and should be done objectively based on the criteria provided, regardless of personal feelings towards individual students. It is a professional duty rather than a moral issue."
