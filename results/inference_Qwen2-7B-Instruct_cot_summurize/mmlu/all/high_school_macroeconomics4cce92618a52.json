This means that it reflects the actual production levels without adjusting for inflation or deflation. It is commonly used to compare the economic output of a country over time or to assess its growth relative to another period. The Bureau of Economic Analysis ( (BEA) calculates Real GDP for the United States, among other countries, as part of their economic data reports."
