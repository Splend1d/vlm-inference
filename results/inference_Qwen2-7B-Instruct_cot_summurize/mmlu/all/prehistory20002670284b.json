It allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrower birth canal in the female pelvis.\n\nThis evolutionary adaptation was crucial for the development of larger brains in humans compared to other primates. With bipedalism, the birth canal became narrower because the mother could carry her offspring upright on her body, which is more efficient than the semi-horizontal position used by many other mammals. This narrower birth canal made it possible for the baby's head to pass through more easily, but it also meant that the infant would be born relatively undeveloped (secondarily altricial) and unable to care for itself immediately after birth. Instead, it required significant parental care, which allowed time for the brain to continue growing and developing after birth.\n\nThis evolutionary trade-off between a narrow birth canal and a larger brain size was essential for the development of complex human cognition, culture, and technology, which are are hallmarks of human societies."
