(\u2200x)(\u2203y)[(Cx \u2022 Sy) \u2022 Gxy): This option incorrectly states that for every child, there exists a school that they both are and are a school of. It doesn't properly convey that the child goes to the school.\n\nB. (\u2200x)[Sx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)): This option suggests that if something is a school, then there exists a child that is a school and goes to it. This doesn't make sense in the context of the original statement.\n\nD. (\u2200x)[Sx \u2022 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)] : This option suggests that for every school, there exists a child who is a school and goes to it. This is also incorrect as it doesn't properly convey that the child goes to the school."
