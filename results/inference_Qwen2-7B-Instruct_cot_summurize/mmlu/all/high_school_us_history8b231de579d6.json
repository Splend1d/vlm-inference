Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nThe ideas expressed above were influenced by which of the following?\n\nA. Widespread prosperity in the 1920s\nB. Widespread economic hardship in the 1920s\nC. The rapid growth of the welfare state in the 1920s\nD. Highly publicized antitrust prosecutions\n"

Widespread prosperity in the 1920s\n\nCalvin Coolidge's speech reflects the sentiments of many Americans during the Roaring Twenties, a period marked by significant economic growth and prosperity. His emphasis on the importance of individual property rights, economic self-sufficiency, and the potential for government overreach through taxation aligns with the optimism and confidence in the free market that characterized this era. The other options do not directly align with the context and content of Coolidge's speech: B refers to a negative economic situation, C pertains to a policy trend that was not central to Coolidge's argument, and D involves legal actions that would not have been the primary focus of a speech on taxation and economic principles."
