Diener and Crandell's categorization of ethical principles in the context of research might be more accurately represented by option B:\n\nB. Four: harm to participants; lack of informed consent; invasion of privacy; involvement of deception\n\nThis option alignss with the common ethical concerns in research, which include:\n1. **Harm to Participants**: Ensuring that no physical or psychological harm comes to participants as a result of their involvement in the study.\n2. **Lack of Informed Consent**: Guaranteeing that all participants understand the nature of the research, its risks, benefits, and their rights before agreeing to participate.\n3. **Invasion of Privacy**: Protecting the confidentiality and personal data of participants, ensuring that their information is used only for the purposes agreed upon and is kept secure.\n4. **Involvement of Deception**: Using deception in research requires careful justification and planning to minimize harm and ensure that the deception is ethically justified.\n\nWhile this might not be an exact quote from Diener and Crandell, it captures the essence of the ethical considerations they might emphasize in their work, focusing on the protection and rights of participants."
