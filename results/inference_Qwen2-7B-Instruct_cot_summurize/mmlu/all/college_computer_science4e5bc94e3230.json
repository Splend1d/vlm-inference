The text segment of P begins at 0x77E80000 in P\u2019s virtual address space. \n\nGiven that the debugger maps this text segment at 0x01000000 in its own virtual address space, this means the debugger has shifted all addresses in P's text segment by 0x01000000. This is a common practice when debugging processes running at high virtual addresses.\n\nTo find out the virtual address used by the debugger for the breakpoint at 0x77E81234 in P, we add the mapping offset:\n\n```\nDebugger virtual address = Debugged process virtual address + Mapping offset\n```\n\n```\nDebugger virtual address = 0x77E81234 + 0x01000000 = 0x01001234\n```\n\nSince the question specifies that the debugger has mapped the page with READ/WRITE access, option A is correct. The other options are do not accurately reflect the provided information:\n\n- B. 0x01001234; page mapped with COPY-ON-WRITE access: This does not specify the access type (READ/WRITE.\n- C. 0x76E81234; page mapped with READ/WRITE access: This does not shift the address into the debugger's address space.\n- D. 0x76E81234; page mapped with COPY-ON-WRITE access: Similar to option B, this does not specify the access type as READ/WRITE."
