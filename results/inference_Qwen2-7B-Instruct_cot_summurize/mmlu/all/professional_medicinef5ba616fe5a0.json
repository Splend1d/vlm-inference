The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?\n\nA.

Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine\n\nCodeine is an opioid analgesic that is converted into its active metabolite, morphine, by the liver enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6. Some individuals may have a genetic variation in the CYP2D6 gene that leads to decreased activity or absence of the enzyme. This results in reduced conversion of codeine to morphine, which is responsible for the analgesic effect of codeine. Therefore, patients who lack the capacity to properly convert codeine to morphine are likely to experience therapeutic failure with codeine.\n\nThe other options do not adequately explain the therapeutic failure in this scenario:\n\nA. Decreased absorption of codeine would result in less drug reaching the systemic circulation and thus less available for metabolism to morphine, but it's not the primary reason for therapeutic failure.\n\nC. Deficiency of \u03ba receptors refers to a decrease in the number or sensitivity of \u03ba opioid receptors, which could affect the analgesic effect of morphine once it is formed from codeine, but it does not explain why the conversion of codeine to morphine might be impaired.\n\nD. Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine would reduce its availability for metabolism to morphine, but it is not the most likely explanation for therapeutic failure when compared to the decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine."
