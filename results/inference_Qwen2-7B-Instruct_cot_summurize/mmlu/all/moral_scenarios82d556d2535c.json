Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, eating the cookies that were specifically bought for someone else without their permission is generally considered morally wrong because it involves taking something that doesn't belong to you without consent, which is a violation of property rights and can be seen as selfish or dishonest.\n\nIn Scenario 2, feeding a hungry child is not morally wrong; in fact, it is a compassionate and responsible action. It addresses the child's immediate needs and is an act of kindness and care.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the first scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing, while the second scenario does not."
