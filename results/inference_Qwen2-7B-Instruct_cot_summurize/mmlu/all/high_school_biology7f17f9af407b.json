The other options all play key roles in regulating respiration:\n\nA. An increase in the amount of CO2 in the blood signals the respiratory center in the brain to increase breathing rate and depth.\nB. A decrease in the amount of O2 in the blood (hypoxemia) also stimulates the respiratory center to increase breathing.\nC. A decrease in the plasma pH level (acidosis) triggers the respiratory center to increase breathing rate to expel more CO2 and raise pH."
