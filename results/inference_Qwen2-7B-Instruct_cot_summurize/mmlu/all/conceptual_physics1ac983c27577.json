The total current entering a node (or point where multiple paths meet) in a circuit is the sum of the currents through each path. However, without knowing the resistance of the lamps or the voltage across them (which would determine the current based on Ohm's Law (I=V/R), we cannot determine the exact current through the second lamp. \n\nThe current in one lamp being 2 A does not directly inform us about the current in the other lamp unless additional information such as the resistance of both lamps and the voltage of the circuit is provided."
