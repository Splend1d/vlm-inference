There isn't a universally accepted \"optimal span of control\" that applies to all situations, as it can vary based on factors such as the nature of the work, the complexity of tasks, the organization's culture, and more.\n\nHowever, some research suggests that a span of control between 5-7 direct reports might be considered effective in many organizations because it allows for sufficient supervision while keeping communication lines short. This range enables managers to maintain close oversight and facilitate direct interaction with their team members.\n\nSo, among the given options:\n\nB. 5\n\nis often cited as an average span of control that works well for many management positions. However, this does not mean it is the absolute optimal span for every situation or organization. The ideal span of control should be determined based on a detailed analysis of the specific context and requirements of each case."
