Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, inviting the new girl to your house might be well-intentioned, but it could be seen as wrong if you did it with the intention of hiding or mocking her living situation. This could potentially make her feel uncomfortable, ashamed, or humiliated, which is not respectful or kind.\n\nIn Scenario 2, lighting up a cigarette while standing by a bench is generally considered not wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, assuming there are are no specific circumstances that make this action harmful to others (e.g., smoking in areas where it's prohibited, or in places where non-smokers are present and it could cause them distress or health issues.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B."
