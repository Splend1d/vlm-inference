The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with values below 7 indicating acidic solutions, values above 7 indicating basic ( or alkaline solutions, and exactly 7 indicating neutrality.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**A. Na2CO3 ( (Sodium Carbonate)**  \nSodium carbonate is a strong base when it reacts with water due to its carbonic acid (H2CO3, which can be represented as:\n\\[ \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3 \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^+ + \\text{HCO}_3^- \\]\n\\[ \\text{HCO}_3^- \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^+ + \\text{CO}_3^{2-} \\]\nBoth reactions produce H+ ions, making the solution basic.\n\n**B. Na3PO4 ( (Sodium Phosphate)**  \nSodium phosphate is a salt of a weak acid (H3PO4) and a strong base (NaOH. When dissolved in water, it will hydrolyze slightly, producing OH- ions from the phosphate group, making the solution basic.\n\n**C. Na2S ( (Sodium Sulfide)**  \nSulfide ions (S2- react with water to form H2S gas and OH- ions, making the solution basic.\n\n**D. NaCl ( (Sodium Chloride)**  \nSodium chloride is a salt of a strong acid (HCl and a strong base (NaOH. It dissociates completely in water into Na+ and Cl- ions, having no effect on the hydrogen ion concentration, resulting in a neutral solution.\n\nGiven this information, the solutions that will have the highest pH (and thus the lowest pH among the options given (are those that are most basic. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, sodium phosphate Na3PO4, and sodium sulfide Na2S all produce basic solutions, but since NaCl produces a neutral solution, it cannot be the answer for having the lowest pH. \n\nBetween the three basic solutions, the one that will have the highest pH (and thus the lowest pH among them, is the one that produces the least amount of H+ ions upon dissolving in water. This would be **Na2CO3**, as it produces more H+ ions than Na3PO4 and Na2S, making its solution more acidic but still basic compared to NaCl. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. Na2CO3**."
