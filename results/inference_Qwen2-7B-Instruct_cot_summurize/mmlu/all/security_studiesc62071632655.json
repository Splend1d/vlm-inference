The viability of the CWC and BCW providing a concrete basis in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is dubious. The Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the illicit trade in materials relating to chemical and nuclear weapons is an equally piecemeal pursuit. Whilst they may serve some utility as a framework for diplomatic exchanges, they are essentially toothless bodies lacking the political will to establish an authority with the powers to police the control and use of these weapons.\nB. The International Non-proliferation Regime has been rendered effectively defunct in the post-Cold War climate. State actors seeking to develop their own weapons capabilities have de-stabilized norms governing the use and control of WMD. This has been evidenced by severe splits in the body following the 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing and the withdrawal of great power support following the US Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\nC. Contemporary concern has been pacified by the fact that WMD threat has greatly diminished with the end of the Cold War. A number of deployed Soviet (Russian) and strategic warheads and US tactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from service thereby removing the threat of total war by massive nuclear exchange.\nD. WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today's policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated.\n"

Here's a brief analysis of each option:\n\nA. The viability of the Chemical Weapons Convention ( (CWC) and Biological Weapons Convention ( (BCW) as a basis in international law is indeed uncertain. These treaties have limitations, as enforcement mechanisms are weak, and there are are no international military police forces to enforce them. However, these treaties have significantly reduced the number of chemical and biological weapons globally. The Proliferation Security Initiative ( (PSI) aims to prevent the illicit trafficking of materials related to weapons of mass destruction but lacks the legal authority and global consensus to be fully effective.\n\nB. The International Non-Proliferation Regime has faced significant challenges since the end of the Cold War. The 1998 nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, and the US Senate's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, illustrate the regime's inability to prevent rogue states from developing nuclear capabilities. However, it's important to note that despite these setbacks, the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( (NPT) remains a cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime, with most nations adhering to its principles.\n\nC. The post-Cold War era saw a significant reduction in the number of deployed nuclear warheads, which has decreased the risk of a catastrophic nuclear exchange. However, this does not negate the ongoing threat posed by other types of WMDs, especially when considering the potential for terrorism and the proliferation of these weapons to non-state actors.\n\nD. WMD terrorism is a serious and evolving threat. The difficulty in locating and deterring terrorist organizations, along with their ideological motivations, makes traditional deterrence strategies less effective. The lack of a clear 'second-strike' capability is also problematic, as it doesn't provide assurance of retaliatory action against a state sponsor or an organization capable of delivering a WMD attack.\n\nIn conclusion, the future of WMDs is characterized by both progress and persistent challenges. International cooperation, enhanced intelligence sharing, robust enforcement mechanisms, and continued disarmament efforts are crucial in mitigating the risks associated with these weapons. Additionally, addressing the root causes of terrorism and ensuring that the non-proliferation regime remains relevant and effective in the face of new threats are essential for global security."
