Spastic paralysis.\n\nWhen there is damage to the internal capsule, particularly involving motor pathways, it can lead to spastic paralysis on the side opposite the injury (in this case, the right leg. This is due to the disruption of the normal inhibitory control over muscle tone by the brainstem and spinal cord. Spastic paralysis is characterized by stiffness, increased muscle tone, and exaggerated tendon reflexes."
