This typically leads to an increase in the price of automobiles, as there are fewer options for consumers and the reduced competition among sellers allows them to charge more. The protection offered to domestic producers comes from this price increase, as they face less competition from foreign manufacturers. However, the higher prices for consumers may deter some potential buyers, affecting their welfare negatively. This policy does not necessarily lead to increased domestic efficiency or lower prices for domestic consumers, nor does it directly protect foreign producers."
