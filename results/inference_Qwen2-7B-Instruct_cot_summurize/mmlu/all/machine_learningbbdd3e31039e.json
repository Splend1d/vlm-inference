False, True\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is False - Industrial-scale neural networks are typically trained on GPUs, not CPUs, due to the high computational power and parallel processing capabilities of GPUs which are crucial for handling large datasets and complex models efficiently.\nStatement 2 is True - The ResNet-50 model does indeed have over 1 billion parameters. It's one of the larger models in the ResNet family, designed for image recognition tasks, and its complexity allows it to capture intricate patterns in images effectively."
