He separates law into two components: primary rules and secondary rules.\n\n1. **Primary Rules**: These are the rules that prescribe what individuals must do. They define the obligations and duties within a legal system. For example, \"You must not steal\" is a primary rule that prescribes an obligation not to engage in theft.\n\n2. **Secondary Rules**: These are the rules that regulate the creation, alteration, and termination of primary rules. They determine how laws are made, changed, and enforced. Secondary rules include procedures for amending constitutions, creating statutes, and appointing judges.\n\nBy separating law into these theoretical constructs and factual observations, Hart provides a clearer understanding of how legal systems function, emphasizing the distinction between the idealized structure of law ( as a theoretical concept  and its practical application and effectiveness in real-world scenarios."
