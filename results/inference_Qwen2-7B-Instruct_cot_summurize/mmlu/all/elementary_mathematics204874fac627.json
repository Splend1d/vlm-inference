Since he reads one book per week (2 weeks, essentially, he will be able to read one book every week.\n\nTo find out how many books he can read within those 12 weeks, we need to divide the total number of weeks by the number of weeks it takes him to read one book:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of books} = \\frac{\\text{Total weeks}}{\\text{Weeks per book}} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the correct expression that Ty could use is the one that divides the total number of weeks by the number of weeks it takes to read one book:\n\n\\[ 12 \\div 2 = 6 \\]\n\nThis expression isn't listed directly among your options since they are formulated differently, but conceptually, option D represents the process of subtracting two weeks from the total repeatedly until you reach zero, which is akin to dividing by two:\n\n\\[ 12 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 0 \\]\n\nThis process corresponds to finding out how many times 2 can be subtracted from 12, which is equivalent to dividing 12 by 2 to get the number of books (6. Therefore, the closest representation to this concept in your given options would be **D**."
