She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Exercise and weight reduction program\nB. Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations\nC. Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations\nD. Captopril therapy\n"

Exercise and weight reduction program\n\nGiven that her blood pressure remains consistently high (even though it's not necessarily \"hypertensive\" based on current definitions ( and considering her age, lifestyle factors such as exercise and diet could play significant roles. Adolescents often have high blood pressure due to obesity or sedentary lifestyles, which can be improved through lifestyle modifications.\n\nThe other options require more specific indications:\n- B. Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations is typically done to assess for pheochromocytoma, a rare adrenal tumor that secretes excessive amounts of catecholamines.\n- C. Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations is used to evaluate for Cushing's syndrome, characterized by excessive cortisol production.\n- D. Captopril therapy is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension but should only be considered if lifestyle modifications fail to lower the blood pressure sufficiently.\n\nTherefore, the first step should focus on modifying her lifestyle to include regular physical activity and dietary changes aimed at reducing body weight if necessary, as these are are foundational in managing adolescent hypertension."
