All of these options.\n\nGeorge and Simons, in their influential work on coercive diplomacy, do indeed consider multiple factors that can influence the outcomes of such diplomatic efforts. Their analysis is comprehensive, taking into account both contextual variables ( which encompass the broader environment in which diplomacy occurs, including global strategic considerations, the nature of the provocation, and perceptions of the potential for war - as well as specific conditions that can either facilitate or hinder success. These conditions include aspects like whether the action is unilateral or part of a coalition, the isolation of the adversary, the clarity of objectives, the strength and alignment of motivations, and the asymmetry in those motivations. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of elements such as the sense of urgency, strong leadership within the decision-making body, domestic and international support, the opponents' fear of unacceptable escalation, and clarity about the precise terms of any settlement. \n\nTherefore, while each of these factors plays a crucial role in the context of coercive diplomacy, it's the combination and interaction of all these elements that ultimately determine the success or failure of such diplomatic efforts."
