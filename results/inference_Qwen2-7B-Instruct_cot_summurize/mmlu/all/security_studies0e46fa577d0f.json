The Humanist Marxist ( (HM) perspective might indeed view capitalism as creating extreme insecurity for workers. In this framework, the worker is often seen as a mere means to an end for the capitalist, who controls the means of production and thus has the power to dictate working conditions, wages, and the overall terms under which labor is exchanged for capital. This disempowerment can lead to insecurity, as workers may lack bargaining power, job security, and the ability to influence the direction of their work or the broader economy.\n\nB. From the HM viewpoint, it would likely agree with the contention that the capitalist economic sphere is not apolitical. Capitalism, in this context, is seen as inherently tied to power dynamics and political structures. Liberalists and realists who might argue that economic decisions are made independently of political considerations could be viewed as overlooking the ways in which capitalist elites use and manipulate political processes to maintain their power and interests. This perspective underscores how economic policies and decisions often serve the interests of the capitalist elite, even if they are not directly elected.\n\nC. The concept of \"surplus value\" is central to Marx's critique of capitalism. It refers to the portion of the value of a commodity that exceeds the cost of the materials used in its production, with the remainder being the worker's wage. According to Marx, surplus value is created by the labor of workers and is appropriated by capitalists through the sale of the product at a price higher than its cost. Thus, the capitalist's accumulation of surplus value is seen as a form of exploitation, where workers are essentially robbed of part of the value they produce because it is taken by the capitalist without compensation.\n\nIn summary, the Humanist Marxist paradigm might align closely with all three of these perspectives, emphasizing the exploitative nature of capitalism, the political dimensions of economic activities, and the systemic insecurity and inequality that characterize capitalist societies."
