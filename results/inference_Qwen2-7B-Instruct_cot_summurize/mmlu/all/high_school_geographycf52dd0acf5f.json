This could be a paper map like a Rand-Mnally atlas, a digital map from a GPS device, smartphone app, or online service like Google Maps. These tools help us navigate streets, highways, and other routes to reach our destination. While a world globe can provide geographical context, it's not practical for daily navigation tasks like getting to school. Mental maps are refer to our internal representations of locations, which might be useful for remembering general layouts but are not used for precise route-finding."
