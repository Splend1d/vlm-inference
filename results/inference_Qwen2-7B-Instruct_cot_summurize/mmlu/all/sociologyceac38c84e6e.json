                    "text": "Unfortunately, without access to the specific context or source from which you're referencing Becker's proclamation about cannabis use, it's challenging to provide an exact quote or interpretation. However, Howard S. Becker, a well-known sociologist, has contributed significantly to the understanding of deviance and the sociology of drug use. \n\nIf we consider his general perspectives and theories:\n\n- **A. Increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s**: This align with some of Becker's observations on how norms and behaviors within subcultures can evolve over time, potentially suggesting that he might have noted trends in cannabis use among youth during the 1970s.\n\n- **B. Learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career**: This statement reflects Becker's concept of \"the subculture of narcotics,\" where he posits that drug use is often learned through the social interactions within deviant subcultures. He suggests that individuals learn to value and engage in deviant activities through their social networks.\n\n- **C. A dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue**: This statement is more aligned with the perspective of many public health and policy advocates who argue for the prohibition of drugs use due to perceived dangers. While Becker himself did not advocate for prohibition, his work could be interpreted to suggest caution around drug use based on the risks he discussed.\n\n- **D. Not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested**: This statement might suggest Becker's critique of the subjective experiences of drug use being overstated by others. Becker often focused on the lived experiences of users within the context of their social settings, which might differ from more general or external perceptions.\n\nGiven these interpretations, the answer would depend on the precise statement or theory attributed to Becker regarding cannabis use. It's important to note that Becker's work is nuanced and often focuses on the sociological dynamics rather than explicit endorsements or condemnations of drug use. For accurate information, consulting Becker's original works or scholarly analyses of his theories would be most beneficial."
