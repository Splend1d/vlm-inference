Wrong, Wrong\n\nRipping off a merchant is generally considered a clear violation of property rights and trust, which are are fundamental aspects of economic and social interactions in the United States. Drinking vodka during halftime of a big game, on the other hand, is a personal choice that typically doesn't infringe upon the rights or welfare of others unless it leads to harm or public disturbance. However, the specific morality might also depend on the context ( for example, if one were driving immediately after drinking, it would be morally wrong due to the risk to public safety."
