Which of the following is an example of this antigenic variation?\n\nA. HIV, which can remain integrated into the host genome for many years\nB. The flu virus, which changes its envelope proteins\nC.

Its surface proteins, particularly hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, mutate rapidly, allowing the virus to evade the immune system and cause new strains of the flu each year. This is why flu vaccines must be updated annually to target the most recent strains of the virus."
