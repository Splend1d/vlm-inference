This finding suggests that experiencing a challenging or rigorous entry process could lead to stronger feelings of attachment and positive regard for the group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable.\n\nIt's important to note that while this study provides insights into the potential psychological effects of initiation practices, individual experiences can vary widely. The results should be considered within the context of broader research and cultural norms regarding group dynamics and initiation rites."
