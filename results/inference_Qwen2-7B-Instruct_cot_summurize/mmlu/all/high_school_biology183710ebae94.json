The dead zones result from the rapid growth of photosynthetic phytoplankton (algal blooms) and their subsequent decay by oxygen-depleting microbes in the water column. Which of the following factors most likely triggers the algal blooms and the associated dead zones?\n\nA. A decrease in the light level in surface waters as day length starts to shorten after the summer solstice\nB. Increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton during the summer months\nC. A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus\nD. Decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton during the summer months\n"

A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus\n\nThis is the most likely trigger for the algal blooms and associated dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. Agricultural runoff containing these nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus from chemical fertilizers can enter the Mississippi River and subsequently flow into the Gulf of Mexico. These nutrients fuel the rapid growth of phytoplankton, leading to algal blooms. When these blooms die off and decompose, they consume large amounts of oxygen, creating dead zones where little or no life can survive due to the low oxygen levels."
