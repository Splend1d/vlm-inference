During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nA sympathetic reader of Logan's Address in the early years of the United States would be most likely to support which of the following Indian policies?\n\nA. Exterminating all Indians\nB. Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty\nC. Encouraging Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico\nD. Building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways\n"

As an Indian leader, Logan appeals for understanding and acknowledges the grievances of both his people and the white settlers. His words express a desire for harmony and a peaceful coexistence, despite the atrocities committed against his community. A sympathetic reader from the early years of the United States who understands Logan's perspective would likely support policies that respect Indian territory and sovereignty. This includes acknowledging the rights and lands of Native American tribes, which aligns with Logan's sentiments of advocating for peace without the fear of retribution or the need for vengeance.\n\nOptions A, C, and D either do not address the underlying issues Logan highlights (such as the destruction of his family, the violation of peace treaties, or the forced relocation of tribes) or suggest actions that would exacerbate the tensions and injustices he speaks against."
