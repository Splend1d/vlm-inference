This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as \"the fight or flight\" response, where the body's natural stress response can lead to heightened alertness and improved concentration. However, when anxiety becomes too high, it can overwhelm a student's ability to process information effectively, leading to poorer performance. The specific threshold at which anxiety starts to negatively impact learning varies from person to person, so not all students will experience this crossover point in the same way."
