All of these\n\nA rainbow occurs due to a combination of phenomena:\n\n1. **Refraction**: When light passes from air into water droplets in the atmosphere, it slows down and bends. This bending of light is called refraction.\n\n2. **Reflection**: Inside the water droplet, the light bounces off the inside surface (a process known as internal reflection. This happens multiple times as the light travels through the droplet.\n\n3. **Dispersion**: As different colors of light bend at slightly different angles due to their varying speeds within the water, this separation of colors is known as dispersion. The different colors emerge at slightly different angles when they exit the water droplet.\n\n4. **Re-emission**: Eventually, the light exits the water droplet and continues through the air, appearing to us as a rainbow of colors.\n\nThese processes combined create the beautiful arc of colors that we see in the sky as a rainbow."
