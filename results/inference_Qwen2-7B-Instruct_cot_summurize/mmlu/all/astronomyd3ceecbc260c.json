Its distance from you\n\nThe relationship between an object's actual (or intrinsic) brightness, its apparent brightness as seen from your location, and its distance from you is described by the inverse square law. This law states that the intensity of light (or any other radiation) emitted by a point source decreases in proportion to the square of its distance from the observer. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ I \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(I\\) is the intensity ( or apparent brightness, and \\(d\\) is the distance from the source.\n\nGiven the actual brightness \\(B_{\\text{actual}}\\) of an object and its apparent brightness \\(B_{\\text{apparent}}\\), along with knowledge of how the object's intrinsic brightness changes over time (which could give us an idea of its movement, but not its speed directly), we can estimate the distance \\(d\\) using the inverse square law:\n\n\\[ B_{\\text{apparent}} = \\frac{B_{\\text{actual}}}{d^2} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(d\\), we get:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{B_{\\text{actual}}}{B_{\\text{apparent}}}} \\]\n\nTherefore, with the actual brightness and apparent brightness, you can estimate the distance of the object from your location without needing additional information such as its speed, composition, or size."
