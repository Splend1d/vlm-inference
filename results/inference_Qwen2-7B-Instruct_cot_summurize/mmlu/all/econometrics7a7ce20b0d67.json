Some variables may be excluded at the first stage leading to coefficient biases\n\nThis approach starts with a broad, comprehensive model and then iteratively refines it by eliminating variables based on statistical criteria (such as p-values or information criteria). This can lead to exclusion of important variables that might not show strong statistical significance in the initial stages but are theoretically relevant for the model. This can result in biased estimates of the coefficients for the included variables.\n\nThe other options, while potential issues in econometric modeling, are not necessarily disadvantages specifically related to the LSE/Hendry approach compared to a specific-to-general approach:\n\nB. The final model may lack theoretical interpretation - This is more related to the quality of variable selection and model specification rather than a direct consequence of the direction of the model-building process.\n\nC. The final model may be statistically inadequate - This depends on various factors including the appropriateness of the statistical tests used, the adequacy of the data, and the presence of omitted variable bias, among others. It's not inherently tied to the direction of model building.\n\nD. If the initial model is mis-specified, all subsequent steps will be invalid. - This is a general concern about econometric modeling and not specific to the direction of model building. A mis-specified initial model could indeed lead to invalid results regardless of whether you start generally and refine or start specifically and expand."
