There were some homeless families inside and he sat on the floor in a corner. He began to play with matches, lighting them for a bit of warmth, and then blowing them out. He carelessly threw them in a pile of refuse on the floor, which started smoldering. He got bored with that and looked around for something else to do. Meanwhile, the tiny fire grew, and the whole back of the building became ensnared in flames. Based on witness statements, the police arrested him for arson, which statutorily requires the \"malicious and intentional\" setting of fire to a structure. Will the prosecutor likely go forward with a prosecution for arson?\n\nA. Yes, because he was a trespasser and he disrespected the rights of the owner of the building.\nB. Yes, because he knew that he was creating an unreasonable risk of harm to others by playing with matches.\nC. No, because the owner of the structure made it too easy for outsiders to get inside the building, thus assuming the risk of the consequences.\nD. No, he did not intentionally set a fire or intend to burn the building, and he did not act maliciously.\n"

Yes, because he knew that he was creating an unreasonable risk of harm to others by playing with matches.\n\nThe prosecutor is likely to go forward with a prosecution for arson under this scenario. The fact that the individual was a trespasser does not automatically negate the charge of arson; rather, it may be considered as part of the circumstances leading to the fire. The key elements for arson are the malicious and intentional setting of fire to a structure. In this case, the man was aware of the potential risks involved in playing with matches (which could lead to fire, especially in a flammable environment like a warehouse filled with refuse. By creating such a risk, he demonstrated intent and malice towards causing harm or damage, even if it was unintentional. This aligns with the legal definition of arson, where the intent to cause damage is a crucial element, regardless of whether the individual intended to specifically target the structure."
