Seedbed Era, 1900 ' 1917.\n\nMuckraking journalism refers to a style of investigative reporting that aimed to expose corruption and social injustices. This style of journalism was prevalent during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly during the Seedbed Era. The work of journalists like Upton Sinclair, Ida Tarbell, and Lincoln Steffens exposed various issues in industries and government, leading to reforms.\n\nThe widespread introduction of public relations in business often followed the reforms prompted by such journalism. Public relations emerged as a way for businesses to manage their image and communicate more positively with the public after facing scrutiny from muckraking journalism. Thus, the Seedbed Era set the stage for the development and growth of public relations practices in the business world."
