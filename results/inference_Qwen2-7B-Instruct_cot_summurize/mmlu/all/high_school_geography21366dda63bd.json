However, historically, some might argue that Italy has been particularly protective of its language, Italian, often referred to as the \"lingua franca\" of the Italian peninsula during the Roman Empire. Italy has a strong tradition of linguistic purity, and efforts have been made to standardize and protect the Italian language from regional variations and outside influences, including English.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, has a complex linguistic landscape with multiple indigenous languages, and while it officially promotes Russian as the state language, it also recognizes and supports many other languages within its territory.\n\nJapan has seen a significant influx of English words and phrases, especially in recent decades due to globalization and technological advancements. The Japanese government has implemented policies to encourage the use of native words for new concepts to preserve and promote the use of the Japanese language.\n\nBrazil, being a large country with numerous indigenous languages, officially recognizes Portuguese as its national language, and there are efforts to preserve and promote the use of indigenous languages alongside it. \n\nIn summary, all these countries have their own unique approaches to preserving their languages, and it's not straightforward to label any one of them as the most active in this regard. Contextual factors such as historical background, cultural values, and contemporary societal trends play significant roles in shaping these linguistic preservation efforts."
