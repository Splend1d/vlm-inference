Grown in animals in the laboratory?\n\nViruses can indeed be grown in animals, as well as in cell cultures derived from animals or plants, and sometimes directly in infected cells themselves. This is typically done under controlled conditions in specialized laboratories to study their properties, behavior, and effects.\n\nTo clarify the other options:\nA. Viruses are not considered the most abundant form of life on Earth. Bacteria are much more abundant, particularly in terms of biomass.\nB. Viruses were discovered after bacteria. The first virus was identified in 1935, while bacteria have been known since ancient times.\nD. Not all human diseases are caused by viruses. While many diseases are viral ( including COVID-19, the flu, and various types of hepatitis, there are also numerous diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and even other viruses. Additionally, some diseases like cancer and heart disease are not directly caused by pathogens but are the result of complex interactions within the body."
