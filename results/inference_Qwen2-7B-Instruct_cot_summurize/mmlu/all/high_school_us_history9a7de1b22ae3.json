We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nWhich of the following regulatory laws was passed as a result of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle?\n\nA.

The Pure Food and Drug Act.\n\nUpton Sinclair's novel \"The Jungle,\" published in 1906, exposed the harsh conditions and unsanitary practices in the meatpacking industry in the United States. The book's graphic descriptions of the Chicago stockyards and the processing of meat led to widespread public outrage and concern over food safety. As a result of the publicity generated by \"The Jungle,\" Congress passed the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906 and the Meat Inspection Act in 1906, both of which were significant pieces of legislation aimed at improving food safety and regulating the meatpacking industry. \n\nA. The Clayton Antitrust Act was passed in 1914 and dealt with anticompetitive business practices, not the meatpacking industry specifically.\nB. The Hepburn Act was passed in 1906 and regulated interstate railroad freight rates, not the meatpacking industry.\nC. The Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in 1890 and was one of the first major federal antitrust laws, but it did not directly address the issues raised by \"The Jungle.\"\n\nTherefore, the law that was passed as a direct result of Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" is the Pure Food and Drug Act."
