Varying from person to person: Sexual arousal and the areas that trigger it can differ significantly between individuals. What might be sexually exciting for one person may not have the same effect on another.\n\nB. Varying for women depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle: Women's sexual responses can indeed change throughout their menstrual cycles due to hormonal fluctuations. For example, some women may find certain areas more sensitive or appealing during specific phases, such as ovulation.\n\nC. Mainly on the lower portion of the body: While the genital area is typically considered the primary focus of sexual excitement for many people, the arousal zones can extend beyond this region. Some individuals may experience sexual excitement in other parts of their body, such as the back, neck, or even the hands and feet, which can sometimes be referred to as erogenous zones.\n\nTherefore, all three statements can be true depending on the context and individual experiences."
