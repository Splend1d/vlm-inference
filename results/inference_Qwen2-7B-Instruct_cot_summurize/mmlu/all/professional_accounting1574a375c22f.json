When a plant asset is retired, it is removed from the company's balance sheet, and its accumulated depreciation is also removed. This results in a debit to the accumulated depreciation account. Therefore, if there are significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year, it could be due to the retirement of plant assets during that period."
