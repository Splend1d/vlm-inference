Generally, segments that meet certain quantitative thresholds or contribute significantly to the overall performance of the company are require separate disclosure. In this case:\n\n- Segment A contributes $42 million in revenue, which is 23.7% of total revenue ($177 million).\n- Segment B contributes $121 million in revenue, which is 68.5% of total revenue ($177 million).\n- Segment C contributes $14 million in revenue, which is 7.9% of total revenue ($177 million).\n\nSegment C's contribution to total revenue is less than 10%, which is a common threshold for materiality in segment reporting. Therefore, based on this criterion, Segment C would not typically require separate disclosure unless there are other qualitative factors that necessitate it. \n\nHowever, the specific rules for segment reporting can vary by jurisdiction and accounting standards, such as GAAP or IFRS. For instance, under U.S. GAAP, segments are required to be disclosed if they meet certain quantitative thresholds, but qualitative factors such as the nature of the business activities, products, services, geographic areas, and economic characteristics are also considered.\n\nGiven the information provided and assuming standard application of GAAP or similar international standards, Segment C's contribution to total revenue suggests it might not meet the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. However, without additional context or specific rules applied, this answer is an interpretation based on common practices. The exact requirement could depend on additional details not provided here."
