Five years into the lease, the team threatened to leave the stadium and move to another city. The city sued the team in federal court, seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the team from breaching its lease and leaving. In its answer, the team included a counterclaim seeking $10 million in damages for losses caused by the city's alleged failure to properly maintain the stadium, as the lease required. The team demanded a jury trial on the counterclaim. The city moved to try its claim for a permanent injunction before the trial on the team's counterclaim. The team objected and moved that the jury trial of its counterclaim be held before the trial of the city's injunction claim. How should the court rule on the parties' motions?\n\nA. The court should first hold a jury trial of the team's counterclaim, and then a nonjury trial of the issues remaining in the city's claim.\nB. The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim without giving binding effect to its findings or conclusions in the later jury trial of the team's counterclaim.\nC. The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim, and then a jury trial of the issues remaining in the team's counterclaim.\nD. The court should schedule a jury trial of both the city's claim and the team's counterclaim.\n"

The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim, and then a jury trial of the issues remaining in the team's counterclaim.\n\nThis approach is consistent with the principle of \"separate trials\" for distinct claims. The city's claim for a permanent injunction is an equitable remedy, which is typically decided by a judge without a jury. The team's counterclaim for damages is a legal claim that may be decided by a jury. By first addressing the city's claim, the court can determine the legal rights and obligations of both parties as they relate to the lease agreement. This decision will inform the jury trial on the counterclaim by providing context about the relationship between the parties and the specific terms of their agreement. After resolving the city's claim, the court can proceed with the jury trial of the team's counterclaim, allowing for a focused and efficient resolution of the damages issue."
