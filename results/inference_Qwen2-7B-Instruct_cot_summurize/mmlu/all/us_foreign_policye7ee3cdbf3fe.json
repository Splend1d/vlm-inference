It encourages liberalization of global trade\n\nAmerican exceptionalism often implies a belief in the superiority of American values, institutions, and policies approaches. In the context of global economics, this can lead to an emphasis on free-market principles, open trade, and globalization. This perspective tends to support policies that encourage liberalization of global trade, as it aligning with the idea of America's role as a leader in promoting economic freedom and capitalism worldwide.\n\nIt is worth noting that while American exceptionalism might advocate for liberalization, the reality of U.S. policy can sometimes be influenced by other factors such as domestic political interests, strategic alliances, and global economic dynamics."
