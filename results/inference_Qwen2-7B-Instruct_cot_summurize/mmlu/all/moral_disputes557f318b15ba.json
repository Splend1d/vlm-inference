Utilitarianism\n\nMill's version of utilitarianism focuses on the consequences of actions and policies, advocating for those that maximize overall happiness or pleasure while minimizing suffering or harm to others. This principle asserts that individuals should have the freedom to act as they please unless their actions cause harm to others. This alignss with the broader utilitarian perspective that actions are right if they promote the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nIt's important to note that while Mill was influenced by Kantian thought, his harm principle is more closely aligned with utilitarian principles, emphasizing the importance of outcomes and the welfare of society over absolute rights or duties."
