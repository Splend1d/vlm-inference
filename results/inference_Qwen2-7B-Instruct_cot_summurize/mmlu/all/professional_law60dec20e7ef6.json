A group of immigrant farm workers were continually refused employment contracts by the labor contractors in the state. Instead, the labor contractors had employed many alien workers since they would toil longer hours for less wages. The immigrant farm workers now bring suit in state court pursuant to the above-mentioned statutory provision. Which of the following determinations would most likely result as a consequence of the immigrant farm workers' lawsuit?\n\nA. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The court would declare the statute constitutional as within the realm of rights reserved to the states by the Eleventh Amendment.\nC. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted.\nD. The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n"

The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n\nThis answer choice assumes that the state has the authority to regulate employment practices within its borders, including restrictions on the employment of unauthorized immigrants. The Equal Protection Clause (option A) might be considered if the law disproportionately affected one group over another without a rational basis, but the given scenario does not provide enough information to determine this. The Eleventh Amendment (option B) concerns sovereign immunity and would not directly address the constitutionality of a state's immigration-related employment laws. Preemption under federal immigration law (option C) could be a concern, but the question does not provide clear evidence that federal law overrides the state's actions here. Therefore, option D is the most likely determination based on the information provided."
