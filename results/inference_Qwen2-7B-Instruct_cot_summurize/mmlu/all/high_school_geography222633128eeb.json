Latin American\n\nMany cities in Latin America, particularly those that developed during the colonial period, often exhibit a distinctive urban layout with a central core or \"zona rosa\" surrounded by a radial pattern of streets and avenues that radiate outwards from this central point. This layout can be likened to a residential spine extending outward from the center city along a main boulevard, which is a characteristic feature of many Latin American cities."
