Bacteria are simple, single-celled organisms that can survive in a wide range of environments, which makes them a good candidate for the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all life on Earth. Viruses, while they share some similarities with living organisms, do not have the ability to replicate independently and require a host cell to do so, which suggests they may not be the direct descendants of LUCA. Organisms living deep in the oceans or using sunlight for energy are are more recent evolutionary developments, and plankton, while ancient, have evolved specific traits for their particular environment, which might not reflect the earliest forms of life."
