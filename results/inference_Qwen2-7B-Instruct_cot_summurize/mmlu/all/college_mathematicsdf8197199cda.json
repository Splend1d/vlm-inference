This property is known as the triangle inequality, which generally holds true but can be an equality only under specific conditions. Specifically, the equality holds if and only if vectors \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are point in the same direction ( or one of them is the zero vector. In most cases, especially when the vectors are not aligned or when either vector is non-zero and not aligned with the other, the value of \\(|x + y|\\) will be less than \\(|x| + |y|\\), thus violating the statement in option D."
