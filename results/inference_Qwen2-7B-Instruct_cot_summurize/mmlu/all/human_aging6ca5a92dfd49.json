While this theory proposes that aging is driven by an internal biological timer, it is not as widely accepted or supported by evidence as other theories such as the free radical theory, wear and tear theory, and garbage accumulation theory. The biological clock theory faces challenges in explaining the variability in aging rates across different organisms and the lack of clear evidence for an intrinsic biological timer controlling aging processes."
