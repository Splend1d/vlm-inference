This means that when you input \\(2x\\) into the function \\(f\\), you get \\(x + 5\\) as the output.\n\nNext, we're given that \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\).\n\nOur goal is to find \\(2 \\times g(6)\\).\n\nLet's start by figuring out what \\(g(6)\\) could be.\n\nGiven \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\), we can substitute \\(f(g(6))\\) with \\(g(6) + 5\\) based on the given property of \\(f\\), since \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\). So, if \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\), then \\(g(6) + 5 = 13\\).\n\nFrom there, we can solve for \\(g(6)\\):\n\n\\[g(6) + 5 = 13\\]\n\\[g(6) = 13 - 5\\]\n\\[g(6) = 8\\]\n\nNow, we need to find \\(2 \\times g(6)\\), which is:\n\n\\[2 \\times g(6) = 2 \\times 8 = 16\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is **B. 16**."
