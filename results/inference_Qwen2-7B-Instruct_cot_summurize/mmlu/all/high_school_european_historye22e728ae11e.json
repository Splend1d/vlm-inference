Instead, it was a non-aggression pact that included secret protocols dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence for each country. Based on these protocols:\n\n- Option A (Denmark: Denmark was not invaded as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.\n- Option B Finland: Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union in November 1939, after the non-aggression pact had been violated by the Soviet Union.\n- Option C France: France was not directly targeted under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It was later invaded by Germany in May 1940 during World War II.\n- Option D Poland: Poland was invaded by both Germany and the Soviet Union in September 1939, in accordance with the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the context of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the correct answer would be D. Poland."
