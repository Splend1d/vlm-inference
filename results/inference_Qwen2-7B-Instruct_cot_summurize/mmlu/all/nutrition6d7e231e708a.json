It is crucial for the growth and differentiation of epithelial cells that form the enamel. A deficiency in vitamin A can lead to enamel defects and may increase the risk of dental caries ( (cavities) because it affects the body's ability to fight off infections and maintain oral health. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nB. Folic acid: While folic acid is important for cell division and DNA synthesis, particularly during fetal development, it is not directly linked to enamel defects or dental caries.\n\nC. Vitamin C: Vitamin C is vital for the production of collagen, which is part of the connective tissue that supports teeth. Deficiencies in vitamin C can lead to gum disease, but it does not have a direct link to enamel defects or caries.\n\nD. Vitamin D: Vitamin D helps in the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, which are essential for bone and tooth health. However, while important, vitamin D deficiency does not typically result in enamel defects or increased risk of dental caries."
