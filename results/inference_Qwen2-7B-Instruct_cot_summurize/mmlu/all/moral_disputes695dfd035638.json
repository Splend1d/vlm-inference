This concept is often referred to as the placebo effect or the nocebo effect, depending on whether the expectations are positive (placebo) or negative (nocebo). The experiments suggest that psychological factors, like expectations, can influence the perceived and actual effects of drugs use, even if the physiological impact might be similar across different individuals. This highlights the complex interplay between biology, psychology, and behavior in the context of drug use and addiction."
