The coastal State enjoy ipso facto and ab initio sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources\n\nUnder international law, particularly as outlined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), coastal states have certain rights over their continental shelf. This includes the right to explore and exploit natural resources on the shelf without needing to declare these rights. This is detailed in Article 76 of UNCLOS.\n\nThe rights of coastal states over the continental shelf include:\n\n- Sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving, and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the seabed and subsourface layers of the continental shelf, including the economic benefits that derive from such resources.\n- The obligation to protect and preserve the environment and to ensure that activities within the continental shelf do not cause damage to the environment of other states or the marine environment in general.\n- The duty to maintain safety standards and prevent accidents that could cause pollution from the continental shelf.\n- The responsibility to regulate the use of the shelf in accordance with international law, ensuring that activities carried out by foreign entities comply with international regulations and agreements.\n\nIt's important to note that these rights apply to both the coastal state itself and any entities under its jurisdiction, including foreign entities granted authorization by the coastal state to carry out activities on its continental shelf."
