The consumer did not read the notice and used the machine on a steep hill. As a result, it falls over and crushes him. He sues on a theory of strict liability, alleging a defect in the manufacture of the product. The manufacturer defends that the consumer misused the product. Will the Court likely grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the indisputable fact that the consumer did not read the warning, which the defendant argued renders the lawsuit invalid as a matter of law?\n\nA. No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.\nB. No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\nC. Yes, because the consumer assumed the risk of the danger when he used the product on a steep hill.\nD. Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n"

Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n\nIn a products liability case under the doctrine of strict liability, the defendant manufacturer may argue that the plaintiff's misuse of the product relieves them of liability if the misuse was obvious and the user was warned against it. In this scenario, since there is an indisputable fact that the consumer did not read the warning about not using the machine on steep hills, and the consumer still proceeded to use the lawn mower on a steep hill, this could potentially be seen as misuse of the product. Therefore, the court might grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on this argument, assuming that the state's laws allow such a defense in strict liability cases."
