He was critical of the philosophical movement known as Academic Skepticism, which held that truth could not be definitively known and thus all beliefs were equally valid. Augustine argued that such skepticism was not only untrue but also self-refuting because it could not logically justify its own position without assuming the very thing it sought to deny ( that there are truths that exist independently of human knowledge or belief. Therefore, Augustine believed that skepticism could be convincingly refuted."
