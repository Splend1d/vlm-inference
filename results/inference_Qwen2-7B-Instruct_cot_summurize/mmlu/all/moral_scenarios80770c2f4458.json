Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character could be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Giving turpentine to a minor to clean a car is not only dangerous but also potentially harmful to the health and well-being of the child. This action can be seen as neglect or endangerment, which are are both morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Using pepper spray on a child is not only illegal but also extremely cruel and dangerous. It can cause severe physical harm, including respiratory issues, and is not an appropriate means of self-defense or escape. This action is clearly morally wrong."
