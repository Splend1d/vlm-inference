Goldthorpe was a British sociologist known for his work on social structure and class analysis. In his 1957 paper \"Class Structure in Britain,\" he proposed a new typology of class structure that included the \"service class.\" According to Goldthorpe, this class comprised individuals who were not engaged in manual labor but instead occupied positions of authority or responsibility within the state apparatus. This could include roles in government administration, education, healthcare, law enforcement, and other public sector jobs where they exercise significant power or influence on behalf of the state. The service class was distinct from the industrial working class and the landed gentry, which were more traditional class categories at the time."
