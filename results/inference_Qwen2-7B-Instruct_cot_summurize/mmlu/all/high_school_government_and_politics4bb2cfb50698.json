The Articles of Confederation established a confederation, which essentially made the United States a loose alliance of sovereign states with a weak central government. This led to several issues, including the inability of the central government to levy taxes, regulate commerce, or effectively manage foreign affairs.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, the delegates at the Constitutional Convention aimed to create a new framework that would provide a stronger central government capable of effectively governing and managing the affairs of the newly independent states. This included establishing a system of checks and balances, defining the powers of each branch of government, and creating mechanisms for the appointment and removal of officials, among other things."
