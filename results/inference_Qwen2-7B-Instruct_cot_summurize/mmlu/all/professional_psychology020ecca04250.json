For reducing activity levels, a higher dose of the stimulant is required.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because, in general, higher doses of stimulants might increase the effectiveness of the medication in some individuals, but they do not necessarily reduce activity levels more efficiently than lower doses. Often, the goal is to find the lowest effective dose to minimize side effects and maximize efficacy. The dosage can vary significantly among patients depending on their response to treatment and any potential side effects they might experience."
