The company plans to send out an e-mail survey to a sample of current customers with a link that gives participants a month of streaming service for free once the survey has been completed. They know that musical tastes vary by geographical region. Which of the following sample plans would produce the most representative sample of its customers?\n\nA. Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.\nB. Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.\nC. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.\nD. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.\n"

This includes considering variables such as geographical regions, which can significantly impact customer preferences and behaviors.\n\nOption A only considers customers who joined in the last month, potentially excluding those who may have different preferences or behaviors based on their longer tenure with the service. This could lead to a biased sample.\n\nOption B provides a simple random sample from all customers who joined within the last 12 months. While this method reduces bias compared to option A, it still does not account for geographical variations in taste and behavior.\n\nOption C selects one customer per state, which might not be representative if there are significant differences within states (for example, urban vs. rural areas within a state might have different preferences).\n\nOption D, however, selects 3% of the customers from each state. This approach acknowledges and accounts for geographical diversity by ensuring a proportional representation of customers across all states. By selecting a consistent percentage from each state, it aims to capture the variation in preferences that may exist due to geographical location while maintaining a manageable sample size.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most likely to produce a sample that is representative of the entire customer base, considering both the time frame of membership and geographical diversity."
