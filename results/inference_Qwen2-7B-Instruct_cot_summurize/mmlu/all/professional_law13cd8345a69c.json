The specific standard applied depends on the level of scrutiny the court uses when reviewing the law.\n\n- **A. The law is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose.** This refers to strict scrutiny, which is used when a law discriminates based on a fundamental right or suspect classification (like race, national origin, etc. The state must show that the law serves a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\n- **B. The law is substantially related to an important government purpose.** This refers to intermediate scrutiny, typically used for laws that affect gender classifications. The state must show that the law serves an important governmental objective and is substantially related to achieving that objective.\n\n- **C. The law is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.** This is the lowest level of scrutiny, used for laws that do not significantly impact fundamental rights or involve suspect classifications. The state only needs to show that there is some rational basis for the law.\n\n- **D. The law is substantially related to a legitimate government purpose.** This is similar to option B but could apply more broadly to other types of laws not covered by strict or intermediate scrutiny. It requires the state to show that the law is related to a legitimate goal and serves a substantial government interest.\n\nIn summary, if a voting law is upheld, it means the court found that the law satisfies the appropriate level of scrutiny based on the nature of the law and its impact. The correct answer would depend on the specific circumstances and legal standards applied in the case at hand."
