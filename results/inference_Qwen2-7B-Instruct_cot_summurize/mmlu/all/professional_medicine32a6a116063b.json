Neurologic examination shows weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated. Sensation to vibration and position is decreased in all extremities, but the decrease is more prominent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. This patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following vitamins?\n\nA. Vitamin B1 (thiamine)\nB. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)\nC. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)\nD. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)\n"

Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by various factors, including vitamin deficiencies.\n\nAmong the options provided, a deficiency in Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) is most likely responsible for these symptoms. Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of nerve cells, particularly those in the peripheral nervous system. Deficiency in Vitamin B12 can lead to a type of peripheral neuropathy known as\u5de8\u5e7c\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u6027\u8d2b\u8840 (megaloblastic anemia, which can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling, muscle weakness, and loss of sensation in the extremities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)"
