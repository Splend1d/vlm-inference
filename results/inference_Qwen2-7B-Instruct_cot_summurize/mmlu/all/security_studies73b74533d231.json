HM rejects Buzan et al.'s theory of sectoral security analysis, on the grounds that securitization is a product of a state-centric approach.\nC. HM rejects the assertion by Buzan et al. that there are distinct and separate sectors of security, instead adopting a holistic view of security within which national and transnational class is an important factor.\nD. HM favours the sectoral approach to security analysis, in particular prioritising the state as a referent object and drawing much of its theoretical foundations from the realist principles that underpin the sectoral approach.\n"

The \"HM\" here seems to represent Hybrid Methodology or perhaps Humanistic Methodology, but without further context, it's difficult to provide a precise interpretation. However, given the options provided, this statement aligns best with an acceptance and appreciation of the sectoral approach to analyzing security, acknowledging its value in providing deeper insights through a focused examination of specific sectors."
