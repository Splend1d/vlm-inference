The implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises when the seller knows the particular purpose for which the buyer desires the goods and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods. This means that if the goods do not meet the specific needs or requirements of the buyer as intended by the seller's knowledge and expertise, the buyer can hold the seller liable under this warranty.\n\nExplanation of other options:\n\nA. This option refers to the implied warranty of merchantability, which applies when the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment in selecting or furnishing suitable goods for the buyer's general use.\n\nB. This option is related to the implied warranty of merchantability but does not specifically mention the seller's knowledge of the buyer's particular purpose for the goods.\n\nD. This option also pertains to the implied warranty of merchantability, where the seller's knowledge of the buyer's intended use of the goods does not automatically trigger the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose; it must be coupled with the seller's knowledge that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment."
