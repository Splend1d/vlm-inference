Paying drug users for negative urine specimens\n\nContingency management (is a behavioral therapy that uses positive reinforcement, such as vouchers or other tangible rewards, to encourage and maintain positive behavior changes. It's often used in substance use disorder treatment programs, where individuals receive rewards for maintaining sobriety or achieving specific treatment-related goals. The system aims to motivate patients by providing incentives for positive outcomes. This approach can include paying individuals for negative urine test results, indicating they have not used drugs during the period of the test, as well as for other positive behaviors related to their recovery."
