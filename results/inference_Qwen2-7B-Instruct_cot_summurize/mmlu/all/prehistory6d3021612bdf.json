While Clovis points are well-documented throughout much of North America including parts of B. Mexico, C. Canada, and D. the continental United States, their absence in Alaska suggests that the Clovis culture did not extend to that region. The Clovis culture is believed to have inhabited areas stretching from southern Canada through the American Southwest and into central Mexico, but the tools characteristic of this culture do not appear in Alaska."
