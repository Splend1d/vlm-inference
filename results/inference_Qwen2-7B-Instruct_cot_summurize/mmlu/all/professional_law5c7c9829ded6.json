M. by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises where the singing takes place. The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs. After the ordinance was enacted and went into effect, several college students were walking down the street on their way to a victory celebration following a big college football game. They began loudly chanting, \"We're number 1. . . we're number 1. \" One of the residents who lived on the street was greatly disturbed by the noise and reported the incident to the police, who were immediately summoned to the scene. The students who engaged in the chanting were arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. The students who were prosecuted now bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance. Which of the following would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement of the city ordinance?\n\nA. The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First andFourteenth Amendments.\nB. The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.\nC. The statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad since it attempts to encompass all forms of singing.\nD. The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.\n"

The statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad since it attempts to encompass all forms of singing.\n\nThis argument is weaker because vagueness and overbreadth are indeed concerns that can arise with such ordinances, but they are not necessarily dispositive constitutional issues. Vagueness challenges may require courts to engage in a balancing test, weighing the potential for unconstitutional vagueness against the government's interest in regulating speech. Overbreadth challenges can be particularly difficult, as they require showing that the law not only potentially harms the plaintiff but also has a substantial likelihood of chilling protected speech more broadly. The Supreme Court has recognized exceptions to overbreadth doctrine in certain contexts, such as when the statute targets core political speech. In this case, the ordinance's exemption for religious songs might suggest that the city intended to protect a subset of speech (religious expression, which could weaken an overbreadth argument.\n\nThe other options present stronger arguments:\nA. The ordinance potentially restricts freedom of expression, which is a fundamental right under the First Amendment, and the Fourteenth Amendment ensures this right is not infringed upon by state action.\nB. The ordinance might not be related to a legitimate community interest if its restriction on non-religious singing is overly broad or does not serve a compelling public purpose.\nD. The distinction between religiously inspired singing and other forms of singing could be seen as impermissible discrimination, potentially violating the Equal Protection Clause if the distinction is not justified by a compelling state interest and is not narrowly tailored."
