Natural selection\n\nNatural selection is the process by which certain heritable traits become more or less common in a population as a result of differential rates of survival and reproduction. Traits that are advantageous in a given environment increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, passing those advantageous traits on to the next generation. Over time, this can lead to populations becoming better suited to their environments.\n\nMutation introduces new genetic variation into a population, but without natural selection, this variation will not necessarily lead to an improvement in fitness. Non-random mating can affect the frequency of certain traits within a population, but it does not inherently favor traits that are beneficial for survival and reproduction. Gene flow, or the transfer of genetic material from one population to another, can introduce new genetic variation, but it also does not necessarily lead to improved adaptation to the environment."
