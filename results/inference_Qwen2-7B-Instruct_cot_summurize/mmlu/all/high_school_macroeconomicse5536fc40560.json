The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nWhen demand falls, the demand curve shifts to the left, leading to a lower equilibrium price and potentially a lower equilibrium quantity depending on how the shift in demand affects the intersection with the supply curve. Conversely, an increase in supply shifts the supply curve to the right, which typically leads to a lower equilibrium price as well, but increases the equilibrium quantity. Since both events occur simultaneously, it's impossible to determine the exact change in equilibrium quantity without more specific information about the magnitude of each shift. However, we can confidently say that the equilibrium price will fall due to the combined effects of decreased demand and increased supply."
