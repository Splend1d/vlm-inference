International society consists of a constellation of sovereign States and other international organizations, which are dispersed in a rather horizontal order of authority\n\nIn the international system, there isn't a central authority akin to a government or court system as found within nation-states. Instead, it operates on a principle of sovereignty among states, which are considered equal and independent. These states interact with each other through various forms of diplomacy, treaties, and international laws, creating a complex web of relationships rather than a hierarchical structure. Other international organizations, such as the United Nations, play significant roles in facilitating cooperation and providing forums for negotiation, but they do not have the power to enforce their decisions like domestic legal systems can.\n\nIt's important to note that while there is no single overarching authority, there are various mechanisms and bodies that help regulate and manage interactions between states, such as international courts (like the International Court of Justice) and specialized agencies (like the World Health Organization). However, these still operate under the principle of state consent and do not have universal jurisdiction over all states."
