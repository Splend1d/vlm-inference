Both of these.\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of relativity, if an object moves at a speed close to the speed of light relative to an observer, the object's mass will appear to increase, and time will seem to slow down for the moving object (this is known as time dilation. The faster the object moves, the more pronounced these effects become. This means that both the mass change and the decrease in pulse (or rather, a slowing of the passage of time from the perspective of an external observer - are observable phenomena when traveling at speeds near the speed of light."
