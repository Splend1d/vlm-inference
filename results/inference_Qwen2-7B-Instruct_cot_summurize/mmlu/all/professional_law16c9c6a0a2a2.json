After losing a large amount of money, the defendants accused the victim of cheating. When the victim tried to leave, the defendants beat him with their fists and, as the victim fell to the ground, they continued by kicking him in the head. The victim suffered a fractured skull in the beating and died as a result of severe head trauma. Thereafter, the defendants reached into the victim's pocket and stole his wallet. The defendants were arrested and charged with the murder of the victim. Prior to trial, the prosecutor admitted that it was impossible to determine which defendant was responsible for actually fracturing the victim's skull. If the defendants are prosecuted for felony murder, which of the following would provide their best defense?\n\nA. The jurisdiction adheres to the inherently dangerous felony requirement.\nB. The jurisdiction follows the independent felony murder rule.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the proximate cause theory.\nD. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory.\n"

                    "text": "In the scenario presented, the defendants are being charged with murder after killing the victim during a fight over an accusation of cheating at poker while under the influence of alcohol. Given the lack of evidence to determine who specifically caused the fatal fracture to the victim's skull, the defense would likely focus on minimizing their individual culpability. Among the options provided, the \"proximate cause theory\" ( (Option C) would potentially provide the best defense.\n\nThe proximate cause theory is used in criminal law to establish that a defendant's actions were a substantial factor in causing the harm or death of another person. In this case, the defense could argue that while both defendants were involved in the altercation and contributed to the harm caused to the victim, there is insufficient evidence to prove that either defendant's specific actions led directly to the fatal injury. By arguing that neither defendant's actions were the direct, proximate cause of the victim's death, the defense might seek to avoid liability for murder.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the effectiveness of such a defense would depend heavily on the specific laws and legal standards of the jurisdiction in question, as well as the strength of other evidence against the defendants. The inherently dangerous felony requirement ( (Option A), the independent felony murder rule  ((Option B), and the agency theory  ((Option D) each have different implications for how felony murder charges are handled, but they do not directly address the issue of establishing individual culpability for a specific aspect of the crime."
