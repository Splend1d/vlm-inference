Both A and B.\n\nIn a direct core type induction furnace, low frequency supply is used primarily to ensure effective heating of the metal without causing excessive stirring. At lower frequencies, the eddy currents generated in the metal are larger in size, which results in less stirring action. This is beneficial when you want to heat the metal without mixing it too much, as it can help maintain the quality of the final product.\n\nAdditionally, lower frequencies also enhance magnetic coupling between the primary (induction coil) and the secondary (metal being heated). This improved coupling leads to more efficient transfer of energy from the induction coil to the metal, resulting in better heating performance.\n\nTherefore, both options A and B accurately describe reasons for using low frequency supply in direct core type induction furnaces."
