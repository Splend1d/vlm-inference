The horizontal motion is generally unaffected by gravity, which acts vertically. Thus, unless there's some horizontal force acting on the ball (like wind or a player applying a lateral force to it), the horizontal velocity will stay the same.\n\nThe vertical component, however, is affected by gravity and will change over time as the ball falls back towards the ground. Therefore, the correct answer would be A. horizontal."
