Corruption in government\u2014especially as it related to big business\u2014energized the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments.\nB. A large-scale movement of struggling African American and white farmers, as well as urban factory workers, was able to exert a great deal of leverage over federal legislation.\nC. The two-party system of the era broke down and led to the emergence of an additional major party that was able to win control of Congress within ten years of its founding.\nD. Continued skirmishes on the frontier in the 1890s with American Indians created a sense of fear and bitterness among western farmers.\n"

Corruption in government\u2014especially as it related to big business\u2014energized the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments.\n\nThis answer choice reflects the context provided in the poem and song excerpt. The reference to \"railroads\" and \"old party bosses\" suggests a critique of the influence of powerful economic interests and political elites on the democratic process. The \"hayseed\" mentioned is likely a metaphor for a common person who feels exploited by these forces, pointing to the growing public dissatisfaction with the status quo during this period. This dissatisfaction fueled movements for reform and increased popular participation in governance."
