Emotional labor refers to the effort required to manage one's feelings and behaviors in ways that are expected by others in the workplace. This can include suppressing negative emotions, displaying positive emotions, or adapting one's emotional responses to suit the needs of patients, families, and other healthcare professionals.\n\nOptions B and C do not accurately summarize Allen's findings, and option D does not provide enough detail to be considered an exact summary of his research. While it might be true that there were changes in the professional status of nursing due to various factors including policy changes like those in Project 2000, and that gender roles within the profession were evolving, Allen's work likely focused more specifically on the emotional demands and labor of nursing rather than these broader policy or demographic shifts. For precise details, one would need to consult the original research paper or a comprehensive review of Allen's work."
