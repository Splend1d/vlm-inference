Option A reduces the sample size without addressing the non-response bias, potentially leading to skewed results. Option B also maintains the original sample size without addressing the issue of non-responses, which could lead to similar biases. Option C introduces new data into the sample, which might not be directly comparable to the initial sample if there are are significant differences between those who responded initially and those who were not contacted again.\n\nOption D aims to improve the response rate by encouraging non-respondents to participate, which can help in reducing any potential bias due to non-response and increase the likelihood of obtaining a more representative sample. However, it's important to consider the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of follow-up efforts, as they can sometimes be resource-intensive."
