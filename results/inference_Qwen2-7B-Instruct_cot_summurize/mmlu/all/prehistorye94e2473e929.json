This principle emphasizes that the slow and gradual changes we observe in the present can be used to understand the Earth's history.\n\nHere's a brief overview of each option:\n\nA. **Natural Selection** - This term refers to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by means of natural selection, where traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction become more common over generations. It doesn't necessarily describe a process of \"existing causes\" over time.\n\nB. **Catastrophism** - This is the idea that the Earth has been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, such as meteorite impacts or volcanic eruptions. This contrasts with uniformitarianism in its view of rapid and dramatic changes in the Earth's surface.\n\nC. **Uniformitarianism** - As mentioned above, this concept focuses on the idea that the same processes occurring now have occurred throughout Earth's history.\n\nD. **Unilineal Evolution** - This refers to the belief in a single, linear path of human cultural development from primitive to advanced stages. It's not related to the concept of \"the slow agency of existing causes.\""
