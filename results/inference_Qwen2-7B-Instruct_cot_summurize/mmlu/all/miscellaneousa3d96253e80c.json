Schist.\n\nShale is a sedimentary rock that, under high pressure and temperature conditions, can be transformed into metamorphic rock known as schist. This transformation occurs when sedimentary rocks undergo metamorphism due to the heat and pressure deep within the Earth's crust. The resulting schist is characterized by layers of minerals such as mmagnetite, chlorite, and quartz, which have been altered by the metamorphic process.\n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Granite - This is an igneous rock formed from the cooling of magma beneath the Earth's surface. It does not form through metamorphism of shale.\n\nB. Quartzite - Although quartzite is also a metamorphic rock, it typically forms from sandstone, not shale. Shale transforms into schist rather than quartzite.\n\nD. Marble - Marble is a metamorphic rock that forms from limestone or dolostone under high heat and pressure. It does not form directly from shale.\n\nSo, based on the process of metamorphism, schist is the rock that most likely forms from the metamorphism of shale."
