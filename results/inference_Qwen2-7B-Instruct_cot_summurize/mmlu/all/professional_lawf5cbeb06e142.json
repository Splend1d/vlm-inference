He signed a note to the bank and secured repayment of the loan with a mortgage. After purchasing the house, the man borrowed money from his credit union to make the repairs. The man signed a note to the credit union; this note was also secured by a mortgage on the house. Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order granted. The man was personally liable on both loans. The man moved into the house and made the necessary repairs. He later defaulted on the debt to the bank, and the bank initiated judicial foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the credit union as parties to the action. An outside party acquired the house at the foreclosure sale. After the expenses of the sale and the balance due the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale proceeds. The outstanding balance of the credit union loan is $20,000. The man and the credit union both claim the $5,000. There is no applicable statute. Who is entitled to the $5,000?\n\nA. The credit union, because the credit union has priority.\nB. The credit union, because the man is personally liable on the debt.\nC. The man, because of his equitable right of redemption.\nD. The man, because the outside party received title to the house subject to the second mortgage.\n"

The man, because of his equitable right of redemption.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, once a property is foreclosed upon, the borrower (or in this case, the man, still has an equitable right of redemption for a certain period after the sale, usually up to the date when the deed is conveyed to the new owner or until the expiration of a redemption period specified by state law. This right allows the borrower to reclaim the property by paying off the debt owed, including any additional costs incurred during the foreclosure process. \n\nGiven that there is no applicable statute mentioned in the scenario, it would be reasonable to assume that the common law principle of equitable right of redemption applies. Since the man is personally liable on the debt, he would be entitled to the remaining sale proceeds ($5,000) until the foreclosure deed is transferred to the new owner, assuming the credit union's claim does not exceed the remaining sale proceeds and the man is able to pay off the debt owed to the bank before then."
