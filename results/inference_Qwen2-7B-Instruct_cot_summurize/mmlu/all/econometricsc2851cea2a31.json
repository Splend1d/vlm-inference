Here's how each term fits into the description:\n\n(i) **The regressand** - This is indeed an alternative name for the dependent variable in linear regression. It refers to the variable that is being predicted or explained by the model.\n\n(ii) **The regressor** - This term is often used to refer to the independent variables, not the dependent variable. However, in some contexts, it might be used loosely to refer to any input variable, including the dependent variable, especially when discussing multiple regression models where there is more than one dependent variable.\n\n(iii) **The explained variable** - This term accurately describes the dependent variable in regression analysis, as it refers to the outcome that the model aims to explain or predict based on the independent variables.\n\n(iv) **The explanatory variable** - This term is typically used to denote the independent variables in a regression model. While it is not directly synonymous with the dependent variable, it is related because it is used to explain or predict changes in the dependent variable.\n\nGiven these definitions, the correct answer is:\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nThis choice correctly identifies \"The regressand\" and \"The explained variable\" as accurate alternative names for the dependent variable in linear regression analysis."
