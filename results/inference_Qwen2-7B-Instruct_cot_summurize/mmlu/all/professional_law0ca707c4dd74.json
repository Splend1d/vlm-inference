Over the course of time, she developed the property into a residential subdivision. A four-lane public highway ran along the northern boundary of the residential subdivision. When the residential subdivision was first plotted, the developer constructed a private road along (and including) the western boundary of the subdivision. This private road was used only for the benefit of the owners who purchased lots in the subdivision. A homeowner owned a 20-acre tract immediately outside of the residential subdivision, which was situated just below the public highway and immediately adjacent to the west side of the private road. The homeowner's property was divided into two 10-acre parcels: Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the public highway; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river. In 1997, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 1 to a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Six months later, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. Assume that no part of Parcel 2 adjoins a public road. Consequently, the woman constructed an access road connecting her property to the private road. After the woman used the private road for approximately two months, a teacher who was an owner within the residential subdivision, ordered the woman to discontinue using the private road. In an appropriate action by the teacher against the woman to enjoin the use of the private road, the woman will\n\nA. win, because there is an easement by estoppel over the private road.\nB. win, because there is an implied easement appurtenant over the private road.\nC. lose, unless the private road is the only access road by which woman can gain ingress and egress to her property.\nD. lose, because she has no legal right to travel over the private road.\n"

An easement is a right or privilege to use someone else's property for a specific purpose. There are several types of easements, including express easements (where there is a written agreement granting the easement, implied easements (where it's clear from the circumstances that one party needs to use the other's property for some purpose, and easements by necessity ( where there's no other reasonable way to access a parcel of land.\n\nIn this case, there's no mention of an express easement being granted to the woman through any document, nor does there seem to be an implied easement based on the facts provided. The private road was built by the developer for the exclusive use of the homeowners within the residential subdivision. Since the woman's property is not adjacent to a public road, her access to her property would typically need to be established through an easement, but the facts suggest none was granted to her.\n\nAdditionally, even if the woman had been using the private road for a period of time without objection, this might not necessarily create an easement by estoppel ( since the teacher (as a property owner within the subdivision) could argue that such usage was permissive and not an established right. \n\nTherefore, under the typical rules of property law, the woman would likely lose an action brought by the teacher to enjoin the use of the private road, as the teacher would have a legal right to restrict access to the private road since it was intended solely for the benefit of the subdivision's lot owners."
