In this case, the elevator starts from rest and comes to a stop, so its final kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, all the work done by the brakes will be equal to the gravitational potential energy lost by the elevator as it falls.\n\nGravitational potential energy (U = mgh, where:\n- g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2,\n- h is the height (which in this case is the same as the distance fallen, d = 100 m.\n\nSo, the work done by the brakes (W (is equal to the gravitational potential energy lost:\n\n\\[ W = U = mgh = 1000 \\times 9.8 \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ W = 980000 \\text{ Joules} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 1,000,000 J."
