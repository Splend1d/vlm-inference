This model posits that by engaging in socially responsible activities, companies can enhance their reputation, attract and retain customers, and foster positive relationships with communities and stakeholders. This, in turn, can lead to long-term financial benefits, as well as contribute to sustainable development and environmental protection. The key idea here is that ethical practices and corporate social responsibility are not just moral imperatives but also strategic business decisions that can yield significant competitive advantages."
