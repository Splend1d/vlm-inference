This means that the electric field above the plane and below the plane will have the same magnitude but opposite directions.\n\nGiven that the electric field above the plane is \u03c3/2\u03b5o and points upwards ( (as stated in the question), the electric field below the plane will also be \u03c3/2\u03b5o but it will point downwards because it's on the opposite side of the plane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \u03c3/2\u03b5o, down"
