The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nWhen consumers are advised that multigrained bread will substantially lessen the risk of cancer, it implies that there is an increase in the perceived health benefits of consuming multigrained bread. This change in consumer perception leads to an increase in the demand for multigrained bread, shifting the demand curve to the right. As a result, this increase in demand typically leads to an increase in both the quantity sold and the price of multigrained bread, assuming the supply remains constant or does not change significantly."
