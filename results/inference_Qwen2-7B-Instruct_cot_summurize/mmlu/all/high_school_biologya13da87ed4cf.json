The offspring produced in subsequent generations have a higher percentage of birds with large beaks.\n\nExplanation:\nNatural selection is a process where organisms with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. In this scenario, during drought years when large, hard-cased seeds are more common, birds with large beaks have an advantage because they can access food that smaller-beaked birds cannot. As a result:\n\n- **Option A** ( Small birds gaining larger beaks by exercising their mouth parts is a possibility over time through a process called 'dental wear', but it's not directly related to natural selection which is based on genetic changes passed down to offspring.\n  \n- **Option B** Mutations do occur naturally, but whether these mutations lead to a larger beak is not guaranteed. Even if some mutations result in larger beaks, the mutation must be advantageous for the bird to survive and pass it on to its offspring. The chance of a mutation occurring is very low, and not all mutations are beneficial.\n  \n- **Option C** Anticipating the drought and growing larger beaks through eating more is not how natural selection works. Birds do not have the ability to predict future environmental conditions or change their physical attributes based on anticipation. Natural selection acts on existing genetic variation.\n  \n- **Option D** This is correct. Over several years of drought, small-beaked birds would struggle to find enough food, leading to higher mortality rates among them. Their genes for small beaks would be less represented in the next generation. Conversely, larger-beaked birds would have a survival and reproductive advantage, increasing the frequency of large beak genes in the population. This is the essence of natural selection: traits that enhance survival and reproduction tend to become more common in a population over time."
