The formula is:\n\n\\[2pq\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(p\\) is the frequency of one allele,\n- \\(q\\) is the frequency of the other allele.\n\nGiven that both alleles have a frequency of 0.2, we have:\n\n- \\(p = 0.2\\)\n- \\(q = 0.2\\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[2pq = 2 \\times 0.2 \\times 0.2 = 0.08\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 0.08."
