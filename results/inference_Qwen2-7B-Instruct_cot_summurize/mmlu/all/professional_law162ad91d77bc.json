She contends that contaminants, consisting mostly of the solvent, were released into the ground at the facility and have migrated and continue to migrate to her property, contaminating the soil, the groundwater, and her well. She alleges various acts of negligence on the part of the facility owner in causing the release of the contaminants into the ground. She also alleges that employees of the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently spilling some of the solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank at the facility. The solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was any contamination, the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination and that therefore the homeowner cannot show how much damage each has inflicted on her. There is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert. Should the court grant the summary judgment motion?\n\nA. No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\nB. No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.\nC. Yes, because there is no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier. damages against the solvent supplier.\nD. Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.\n"

No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\n\nIn this situation, the homeowner's lawsuit against both the metal fabrication facility owner and the solvent supplier implies that the damage is considered indivisible, meaning it cannot be readily apportioned between the two parties. Under such circumstances, both defendants can be held jointly and severally liable, which means that the plaintiff can seek to recover the full amount of damages from either defendant, or from both, regardless of the specific contribution of each defendant to the harm caused. If one defendant is unable to pay their share, the other remains responsible for the unpaid portion.\n\nThe fact that there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert does not automatically absolve the solvent supplier of liability. Instead, it suggests that the liability should be assessed based on individual actions, but still under the principle of joint and several liability for an indivisible injury.\n\nTherefore, the court should not grant the summary judgment motion on the basis provided by the solvent supplier, as it does not provide sufficient grounds to absolve the solvent supplier from liability."
