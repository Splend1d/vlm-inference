It adapts to changing organizational environments.\n\nThe open systems model of public relations recognizes that organizations are part of a larger environment and are interconnected with various stakeholders, including the media, employees, customers, and the general public. This model emphasizes adaptability and responsiveness to external changes and feedback from these stakeholders. \n\nB. It is true that transparency is often a key component in building public trust, but this is not exclusive to the open systems model; it can apply to any approach emphasizing honesty and openness in communications.\n\nC. Focusing on removing communication barriers within an organization is important for internal effectiveness, but the primary emphasis of the open systems model is on the organization's interactions with its external environment.\n\nD. Communicating with publics frequently to effect change is more aligned with the concept of two-way symmetrical communication, which aims for mutual understanding and shared objectives between the organization and its publics. While the open systems model does involve communication with publics, its focus is broader and includes adaptation to environmental changes rather than solely on effecting external change through communication."
