Diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles\n\nThe symptoms and physical examination findings described suggest a possible diagnosis of Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. One of the characteristic signs of this condition is exophthalmos ( or protrusion of the eyes, which can be due to inflammation of the periorbital tissues and enlargement of the rectus muscles in the eye socket. \n\nAn MRI of the head and orbits would likely show diffuse enlargement of these rectus muscles as well as inflammation and possibly edema of the surrounding tissues. Calcification of the orbit (choice A) is not typical for Graves' disease. Dilated ventricles (choice C) are seen in conditions like hydrocephalus, not specifically related to thyroid disorders. And lymphoma (choice D) could potentially cause orbital swelling, but it's less likely to present with the specific constellation of symptoms and findings you've described, especially without other supporting clinical features."
