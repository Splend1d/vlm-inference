Describes the limitations on the usefulness of the projection.\n\nWhen an accountant compiles projected financial statements, it is important to include a disclaimer or a paragraph in the accountant's report that highlights the limitations associated with these projections. This is because projected financial statements are based on assumptions and estimates about future events, which are inherently uncertain. Therefore, they may not accurately reflect the actual financial position or performance of a company in the future. The limitations could include factors such as changes in market conditions, economic fluctuations, or unforeseen operational challenges that were not anticipated at the time of preparing the projections.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are not typically included in an accountant's report for projected financial statements. Option A disclaiming assurance on historical financial statements would not be relevant since the focus is on projections. Option B providing limited assurance on the results being not applicable because projections are by nature speculative. Option D evaluating hypothetical assumptions is more related to the preparation process rather than a requirement in the report itself."
