Price bonding. \n\nPrice bonding refers to the phenomenon where consumers perceive a higher value for a product or service when they are continuously exposed to its price, even if that price doesn't necessarily change. This can lead to an increased perceived risk if the price is high and the consumer is constantly reminded of it, or perceived value if the price is low and the consumer is reminded frequently. This concept is often used in marketing strategies to influence consumer behavior."
