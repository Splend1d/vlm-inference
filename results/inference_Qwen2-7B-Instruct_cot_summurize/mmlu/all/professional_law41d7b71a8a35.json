In return, the owner promised to pay the gardener $2,400 upon completion of the job. Since a golf tournament was scheduled for the weekend of April 20 \u0080\u009421, the gardener agreed to replace all the sprinkler heads no later than April 19. Before accepting the job, the gardener had inspected the golf course and determined that 240 sprinkler heads had to be replaced. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 new sprinkler heads on the first six holes of the 18-hole golf course. That afternoon, however, the owner learned that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so he notified the gardener to discontinue the job. The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period. Also, the gardener's application for unemployment compensation was rejected at the same time. Which of the following statements, if found to be true, would provide the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener?\n\nA. The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt onApril 12.\nB. The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.\nC. The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.\nD. Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.\n"

                    "text": "In this scenario, determining the legally justifiable grounds for the owner's decision to discharge the gardener involves assessing the contractual obligations and legal principles related to breach of contract and reasonable cause for termination.\n\nGiven the facts:\n\n1. An oral agreement was made for the installation of new sprinkler heads, with specific conditions regarding the timeline and payment.\n2. The gardener completed 80 out of 240 sprinkler heads before being discharged.\n3. The gardener was declared bankrupt on April 12, which might affect his ability to fulfill contractual obligations.\n4. The owner hired another landscaper to finish the job at a higher rate ($8 per head) after the gardener was discharged.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\nA. The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12.\nBankruptcy can indeed be a reason for a party to terminate a contract if it makes performance of the contract impossible or significantly more difficult. However, the key is whether the owner can demonstrate that the bankruptcy directly affected their ability to receive the contracted service (i.e., the sprinkler installation. If the gardener's bankruptcy did not prevent them from continuing with the job, this might not provide a justifiable ground for discharge.\n\nB. The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.\nThe percentage of work completed does not automatically justify discharge without considering the reasons behind the delay or the nature of the work left undone. If the owner can show that the work left undone could not be reasonably completed within the agreed timeframe or that the quality of the work done was unsatisfactory, this could provide a justifiable ground for discharge.\n\nC. The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.\nContracts must be in writing to be enforceable under many jurisdictions' statutes of fraud, particularly for services involving a significant amount of money or specific terms. This statement alone does not provide grounds for discharge but indicates that the contract may lack formal legal standing.\n\nD. Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler head.\nIf the gardener refused to correct defects in the work they completed, this could be considered a breach of contract. Assuming the owner can prove the defects exist and the gardener's refusal to rectify them, this could provide legally justifiable grounds for discharge.\n\nBased on these analyses, **Statement D** seems to provide the most compelling grounds for the owner's action. The gardener's refusal to address defective work, especially if it constitutes a breach of the contract's implied obligation to perform the work to a satisfactory standard, would likely be considered a justifiable reason for the owner to terminate the contract and seek alternative arrangements."
