This may be due to several factors, including social support, better access to healthcare, and potentially more cognitive stimulation from being part of a relationship.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. Being African or Hispanic American does not necessarily decrease the risk of Alzheimer's; rather, research indicates that the risk can vary among different racial and ethnic groups.\nB. Eating fish, particularly foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon, may offer some benefits for brain health, but it is not conclusively proven to decrease the risk of Alzheimer's.\nC. A lower level of education has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's in some studies, although this relationship might be confounded by other factors such as lifestyle and environmental exposures."
