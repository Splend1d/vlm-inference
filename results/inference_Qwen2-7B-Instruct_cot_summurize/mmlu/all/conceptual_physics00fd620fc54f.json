Water has a high specific heat, which means it can absorb and store a significant amount of heat energy before its temperature rises. This property allows water to moderate the temperature of its surroundings, effectively regulating the climate in various ecosystems. For example, large bodies of water like oceans and lakes help to stabilize local temperatures by absorbing and releasing heat more slowly than land surfaces."
