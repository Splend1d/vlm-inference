An equitable result is what a judge or the arbitrator would decide ex aequo et bono, i.e. upon their discretion and in light of what they consider as fair and equitable in a delimitation case.\n\nIn the context of maritime delimitation, an equitable result refers to a situation where a court or tribunal, when faced with the task of determining the maritime boundary between two states, does not strictly adhere to the equidistance principle (which involves drawing a boundary equally distant from each state's coastlines. Instead, it considers a range of factors, including geographical, economic, environmental, and historical aspects, to determine a boundary that is deemed fair and just for both parties involved. This approach allows for flexibility and consideration of the specific circumstances of each maritime delimitation case."
