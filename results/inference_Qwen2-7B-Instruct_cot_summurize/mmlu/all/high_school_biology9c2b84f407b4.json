This is accomplished through proton pumps such as the vacuolar proton pump (V-ATPase. The low pH allows the lysosome's digestive enzymes to be active, which would not be possible at a more neutral pH like the cytoplasm (around 7.2). Therefore, this acidic environment enables the lysosome to efficiently degrade and recycle cellular waste and foreign particles."
