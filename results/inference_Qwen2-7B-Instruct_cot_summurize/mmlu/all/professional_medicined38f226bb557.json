This condition involves thickening and scarring of the lung tissue, leading to reduced lung function and symptoms like shortness of breath and cough. The histological examination would typically show diffuse interstitial fibrosis, where there is excessive accumulation of collagen fibers in the lung tissue. \n\nThe other options do not typically occur as the primary finding in patients with systemic sclerosis:\n\nB. Intra-alveolar exudates: These are fluid-filled spaces within the alveoli, more commonly associated with acute lung injury or infection.\n\nC. Multiple thromboemboli: While patients with systemic sclerosis may have a higher risk of developing pulmonary embolism due to anticoagulant abnormalities, it's not the primary finding that is pathognomonic for systemic sclerosis.\n\nD. Necrotizing vasculitis: Although some patients with systemic sclerosis may develop necrotizing vasculitis affecting small blood vessels, this is not typically a characteristic finding on lung biopsy in systemic sclerosis."
