                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. **S, +, x) is closed under addition modulo 10.**\n\nThis statement is true because when you add any two elements from set \\(S\\) and then take the result modulo 10, the outcome will always be another element within \\(S\\). For example, \\(2 + 4 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}\\), and \\(6 + 8 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}\\).\n\nB. **(S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.**\n\nThis statement is also true for similar reasons as above. When you multiply any two elements from set \\(S\\) and then take the result modulo 10, the outcome will always be another element within \\(S\\). For example, \\(2 \\times 4 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{10}\\), and \\(4 \\times 8 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}\\).\n\nC. **(S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.**\n\nThis statement is false. In the context of \\(S, +, \\cdot \\) being a structure under addition and multiplication modulo 10, we need to find an element in \\(S \\) that acts as an additive identity. However, there is no single element in \\( S = \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\} \\) that when added to any other element in \\( S \\) results in the original element, considering the operation is done modulo 10. For instance, \\( 4 + 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10} \\), not \\( 4 \\). Thus, there is no identity element for addition in \\( S \\) under these operations.\n\nD. **(S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.**\n\nThis statement is true. For a set with multiplication, if there were an identity element \\( e \\) in \\( S \\), then for every element \\( a \\) in \\( S \\), \\( a \\cdot e \\equiv a \\pmod{10} \\) must hold. However, given the elements in \\( S \\), there is no single element that satisfies this condition for all elements in \\( S \\). For example, while \\( 4 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{ {10} \\), there is no such \\( e \\) that makes \\( 4 \\cdot e \\equiv 4 \\pmod{ {10} \\) true for all \\( e \\) in \\( S \\), except for the trivial case where \\( e \\) is \\( 1 \\), which is not in \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, the false statement among the options provided is **C**."
