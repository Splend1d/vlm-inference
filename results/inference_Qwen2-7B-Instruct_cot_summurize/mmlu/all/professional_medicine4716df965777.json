The other options might be relevant based on the results of the pregnancy test or further evaluation:\n\n- A. abdominal flat plate radiography may be considered if there are signs of obstruction or other abdominal pathology.\n- B. amylase level could be useful if there is suspicion of pancreatitis, which can present with similar symptoms but is not the first choice for an initial test in this scenario.\n- C. complete blood count ( (CBC) might be ordered later in the evaluation to check for anemia or infection, which could be related to blood in the vomit, but it is not the most appropriate initial test.\n\nTherefore, starting with a urine pregnancy test would help determine if pregnancy is a contributing factor to her symptoms before proceeding with additional tests."
