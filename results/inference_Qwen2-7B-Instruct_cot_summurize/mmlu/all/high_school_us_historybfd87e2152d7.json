Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.\u2026 He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!\n\u2014William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843\nGiven the perspective of the passage above, William Hickling Prescott believed which of the following about the conquest of the Aztec Empire?\n\nA. The actions of Hernando Cortes were irrational.\nB. The conquest of Mexico was a racist atrocity.\nC. Cortes was chiefly motivated by a desire for wealth.\nD. The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the perspective presented in the passage, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n\nThe author, William Hickling Prescott, emphasizes Cortes' determination and spirit of adventure, highlighting his conception of conquering Mexico immediately upon landing. He also notes Cortes' successful achievement of a vast enterprise with resources created solely by his own genius, suggesting that the author views the conquest as a testament to Cortes' military prowess rather than undervaluing his talents. Moreover, Prescott describes the assembly of a diverse group of soldiers under Cortes' leadership, indicating that despite their differences, they were compelled to unite for a common goal, supporting the idea that Cortes' leadership facilitated cooperation among these disparate forces.\n\nPrescott does not suggest that Cortes' motivations were purely for wealth ( nor does he imply that the conquest was a racist atroity. Instead, he portrays the Spanish conquest as part of a broader narrative of European exploration and the spread of civilization, suggesting that the Aztec Empire needed to make way for what he perceived as a superior Spanish civilization."
