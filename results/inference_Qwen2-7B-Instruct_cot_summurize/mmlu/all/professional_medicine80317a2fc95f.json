Physical examination shows decreased range of motion in the affected hand. The patient is upset that his hand has not fully healed, and he files a malpractice suit against the physician.

The patient's perception that the physician is incompetent\n\nThis choice aligns with the patient's concern about the healing process and the decrease in range of motion in his hand following the surgery. If the patient believes that the physician lacks competence in performing the procedure or manage the post-operative care, it could be a valid reason for filing a malpractice claim. The other options do not directly address the medical outcome or the patient's perception of the physician's performance."
