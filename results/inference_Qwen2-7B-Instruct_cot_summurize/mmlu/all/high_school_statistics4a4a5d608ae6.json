The probability of getting a finding at least as extreme as that obtained by chance alone if the null hypothesis is true is 0.20. \n\nThis is the correct interpretation of a P-value. A P-value of 0.20 means that, assuming the null hypothesis is true, there's a 20% chance of observing the data or something more extreme just due to random variation. This value is used in hypothesis testing to assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. If the P-value is below a predetermined threshold (often 0.05), it suggests that the observed data are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, and thus, the null hypothesis might be rejected in favor of an alternative hypothesis."
