Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, slashing the neighbor's tires is considered a clear violation of property rights and can cause significant harm and inconvenience to the neighbor. This action is generally viewed as morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, convincing your wife to sell the car might not necessarily be morally wrong. It depends on the context and whether you have the right to make such decisions without her consent or if there was deception involved. However, assuming you had a good reason for wanting to sell the car with her agreement or involvement, this action would not typically be considered morally wrong. It could be seen as a responsible decision if it serves practical needs or financial benefits for both parties."
