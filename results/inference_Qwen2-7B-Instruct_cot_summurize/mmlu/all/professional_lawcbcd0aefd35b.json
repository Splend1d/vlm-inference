Not admissible, because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence.\n\nThis is based on the Federal Rules of Evidence ( Rule 608(b), which generally prohibits the introduction of specific instances of a witness's conduct to attack or support their character for truthfulness. However, there may be exceptions depending on the jurisdiction's specific rules or exceptions to this general rule. In any case, the question posed by the prosecutor seeks to introduce evidence of a past lie by Jones unrelated to the current charges, which would typically fall under this prohibition. \n\nIt's worth noting that the admissibility of evidence can vary significantly between jurisdictions and depends on many factors including the specific circumstances of the case, local rules of evidence, and possibly the judge's discretion."
