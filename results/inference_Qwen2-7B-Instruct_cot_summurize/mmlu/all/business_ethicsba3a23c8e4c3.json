Social policies, Social programmes, and Social impacts.\n\nWood argues that CSR has three primary outcomes:\n\n1. **Social Policies**: These are the formal commitments or guidelines that a company develops regarding its social responsibilities. These policies outline how the company intends to address societal issues through its operations and practices.\n\n2. **Social Programmes**: These are the practical actions taken by the company in line with its CSR policies. This could involve initiatives such as community engagement, environmental protection efforts, or employee welfare programs.\n\n3. **Social Impacts**: These are the outcomes or effects of the company's CSR activities on society. This includes both positive and negative consequences, which can influence public perception, company reputation, and potentially lead to regulatory changes or new business opportunities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Social policies, Social programmes, and Social impacts."
