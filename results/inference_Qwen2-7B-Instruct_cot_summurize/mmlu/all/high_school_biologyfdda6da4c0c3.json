How does the soap help submerge the leaf disks?\n\nA. The soap molecules enter through the stomata of the leaf and bond to oxygen molecules.\nB. The soap molecules bond to air bubbles on the surface of the leaf and remove them.\nC. The soap molecules decrease the pH of the water, allowing excess H+ to bond to the leaf surface.\nD. The hydrophobic regions of the soap molecules attach to the waxy leaf surface, while the hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules.\n"

The hydrophobic region of the soap molecules attaches to the waxy leaf surface, while the hydrophilic (regions form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules. This action reduces the adhesion between the leaf and the air, making it easier for the leaf to sink in the water."
