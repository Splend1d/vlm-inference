Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_B}{\\partial t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) is the electric field,\n- \\( \\Phi_B \\) is the magnetic flux, and\n- \\( \\frac{\\partial \\Phi_B}{\\partial t} \\) is the rate of change of the magnetic flux with respect to time.\n\nThe electric displacement current, \\( I_D \\), is defined as:\n\n\\[ I_D = \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\mathbf{D} \\) is the electric displacement field,\n- \\( \\epsilon_0 \\) is the permittivity of free space, and\n- \\( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} \\) is the rate of change of the electric displacement field with respect to time.\n\nThus, the electric displacement current is indeed proportional to the rate of change of the electric flux through a surface, not the magnetic flux itself or its time integral."
