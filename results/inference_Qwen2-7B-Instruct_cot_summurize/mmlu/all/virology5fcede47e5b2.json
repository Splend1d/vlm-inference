However, the exact number can change as new viruses are discovered or classified. As of my last update in 2023, the Paroviridae family includes at least four genera: Amdarviruses, Cardioviruses, Pararetroviruses, and Parainfluenzaviruses. Therefore, option A ( \"Having 5 genera\" could be potentially correct if we consider that there might have been an addition to the genera since my last update. For the most accurate information, it would be best to consult the latest virology resources or databases like the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( (ICTV)."
