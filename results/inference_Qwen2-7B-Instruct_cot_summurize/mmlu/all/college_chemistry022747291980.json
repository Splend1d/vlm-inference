The number of distinct chemical shifts in a 13C NMR spectrum can be used to determine the structure of an organic compound.\n\nA. Hexane (has a structure as \\( \\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_3 \\). All carbon atoms in hexane are sp^3 hybridized and bonded to either one or two other atoms. This results in a spectrum with four distinct chemical shifts: one for each methyl group, one for the methylene group directly attached to the methyl group, and two for the remaining two types of methylene groups.\n\nB. 2-Mthylpentane has the structure \\( \\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_3 \\). It has three distinct environments: the two methyl groups, and the remaining methylene group.\n\nC. 3-Mthylpentane has the structure \\( \\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_3 \\). It also has three distinct environments: the two methyl groups and the remaining two methylene groups.\n\nD. 2,3-Dimethylbutane has the structure \\( \\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_3 \\). It has four distinct environments: the two methyl groups, the first methylene group attached to the methyl group, and the second methylene group attached to the methyl group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2-methylpentane, because it has five distinct environments: the two methyl groups, and the three different types of methylene groups, resulting in five distinct chemical shifts in its 13C NMR spectrum."
