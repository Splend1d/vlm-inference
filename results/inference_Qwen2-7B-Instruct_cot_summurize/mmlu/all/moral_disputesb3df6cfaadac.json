The harm can be seen as a form of symbolic violence that expresses societal attitudes towards gender, power, and sexuality. \n\nGiven this understanding, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Both A and B\n\nThis is because, according to McGregor, the expressive harm of rape can be both intentionally inflicted through societal and cultural norms that normalize or justify sexual violence (option A), and it can also occur unintentionally due to the perpetuation of harmful beliefs and attitudes about gender and sexuality that lead to such acts. Therefore, the harm can be both intentionally and unintentionally inflicted, depending on the context and perspective."
