The most important characteristics of weak states are their frequent inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence. Even within states with well developed coercive power they do not always retain absolute loyalty and are faced with a real possibility of military intervention. Whilst armed forces are ill-equipped, poorly managed and prone to factional divisions, social actors are powerful enough to resist governance. Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent.\nB. Weak states possess high levels of social-political cohesion which is correlated to the hegemonic enforcement idea of the regime, which in turn becomes accepted to the point of being legitimized as the social norm.\nC. Weak states have a monopoly on the instruments of violence and have the coercive capability to force compliance even when social actors attempt to resist. The regimes lack popular legitimacy, the integrity of the regime's survival is consolidated by power resulting in the naturalization of violence within society.\nD. Weak states do not utilize coercive capabilities in normal policy. State institutions typically have a developed bureaucracy which legitimizes the regime's ability to rule. Paradoxically, however, the more a weak state exercises its coercive power the more it reinforces its infrastructural power but reduces its ability to rule.\n"

Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent.\n\nThis statement accurately captures the essence of what defines a weak state. A weak state struggles to maintain control over its territory and population due to issues with its military and security apparatus, which are often underfunded, poorly equipped, and prone to internal divisions. This weakness can lead to instability, as various factions within the state may vie for power or external actors may intervene. Social actors, such as citizens, may have significant influence over governance and be capable of resisting state authority. As a result, the state frequently lacks a strong monopoly on the use of violence, which is essential for maintaining order and stability."
