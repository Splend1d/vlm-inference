This method involves collecting a range of student work over time, which allows educators to see the progression and improvement in skills, as well as the breadth of the student's understanding and application of those skills. It includes not only drafts but also reflections, planning documents, and revisions, providing a comprehensive view of the student's learning process and outcomes."
