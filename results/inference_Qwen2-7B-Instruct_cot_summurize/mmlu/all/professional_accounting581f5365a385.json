As an increase in accumulated depreciation of $32,000.\n\nThe reason for this is that the failure to record depreciation in the prior year does not affect the expense recognized in the current or any future years, as the expense has already been incurred. However, it does impact the book value of the asset (in this case, the building) and the accumulated depreciation account. Since the depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes, it means the tax return for the prior year understated the depreciation expense by $40,000. This results in a deferred tax asset if the company uses the balance sheet method for recognizing temporary differences. \n\nTo correct this error in the current year, you would adjust the accumulated depreciation by $32,000 ( which is the amount of depreciation that should have been recorded in the prior year ($40,000) multiplied by the tax rate ( (20% or 0.20). This adjustment reflects the correct book value of the asset on the balance sheet without affecting the income statement, as the expense has already been accounted for in the prior year's tax return."
