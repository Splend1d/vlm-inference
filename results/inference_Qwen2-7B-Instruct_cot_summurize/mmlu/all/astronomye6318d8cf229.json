From fragments of planets ejected by impacts\n\nPlanetary rings systems often form when a moon or satellite of a planet is torn apart by tidal forces due to its close proximity to the planet. These tidal forces can cause the moon to break up into smaller and smaller pieces until it forms a ring system. This process can happen when a moon gets too close to its parent planet, and the gravitational pull causes it to disintegrate.\n\nThe fragments that make up these rings can vary in size from tiny particles of dust and ice to larger boulders or even small moons. The rings can also consist of material that was originally part of the planet's formation disk (the \"solar nebula\") but was never able to coalesce into a full-fledged moon.\n\nSo while option A ( \"From the dismantling of small moons by impacts\" does contribute to the composition of some rings, especially if the impact is strong enough to break apart a moon, it's not the primary mechanism for forming most planetary ring systems. Options C and D describe processes that can contribute to the composition of rings systems but do not explain their origin."
