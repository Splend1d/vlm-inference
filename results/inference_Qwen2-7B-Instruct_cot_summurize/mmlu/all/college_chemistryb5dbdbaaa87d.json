It has little effect.\n\nWhen you double the volume of a buffer solution by adding water, the concentrations of both the weak acid and its conjugate base are halved ( because you're diluting the solution. Since the initial concentrations were equal, doubling the volume will still keep their concentrations relatively close to each other. This means the buffer's ability to resist changes in pH upon the addition of small amounts of acid or base is largely preserved. Therefore, the pH of the buffer will have little effect compared to when it was at its original concentration ratio."
