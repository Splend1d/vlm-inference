When considering the options given:\n\nA. **4**: This is not necessarily a factor because \\(4 = 2^2\\), and while \\(2\\) is a factor, the presence of \\(2^2\\) cannot be guaranteed based on the given prime factors since they only include one \\(2\\).\n\nB. **2**: Since \\(2\\) is listed as one of the prime factors, any number with \\(2\\) as a prime factor will have \\(2\\) as a factor. Therefore, \\(2\\) is indeed a factor of this number.\n\nC. **10**: This is a product of \\(2\\) and \\(5\\). While both \\(2\\) and \\(5\\) are factors of the number, just because the number includes both \\(2\\) and \\(5\\) in its prime factorization does not mean \\(10\\) ( itself is a factor. For example, the number could be \\(2 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13 \\times 31 = 10 \\times 7 \\times 13 \\times 31\\), but it could also be any multiple of these primes, not necessarily including \\(10\\) specifically.\n\nD. **15**: This is a product of \\(3\\) and \\(5\\). Since neither \\(3\\) nor \\(5\\) is listed as a prime factor of the number, \\(15\\) cannot be a factor of this number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 2**."
