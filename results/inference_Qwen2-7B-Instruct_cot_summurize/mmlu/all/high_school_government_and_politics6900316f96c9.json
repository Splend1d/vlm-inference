This is due to Senate rules that allow for an extended period of debate on any bill or motion, which can be blocked by a minority of senators if they choose to speak for as long as necessary. \n\nIn contrast, the House of Representatives generally has more structured debate times and rules that limit how long speeches can last, making it less susceptible to filibuster-like tactics. The House often uses a \"point of order\" system to enforce time limits on speeches and debate, preventing prolonged discussions that could stall legislative action.\n\nIt's important to note that while the House has procedural mechanisms to manage debate, it does not have the same level of formalized filibuster protection as the Senate. However, the Senate's filibuster rule allows for more prolonged debate and obstruction, which is why filibusters are less likely to occur in the House."
