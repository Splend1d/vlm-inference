This principle is famously encapsulated in his argument about the \"drowning child,\" suggesting that saving a child from drowning should be prioritized regardless of where they are located.\n\nRegarding objections to his theory:\n\nA. It is indeed argued that Singer's theory might not sufficiently prioritize alleviatinging suffering in distant parts of the world compared to local issues. This criticism stems from the concern that his global utilitarian perspective might lead to neglect of immediate local needs in favor of more distant but potentially greater numbers of people in need.\n\nB. Another critique is that his theory inadvertently gives undue weight to geographical proximity. Critics argue that this could lead to a moral bias towards helping those closer to us, potentially overlooking those in dire need elsewhere.\n\nC. The concept of a stronger moral obligation to one's loved ones versus strangers is also debated. Some argue that Singer's theory should incorporate some form of relational or familial duty, acknowledging that there may be more significant moral obligations owed to those with whom we have a personal connection.\n\nD. Finally, the practicality and feasibility of adopting Singer's theory in its entirety are often questioned. The requirement to consider the interests of all beings equally, especially when it comes to making life-altering decisions, can be seen as too drastic a change to the existing moral framework.\n\nS"
