This action involves causing harm and suffering to living beings unnecessarily and without their consent, which is not only ethically questionable but also potentially illegal depending on jurisdictional laws regarding animal cruelty and food safety.\n\nIn Scenario 2, tossing the hot coal to a friend can be considered morally wrong if it leads to injury or harm. Assuming no context of a controlled game where such action might be seen as playful and harmless ( which isn't provided here), intentionally harming someone through physical means would generally be viewed as morally wrong. However, without specific context, it's hard to definitively label this scenario as unequivocally wrong, given that it could depend on the intent and circumstances. But, in general terms, it leans towards being morally questionable. \n\nThus, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions could be considered wrong."
