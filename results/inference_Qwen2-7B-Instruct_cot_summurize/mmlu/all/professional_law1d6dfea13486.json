The factory moved for summary judgment on the ground of res judicata (claim preclusion), arguing that the man had sued on and lost an identical claim one year before. The court denied the motion. The factory has asked its attorney's advice as to whether it may appeal the court's denial of summary judgment in order to avoid an expensive trial. What advice should the attorney give?\n\nA. The factory may appeal if the appellate court finds that the case involves a controlling question of law upon which the courts are divided.\nB. The factory may appeal if the trial court certifies that there is no just reason for delay.\nC. The factory may not appeal until after a trial on the merits or other disposition resulting in a final judgment.\nD. The factory may not appeal, because the denial of summary judgment is a collateral order.\n"

The factory may not appeal until after a trial on the merits or other disposition resulting in a final judgment.\n\nIn the United States legal system, appeals can generally only be taken from final judgments, not from interlocutory orders such as a denial of a motion for summary judgment. This is known as the final judgment rule. The factory would need to wait until after a full trial on the merits or some other action that results in a final judgment before it could appeal the court's decision denying the motion for summary judgment based on res judicata. \n\nOptions A and B describe circumstances under which an appeal might be allowed under certain exceptions to the final judgment rule, but these do not apply to the scenario described here. Option D incorrectly states that the denial of summary judgment is a collateral order, which is not relevant to the question of whether the factory can appeal the denial of summary judgment on res judicata grounds."
