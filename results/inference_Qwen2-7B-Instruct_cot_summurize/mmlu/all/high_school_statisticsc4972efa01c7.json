                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Z-score in normal distribution. The Z-score is calculated as:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the value we're interested in ( in this case, the amount of bread baked which exceeds the demand, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean daily demand, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the demand.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean daily demand (\\(\\mu\\)) = 2,500 loaves\n- Standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 225 loaves\n- Bread baked per day = 3,000 loaves\n\nWe want to find the probability that the demand exceeds 3,000 loaves, so we calculate the Z-score for 3,000 loaves:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{3000 - 2500}{225} = \\frac{500}{225} = 2.22 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that corresponds to a Z-score of 2.22. This probability represents the area under the curve to the right of our Z-score, which means the probability of exceeding 3,000 loaves in demand.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator function for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, we find the probability associated with a Z-score of 2.22. This gives us the probability of not running out of bread, but since we're looking for the probability of running out, we need the complement of this value.\n\nThe probability of Z being less than 2.22 is approximately 0.9868 ( (looking up 2.22 in a standard normal distribution table). Therefore, the probability of running out of bread (i.e., demand exceeding 3,000 loaves) is:\n\n\\[ P(Z > 2.22) = 1 - P(Z < 2.22) = 1 - 0.9868 = 0.0132 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 0.0132."
