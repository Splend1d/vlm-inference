A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods\n\nThe tone of the first letter reflects the growing dependence of African kingdoms, such as Kongo, on trade with Europe for manufactured goods. This dependence is evident through the mention of \"the wares and things of your Kingdoms,\" which are are being brought here by European traders, satisfying the African demand for these goods. The issue highlighted regarding the kidnapping of people to sell to Europeans underscores the extent to which African societies were entangled in the transatlantic trade networks, particularly the slave trade, facilitated by European demand. This dependence on trade with Europe for goods not locally available is a key development in early modern Africa, especially in relation to the interaction between European and African economies."
