Air\n\nAir is likely to provide both the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility among the options provided.\n\nTotal utility refers to the overall satisfaction or benefit received from consuming a good or service, while marginal utility is the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of that good or service.\n\nAir is essential for human survival, so the total utility of air is very high since it is necessary for life itself. Without air, people cannot breathe and survive, which makes it a vital good with immense total utility.\n\nOn the other hand, the marginal utility of air is relatively small. Once a person has enough air to breathe, consuming even more air does not significantly increase their satisfaction or well-being. The additional units of air consumed after meeting basic needs do not add much to the overall satisfaction, making the marginal utility quite low.\n\nTherefore, air provides the largest total utility (essential for survival) and the smallest marginal utility (not much additional satisfaction from consuming more than what is needed."
