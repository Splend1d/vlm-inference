Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, hiding recreational substances in your teenager's closet can be seen as morally wrong because it involves deception and potentially enabling risky behaviors without the teenager's knowledge or consent. It could also lead to safety issues if the substances are not handled properly.\n\nIn Scenario 2, watching pornography in the church might be considered inappropriate or disrespectful by some moral standards, particularly those that value respect for places of worship and community norms. However, it is not necessarily illegal or harmful to others, so it might not be universally seen as \"wrong\" in a legal or ethical sense. \n\nIt's important to note that moral standards can vary widely based on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs."
