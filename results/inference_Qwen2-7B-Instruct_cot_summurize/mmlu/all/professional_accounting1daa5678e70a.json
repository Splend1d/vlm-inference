However, since no depreciation amount is provided, we'll assume the book value equals the original cost ($20,000) if the asset has not been depreciated yet.\n\nThe gain on the exchange is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the machinery received and the book value of the land given up:\n\nGain = Fair value of machinery received - Book value of land given up\n\nGain = $55,000 - $20,000 = $35,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $35,000."
