The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the retiree's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the artist has continued to pay his rent, and the retiree continued to accept it. The building became infested with rats after a restaurant was opened in the adjacent building. The artist could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. At common law, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period?\n\nA. Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.\nB. Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.\nC. Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.\nD. Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.\n"

Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three-year period.\n\nAt common law, when a tenant remains in possession of property after the expiration of a lease without the landlord's consent, this is known as \"holding over.\" In such cases, the tenant may become a trespasser at the will of the landlord. However, if the landlord accepts rent from the tenant after the lease has expired, it can be interpreted as an implied renewal of the lease on new terms. \n\nIn this scenario, since the artist continued to pay rent and the retiree accepted it, it can be considered an implied renewal of the lease. If the retiree wishes to terminate the relationship, they would need to provide proper notice according to local laws. Before the first rental payment after the expiration of the initial three-year period, the retiree could potentially seek a remedy based on the principle of unjust enrichment or by claiming the artist should have vacated the premises or been held responsible for three years' rent, depending on the specifics of the situation and local laws. However, option C, which involves recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist stayed beyond the initial three-year period, is most closely aligned with the concept of recovering damages due to a tenant staying past the expiration of the lease without express permission."
