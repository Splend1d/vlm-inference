However, among the options provided, an \"open type winding\" is generally necessary for all DC machines because it allows for the flow of current through the conductors, which is essential for generating a magnetic field and producing torque in the motor or power in the generator. \n\nIn contrast, while \"closed winding,\" \"lap winding,\" and \"wave winding\" are different types of windings that can be used in DC machines depending on factors such as voltage levels, current ratings, and efficiency requirements, they are not necessarily required in every DC machine. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. open type winding"
