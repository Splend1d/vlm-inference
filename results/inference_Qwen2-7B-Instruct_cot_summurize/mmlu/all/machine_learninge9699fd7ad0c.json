Inputs are $100$-dimensional, and have several features such as the number of square feet, the median family income, etc. The first hidden layer has $1000$ activations. The second hidden layer has $10$ activations. The output is a scalar representing the house price. Assuming a vanilla network with affine transformations and with no batch normalization and no learnable parameters in the activation function, how many parameters does this network have?\n\nA. 111021\nB. 110010\nC. 111110\nD. 110011\n"

                    "text": "To calculate the total number of parameters in this neural network, we need to consider both the weights and biases for each layer.\n\nThe input layer connects directly to the first hidden layer. Since the input is 100-dimensional and the first hidden layer has 1000 activations, there will be 100 * 1000 = 100,000 weights connecting the input layer to the first hidden layer. Additionally, there will be 1000 biases for these activations, resulting in 1000 additional parameters. So, the total for the first layer is 100,000 + 1000 = 101,000 parameters.\n\nNext, the first hidden layer connects to the second hidden layer. There are are 1000 activations from the first hidden layer and the second hidden layer has 10 activations. This means there are are 1000 * 10 = 10,000 weights connecting the first hidden layer to the second hidden layer. There will also be 10 biases for these activations, adding another 10 parameters. So, the total for the second layer is 10,000 + 10 = 10,010 parameters.\n\nFinally, the second hidden layer connects to the output layer (which is a single scalar value. Therefore, there are 10 activations from the second hidden layer and the output layer is 1-dimensional, meaning there are 10 * 1 = 10 weights connecting the second hidden layer to the output layer. There will also be 1 bias for this output, resulting in an additional 1 parameter. So, the total for the output layer is 10 + 1 = 11 parameters.\n\nAdding all these together: 101,000 ( (first layer) + 10,010 ( (second layer) + 11 ( (output layer) = 111,021 parameters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 111021"
