There is no concrete historical evidence to support any specific sexual orientation for him. Therefore, none of these options can be definitively proven correct based on historical records. However, in modern interpretations and speculations, his relationships with men have sometimes been discussed in the context of bisexuality or homosexuality due to the nature of his court and relationships with companions like Hephaestion. But again, this remains largely speculative and based on modern interpretations rather than definitive historical evidence."
