It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nThe views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy\nD. Maintenance of large armies\n"

Tacitus is describing a historical event where Roman tribes (Chamavi and Angrivarii) expelled another group (the Bructeri, presumably due to concerns over their actions or threats. The passage does not necessarily express disgust for barbarian peoples, concern about Stoicism among the aristocracy, or the need for maintaining large armies based solely on this excerpt. Instead, it reflects a historical context of conflict and territorial disputes within the Roman world, indicating the Romans' concern about external threats and their methods of dealing with them."
