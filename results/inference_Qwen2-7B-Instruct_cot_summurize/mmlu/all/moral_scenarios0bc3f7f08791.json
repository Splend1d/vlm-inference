In Scenario 1, the main character is clearly doing something morally wrong by stealing wallets.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is ordering students to study. While it might be seen as somewhat harsh or demanding depending on the context and how it was executed, it is not necessarily morally wrong. It is part of the teacher's role to ensure their students learn and understand the material. The scenario does not provide enough information to label this action as morally wrong in an absolute sense. However, if the conditions under which the students were asked to study were excessively harsh, such as during a time of personal crisis for them, then it could be argued that it could be morally wrong from their perspective. But based solely on the information given, ordering students to study is not considered morally wrong."
