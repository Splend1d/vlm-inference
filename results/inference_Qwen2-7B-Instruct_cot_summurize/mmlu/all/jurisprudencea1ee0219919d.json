Gemeinschaft is a society based on community, while Gesellschaft is one based on association. \n\nGeorg Simmel, a sociologist, introduced these terms to describe two different types of social relationships. Gemeinschaft refers to a community where people have close ties based on shared values, traditions, and personal relationships. In contrast, Gesellschaft describes societies where people interact primarily for self-interest or practical reasons, often through formal institutions or contractual agreements."
