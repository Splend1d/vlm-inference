                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Decreased by a factor of 81.\n\nThe emission spectrum of an atom is determined by the energy transitions between its discrete energy levels. The energy difference between two levels determines the wavelength of light emitted during a transition from the higher level to the lower one.\n\nFor Li\u00b2\u207a, with Z = 3, the energy levels depend on the principal quantum number n, which can take values greater than or equal to 2 for this ion ( (since it's doubly ionized, it has lost two electrons). \n\nFor a hydrogen-like atom (like Li\u00b2\u207a, the energy levels are given by:\n\n\\[ E_n = -\\frac{h^2}{2m}\\frac{1}{n^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is Planck's constant, and \\( m \\) is the mass of the electron. For simplicity, we can write \\( -\\frac{h^2}{2m} \\) as \\( K \\), so the energy levels are given by:\n\n\\[ E_n = -\\frac{K}{n^2} \\]\n\nThe energy difference between two levels \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\) (is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = E_{n_1} - E_{n_2} = -\\frac{K}{n_1^2} + \\frac{K}{n_2^2} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = \\frac{K}{n_1^2} - \\frac{K}{n_2^2} = K\\left(\\frac{1}{n_2^2} - \\frac{1}{n_1^2}\\right) \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the hydrogen atom, which has Z=1. The energy levels for hydrogen are:\n\n\\[ E_n = -\\frac{K}{n^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( K \\) is the same constant. \n\nThe energy difference between two levels \\( m_1 \\) and \\( o_2 \\) for hydrogen is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E' = \\frac{K}{o_1^2} - \\frac{K}{o_2^2} = K\\left(\\frac{1}{o_1^2} - \\frac{1}{o_2^2}\\right) \\]\n\nNotice that \\( \\Delta E' \\) is exactly the same as \\( \\Delta E \\), since they both are proportional to \\( K \\) and involve the inverse square of the principal quantum numbers.\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of light emitted during a transition in Li\u00b2\u207a will be the same as the wavelength of light emitted during a transition in hydrogen for the same initial and final energy levels. However, since the energy levels for Li\u00b2\u207a are closer together than those for hydrogen (because \\( \\frac{1}{n^2} \\) decreases more rapidly with increasing \\( n \\) for Li\u00b2\u207a compared to hydrogen), the wavelengths will correspond to higher energy transitions in Li\u00b2\u207a.\n\nThe relationship between the wavelengths of Li\u00b2\u207a and hydrogen for the same transitions is given by:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_{Li^+} = \\lambda_{H} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n_H}{n_{Li^+}}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nSince \\( n_{Li^+} \\) is less than \\( n_H \\) for the same transitions, this implies that \\( \\lambda_{Li^+} < \\lambda_{H} \\), meaning the wavelengths of Li\u00b2\u207a are shorter than those of hydrogen for the same transitions.\n\nTo find how much they are decreased, we need to compare the energy levels directly:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E_{Li^+}}{\\Delta E_H} = \\frac{\\frac{K}{n_1^2} - \\frac{K}{n_2^2}}{\\frac{K}{o_1^2} - \\frac{K}{o_2^2}} = \\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \\frac{1}{n_2^2} : \\frac{1}{o_1^2} - \\frac{1}{o_2^2} \\]\n\nGiven that the energy levels decrease faster with increasing \\( n \\) for Li\u00b2\u207a than for hydrogen, we can infer that \\( \\Delta E_{Li^+} < \\Delta E_H \\), and thus the wavelengths must be longer for hydrogen than for Li\u00b2\u207a.\n\nTo find the exact factor, we compare the energy levels:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1_1^2}{n_1^2} = 81 \\]\n\nThis means the wavelengths of Li\u00b2\u207a are decreased by a factor of 81 when compared to hydrogen, making the correct answer C.
