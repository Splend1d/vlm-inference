Higher taxes and buying Treasury securities.\n\nThis represents a combination of contractionary fiscal policy ( (higher taxes) and expansionary monetary policy ( (buying Treasury securities). \n\nWhen taxes are increased, consumers have less disposable income, which can decrease consumption and slow down economic growth - this is a contractionary fiscal policy. On the other hand, when the central bank buys Treasury securities, it increases the money supply in the economy, which can stimulate economic growth - this is an expansionary monetary policy. \n\nTherefore, option D represents a combination of these two policies types."
