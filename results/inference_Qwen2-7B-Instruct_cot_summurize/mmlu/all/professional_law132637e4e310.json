He assigned in writing 25 percent of any future royalties, when and if the screenplay was made into either a movie or a stage play, to his friend, who had subsidized him during his early years as a struggling writer. Shortly after the screenplay was completed, the author was killed in an auto accident. A movie studio then purchased the screenplay from the executors of the author's estate and filmed the movie Quiet Winter, which was a great success. In an action against the executors of the author's estate to recover her percentage of the movie royalties, the friend will most likely\n\nA. lose, because under the circumstances an assignment of future rights is unenforceable.\nB. lose, because the attempted gift of royalties failed for non-delivery.\nC. win, because she was an intended beneficiary.\nD. win, because the assignment of future rights is enforceable.\n"

This assignment is a legal agreement that transfers the right to receive a portion of the future income from the screenplay to the friend. Since the assignment was in writing and it specified that the royalties would be given to the friend \"when and if\" the screenplay was adapted into a movie or stage play, it meets the criteria for a valid assignment of future rights.\n\nThe fact that the author died before the screenplay was adapted into a successful movie does not nullify the assignment. The assignment was valid at the time it was made, and the friend becomes entitled to the agreed-upon percentage of royalties once the conditions specified in the assignment are met (in this case, when the screenplay is adapted into a movie.\n\nTherefore, the friend can sue the executors of the author's estate to recover her percentage of the movie royalties, and she is likely to win the lawsuit based on the enforceability of the assignment."
