In many cases, species with overlapping breeding seasons can still successfully breed and produce viable offspring, especially if they do not experience significant behavioral or physical barriers to mating. \n\nGeographic isolation ( (A) means that the potential mates cannot physically reach each other to mate.\n\nBehavioral isolation ( (B) refers to differences in courtship behaviors that prevent one species from recognizing the signals of another species as potential mates.\n\nReproductive isolation  ((C) includes differences in the timing of breeding seasons, among other factors, which prevent successful mating between species. However, this term is often used more broadly to encompass all types of barriers that prevent interbreedingability, including those not directly related to the breeding season."
