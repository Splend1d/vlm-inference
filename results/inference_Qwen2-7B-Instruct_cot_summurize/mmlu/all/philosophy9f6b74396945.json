Psychological egoism suggests that all of our actions are ultimately motivated by self-interest. If we always felt pleasure when getting what we want, it could potentially be seen as supporting this view since it might imply that our actions are driven by our desire for pleasure.\n\nHowever, Feinberg points out that there are instances where people do not feel pleasure when they get what they want, such as when someone has to work very hard to achieve something they desire but ends up feeling exhausted or indifferent about the outcome. These counterexamples show that one can still act in ways that benefit others without being necessarily acting from a self-interested motive. Therefore, according to Feinberg, the claim that we always feel pleasure when we get what we want is false, and this fact does not support psychological egoism even if it were true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. is false, and would not support psychological egoism even if it were true."
