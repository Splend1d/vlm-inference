All proteins that are to be catabolised are tagged with the peptide ubiquitin.\n\nUbiquitination is a key process in the regulation of proteolysis, particularly in the context of the proteasome pathway, which is responsible for the degradation of many cellular proteins. Proteins destined for degradation are often modified by the addition of ubiquitin molecules, which signals for their subsequent breakdown by the proteasome.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. The rate of tissue protein catabolism is not necessarily constant throughout the day; it can vary depending on metabolic needs and circadian rhythms.\nB. Not all tissue proteins undergo catabolism at the same rate; some may have faster turnover rates than others based on their function and the physiological state of the organism.\nD. While lysosomal enzymes play a significant role in the degradation of macromolecules including proteins, they are not the only mechanism for tissue protein catabolism. Proteins can also be degraded through the proteasomal pathway mentioned above."
