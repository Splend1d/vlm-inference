In this case, Ace Co. received $15 per share for 1000 shares, which totals $15,000. This amount would be reported as a cash inflow under the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. There is no need to adjust this amount to calculate cash flows from operating activities since the issuance of stock is directly related to financing activities, not operations."
