A group of students painted purple a statue of the university's founder in protest to the university's federally subsidized nuclear weapon experimental studies. The leader of this group of students was a first-year student from a neighboring state who established residency in the state after beginning classes. The group leader had been the recipient of a $5,000 annual grant from the state to finance his education. However, the aid was withdrawn because of a state statute, which provided: \"Any student attending a state university who engages in disruptive campus activities will not be eligible for state aid. \"The group leader was married to a fellow student. However, in light of his involvement in defacing the statue and the loss of his state aid, his wife left him. At that time, the group leader received a tax bill for $150. This tax was imposed uniformly by the city on all individuals over 19 years of age, with the exception that full-time female college students were exempted. The tax notice stated that his wife, 22 years of age, qualified for the exemption, and there was no bill enclosed for her. Subsequently, the group leader moved in with his new girlfriend and began making arrangements to secure a divorce. However, the group leader was not able to obtain a divorce, since he had not fulfilled the 12-month residency requirement as imposed by state law. In an action by the group leader against the state challenging the constitutionality of the state statute regarding disruptive campus activities in order to regain his $5,000 annual grant, the court will most likely declare the statute\n\nA. constitutional, because it promotes a compelling state interest.\nB. constitutional, because it is a proper exercise of state action designed to regulate the activities of state university students.\nC. unconstitutional, because it is vague and overbroad.\nD. unconstitutional, because it is discriminatory on its face.\n"

                    "text": "C. unconstitutional, because it is vague and overbroad.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe state statute that denies state aid to students engaging in disruptive campus activities could potentially be challenged under the principles of vagueness and overbreadth in a court of law. Vagueness occurs when a law fails to provide clear guidelines for determining what conduct is prohibited, leading to arbitrary enforcement and potential infringement on First Amendment rights. Overbreadth refers to laws that prohibit not only the specific behavior they intend to address but also other conduct that might be considered constitutionally protected.\n\nIn this case, the statute could be seen as overbroad if it does not clearly define what constitutes \"disruptive\" campus activities, leaving room for subjective interpretation by administrators or police. This could lead to the suppression of protected speech or assembly without clear standards, which would be problematic under the First Amendment.\n\nMoreover, the statute might also be challenged as being vague if it does not specify what activities are considered disruptive and how they should be evaluated. This lack of clarity could lead to inconsistent application of the law, which is another constitutional concern.\n\nAs for discrimination, while the statute initially appears neutral, the specific circumstances of the case (such as the withdrawal of aid due to a relationship status (and the marital status-based exemption for female students) might raise questions about whether the law discriminates against certain groups in a way that is not reasonably related to a legitimate state interest. However, this aspect seems less central to the primary concerns of vagueness and overbreadth in this context.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the court is most likely to rule the statute unconstitutional primarily for being vague and overbroad, rather than for being discriminatory, unless additional arguments can be made that the discrimination aspect is significant enough to outweigh the vagueness and overbreadth concerns."
