The knee is not a ball and socket joint; it is a hinge joint that allows for flexion and extension.\n- B. A baker's cyst typically forms behind the knee, not anterior ( it is usually found over the tibia, just above the knee joint.\n- C. The patellar tap is a diagnostic maneuver where pressure is applied under the patella (knee cap) to check if fluid is present beneath it, which would indicate a knee effusion.\n- D. 'Knock knee', also known as genu valgum, is characterized by knees that turn inward, while 'bow leg' or genu varum refers to knees that turn outward. Thus, a 'knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu valgum, not genu varum."
