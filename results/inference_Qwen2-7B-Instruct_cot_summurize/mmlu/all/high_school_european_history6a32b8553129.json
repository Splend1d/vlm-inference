One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given?\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\nB. Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\nD. Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the quote provided by Voltaire, it seems that he is questioning the role of reason in understanding and predicting natural disasters, as well as reflectinging on the moral implications of human actions and the fate of individuals during such events. This sentiment align more closely with Jean-Jacques Rousseau's philosophical views, particularly his ideas about the corruption of society and the innate goodness of human beings before societal influence.\n\nRousseau believed that humans are inherently good but that society corrupts this goodness through its institutions and structures. He emphasized the importance of emotions and the individual's natural inclinations over rationality and societal norms. This aligns with Voltaire's expression of concern about the suffering and loss caused by natural disasters and the potential hypocrisy of religious leaders, suggesting that reason might not be sufficient to guide morality or predict natural phenomena.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls."
