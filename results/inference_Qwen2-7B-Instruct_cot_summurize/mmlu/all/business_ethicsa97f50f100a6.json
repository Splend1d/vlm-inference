This model is often associated with market-oriented policies, deregulation, and a strong emphasis on free trade and private enterprise.\n\nGiven the financial crisis that began in 2007 and reached its peak in 2008, also known as the Global Financial Crisis or Great Recession, the effectiveness of the Anglo-American model was called into question. The crisis highlighted issues such as excessive risk-taking by financial institutions, inadequate regulation, and the potential for systemic instability in these economies. \n\nHere's a breakdown of how each option relates to this context:\n\nA. 1,2,3 - This implies that options 1, 2, and 3 might support the claim that the Anglo-American model was the best before the recession. However, without specific details about what these options represent, it's hard to provide an accurate response. Generally speaking, the crisis revealed significant flaws in the model, suggesting that it might not have been \"the best\" in hindsight.\n\nB. 1,3,4 - Similarly, this option would need more context. However, considering the post-crisis reflections, one might argue that elements of the Anglo-American model (like deregulation and reliance on markets ( contributed to vulnerabilities that led to the crisis. Therefore, this option could suggest that certain aspects were not ideal.\n\nC. 2,3,4 - This option might suggest that two or three points support the view that the Anglo-American model had significant issues during and after the recession. The crisis indeed exposed weaknesses in the model related to financial oversight, risk management, and the interconnectedness of global financial systems.\n\nD. 1,2,3,4 - This option would imply that all points considered support the notion that the Anglo-American model was either the best or had significant flaws when evaluated in light of the recession. Given the insights gained from the crisis, many would argue that the model had substantial flaws that needed addressing.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most accurate answer would likely be C. 2,3,4, assuming that \"2\" refers to deregulation, \"3\" to reliance on markets, and \"4\" to the interconnected nature of global financial systems. These aspects were crucial in understanding how the Anglo-American model contributed to the vulnerabilities that led to the Global Financial Crisis."
