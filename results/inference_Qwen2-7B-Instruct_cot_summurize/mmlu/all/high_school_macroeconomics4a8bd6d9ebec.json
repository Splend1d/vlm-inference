                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The crowding out effect occurs when government borrowing to finance its spending competes with private borrowers for funds, leading to higher interest rates and reduced private investment. This effect is more pronounced when the investment demand curve is inelastic. An inelastic investment demand curve means that changes in interest rates have a small impact on the quantity of investment demanded. Thus, even if interest rates rise due to increased government borrowing, the decrease in private investment is limited because firms are less responsive to changes in interest rates.\n\nTo clarify why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Expansionary monetary policy would actually counteract crowding out by keeping interest rates low, making it easier for both the government and private sector to borrow.\n  \nC. If government spending improves profit expectations among businesses, it could lead to an increase in private investment, which might reduce the crowding out effect rather than increase it.\n\nD. An elastic investment demand curve means that changes in interest rates have a large impact on the quantity of investment demanded. In this case, the crowding out effect would be lessened because firms would significantly reduce their investment in response to higher interest rates."
