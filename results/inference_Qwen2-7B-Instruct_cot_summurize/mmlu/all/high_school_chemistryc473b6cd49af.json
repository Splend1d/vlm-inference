Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent. Step 3. Separated solute and solvent are brought together filling in the spaces.All of the fundamental principles below are important in understanding the formation of solutions except which one?\n\nA. Starting at equilibrium, moving particles apart while in the solid or equilibrium phases requires added energy proportional to the attractive forces.\nB. Bringing particles together releases energy in proportion to their attractive forces.\nC. The total of the energies in steps 1 to 3 indicates if a solution will form.\nD. Molecules with similar molecular masses are required to form solutions.\n"

Molecules with similar molecular masses are required to form solutions.\n\nThe formation of a solution does not require that the molecules have similar molecular masses. While it's true that some similarities in molecular structure or size might facilitate interactions between solute and solvent molecules, especially in cases like like-dissolves-like ( where polar solvents dissolve polar solutes and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes, it is not a strict requirement for the formation of a solution. Solutions can form with a wide range of solute and solvent molecules, regardless of their mass, provided that the solute can dissolve in the solvent through appropriate interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, or ionic bonding."
