This concept is often used in ecology to describe how one species might replace another over time in a given environment, a process known as succession. The invaders may eventually become the dominant species in the area, potentially leading to the extinction of the original species if environmental conditions allow for it. This dynamic can also apply to human societies, where migration patterns lead to changes in demographic composition and cultural landscapes."
