Registered voters between the ages of 35 and 45 are more likely to vote than those under the age of 21. - This statement could be true, as there might be generational factors influencing voter turnout. However, without specific data, we cannot definitively confirm its accuracy.\n\nB. A registered voter who has attained his or her General Educational Development (GED) is less likely to vote than a high school dropout. - This statement is generally not supported by empirical evidence. Studies have shown that education level correlates with higher voter turnout, suggesting that GED holders may be more likely to vote than those without a high school diploma.\n\nC. Registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections than they are in primary elections. - This statement is accurate. Primary elections typically have lower turnout rates compared to general elections due to fewer eligible voters participating.\n\nD. More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980. - This statement can be confirmed as accurate based on historical data. Women have consistently had higher voter turnout rates than men in U.S. presidential elections since 1980.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that does NOT accurately describe voting behavior in the United States is **B. A registered voter who has attained his or her General Educational Development (GED) is less likely to vote than a high school dropout**."
