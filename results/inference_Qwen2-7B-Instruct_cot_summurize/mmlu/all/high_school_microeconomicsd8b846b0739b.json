Diminishing marginal utility refers to the concept that as a consumer consumes more units of a good, the additional satisfaction (or utility) gained from each extra unit decreases. This principle leads to a downward-sloping demand curve because consumers are willing to pay less for additional units of a good as they consume more and derive less additional satisfaction from each extra unit.\n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. Diminishing marginal returns: This term is more commonly used in production economics, referring to the reduction in output gained from adding one more unit of input when all other inputs are held constant. It doesn't directly relate to the demand curve for a consumer.\n\nC. The Fisher effect: This is an economic theory that describes how inflation affects nominal interest rates. It does not have a direct relationship with the demand curve for an individual consumer.\n\nD. Diminishing returns to scale: This concept pertains to the behavior of total output in response to changes in all inputs, holding the technology constant. It is relevant in production theory but not in explaining the downward slope of the demand curve for a consumer."
