The subaltern refers to populations that are marginalised or outside of the hegemonic power structure. \n\nIn postcolonial theory, the concept of the subaltern was developed by the Indian philosopher and political theorist, Pratap Singh. It refers to groups who are structurally and socially marginalized and who lack political voice and agency. This includes peasants, women, indigenous peoples, and other social groups that are typically excluded from the dominant discourse of history, politics, and culture."
