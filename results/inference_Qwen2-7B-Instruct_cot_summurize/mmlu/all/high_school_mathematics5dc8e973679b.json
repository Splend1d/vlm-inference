Since there are 12 marbles in total and 3 of them are either red, green, or blue, there are \\(12 - 3 = 9\\) marbles that are not red, green, or blue.\n\nThe problem then reduces to choosing 1 marble from the 3 special ( (red, green, or blue) and 3 marbles from the remaining 9. This can be done using combinations since the order in which the marbles are chosen does not matter.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 marble from the 3 special ones is \\(\\binom{3}{1}\\), and the number of ways to choose 3 marbles from the 9 non-special ones is \\(\\binom{9}{3}\\).\n\nThus, the total number of ways to choose 4 marbles under these conditions is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{9}{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n- \\(\\binom{3}{1} = 3\\) ( because there are 3 ways to choose 1 marble out of 3.\n- \\(\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 84\\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 84 = 252\n\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 252."
