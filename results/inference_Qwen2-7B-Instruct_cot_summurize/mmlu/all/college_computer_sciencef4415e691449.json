Here are the corrections to the options:\n\nA. While there may be some RPC implementations that have limitations on distance due to protocol constraints, this is not a universal rule. Modern RPC systems can handle calls across vast distances.\n\nB. RPCs do not inherently prevent returning values. In fact, one of their key features is to allow functions to return values and arguments to be passed back and forth between processes or machines.\n\nC. Parameters can indeed be passed by reference or value, depending on the RPC system's design. Passing by reference allows changes to the original data to be reflected on the server side.\n\nD. RPC systems often support calling procedures implemented in different languages, especially through interoperability mechanisms like inter-language pragmas (ILPs, or language bindings.\n\nTherefore, none of the provided options correctly state a universally true limitation of an RPC. The actual limitations might depend on specific RPC protocols or implementations used."
