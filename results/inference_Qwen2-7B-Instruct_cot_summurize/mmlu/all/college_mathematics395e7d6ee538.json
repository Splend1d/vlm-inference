In metric spaces, compactness implies completeness. That is, if every open cover of a space has a finite subcover (which is the definition of compactness), then the space is also complete. A space is complete if every Cauchy sequence in it converges to a point within the space.\n\nB. **Every complete space is compact** - This statement is false. Completeness and compactness are two different properties of topological spaces. While compactness does imply completeness in metric spaces, the converse is not true. There exist complete spaces that are not compact. For example, the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with the usual metric is complete but not compact because it is not bounded.\n\nTherefore, neither statement A nor B is universally true, making the correct choice C. Neither (a) nor (b."
