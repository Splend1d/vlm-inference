These rights, such as freedom of contract or property rights, are viewed as serving the interests of the bourgeoisie at the expense of the proletariat. Marxists argue that these rights are not absolute but are subject to the needs of the class struggle and the overall goal of abolishing private ownership of the means of production.\n\nIn a socialist society, according to Marxist thought, the state would serve the collective interests of the community rather than the interests of a ruling class. The need for individual rights diminishes because the distribution of resources and the structure of society would be organized in a way that ensures equitable access and participation for all members of society. Thus, in a socialist system, the concept of rights might be reinterpreted or replaced by principles that prioritize communal well-being and equality.\n\nIt's important to note that Marxist theorists themselves did not necessarily reject rights outright; rather, they critiqued how rights functioned within capitalist societies and envisioned a future where the needs of the individual could be fulfilled through a different social and economic organization."
