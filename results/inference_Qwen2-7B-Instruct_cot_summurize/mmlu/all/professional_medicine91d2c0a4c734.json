Androgen insensitivity\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome (also known as complete androgen insensitivity, is a condition where an individual inherits genes from both parents that cause the body to lack receptors for the male hormone testosterone. This means that the body does not respond to testosterone, which typically promotes development of male sex characteristics. As a result, people with this condition often develop female secondary sex characteristics even though they may have a male Y chromosome. They can also be infertile due to the lack of response to male sex hormones. It is important to note that this condition is not related to a lack of puberty but rather to the body's inability to respond to certain hormones in a typical way.\n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that the absence of menstruation at age 17 could also indicate other conditions such as premature ovarian failure or Turner syndrome, which would require further investigation and testing. The fact that the patient refuses a pelvic or rectal examination complicates the diagnosis and highlights the importance of respecting patient autonomy while ensuring comprehensive medical care."
