Humans can align themselves with life energy through worship of kami\n\nThis theme reflects the core belief in Shinto, the indigenous religion of Japan, which emphasizes the presence of spiritual forces, or kami, in nature and everyday life. Shinto teaches that humans can connect with these divine energies by engaging in rituals, offerings, and respect for natural elements and ancestors. This alignss with the holistic view of the universe in Japanese culture, where everything is interconnected and imbued with spiritual significance."
