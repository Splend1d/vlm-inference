If not, the full amount is due within 30 days.\n\nGiven that the store made the payment on August 13, which falls within the 10-day period ( (from August 4), they qualify for the 2% discount.\n\nFirst, calculate the discount:\n\n2% of $7,000 = ( $7,000 * 0.02 = $140\n\nThen, subtract the discount from the total invoice to find out how much the store actually pays:\n\n$7,000 - $140 = $6,860\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $6,860"
