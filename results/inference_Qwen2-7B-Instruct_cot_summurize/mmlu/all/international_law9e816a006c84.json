Such conduct is a private act (jure gestionis).\n\nWhen a state official, such as a minister, engages in actions that are considered to be personal in nature, these acts are typically referred to as \"jure gestionis.\" These acts are generally not covered by sovereign immunity and can thus potentially be subject to legal proceedings in another country's courts. This means that if a minister from Country X commits an unlawful homicide abroad, this act would most likely be categorized under jure gestionis, making it not protected by immunity. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific categorization can vary based on international law interpretations and the jurisdictional laws of the countries involved."
