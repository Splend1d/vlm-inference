The outcome arising from legal methods, i.e., arbitration or adjudication by the International Court of Justice (ICJ, is final and binding upon the parties, whereas this is not necessarily the case with diplomatic methods. \n\nPolitical means of dispute settlement often involve negotiations, diplomacy, and informal discussions that can lead to agreements or understandings between the parties but do not necessarily result in a legally binding decision. In contrast, legal methods such as arbitration or adjudication by international courts typically provide a more formal and structured process where the outcome is binding and enforceable under international law."
