Extrinsic evidence refers to any evidence not contained within the primary document or statement being questioned. In this case, the defendant's admission is not part of the main case (the robbery) but is an additional fact regarding a separate criminal act (false pretenses). \n\nThe court officer's testimony about this separate act cannot be used to prove the defendant's guilt in the current case. The fact that the defendant admitted to committing false pretenses, which he denied in court, does not directly relate to his guilt in the robbery charges. Therefore, the testimony is inadmissible for that purpose."
