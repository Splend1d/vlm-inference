In a paging system, each page has an entry in the page table. Smaller pages mean more entries in the page table, which can increase memory usage for the page table itself. Larger pages reduce this overhead by decreasing the number of entries needed in the page table.\n\n2. **An advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation**: This statement is also true. Internal fragmentation occurs when there are are unused gaps within a block of memory that cannot be used because they are too small. Smaller pages can help mitigate this issue by making it more likely that even small unused spaces can be accommodated by fitting into a smaller page.\n\n3. **Normally, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length, so longer pages can be used advantageously**: This statement is true as well. Disk access times are primarily determined by factors such as seek time, rotational latency, and transfer rate of the disk, rather than the length of the pages being loaded from or written to the disk. Longer pages may require more data to be transferred at once, but this does not necessarily make them less advantageous if it aligns with the other performance characteristics of the system, such as cache utilization and the aforementioned reduction in page table size and internal fragmentation."
