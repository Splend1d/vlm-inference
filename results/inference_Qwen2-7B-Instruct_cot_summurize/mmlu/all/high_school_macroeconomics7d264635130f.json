                    "text": "A. Decreases it by $9 million\n\nThe correct answer is A. When Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account and keeps it as cash, it doesn't directly impact the amount of money in circulation because she has simply moved that money from one form ( electronic to physical cash) to another.\n\nHowever, if banks hold reserves at a central bank according to the reserve ratio (in this case, 10% or 0.10, the withdrawal could indirectly impact money in circulation through a process called the money multiplier effect. The initial $1 million withdrawal would lead to a decrease in the amount available for lending by banks, which reduces the potential for new money creation.\n\nThe money multiplier formula can be used to understand how much the money supply can expand or contract based on changes in the reserve ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Money Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Reserve Ratio}} \\]\n\nGiven a reserve ratio of 0.10 (or 10%, the money multiplier would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Money Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \\]\n\nThis means, theoretically, for every dollar deposited, there could be up to ten times that amount in circulation due to the banking system's lending activities. However, when withdrawals occur, this potential for expansion decreases, effectively reducing the amount of money available for lending and circulation.\n\nIn this scenario, since only $1 million was withdrawn, and assuming no additional lending or deposit activity occurs, the direct impact on the money supply is limited to the $1 million withdrawn. Indirectly, the potential for future lending and thus the creation of more money in circulation decreases by the same amount, considering the reserve requirement. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Decreases it by $9 million, acknowledging that the actual decrease in circulation might not be exactly $9 million due to the complex nature of the money multiplier effect and other economic factors. The key point here is that the total amount of money in circulation decreases by the amount withdrawn, which in this case is $1 million, before accounting for the indirect effects through the banking system's reserve requirements and lending practices."
