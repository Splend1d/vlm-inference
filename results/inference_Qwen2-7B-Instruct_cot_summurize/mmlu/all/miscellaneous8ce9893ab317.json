Pollen is produced by anthers in flowers.\nB. Vascular cambium is responsible for the secondary growth of plants, which includes the formation of new xylem and phloem, not an apical meristem.\nC. Xylem transports water and minerals, not sugars. Sugars are transported by phloem.\nD. Guard cells control the opening and closing of stomata, which regulates transpiration and gas exchange.\n\nTherefore, only option D correctly matches its function."
