We know that the car starts from rest (initial velocity \\(v_i = 0\\)), ends with a velocity \\(v_f = 20.0 \\, \\text{m/s}\\), and takes \\(t = 15.0 \\, \\text{s}\\) to do so. The acceleration can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{v_f - v_i}{t} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{20.0 \\, \\text{m/s} - 0}{15.0 \\, \\text{s}} = \\frac{20.0}{15.0} = 1.33 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nNow that we have the acceleration, we can calculate the displacement (s):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{1}{2} at^2 \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.33 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\times ( (15.0 \\, \\text{s})^2 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 0.665 \\times 225 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\n\\[ s = 149.675 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\n\nC. 450 m\n\nHowever, it seems there's been a misunderstanding in the calculation process leading to an incorrect selection of the answer based on the options provided. Given the correct process and calculations:\n\n- Option A (150 m would be closer to our calculated value if there were a rounding difference or a typo in the question or answers.\n- Option B 300 m, C 450 m, and D 600 m are are not the result of the correct application of the formula given the values provided.\n\nGiven the correct calculation based on the provided data, none of the options A, B, C, or D exactly match the precise calculation result of approximately 149.675 meters. However, if we must choose from the given options, option A (150 m is the closest to our calculated result."
