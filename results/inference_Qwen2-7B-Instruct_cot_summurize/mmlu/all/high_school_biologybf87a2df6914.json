Each individual carries two copies of each gene, one inherited from each parent. During meiosis, the process by which gametes are produced, the chromosomes shuffle around, leading to a unique combination of alleles in each gamete. When these gametes fuse during fertilization, offspring inherit a unique set of genes, contributing to genetic variation among individuals."
