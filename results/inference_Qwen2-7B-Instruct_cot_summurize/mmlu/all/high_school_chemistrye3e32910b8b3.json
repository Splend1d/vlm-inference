                    "text": "The correct answer is D.\n\nWhen magnesium metal reacts with a solution of chromium(III) nitrate, the magnesium gets oxidized to form magnesium ions (Mg^2+), and the chromium in the solution gets reduced to form elemental chromium (Cr). The balanced net ionic equation for this reaction is:\n\n\\[ \\text{3Mg}(s) + \\text{2Cr}^{3+}(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{3Mg}^{2+}(aq) + \\text{2Cr}(s) \\]\n\nThis reaction shows that three moles of magnesium react with two moles of chromium(III) ions to produce three moles of magnesium ions and two moles of chromium metal. The nitrate ions (NO_3^- are spectator ions and do not participate in the actual reaction, hence they are not included in the net ionic equation. \n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n\nA. Mg(s) + Cr(NO3)3(aq) \u2192 Mg2+(aq) + Cr3+(aq) + 3NO3-(aq) - This does not balance in terms of charge and number of atoms on both sides.\n\nB. 3Mg(s) + 2Cr3+ \u2192 3Mg2+ + 2Cr(s) - This incorrectly suggests that chromium turns into chromium(0) instead of chromium(III).\n\nC. Mg(s) + Cr3+ \u2192 Mg2+ + Cr(s) - This does not balance in terms of the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer."
