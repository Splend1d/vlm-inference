Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean.\n\nThis statement is more applicable to continuous random variables that follow a normal distribution, according to the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule. For discrete random variables, this rule does not generally apply because the shape of their distribution can vary widely and may not be symmetrical or bell-shaped.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are true for discrete random variables:\n\nA. The possible outcomes must all be numerical. This is true for discrete random variables, as they typically represent counts or categories that can be quantified with numbers.\n\nB. The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive. This is also true for discrete random variables; each outcome represents a distinct event, and it is impossible for two different outcomes to occur simultaneously in a single trial.\n\nC. The mean (expected value always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability. This is correct for discrete random variables, as the expected value is calculated by summing the product of each possible value and its probability.\n\nTherefore, option D is the exception among the provided statements for discrete random variables."
