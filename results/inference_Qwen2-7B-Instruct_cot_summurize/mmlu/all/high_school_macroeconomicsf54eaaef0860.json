This can offset the intended stimulative effects of fiscal policy.\n\n**Correct Answer:**\n\nC. occurs when consumers and firms spend less offsetting expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nThis choice correctly identifies that crowding out happens when government actions (like spending increases or borrowing) lead to higher interest rates, making it more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money for investment and consumption, respectively. This can reduce overall economic activity, potentially diminishing the effectiveness of fiscal policy.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Crowding out is not one reason fiscal policy is so effective; rather, it can limit the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy by reducing private sector spending.\n\nB. Interest rates falling due to government borrowing would actually suggest \"crowding in,\" where government borrowing leads to lower interest rates, encouraging more private investment, rather than \"crowding out.\"\n\nD. The aggregate demand curve does not shift to the right as a result of \"crowding out\"; instead, it might be affected by changes in consumer spending, investment, government spending, or net exports, but \"crowding out\" specifically refers to a dynamic within these components."
