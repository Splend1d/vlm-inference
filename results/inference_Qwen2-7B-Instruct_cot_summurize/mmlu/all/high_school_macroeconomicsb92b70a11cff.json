If the reserve ratio is increased, it actually requires banks to hold more reserves against their deposits, reducing the amount of excess reserves they can hold.\n\nC. If the discount rate is increased, it makes it less attractive for banks to borrow from the central bank (the Fed), potentially leading them to hold more excess reserves rather than borrowing, but this is a less direct effect and doesn't necessarily lead to an increase in excess reserves.\n\nD. When the Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks, it reduces the amount of cash those banks have, which could decrease their excess reserves."
