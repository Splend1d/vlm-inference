One employee of the department of treasury brought an action claiming a denial of equal protection and due process by taking away his right to a job. It is claimed that the prohibition is necessary to protect the public from potential problems that could arise. Which test of constitutional validity would be likely applied to this regulation?\n\nA. Strict scrutiny, since drug users are a special class of persons often discriminated against by the public.\nB. Intermediate scrutiny, because, like gender, this can be a sensitive area where discrimination is common.\nC. The rational basis test, because discrimination is generally favored with drug users or even those getting treatment.\nD. The rational basis test, because the regulation need only be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid.\n"

The rational basis test, because the regulation needs only to be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid.\n\nIn the United States, when a law discriminates based on a suspect classification ( such as race, national origin, or religion, it must satisfy strict scrutiny. When a law discriminates based on a non-suspect classification, such as age, gender, or disability, it must satisfy intermediate scrutiny. However, when a law discriminates based on a non-suspect classification in a context that is not traditionally associated with discrimination ( such as drug use or drug treatment, the standard of review might be the rational basis test.\n\nThe rational basis test requires the government to show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. This is a very low standard of review, and laws that pass this test are are often upheld by courts. In the case of regulations concerning employment and public safety, the government's interest in protecting the public from potential harm caused by individuals with a history of drug use or treatment could potentially meet this standard.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a general description of legal principles, and the specific outcome of any case would depend on the detailed circumstances and legal arguments presented."
