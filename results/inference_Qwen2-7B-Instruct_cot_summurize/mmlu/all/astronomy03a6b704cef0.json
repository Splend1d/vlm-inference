The path of the Sun in the sky throughout a year.\n\nThe ecliptic is the apparent path that the Sun takes across the celestial sphere over the course of a year. This path is actually determined by the tilt of Earth's axis and its orbit around the Sun. The ecliptic plane, which contains this path, is also the plane that divides the sky into the northern and southern celestial hemispheres."
