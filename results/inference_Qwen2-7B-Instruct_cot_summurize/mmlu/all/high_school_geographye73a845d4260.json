The other options, innovation, diffusion, and acculturation, are all processes by which cultural changes can occur. Innovation refers to new ideas or technologies that are developed within a culture and then spread through it. Diffusion involves the spread of ideas, behaviors, or products from one group to another. Acculturation refers to the process by which individuals or groups adopt the customs, behaviors, beliefs, and values of another culture."
