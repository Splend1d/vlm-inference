This is because it provides more area for the gas molecules to move from an area of higher concentration (the alveoli) to an area of lower concentration (the blood. This process follows Fick's law, which states that the rate of diffusion is proportional to the surface area available for diffusion.\n\nLet me clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Decreasing the partial pressure gradient of the gas: This actually decreases the rate of diffusion as there would be less of a driving force for the gas molecules to move across the membrane.\n\nB. Decreasing the solubility of the gas in water: While this might affect how much of the gas can dissolve in the blood and potentially its transport, it does not directly affect the rate of diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane. The rate of diffusion depends more on the concentration gradients and surface area than on solubility in the fluid phase.\n\nD. Decreasing the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary: This would decrease the rate of diffusion, as the blood is responsible for carrying the dissolved gas molecules away from the alveoli and into the body. Slower blood flow means less efficient transport of the diffused gases."
