This means that the signal's value can change continuously over time, rather than being limited to discrete points.\n\nThe other options describe properties of a sinusoidal signal, but they do not specifically define whether the signal is analog or digital:\n\nB. being negative for one half cycle: This describes the periodic nature of a sinusoidal signal, which oscillates between positive and negative values.\n\nC. being positive for one half cycle: Similarly, this also describes the periodic nature of a sinusoidal signal.\n\nD. having positive as well as negative values: While this is true, it doesn't distinguish an analog signal from a digital one. In both analog and digital signals, a sinusoidal signal can have both positive and negative values at different points in time."
