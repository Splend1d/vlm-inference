Roosevelt's New Deal coalition was significantly bolstered by the support of various groups, including urban voters in the Northern states. The New Deal introduced a range of social and economic reforms that appealed to these voters, particularly in addressing the hardships caused by the Great Depression. This coalition helped Democrats maintain control of Congress throughout Roosevelt's presidency and laid the groundwork for future Democratic successes."
