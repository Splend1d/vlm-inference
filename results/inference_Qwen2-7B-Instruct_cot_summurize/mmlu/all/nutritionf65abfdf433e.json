Potassium\n\nHigh intakes of foods containing phytic acid, such as whole grains, legumes, and nuts, can inhibit the absorption of certain minerals including calcium, zinc, and iron. However, potassium is not significantly affected by phytic acid. The reason for this is that potassium does not bind to phytic acid in the same way that other minerals do, thus its absorption is not inhibited in the same manner."
