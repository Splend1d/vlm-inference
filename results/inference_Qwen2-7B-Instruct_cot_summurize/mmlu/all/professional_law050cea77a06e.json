He contacted several companies and asked them to submit bids for the installation work. An alarm company decided to submit a bid and, in turn, requested bids from several wholesalers for the burglar alarms it planned to use if it was awarded the job. A supplier submitted a bid to the alarm company that the latter used in computing the bid that it was preparing for the builder. On September 1, the alarm company sent the builder its bid, in which it proposed to install the security systems for $100,000. On September 9, the supplier notified the alarm company that it would be unable to supply any burglar alarms to them. On September 11, the builder sent the following fax to the alarm company: \"I hereby accept your offer to install the security systems for $100,000. \"The alarm company had to pay another wholesaler $10,000 above the price quoted by the supplier for the burglar alarms. As a result, the alarm company advised the builder that the total price for the job would have to be increased to $10,000. The builder replied that he would hold the alarm company to the initially agreed price of $100,000. The alarm company installed the security systems, but the builder has not yet paid them anything. In an action by the alarm company against the builder for services rendered, the alarm company will probably be able to recover\n\nA. $100,000, because that was the contract price.\nB. $110,000 because of an unanticipated changeof circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.\nC. only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.\nD. only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- A. $100,000 is incorrect because, as you've mentioned, the builder accepted the original price of $100,000, and the alarm company informed the builder that due to unforeseen circumstances (specifically the supplier's inability to provide the necessary equipment at the quoted price), they would need to increase the cost to $10,000 more than originally agreed upon. This price increase wasrepresents a breach of the original agreement.\n\n- B. $110,000 is also incorrect because, based on the information provided, the builder agreed to pay the original price of $100,000 and did not consent to the additional $10,000. The builder held the alarm company to the initial price, indicating that they were not accepting a price increase.\n\n- C. only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration, is also incorrect. The doctrine of commercial frustration applies when an unforeseen event renders the performance of a contract impossible or radically different from what was expected, and this event was not within the control of either party. In this case, while there was an unforeseen event (the inability to procure the equipment at the quoted price), the performance of the contract (installation of the security systems) waswas still possible, albeit at a higher cost.\n\n- D. only in quantum meruit is the correct answer. Quantum meruit refers to the principle that a person should be paid for the value of the services they have provided, even if no contract exists. In this situation, since the alarm company breached the original agreement by increasing the price without the builder's consent, they cannot enforce the new price. Instead, they can only claim payment based on the reasonable value of the services actually provided, which would likely be considered quantum meruit."
