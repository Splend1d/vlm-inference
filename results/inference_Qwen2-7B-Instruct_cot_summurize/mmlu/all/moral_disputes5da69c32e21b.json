Being seen as curiosities: Cloned individuals might face unique social and cultural perceptions, being objects of fascination or curiosity rather than just ordinary human beings. This could affect their personal identity, privacy, and how they are treated by society.\n\nB. Being scrutinized in relation to the person they are clones of: There could be intense public and possibly private interest in comparing them to the original individual. This scrutiny might extend to aspects like appearance, behavior, and even life choices, potentially leading to unfair judgments or expectations based on comparisons with the original clone's life or experiences."
