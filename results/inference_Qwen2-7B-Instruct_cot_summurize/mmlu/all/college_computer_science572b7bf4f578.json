Maximum throughput is generally higher with more stages in the pipeline if the pipeline stages can be effectively utilized without causing bottlenecks. However, simply having more stages does not automatically mean better throughput. It depends on the efficiency of the pipeline design and the utilization of its stages. Without specific information about the efficiency and utilization of each pipeline, we cannot definitively conclude that M-7's pipeline has better maximum throughput. Therefore, Statement I is **uncertain** based on the given information.\n\n**Statement II**: The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n\nLatency refers to the time it takes for an instruction to complete from start to finish. In pipelined architectures, latency is often associated with the longest path an instruction must follow through the pipeline. Since M-7 has more stages (7 vs. 5 for M-5), it might intuitively seem that latency would be longer due to the additional stages. However, the actual latency also depends on how these stages are implemented and the clock cycle time. A shorter clock cycle time for M-7 (7.5 ns vs. 10 ns for M-5 could potentially offset the increased number of stages by allowing more instructions to be processed within the same period. Without specifics on how efficiently each stage operates, we cannot definitively say that the latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7's pipeline. This statement is also **uncertain** based on the provided information.\n\n**Statement III**: Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5.\n\nThis statement is generally false because the execution speed of a program depends on multiple factors, including but not limited to the pipeline depth, clock cycle time, the efficiency of the instruction set implementation, and the specific operations performed by the program. Even with a shorter clock cycle time and potentially more efficient use of pipeline stages, M-7 might not always run programs faster than M-5 if the program's execution pattern does not benefit from the extra pipeline stages or if there are are other inefficiencies in the design. Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the statements are definitively true based solely on the information provided. However, since the question seems to imply selecting the correct answer(s), and considering the context and options, **the closest correct answer** would be **A. I only**, acknowledging that the analysis for Statements II and III leads to uncertainty and a conclusion against Statement III, respectively."
