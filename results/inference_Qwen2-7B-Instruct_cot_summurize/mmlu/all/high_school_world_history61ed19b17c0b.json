The population increased due to the increased diversity of crops.\n\nThe process described by Alfred Crosby in his 1972 work referred to the Columbian Exchange, which was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World (Europe, Africa, and Asia after Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492. This exchange introduced new foods like wheat, oranges, and grapes to Europe, which significantly boosted agricultural productivity and diet variety. The increased food supply contributed to higher birth rates and lower mortality rates, leading to a substantial increase in Europe's population over time. Additionally, these new crops often led to more efficient land use and agricultural practices, further supporting population growth."
