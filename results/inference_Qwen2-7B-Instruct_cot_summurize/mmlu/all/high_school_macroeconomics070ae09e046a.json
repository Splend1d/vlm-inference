Unlike commodity money (which derives its value from the commodity of which it is made ( or bimetallic standards where two commodities like gold and silver are used), fiat money does not have an intrinsic value based on a physical commodity like gold or silver. Its value comes from the government's promise to honor debts paid in the currency."
