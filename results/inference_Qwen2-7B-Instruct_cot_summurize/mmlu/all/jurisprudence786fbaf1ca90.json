Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will.\n\nSavigny's Volksgeist theory emphasizes that the spirit (Geist) of the people (Volk) influences and shapes the law in a way that reflects the collective consciousness, traditions, and cultural norms of that society. It suggests that law emerges organically from the social, cultural, and historical context rather than being solely the product of a sovereign's arbitrary decisions or directives. Therefore, stating that law is merely the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will contradicts the core idea of Volksgeist, which posits a more organic and culturally rooted development of legal systems."
