Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA\n\nDuring PCR, primers that are complementary to specific regions of the DNA are used to initiate the synthesis of new DNA strands. They are crucial for amplifyinging the target DNA sequence.\n\nA. Reverse transcriptase is used in reverse transcription PCR ( (RT-PCR), not in standard PCR which works with DNA templates.\n  \nB. A vacuum chamber is not required for PCR. It is used in some other biological processes like in vacuum centrifugation for removing liquid from samples but it's not necessary for PCR.\n\nD. DNA ligase is not required in PCR. It is used to join together nucleotide sequences after they have been cut by restriction enzymes, typically during cloning procedures."
