Sandel discusses the philosopher Peter Singer's argument that autonomy has intrinsic moral value because it allows individuals to act and choose freely without being coerced or unduly influenced by external factors. This freedom from distress enables people to pursue their own goals and desires, and thus live lives that are meaningful to them. Sandel notes that Gill supports this view of autonomy's moral worth, emphasizing that autonomy enables individuals to act according to their own will and values, rather than being controlled by external forces or pressures."
