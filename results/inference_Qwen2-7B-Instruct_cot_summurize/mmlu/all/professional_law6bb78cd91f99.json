Yes, as an admission by a party opponent.\nB. Yes, as a statement against the interests of the other defendants.\nC. No, because it was made while in custody and therefore is unreliable.\nD. No, because the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus it is hearsay.\n"

Yes, as a statement against the interests of the other defendants**.\n\nIn legal terms, a statement against interest is one where the declarant stands to lose something by making the statement. In this case, the driver, by implicating himself and specifically stating that the proceeds went to the first and second defendants, is essentially admitting that those individuals benefitted from the crime. This statement is against his own interest since he could be seen as trying to shift blame and potentially receive a lesser sentence for himself. Thus, under certain circumstances, such statements can be admitted into evidence against the other parties involved in the crime."
