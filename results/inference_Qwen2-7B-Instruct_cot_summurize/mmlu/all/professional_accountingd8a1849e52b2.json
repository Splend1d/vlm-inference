                    "text": "To determine how the change in the inflation premium affects the company's cost of equity and stock price, we need to understand how these factors are related.\n\nThe cost of equity can be calculated using several methods, including the Capital Asset Pricing Model ((CAPM), which uses the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of Equity} = R_f + \\beta \\times ((\\text{Market Return} - R_f) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( R_f \\) is the risk-free rate,\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the beta of the stock,\n- Market Return is the expected return of the market.\n\nInflation impacts the real interest rates and thus affects the risk-free rate \\( R_f \\). A lower inflation rate implies that the purchasing power of money increases, potentially leading to lower nominal interest rates and thus lower risk-free rates. This, in turn, can lead to a decrease in the cost of equity, as the required return for investors decreases.\n\nHowever, the relationship between dividend growth and stock price is more straightforward: a higher dividend growth rate generally leads to a higher stock price, assuming all else being equal. In this case, the expected dividend growth rate remains at 3%, so this factor does not directly influence the stock price based on the information provided.\n\nGiven the context of the question, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Cost of equity will likely decrease.\n\nThis is because a decrease in the inflation rate could lead to a decrease in the risk-free rate, which would in turn decrease the cost of equity. However, without specific numbers for the risk-free rate or other variables, it's important to note that the exact impact on the stock price cannot be definitively stated, as it also depends on the market's expectations and the overall economic conditions."
