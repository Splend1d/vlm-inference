Wrong, Not wrong\n\nTurning on cartoons at a child's birthday party is generally not considered a morally wrong action; it could be seen as a reasonable and even expected way to entertain the children. However, keeping old love letters after getting married might be viewed as disrespectful or potentially hurtful to one's current partner, depending on the context and how it might affect the relationship. Therefore, scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while scenario 2 might be considered morally wrong based on typical standards of respect and honesty in relationships."
