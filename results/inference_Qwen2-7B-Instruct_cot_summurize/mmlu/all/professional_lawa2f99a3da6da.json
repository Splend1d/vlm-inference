The contract stipulated that delivery would be \"F. O. B. at the dealer's shop,\" with payment to be made one week after tender. When the dealer received the tapestry, he noticed that it had been damaged in transit. The dealer immediately contacted the collector and notified him that he was rejecting the tapestry because it had ripped apart and was becoming unwoven. The collector told the dealer that he would get back to him with re-shipping instructions. The collector did not make any further contact with the dealer. After four weeks, the dealer then sold the tapestry to a buyer for $120,000. If the collector sues the dealer for damages, the collector should recover\n\nA. $120,000, for conversion.\nB. $108,000, because the dealer is entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% on the resale.\nC. $100,000, which is the contract price.\nD. $20,000, which covers the difference between the contract price and the sale price.\n"

The contract specifies the terms of the transaction, including the method of delivery ( \"F. O. B. at the dealer's shop\" and the timing of payment. When the dealer received the tapestry and found it damaged, he rejected it based on the condition. However, the fact that the tapestry was damaged does not absolve the dealer from his contractual obligation to pay the agreed-upon price if the goods were delivered as specified, assuming the damage occurred during transportation and was not due to any negligence or fault of the dealer.\n\nAfter the dealer rejected the tapestry, he proceeded to sell it to a third party for $120,000. This action could potentially be seen as conversion, where the dealer misappropriates the property belonging to another, but this is not what the question asks about in terms of recovery by the collector.\n\nGiven that the dealer rejected the goods due to damage that occurred during shipping, and assuming there is no evidence that the dealer was responsible for the damage, the collector should still be entitled to the contract price of $100,000. Any subsequent sale of the tapestry by the dealer for more than the contract price does not affect the collector's right to receive the original agreed-upon price under the contract. Therefore, the collector should recover:\n\nC. $100,000, which is the contract price."
