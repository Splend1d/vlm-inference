This can lead to symptoms such as pain, swelling, difficulty walking (as indicated by lack of fluid motion during gait analysis), and foot drop due to compression of the peroneal nerve against the dislocated fibular head. \n\nThe standing flexion test being negative suggests that there might not be a significant flexion deformity, which could help differentiate this from other potential causes like fractures or dislocations involving the knee joint itself. The intactness of the cruciate and collateral knee ligaments also points towards an issue external to the knee joint.\n\nOptions A ( anteriorly deviated distal femur, B plantar flexed cuboid, and D unilateral sacral shear do not match the presented symptoms and findings well. An anterior deviation of the distal femur would likely present with different symptoms and findings, as would a plantar flexed cuboid or a unilateral sacral shear, neither of which would necessarily present with the described gait disturbance or foot drop."
