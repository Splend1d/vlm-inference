The bill imposes a 15% tax upon the gross annual receipts from the sales of all birth control devices. The bill has the strong support of conservative and pro-life organizations. The stated purpose of the proposed measure is to raise revenue and spur population growth across the country. In your learned opinion, the proposed tax is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because the fact that the tax applies to all sales of every type of birth control device invalidates any possible objection to the tax on the grounds that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. constitutional, because the fact that controversial policy motives may have induced the enactment of an otherwise reasonable measure calculated to raise revenue does not ipso facto invalidate the tax.\nC. unconstitutional, because in inseverable aggregates, the domestic purchases and sales of birth control devices affect interstate and foreign commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, because the tax burdens the fundamental right to privacy of users of birth control devices without establishing a compelling national interest for doing so.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The proposed tax would likely be considered unconstitutional under the standard set by the Supreme Court in cases such as Griswold v. Connecticut ( and Lawrence v. Texas. These cases establish that the government cannot impose restrictions on personal decisions related to intimate relationships, including decisions about contraception, which are are considered fundamental rights protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn the case of a tax like this one, it would burden the fundamental right to privacy of individuals who use birth control devices, as it would require them to spend a significant portion of their income on these products. Without establishing a compelling national interest that justifies this infringement on a fundamental right, the tax would likely be deemed unconstitutional.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ensures that laws apply equally to all people, but it doesn't directly address the constitutionality of taxes or their impact on fundamental rights. \n\nOption B is also incorrect because the fact that a law was enacted for controversial reasons does not automatically render it unconstitutional. However, if it infringes on fundamental rights without a compelling justification, it would still be challenged based on those rights rather than its motive.\n\nOption C pertains to the issue of interstate and foreign commerce, which might be relevant if the tax were to restrict trade or commerce across state lines or internationally. However, the primary concern here is the infringement of a fundamental right, which makes option D the more appropriate answer."
