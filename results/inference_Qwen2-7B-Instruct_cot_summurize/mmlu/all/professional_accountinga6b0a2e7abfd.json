Theory of constraints.\n\nThe Theory of Constraints (TOC) is particularly useful in situations where there are are bottlenecks or constraints limiting the performance of a system. In this case, since the manager is dealing with limited capacity for operation of a critical machine, TOC can help identify and improve this constraint to increase overall profitability. The other options listed might not directly address the issue of capacity limitations:\n\n- B. Economic Order Quantity ( focuses on inventory management and determining the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs.\n- C. Balanced Scorecard is a strategic management tool used to monitor and assess progress toward achieving long-term business goals.\n- D. Cost-Variance Analysis is primarily used in project management to compare budgeted versus actual costs.\n\nTherefore, the best answer here is A. Theory of Constraints."
