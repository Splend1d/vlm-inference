It imposed several criteria on the former Yugoslav republics, including:\n\nC. A commitment to human rights and democracy: This criterion was part of the broader aim to ensure that the newly formed states would adhere to international standards of governance and respect for human rights.\n\nA. Commitment to submit disputes to the International Court of Justice ( (ICJ): The commission encouraged the new states to resolve any disputes through the International Court of Justice, which is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. This was intended to provide a peaceful and legal means of resolving conflicts between the states.\n\nIt's important to note that the commission did not mandate an exchange of ethnic populations ( option D) as this was not within its purview or in line with international law and ethics. The focus was on creating stable, peaceful, and democratic states rather than on ethnic reconfiguration."
