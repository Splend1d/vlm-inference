Realism is a set of approaches to Security Studies that focuses on states, and tries to determine which strategy a state should adopt to achieve security and other goals.\n\nRealism in Security Studies emphasizes the role of states as the primary actors in international politics and their pursuit of power and security. It suggests that states are rational actors who act based on self-interest, and international relations are characterized by anarchy, where there is no central authority to enforce cooperation or agreements. Realist theories often focus on military capabilities, alliances, and deterrence strategies to ensure a state's survival and dominance in the international system."
