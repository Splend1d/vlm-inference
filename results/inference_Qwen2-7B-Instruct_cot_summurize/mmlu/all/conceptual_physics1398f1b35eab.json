                    "text": "The correct answer is A. force due to gravity is the same on each.\n\nIn the scenario described, both the heavy and light rock are in free fall, which means they are experiencing the full force of gravity without any external forces acting upon them, such as air resistance or friction. According to Newton's second law of motion, F=ma, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration, the acceleration (a, is directly proportional to the net force acting on an object (F, and inversely proportional to the object's mass m. \n\nWhen there is no air resistance (option B is incorrect), the force on both objects is solely due to gravity, and since the force of gravity (F = mg (where g is the acceleration due to gravity and m is the mass of the object) is proportional to the mass of the object, but the gravitational acceleration g is constant near the surface of the Earth, the force of gravity on both rocks is the same, making their accelerations equal regardless of their masses. This is why the heavy rock does not have a greater acceleration than the light rock despite its greater mass. Option D is also correct, as the ratio of force to mass (F/m is the same for both rocks since the force (F is equal and their masses m are different, leading to the same acceleration a. However, the key point here that directly answers the question is that option A correctly states the reason: the force due to gravity is the same on each."
