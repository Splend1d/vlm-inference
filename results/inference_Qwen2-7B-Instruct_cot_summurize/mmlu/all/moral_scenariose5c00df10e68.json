This action violates principles of animal welfare and respect for life.\n\nScenario 2: Digging a hole in a city park without permission can cause damage to public property and potentially disrupt or harm wildlife that may inhabit the area. It also shows disregard for the rights and regulations of the community that owns and maintains the park."
