Traditional theories explain international politics as the distribution of power among members of an international system, and specifically as the balance of power amongst major states. The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state.\nB. The traditional approaches emerged in response to the Cold War, and to the accumulation of tension and competition between the two Superpowers. Traditional theories seek to explain behaviour in terms of arms accumulation.\nC. Traditional conceptions emerged to explain the clusters of norms and patterns of behaviour that result in management of conflict and cooperation in the international system, in specific spheres of activities.\nD. Traditional approaches are concerned with sovereignty. Sovereignty is a legal status; it gives the state control over a specified territory, means it is free from arbitrary intervention, and is responsible to no higher authority. Traditional theories examine the patterns of behaviour and relative cooperation of sovereign states in the international system.\n"

The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state.\n\nThis option best captures the essence of traditional Security Studies. Traditional theories indeed focus on the distribution and dynamics of power within the international system, particularly through the concept of the balance of power. This idea posits that the security strategy of a state is largely determined by its relative power and the constraints imposed by the power dynamics of other states in the system. The balance of power theory suggests that states will adjust their policies and behavior in response to the changing distribution of power in order to maintain or enhance their own security."
