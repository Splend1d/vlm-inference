The state is indeed often the most prominent actor when it comes to committing violent acts against humans, such as during conflicts, civil wars, or through oppressive policies. This can directly threaten human security by causing harm, displacement, and loss of life. Thus, understanding the role of the state in perpetuating violence is crucial for addressing human security concerns.\n\nB. States typically possess significant material resources and power, including military capabilities, economic resources, and political influence. These resources can be used to protect citizens, provide essential services, maintain law and order, and promote development, all of which contribute to human security. Conversely, a state's misuse of its power can lead to insecurity and instability within its borders and beyond.\n\nC. In the context of urgent humanitarian crises, such as natural disasters, conflicts, or pandemics, immediate assistance from states and international organizations is often necessary to save lives and provide basic needs. Adopting a hands-off approach would not only fail to address the immediate threats to human security but could exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and lead to further suffering.\n\nTherefore, considering all three options highlights the complex interplay between state actions and inactions in shaping human security. The state plays a dual role: it can both pose a threat to human security and also have the capacity to provide protection and support. Understanding and addressing this dual nature is essential for effective policy-making and intervention strategies aimed at enhancing human security."
