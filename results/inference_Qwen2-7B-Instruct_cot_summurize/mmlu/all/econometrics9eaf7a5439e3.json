Uncorrelated\n\nWhen tools like autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF), and spectral analysis do not find any evidence of structure in the data, it suggests that there is little to no correlation between successive values in the time series. This means that each observation is not dependent on the previous one, indicating an uncorrelated nature of the data. However, this does not necessarily imply independence or normal distribution, nor does it suggest anything about the distribution being fat-tailed. Independence would require more than just lack of autocorrelation. Normality and fat-tailed distributions are concerns related to the probability distribution of the data points, not their correlation with previous points."
