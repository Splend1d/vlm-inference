To achieve allocative efficiency, which means producing the quantity where the marginal benefit (or consumer surplus) equals the marginal cost, the government may intervene to set prices at the level where marginal cost (MC equals marginal revenue (MR. In most cases, this also corresponds to setting the price equal to marginal cost, especially in a competitive market scenario, because marginal revenue equals price in such markets.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. Where price equals average total cost (ATC: This is not necessarily the allocatively efficient level of output. In fact, if a monopolist charges a price equal to ATC, it would likely be making losses, as it would cover only its average costs but not generate any profit or charge a price that reflects the value consumers place on the product (i.e., marginal cost.\n\nB. Where marginal revenue equals marginal cost: This is one condition for a monopolist to maximize profits, not necessarily for achieving allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency requires that the price reflects the true marginal cost, which is often lower than the marginal revenue for a monopolist.\n\nC. Where normal profits are made: This refers to the situation where a firm earns just enough to keep existing in the market without having to attract new entrants. It does not necessarily mean the firm is operating at an allocatively efficient level of output. The firm might be charging a price above marginal cost, leading to overproduction from an allocative perspective."
