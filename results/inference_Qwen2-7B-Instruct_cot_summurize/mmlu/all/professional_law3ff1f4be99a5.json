The plaintiff claimed that the defendant drove through a red light and hit her as she was crossing the street. The posted speed limit at the scene of the accident was 25 m. p. h. In his case-in-chief, the defendant testified that the traffic light was green and he was driving carefully at 20 m. p. h. The plaintiff's attorney did not cross-examine the defendant. Rather, she called a police officer who testified that the defendant told him immediately after the accident that he was going 30 m. p. h. The police officer's testimony is\n\nA. a prior inconsistent statement and, therefore, admissible to impeach.\nB. hearsay, but admissible as a prior inconsistent statement for any purpose.\nC. admissible, as offered against the defendant.\nD. inadmissible, because the accident report is the best evidence of what the defendant told the police officer.\n"

Prior inconsistent statements are typically admissible to impeach the credibility of a witness, especially when the statement was made under circumstances where it would be expected to be truthful (such as immediately after an incident. In this case, the defendant's statement to the police officer would have been made under conditions where he would likely have provided accurate information.\n\nOption B is incorrect because hearsay rules generally do not allow statements made by a party-opponent (like the defendant's statement) to be admitted into evidence without meeting certain exceptions, such as those for prior consistent or inconsistent statements. Option C is also incorrect because the police officer's testimony is not being offered directly against the defendant but rather to impeach the defendant's testimony in his case-in-chief. Option D is incorrect because the best evidence rule does not apply here; instead, the rule regarding prior inconsistent statements is more relevant for assessing the admissibility of the police officer's testimony."
