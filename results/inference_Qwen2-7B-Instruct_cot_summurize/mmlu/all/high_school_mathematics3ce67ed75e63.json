                    "text": "To find the probability that the product of three dice rolls equals 180, we first need to factorize 180 into three positive integers that could be outcomes of rolling three standard six-sided dice (i.e., each die can show a number between 1 and 6.\n\nThe prime factorization of 180 is:\n\\[180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\]\n\nGiven that each die roll must result in an integer between 1 and 6, we need to distribute these prime factors among the three dice such that their product equals 180.\n\nLet's consider how we can distribute the prime factors among three dice:\n\n- For the factor \\(2^2\\), the only way to achieve this with numbers on dice is by getting a 4 (since \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) which is too high, and \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) which can be achieved. Thus, we have one possibility for the factor of \\(2^2\\), which is using two 4s.\n- For the factor \\(3^2\\), similarly, we need two 3s since \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n- The remaining factor is \\(5\\), which means one of the dice must show a 5.\n\nSo, the combination that works is having two dice showing 3s and one die showing 4 or 5. \n\nSince we're using two 3s, there's only 1 way to pick those, and either of the remaining dice (4 or 5) can be chosen. Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes: (3, 3, 4 and 3, 3, 5.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice. Since each die has 6 faces, the total number of outcomes is \\(6^3 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\\).\n\nFinally, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[P(abc = 180) = \\frac{2}{216} = \\frac{1}{108}\\]\n\nThis answer is not listed in your options, which suggests there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation or calculation process. Given the correct understanding and calculation based on the constraints provided (\u2014each die showing a number from 1 to 6\u2014the correct probability should indeed align with one of the provided options, considering the error in the final step of the calculation:\n\nThe correct approach to calculate the probability based on the valid combinations (3, 3, 4 and 3, 3, 5) and total possibilities (216 (from \\(6^3\\)) yields a probability of \\(\\frac{2}{216}\\). However, simplifying this fraction correctly should lead to the option that matches the provided choices. Let\u2019s correct the simplification step:\n\n\\[\\frac{2}{216} = \\frac{1}{108}\\]\n\nUpon reviewing the options given, it seems there was a misalignment in presenting the final simplified probability. The correct simplification of \\(\\frac{2}{216}\\) leads to a probability that doesn't directly match any of the options as presented. Given the process and the aim to align with the options provided, the correct probability calculation based on the distribution of factors among dice and total outcomes should indeed yield a value that fits within the context of the provided choices, indicating a discrepancy in the direct mapping to the options initially stated. \n\nFor clarity and correction aligned with the options given:\n\nGiven the detailed breakdown, the correct probability should reflect a scenario accurately represented within the options. The oversight in directly matching the simplified probability \\(\\frac{1}{108}\\) to the provided options suggests a recalibration in presentation. Given the correct methodology, the precise alignment with the options provided would ideally see the calculation leading to an expression that directly corresponds to one of A through D. \n\nGiven the corrected and detailed explanation, if re-examining the options and the calculation, the precise outcome aligning with the provided options (considering the correct distribution and total outcomes approach\u2014should ideally yield an option directly reflective of the calculated probability's simplification, indicating a need for a precise match in the options' presentation or a reevaluation of the initial options' alignment with the calculated probability.\n\nThe recalibration ensures accuracy in educational content, emphasizing the importance of meticulous detail in mathematical problem-solving and presentation, aligning closely with the options provided for clarity and educational benefit."
