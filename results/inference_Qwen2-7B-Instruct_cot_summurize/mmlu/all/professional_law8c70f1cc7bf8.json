                    "text": "A company owns and operates a chemical plant that manufactures paraquat, an herbicide used primarily as a weed killer. The plant is located in a rural area in the southwestern part of the state. In its production of paraquat, the company emits putrid smelling fumes throughout the surrounding countryside. Although the fumes are harmless to health, they are rank and highly offensive. Despite extensive research by the company to alleviate the problem, there is no known way to manufacture paraquat without discharging malodorous fumes into the air. An owner of a large dairy farm that is adjacent to the plant finds the foul-smelling herbicide fumes to be extremely unpleasant and totally objectionable. The owner brings an action based on private nuisance against the company and seeks to enjoin the manufacture of paraquat at the chemical plant. Which of the following facts, if proven, will be most helpful to the company's defense?\n\nA. Federal, state, and local agencies approved the design of the plant and equipment used to produce paraquat.\nB. The company has a contract with the federal government whereby it supplies 80 percent of its paraquat production to the Drug Enforcement Agency, which uses the herbicide as a marijuana eradicator.\nC. The company commenced the manufacture of paraquat at the plant before the owner acquired the land and built his dairy farm.\nD. Paraquat is the only herbicide that can safely and effectively kill marijuana, which, if not controlled, poses a serious drug-enforcement problem.\n"

Federal, state, and local agencies approved the design of the plant and equipment used to produce paraquat.\n\nThis fact suggests that the company has complied with regulatory requirements and followed established safety standards in their operations. It indicates that the emissions are not the result of any negligence or violation of environmental laws, which could mitigate the claim of private nuisance. However, it's important to note that this fact alone might not fully absolve the company from liability for nuisance if the emissions are still considered unreasonable and excessively burdensome under the specific circumstances and local conditions.\n\nB. The company has a contract with the federal government whereby it supplies 80 percent of its paraquat production to the Drug Enforcement Agency, which uses the herbicide as a marijuana eradicator.\n\nWhile this fact may have some relevance in terms of the company's legitimate use of paraquat, it does not directly address the issue of nuisance caused by the emissions. The fact that the herbicide serves a governmental purpose might influence the court's decision regarding the reasonableness of the company's actions, but it does not automatically justify the emissions if they are found to be excessively burdensome.\n\nC. The company commenced the manufacture of paraquat at the plant before the owner acquired the land and built his dairy farm.\n\nThis fact shows that the nuisance issue predates the owner's acquisition of the property, which could weaken the owner's claim of nuisance since it implies that the owner had the opportunity to consider the potential impact of the nearby plant when purchasing the land. However, this fact might not entirely absolve the company of responsibility if the nuisance is found to be substantial and unreasonable after the owner's acquisition of the property.\n\nD. Paraquat is the only herbicide that can safely and effectively kill marijuana, which, if not controlled, poses a serious drug-enforcement problem.\n\nThis fact highlights the company's contribution to addressing a significant social issue ( combating illegal drug cultivation. While this might be relevant in terms of the company's public interest and societal benefits, it does not directly address the issue of nuisance caused by the emissions. The company's need for a specific herbicide might be seen as less relevant than the burden imposed on the nearby property owner due to the emissions."
