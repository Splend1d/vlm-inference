                    "text": "C. One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg.\n\nExplanation: \nThe acrosome reaction and the cortical reaction are crucial events that occur immediately after fertilization. These reactions ensure that only one sperm fertilizes an egg. \n\nThe acrosome reaction involves the rupture of the acrosome on the head of the sperm, releasing enzymes that help the sperm penetrate the outer layers of the egg. This ensures that the sperm can enter the egg.\n\nThe cortical reaction occurs when the sperm penetrates the egg's zona pellucida, causing a chemical reaction in the zona that hardens and prevents any further sperm from entering the egg. This is how the body ensures that only one sperm fertilizes the egg, preventing multiple pregnancies from a single fertilization event.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly states what these reactions ensure. Options A and D relate to the ability of a sperm to fertilize an egg and the development of a zygote, but they do not specifically describe the role of the acrosome and cortical reactions. Option B could be true as a result of these reactions, but it's not a direct outcome of them."
