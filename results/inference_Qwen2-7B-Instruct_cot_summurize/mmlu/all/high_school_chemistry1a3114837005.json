NaBr: Sodium chloride ( is highly soluble in water.\n- B. NiSO3: Nickel(II) sulfate is soluble in water.\n- C. CrCl3: Chromium(III) chloride is soluble in water.\n- D. Mn(NO3)2: Manganese(II) nitrate is soluble in water.\n\nAll the given options are soluble in water, but based on the general solubility rules, all should be soluble with no clear exception among them. However, if considering the trend of solubility based on the cations:\n\n- Chromium (Cr^3+ is less common than sodium (Na^+) or manganese (Mn^2+) in terms of forming soluble salts, but chromium(III) chloride (CrCl3) is indeed soluble.\n\nIn a literal sense, since all of them are soluble, none is inherently \"least soluble\" based on the given options and general solubility rules. This question might be misleading as it doesn't provide enough context or criteria to distinguish between options correctly. In an ideal scenario, without additional context or specific conditions ( (like considering solubility at certain temperatures or pressures), it's safe to say that all of them are soluble in water, and thus, there isn't a clear answer to which one would be the least soluble based solely on the provided information."
