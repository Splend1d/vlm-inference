However, based on common associations:\n\n- If Van den Haag is referring to Hugo van den Haag, a Dutch-American philosopher and lawyer known for his views on capital punishment, then the answer would likely be C. retentionist, as he was in favor of the death penalty.\n\n- If you're referring to someone else named Van den Haag, please provide more details so I can give a more accurate response."
