They stopped their patrol car and walked over to the man, whom they recognized as a troublemaker from the neighboring town. Realizing that the man was extremely intoxicated, they grabbed him and shoved him into their patrol car. They drove the man around in the police car for a few minutes and told him he had two choices. They would either take him to jail for the night or drive him to the city limits and drop him off there. The man indicated that he didn't want to go to jail. One of the officers then said, \"Does that mean you want us to drop you off at the city limits?\" The man replied, \"Yes. \" They then drove him to the city limits and left him along a busy highway. Moments later, the man staggered onto the street and was struck by a car driven by a motorist. He suffered multiple injuries. If the man asserts a claim against the police department based on negligence, he will most likely\n\nA. recover, because the police should have realized it was dangerous to drop him off where they did.\nB. recover, because the police knew that the man was intoxicated when they dropped him off.\nC. not recover, because the man chose to be driven to the city limits.\nD. not recover, because the motorist's act was a supervening cause of his injury.\n"

In this case, the police officers' actions (dropping the man off at the city limits while intoxicated, which was negligent, led to the man being hit by a car. However, the car hitting the man is considered a supervening cause, as it was an unforeseeable and independent event that directly caused the injuries, rather than the actions of the police officers. \n\nTherefore, the man would most likely not recover damages from the police department for his injuries due to the intervening cause doctrine."
