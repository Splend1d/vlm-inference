The amount of a radioactive substance decreases by half every time it goes through one half-life.\n\nThe question is asking us to find out how many half-lives it takes for 10.0 kg to decay down to 1.0 microgram ( (\u03bcg). \n\nFirst, let's convert everything to the same unit. Since 1 kg = \\(1 \\times 10^6\\) \u03bcg, we have:\n\n- Initial amount: \\(10.0 \\, \\text{kg} = 10 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{\u03bcg}\\)\n- Final amount: \\(1.0 \\, \\text{\u03bcg}\\)\n\nSo, the ratio of the final amount to the initial amount is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1.0 \\, \\text{\u03bcg}}{10 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{\u03bcg}} = 10^{-7} \\]\n\nThis means the amount has decreased by a factor of \\(10^7\\).\n\nGiven that each half-life halves the amount, we can express the reduction as a power of 2:\n\n\\[ 2^n = 10^7 \\]\n\nWe want to find \\(n\\), which represents the number of half-lives:\n\n\\[ n = \\log_2{10^7} \\]\n\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{\\log_{10}{10^7}}{\\log_{10}{2}} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{7}{\\log_{10}{2}} \\]\n\nSince \\(\\log_{10}{2} \\approx 0.3010\\),\n\n\\[ n \\approx \\frac{7}{0.3010} \\approx 23.25 \\]\n\nSince the number of half-lives must be an integer, and because we're looking for the number of half-lives it takes to reduce the amount from 10.0 kg to less than 1.0 \u03bcg ( (which would require more than 23 half-lives but not reaching exactly 24), the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 29**\n\nThis is based on the understanding that it would take 23 full half-lives to reduce the amount significantly below 10.0 kg, but we need to account for the fact that we're aiming for less than 1.0 \u03bcg, which necessitates considering the next whole number of half-lives beyond 23, leading to option C being the closest correct choice given the options provided."
