                    "text": "Gold has an atomic number of 79, which means it has 79 protons and 79 electrons in its neutral state. The quantum number \\(l\\) corresponds to the angular momentum quantum number, which describes the shape of the electron orbital. The value \\(l = 2\\) corresponds to the d-orbitals.\n\nAn atom has orbitals for each value of \\(n\\) ( (principal quantum number) and \\(l\\). For \\(l = 2\\), there are five different d-orbitals: \\(d_{x^2-y^2}\\), \\(d_{xy}\\), \\(d_{xz}\\), \\(d_{yz}\\), and \\(d_z^2\\).\n\nEach of these d-orbitals can hold up to two electrons, following the Pauli exclusion principle. Therefore, for \\(l = 2\\), the maximum number of electrons is \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\).\n\nHowever, this calculation only considers the contribution from the d-orbitals. Gold also has s and p orbitals contributing to its total electron count. The s-orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, and each p-orbital can hold a maximum of 6 electrons.\n\nFor \\(n=1\\), there is 1 s-orbital.\nFor \\(n=2\\), there are 2 p-orbitals.\nFor \\(n=3\\), there are 3 p-orbitals.\nFor \\(n=4\\), there are 5 d-orbitals as calculated above.\n\nAdding all these up:\n\n- \\(s\\) orbitals: \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\)\n- \\(p\\) orbitals: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n- \\(d\\) orbitals: \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\)\n\nSo, the total number of electrons in gold is \\(2 + 5 + 10 = 17\\).\n\nHowever, none of the options provided match the correct answer of 17. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the question or the options provided. Given the typical electron configuration of gold (Au, which is [Xe] 4f\u00b9\u2074 5d\u00b9\u2070 6s\u00b2 6p\u2076, we can see that the electrons with l = 2 would be those in the 5d subshell, which indeed holds a maximum of 10 electrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the information given about electrons with \\(l = 2\\) is:\n\nB. 23\n\nThis answer is incorrect based on the explanation above, indicating either a mistake in the question's options or the need for clarification on the specific context of \"electrons with quantum number l = 2\" within the electron configuration of Au. The correct count of electrons with \\(l = 2\\) in Au is 10, not any of the provided options."
