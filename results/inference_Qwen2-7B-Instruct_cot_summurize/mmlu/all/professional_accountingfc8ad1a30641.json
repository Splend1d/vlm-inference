Consider the policy that prohibits the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed in key management positions.\n\nObjectivity is crucial for both internal and independent auditors, as it ensures their assessments and findings are unbiased and fair. When evaluating an internal auditor's objectivity, an independent auditor must consider policies that prevent potential conflicts of interest, such as auditing areas where relatives hold key management positions. This helps ensure that the internal auditor remains impartial and does not allow personal relationships to influence their professional judgment or actions. \n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. Testing controls is part of the independent auditor's responsibility, but it doesn't directly address the objectivity of the internal auditor.\nB. Analyzing risk factors is also part of an independent auditor's role, but it doesn't specifically address the internal auditor's objectivity.\nC. Reviewing the internal auditor's reports can help ensure consistency in their work, but it doesn't specifically address objectivity."
