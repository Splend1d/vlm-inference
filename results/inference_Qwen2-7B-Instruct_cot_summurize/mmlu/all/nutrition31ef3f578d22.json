Birth weight below a population threshold for gestational age.\n\nIntrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR) refers to a situation where a fetus does not grow at an appropriate rate in the womb, resulting in a lower birth weight than what is typical for the gestational age. This can be due to various factors such as placental insufficiency, maternal health issues, or genetic predispositions. It is important to note that IUGR does not necessarily mean that the baby will be underweight at birth; rather, it means that their growth was insufficient compared to what is expected for their stage of development in the womb.\n\nOptions A and B ( low birthweight (LBW) and very low birthweight (VLBW) refer to babies born weighing less than certain thresholds (typically less than 2500 grams for LBW and less than 1500 grams for VLBW. These categories do not specifically describe the cause of the low birth weight, which could be due to IUGR or other factors like preterm birth.\n\nOption D, pre-term birth, refers to a delivery occurring before 37 completed weeks of gestation. While a baby born prematurely may also experience IUGR if they did not have sufficient time to grow adequately in the womb, pre-term birth itself is not synonymous with IUGR."
