The homeowner's and daughter's lots were in an unimproved natural state. The sister, however, had lived for 10 years in a house that she had built on her property. The daughter, in preparation for building a house on her lot, carefully excavated an area eight feet deep for the purpose of building a basement. The daughter completed construction of her house and macadamized an area for use as a driveway without changing the former contours of the land. Shortly thereafter, the sister began to make complaints to the daughter about the flooding of her basement, which she claimed had been previously free of water. The sister then built a concrete wall three feet along her border with the daughter to prevent the flow of rain water running onto her land from the daughter's property. This caused the surface water to stand and become stagnant on the daughter's land. The daughter demanded that the sister remove the wall, and upon the sister's refusal, the daughter brought an appropriate action to compel removal. The most likely result is\n\nA. the sister must remove the wall because she has no right to obstruct the flow of such surface water.\nB. the sister must remove the wall at the daughter's expense.\nC. the sister may leave the wall without being liable to the daughter for money damages.\nD. the sister may leave the wall, but she will be liable to the daughter for money damages.\n"

The law generally recognizes a right of lateral and subjacent support in land ownership, meaning that each owner has a right to have their land supported by the land next to it and a right to have water drain away from their land through the land next to it. In this case, the sister's construction of the wall has interfered with the natural drainage pattern, causing the daughter's land to retain water and potentially leading to further issues like flooding. Therefore, the court is likely to order the sister to remove the wall to restore the natural flow of water, thereby respecting the daughter's right to have water drain away from her land.\n\nOption B is unlikely because there is no indication that the daughter is responsible for any costs related to the sister's actions or improvements.\n\nOption C is also unlikely since there would typically be consequences for interfering with a neighbor's property rights in this manner, especially when it leads to negative impacts on the neighbor's land.\n\nOption D combines elements that are less likely than option A, as it suggests the sister can keep the wall but face potential monetary damages, which might not be the primary focus of such an action unless specifically stipulated by law or agreed upon between the parties."
