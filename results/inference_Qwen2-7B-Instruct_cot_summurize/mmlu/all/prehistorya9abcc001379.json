However, among the options provided, the construction of canals for irrigation (option B, might be seen as a significant factor that could have contributed to the development of a complex society.\n\nAncient civilizations often developed sophisticated agricultural systems to support larger populations. Irrigation canals would have allowed for the cultivation of crops in areas with less natural rainfall, enabling a more stable food supply and supporting the growth of larger communities. This surplus food production could then sustain specialists who were not engaged in agriculture, potentially leading to the development of craftspeople, administrators, priests, and other roles that characterize complex societies.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is one of several possible explanations. The other options you've listed might also play roles in the development of Caral's society:\n\n- A. The need to collect large quantities of shellfish might indicate a coastal settlement or reliance on marine resources, but it does not necessarily imply the development of a complex society.\n- C. The building of the Pir\u00e1mide Mayor ( refers to a monumental structure built by the Caral civilization, which could be indicative of advanced architectural skills and organization, but it doesn't directly explain why the society became complex.\n- D. The excavating work to produce sunken plazas could suggest a focus on ceremonial or religious activities, which might have been central to the social organization of the society.\n\nIn summary, while option B\u2014construction of canals for irrigation\u2014is one plausible explanation for the development of a complex society at Caral, it's essential to consider that multiple factors, including those mentioned in options A, C, and D, may have also contributed to this complex societal development."
