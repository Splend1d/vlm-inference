The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C. Calhoun, \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest,\" 1828\nThe issue that precipitated the passage excerpted above was\n\nA. the removal of American Indians from the South.\nB. the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States.\nC. the passage of an act creating higher tariff rates.\nD. the funding of \"internal improvements.\"\n"

Calhoun's \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\" written in response to the Tariff of 1828, also known as the \"Tariff of Abominations.\" This high tariff disproportionately affected the Southern states, particularly South Carolina, because it increased the cost of imported goods, hurting the Southern economy which relied heavily on trade. Calhoun argued that the federal government overstepped its bounds by imposing tariffs that harmed the states, leading to tensions that eventually contributed to the Nullification Crisis and the potential secession of South Carolina."
