By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code\n\nWhen a buffer overflow occurs on the stack, it typically involves writing more data than expected into a buffer, causing the excess data to spill over into adjacent memory locations, including the stack's return address. The return address is usually stored in the stack frame right before the function's return value. An attacker can exploit this by overwriting this return address with the address of their own malicious code. When the program completes the current function and attempts to return, it will execute the code at the location specified by the now-overwritten return address instead of returning to the correct code path. This allows the attacker to inject and run their own code in the context of the current program execution."
