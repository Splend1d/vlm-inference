However, they often faced significant challenges and discrimination in these new environments. Despite the abolition of slavery, societal prejudices and systemic racism persisted, leading to various forms of discrimination such as racial segregation, unequal access to education and employment, and limited political rights. This discrimination greatly impacted the ability of former slaves to fully integrate into society and achieve equality with their non-black counterparts."
