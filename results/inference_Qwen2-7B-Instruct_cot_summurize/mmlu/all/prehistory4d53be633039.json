The exact sequence and contribution of these factors vary depending on the species and region in question. For instance, the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions in Australia are thought to have been primarily driven by human hunting pressures, whereas those in the Americas might have been influenced by both human impacts and broader environmental changes related to the end of the last Ice Age. Additionally, some studies suggest that humans may have inadvertently facilitated the spread of disease among the large animals, which could have played a role in their decline."
