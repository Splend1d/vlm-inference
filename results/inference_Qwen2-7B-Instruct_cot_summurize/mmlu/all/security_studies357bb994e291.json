The security paradigm has been the development of multi-level analysis, to aid the understanding of disempowerment and to promote peace research involvement by NGOs, policy-makers, and the academic community.\nB. The security paradigm of US led strategy has been the undertaking of short-term measures, many of which are drawn from research of the peace studies community. They focus on peace-keeping, peace-making, and structural change for preventing further conflict.\nC. The security paradigm of recent years has been to some extent a reversion to 'liddism'; keeping the lid on a potentially fractured international system, without redress to the critical underlying causes of the problems.\nD. The dominant approach to security studies has been a US led initiative which recognizes the need to undertake responsibility for inter-governmental cooperation, particularly for the commitment towards ethical intervention and for securing peaceful transformations alongside demilitarization of the international community.\n"

The security paradigm of recent years has been to some extent a reversion to 'liddism'; keeping the lid on a potentially fractured international system, without redress to the critical underlying causes of the problems.\n\nFollowing the terrorist attacks of 9/11, there was a significant shift in the global security paradigm. The United States, in particular, embarked on a series of military interventions and intelligence operations aimed at counter-terrorism, leading to what many refer to as \"preemptive war\" policies. This period saw a significant increase in military spending and a focus on hard power solutions to perceived threats. While these actions were intended to stabilize and secure the international system, they often neglected the underlying social, economic, and political issues that can contribute to conflict.\n\nCritics argue that this approach has contributed to a perpetuation of instability, with unintended consequences such as the rise of extremist groups in regions like Afghanistan and Iraq, and the destabilization of countries like Libya after the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi. The lack of attention to addressing root causes of conflict, such as poverty, inequality, and governance issues, has been seen as a shortcoming of this paradigm.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and D either misrepresent or exaggerate certain aspects of the post-9/11 security paradigm. Option A suggests that the security paradigm involves promoting peace through NGOs and academic involvement, which is not a primary focus of the US-led strategy following 9/11. Option B inaccurately attributes the focus on peace-keeping and structural change solely to the peace studies community, when in fact, these strategies were part of broader international efforts and not necessarily driven by peace studies. Option D incorrectly implies that there is a universal recognition of ethical intervention and demilitarization within the international community, which has not been consistently adopted or implemented across nations."
