Power and liability. \n\nIn Hohfeld's scheme of jural relations, power is understood as the ability to perform an act without any corresponding duty or obligation towards another person. Liability, on the other hand, refers to the obligation to refrain from performing an act or to bear the consequences of one's actions. These two concepts are not considered apparent correlatives in Hohfeld's scheme, as they represent different types of legal relationships."
