This refers to the way in which individuals use psychological defense mechanisms to manage emotional arousal or distress. When these defenses fail, it can lead to heightened anxiety.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the psychoanalytic perspective is quite complex and includes several other factors that can contribute to anxiety, such as incongruence between the stranger and the memory of the mother ( which could be related to A, and a failure to dissolve a symbiotic attachment ( which could relate to B. \n\nFor instance:\n- **Incongruence between the stranger and the memory of the mother** ( might relate to a situation where a person encounters a stranger who triggers memories of their mother, leading to feelings of anxiety due to the perceived incongruity.\n- **Failure to dissolve a symbiotic attachment** could refer to unresolved dependence on others, especially in early childhood, leading to anxiety when trying to navigate independent situations.\n\nTherefore, while all these options can contribute to anxiety, option D specifically addresses a fundamental aspect of how the psyche manages its reactions to stressors, making it a comprehensive choice within the psychoanalytic framework."
