He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Right bundle branch block\nB. Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I\nC. Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II\nD. Third-degree atrioventricular block\n"

                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms and findings described is D. Third-degree ( or complete atrioventricular (AV) block.\n\nA third-degree AV block is characterized by the complete separation of the atrial and ventricular rhythms, meaning that the electrical signals originating in the atria do not reach the ventricles. The patient's history of fainting, fatigue, and a pulse rate of only 40 beats per minute suggests that the heart's ventricles are not receiving sufficient pacing from the atria. The presence of cannon A waves on physical examination further supports this diagnosis, as these waves indicate retrograde flow from the ventricles back into the atria, which is typical of third-degree AV block. \n\nIn contrast:\n- A right bundle branch block would result in a widened QRS complex without the typical atrial arrhythmias seen in the patient.\n- Second-degree AV block, type I ( (also known as Mobitz Type I) would show a gradually increasing PR interval followed by a dropped beat, whereas in the current case, there is no apparent relation between the P and R wave rates.\n- Second-degree AV block, type II ( (also known as Mobitz Type II) involves skipped beats without any predictable pattern, and the ventricular rate is usually faster than the atrial rate, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting diagnosis given the provided information is third-degree AV block."
