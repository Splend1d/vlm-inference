This principle alignss with his utilitarian approach, where actions are judged based on their outcomes, specifically the maximization of overall happiness and minimization of suffering. It's important to note that this is a simplification, as Singer's views encompass more complex ethical considerations related to speciesism, but fundamentally, his argument hinges on the idea of maximizing overall welfare."
