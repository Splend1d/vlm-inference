Since the cycle has 6 terms, we can find the equivalent position of the \\(100^{\\text{th}}\\) term by finding the remainder when \\(100\\) is divided by \\(6\\).\n\n\\(100 \\mod 6 = 4\\)\n\nThis means that the \\(100^{\\text{th}}\\) term in the cycle corresponds to the fourth term in the repeating sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the \\(100^{\\text{th}}\\) term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is \\(3\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 3**."
