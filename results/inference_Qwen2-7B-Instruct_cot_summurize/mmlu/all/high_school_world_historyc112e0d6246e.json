This blending of Western literary techniques with non-Western themes and perspectives was a common feature of African writers during this period, often referred to as the \"Black Atlantic\" or \"world literature.\" This approach allowed for a unique form of cultural exchange and expression that transcended traditional boundaries between Eastern and Western cultures."
