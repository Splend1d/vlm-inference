Separate columns for governmental activities business-type activities and discretely presented component units. \n\nThis is the correct answer because the Statement of Activities in the government-wide financial statements typically presents information in separate columns or sections for different types of activities, including governmental activities, business-type activities, and discretely presented component units. This allows for a clear distinction between the various types of operations and their associated expenses and revenues.\n\nOptions B and C are not accurate as they suggest separate columns for each fund, but the statement of activities usually consolidates all funds into one presentation. Option D is incorrect because it suggests a specific location for program and general revenues on the statement, whereas the actual presentation can vary depending on the specific requirements and format used by the entity preparing the financial statements."
