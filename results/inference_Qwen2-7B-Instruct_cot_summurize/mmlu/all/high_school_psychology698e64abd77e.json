In this case, since the exam only focuses on motivation and emotion, social psychology, and the biological basis of behavior, it may lack content validity because it does not cover other important areas of psychology that might be relevant for an AP Psychology course. For example, it does not include topics such as cognitive processes, developmental psychology, personality theory, psychological disorders, or research methods, which are are typically part of an AP Psychology curriculum. Therefore, a test focusing solely on these three areas would likely not provide a comprehensive assessment of students' knowledge across the entire field of psychology."
