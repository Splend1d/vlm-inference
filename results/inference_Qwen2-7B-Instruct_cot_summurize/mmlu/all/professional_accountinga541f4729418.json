This information might include, but is not limited to:\n\n1. **Data covering financial trends**: This refers to the historical performance of the company over several periods, which can be used to analyze growth, profitability, liquidity, and other key financial indicators.\n2. **Fiscal years**: These are are the periods during which the financial statements are prepared, usually 12-month periods ending on a specific date (e.g., December 31st or March 31st.\n\nIn contrast, the financial statements themselves, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, present a snapshot of the company's financial position at a specific point in time (and for a specific period (usually one fiscal year) and do not necessarily provide detailed historical comparisons or trends.\n\nTherefore, the inclusion of statistical tables allows for a deeper understanding of the financial health and performance of the company over time, which is not the primary focus of the financial statements."
