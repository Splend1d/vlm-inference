It involves rapid and irreversible learning of certain behaviors based on direct sensory experience with important objects or events. For example, in birds like ducks and geese, imprinting can refer to their initial attachment to a mother figure ( often the first living thing they see after hatching.\n\nOptions A, B, and D describe different forms of learning:\n\nA. Critical learning - This term is not standard in psychology and might be used differently depending on context. However, it could potentially refer to a concept similar to imprinting if it implies that there's a critical period for learning.\n\nB. Maturation - This refers to the development of an organism's physical structure and function over time, largely determined by genetic programming. It does not specifically refer to learning.\n\nD. Social learning - This refers to learning through observation, imitation, and modeling of others' behaviors. It is distinct from imprinting, although both involve learning without direct reinforcement."
