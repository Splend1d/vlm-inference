He had an anterior myocardial infarction 3 years ago and has had shortness of breath with mild exertion since then. Current medications include labetalol and daily aspirin. He has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His pulse is 100/min and regular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. There are jugular venous pulsations 5 cm above the sternal angle. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. There is edema from the midtibia to the ankle bilaterally. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?\n\nA. Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\nB. Impaired contractility of the left ventricle\nC. Prolapse of the mitral valve\nD. Thrombosis of the superior vena cava\n"

The signs and symptoms mentioned, including progressive fatigue, ankle swelling, shortness of breath with mild exertion, elevated blood pressure, jugular venous pulsations, crackles at lung bases, an S3 gallop ( (an additional heart sound indicating volume overload), and bilateral ankle edema, all point towards heart failure.\n\nConsidering these clinical features, the most likely finding in further evaluation would be:\n\nB. Impaired contractility of the left ventricle\n\nThis is because the patient's history of a myocardial infarction and current symptoms are consistent with chronic heart failure, particularly left ventricular dysfunction. The S3 gallop suggests volume overload, which is often seen in advanced heart failure due to decreased ejection fraction or impaired contractility of the left ventricle. The other options do not directly correlate with the clinical presentation described: decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (would suggest a less severe form of heart failure, prolapse of the mitral valve could contribute to heart failure but is not necessarily the most common finding based on the symptoms, and thrombosis of the superior vena cava is not typically associated with the presented symptoms."
