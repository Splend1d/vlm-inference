However, African Americans are not a significant population in these regions. The majority of African Americans reside in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, where they have a long history and significant cultural presence due to the legacy of slavery and the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nTherefore, it is incorrect to associate African Americans with the southern prairie provinces."
