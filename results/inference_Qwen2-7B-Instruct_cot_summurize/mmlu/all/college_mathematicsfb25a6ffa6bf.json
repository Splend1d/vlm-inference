Here's why:\n\n- **Dimension 0 (** This corresponds to the scenario where V and W have no elements in common other than the zero vector. In this case, their intersection is just the trivial subspace { {{0} }.\n\n- **Dimension 1** This happens when V and W intersect along a line within R^4. For example, if one of the subspaces is the span of two vectors in R^4 that are not parallel but are contained in the plane defined by the other subspace, they will intersect along a line.\n\n- **Dimension 2** This is the scenario where V and W actually coincide; that is, they are the same subspace. If they are both 2-dimensional and span the same plane within R^4, then their intersection is the entire subspace itself.\n\n- **Dimension greater than 2 is not possible** because both V and W are 2-dimensional, meaning they can't share more than 2 linearly independent vectors without being being identical subspaces. The maximum overlap can't exceed the dimensionality of either space.\n\nTherefore, the possible dimensions of the subspace \\(V \\cap W\\) are 0, 1, or 2."
