The statement highlights the success of using machines in the cotton industry, suggesting that similar advancements in woolen manufacturing could lead to significant benefits. It also discusses how the introduction of new machinery (like the scribbling mill, spinning frame, and fly shuttle) initially caused alarm among workers due to fears of job loss, but these machines actually contributed to higher wages and increased trade. This aligns with the principles of industrialization, where mechanization and technological improvements are central to economic growth and development."
