Here's a breakdown of each option:\n\nI. **Testosterone** - This is a steroid hormone produced by the body primarily in the testes ( in males and the ovaries and adrenal glands in females. It is indeed a steroid-based molecule.\n\nII. **Triglycerides** - These are fatty acids bound to glycerol, forming a triglyceride molecule. While they contain carbon atoms, triglycerides are not classified as steroids because they do not have the specific structure of steroid compounds.\n\nIII. **Progesterone** - Another steroid hormone, progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum, placenta, and adrenal cortex. It plays a crucial role in reproduction and maintaining pregnancy.\n\nIV. **DNA** - Deoxyribonucleic acid is the molecule that carries most of the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA is a polymer made from a chain of nucleotides subunits, each with a nitrogen-containing base, a sugar (deoxyribose), and a phosphate group. It does not fit into the definition of a steroid-based molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. I and III**, as these are steroid-based molecules."
