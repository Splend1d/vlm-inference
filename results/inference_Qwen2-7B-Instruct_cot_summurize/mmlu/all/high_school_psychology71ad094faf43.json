This theory suggests that emotional responses are the result of both physiological arousal and the interpretation or labeling of those bodily sensations. In Antoinette's case, the sudden jump out by her friends and the resulting fear (as indicated by her racing heart and shrieking) were initially unaccompanied by an immediate emotional label ( she initially thought they were ninjas. However, once she identified them as friends, her emotional response shifted to happiness. This demonstrates how our thoughts and interpretations can significantly influence our emotions."
