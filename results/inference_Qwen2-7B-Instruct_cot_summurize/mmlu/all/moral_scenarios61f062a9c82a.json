It's a common and acceptable practice as part of commerce and daily life.\n\nRefusing to shake hands because of personal health concerns related to the virus can be seen as a self-preservation action. While it might cause inconvenience or discomfort to others, it's not necessarily morally wrong if done out of concern for one's own health and safety during a pandemic. However, it's important to consider the social context and the potential impact on interpersonal relationships when making such decisions. \n\nThus, the actions in the two scenarios do not align with clear-cut moral wrongness or rightness based on the information provided."
