A pediatrician informed the infant's father that unless his daughter received immediate medical treatment, she would die. The father, who was very religious, refused to permit the pediatrician to administer the necessary treatment. He explained that his faith in his religion would restore his daughter to good health. As a consequence, the pediatrician sought an order from the state court, where the father was present, permitting the pediatrician to provide the necessary medical treatment to the infant. Which of the following is the father's strongest constitutional argument against the court order?\n\nA. The order violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The order violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The order violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe father's strongest constitutional argument against the court order would be based on the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which protects the freedom to practice one's religion without government interference. This protection is incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, meaning it applies to state actions as well. The father claims that his religious beliefs prohibit him from allowing medical treatment for his daughter, and he argues that forcing him to do so violates his right to freely exercise his religion. Therefore, this is the strongest constitutional argument against the court order."
