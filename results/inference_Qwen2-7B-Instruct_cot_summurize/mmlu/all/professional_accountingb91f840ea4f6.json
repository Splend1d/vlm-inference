The remaining two components have costs of $10 million each; one of them has a useful life of four years, and the other has a useful life of five years. The company applies the cost model to the equipment and uses the straight-line method of depreciation.

Then, we'll calculate the depreciation expense for each component and sum these expenses to find the total depreciation expense for the year.\n\nGiven:\n- Total cost of equipment = $100 million\n- Two components ( together costing 80% of the total cost, so their combined cost is 0.8 * $100 million = $80 million with a 20-year useful life.\n- Remaining two components: $10 million each\n  - One with a 4-year useful life\n  - Another with a 5-year useful life\n\n**Step 1: Depreciation Expense for the Components Together Costing 80%**\n\nThe annual depreciation expense for these components would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Depreciation} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Components}}{\\text{Useful Life}} = \\frac{$80\\, million}{20\\, years} = $4\\, million \\]\n\n**Step 2: Depreciation Expense for Each of the Remaining Components**\n\n- **Component with a 4-year useful life**: \n\\[ \\text{Depreciation Expense} = \\frac{$10\\, million}{4\\, years} = $2.5\\, million \\]\n  \n- **Component with a 5-year useful life**: \n\\[ \\text{Depreciation Expense} = \\frac{$10\\, million}{5\\, years} = $2\\, million \\]\n\n**Step 3: Total Depreciationation Expense for Year 1**\n\nSumming up all the depreciation expenses gives us the total depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Depreciationation Expense} = $4\\, million + $2.5\\, million + $2\\, million = $8.5\\, million \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. $8,500,000**."
