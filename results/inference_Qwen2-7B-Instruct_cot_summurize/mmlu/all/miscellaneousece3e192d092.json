This means that the fuel is burned outside the engine mechanism, and the heat generated is used to create steam. The steam then expands and pushes the pistons within the engine, converting the thermal energy into mechanical work. \n\nIn contrast:\n- An internal combustion engine burns fuel inside the engine itself, with the combustion chamber being part of the engine mechanism.\n- A rotary engine rotates as it operates, unlike the reciprocating motion of a steam or internal combustion engine.\n- A reaction engine uses a jet of exhaust material (like gases from burning fuel) to generate thrust, typically found in rocket engines or some advanced aircraft propulsion systems."
