For example, Genesis 2:7 says, \"Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.\" This verse implies that there is a distinct, non-physical essence (the soul or spirit) that was infused into the physical body by God, creating a unique, dual nature to human beings. \n\nIn contrast, soul-body dualism posits two separate substances - the soul and the body - that interact with each other. The Bible's account of the soul aligns more closely with this philosophical position than with the identity theory or the idea of a monistic soul, which might suggest a more unified or materialistic view of the self."
