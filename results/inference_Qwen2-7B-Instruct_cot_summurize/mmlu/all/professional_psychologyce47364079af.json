According to Goal-Setting Theory, as proposed by Dr. Edwin Locke, goals should be Specific (Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound ( often referred to as the SMART criteria. However, the \"highly difficult\" part of this statement implies an extreme level of difficulty, which might not necessarily lead to better performance or higher levels of motivation if the goals become unattainable or demotivating.\n\nResearch suggests that goals should be challenging but still within reach to maintain engagement and motivation without causing frustration or disengagement. Overly difficult goals might result in failure more often than success, which can undermine motivation and self-efficacy. Therefore, a balance between challenge and attainability is crucial for effective goal setting."
