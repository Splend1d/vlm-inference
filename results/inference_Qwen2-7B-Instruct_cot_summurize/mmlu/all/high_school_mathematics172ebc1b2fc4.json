The other half continues to accrue interest, and at the end of the ten years, Alex will pay off the remaining balance.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\\[ A = P \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n} \\right)^{nt} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\(P\\) is the principal amount ( ($10,000).\n- \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate ( (10% or 0.10).\n- \\(n\\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year ( (4 times for quarterly compounding).\n- \\(t\\) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.\n\n**First 5 years:**\n\\[ A_5 = 10000 \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4} \\right)^{4*5} \\]\n\\[ A_5 = 10000 \\left( \\left(1 + 0.025 \\right)^{20} \\]\n\\[ A_5 = 10000 \\left( (1.025)^{20} \\]\n\\[ A_5 \\approx 10000 \\times 1.6386 \\]\n\\[ A_5 \\approx 16386 \\]\n\nAt the end of 5 years, Alex pays off half of this amount:\n\\[ Payment_1 = \\frac{16386}{2} = 8193 \\]\n\nRemaining balance after the first payment:\n\\[ Remaining = 16386 - 8193 = 8193 \\]\n\nThis remaining amount continues to accrue interest for another 5 years:\n\\[ A_{10} = 8193 \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4} \\right)^{4*5} \\]\n\\[ A_{10} = 8193 \\left( (1.025)^{20 \\]\n\\[ A_{10} \\approx 8193 \\times 1.6386 \\]\n\\[ A_{10} \\approx 13327 \\]\n\nTotal repayment under the compound interest option:\n\\[ Total_{compound} = 8193 + 13327 = 21520 \\]\n\n### Simple Interest Option\n\nFor the second option, Alex takes out a loan of $10,000 with a simple annual interest rate of 12%. The total repayment at the end of 10 years includes the principal plus the interest.\n\nThe formula for simple interest is:\n\\[ I = P \\cdot r \\cdot t \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(I\\) is the interest.\n- \\(P\\) is the principal amount ($10,000).\n- \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate ( (12% or 0.12).\n- \\(t\\) is the time in years ( (10).\n\n\\[ I = 10000 \\cdot 0.12 \\cdot 10 \\]\n\\[ I = 12000 \\]\n\nSo, the total repayment under the simple interest option is:\n\\[ Total_{simple} = Principal + Interest = 10000 + 12000 = 22000 \\]\n\n### Difference\n\nThe positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes is:\n\\[ |Total_{compound} - Total_{simple}| = |21520 - 22000| = 480 \\]\n\nIt seems there might be a misunderstanding or rounding error in the provided options since none of them match the calculated difference of 480. Given the calculations, the closest answer choice to our result would be:\n\nC. 382\n\nHowever, based on the precise calculation, the correct difference should be **480**, which is not listed among the provided choices. Therefore, based on the information provided and the calculations performed, the closest correct answer based on the given options might be considered C. 382, but acknowledging that the precise answer is 480."
