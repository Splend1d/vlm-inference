Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, he received an offer of his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser sued for specific performance on the basis that the oral understanding, along with the written offer and the check, constituted an enforceable agreement. Will the purchaser likely prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.\nB. No, because the offer was not accepted \u0080\u0094 prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\nC. Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.\nD. No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.\n"

No, because the offer was not accepted \u2014 prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this scenario, the key factor is whether the seller accepted the offer made by the purchaser. An enforceable contract requires an offer, acceptance of that offer, and consideration. In this case, the oral agreement was not enough to constitute an acceptance since it was not followed by the seller's clear acceptance through signing the offer form. \n\nThe written offer was sent but was not accepted by the seller's actions, such as signing the offer form or accepting its terms. Instead, the seller chose to accept a higher offer, which means he did not accept the original offer made by the first buyer. \n\nThe post-dated check for 5% of the price can be seen as an earnest money deposit, which is common in real estate transactions to show good faith, but it alone cannot bind the parties into a contract without an acceptance of the offer.\n\nTherefore, the seller was within his rights to sell the house to the party offering the full asking price of $120,000, as he had not formally accepted the initial offer made by the first buyer. Hence, the purchaser is unlikely to prevail in their lawsuit seeking specific performance."
