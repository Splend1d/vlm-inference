The force of the man on the scale\n\nThis is because Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In this scenario, the man exerts a force on the scale (the action, which results in the scale exerting an equal and opposite force back on the man, which we perceive as his weight.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that due to the upward acceleration of the elevator, the scale will actually exert a greater force on the man than just his weight, effectively supporting him more than if the elevator were stationary or moving at a constant speed. This additional force is due to the inertial forces caused by the acceleration."
