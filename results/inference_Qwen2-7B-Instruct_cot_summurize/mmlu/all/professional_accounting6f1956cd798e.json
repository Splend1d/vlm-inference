Impossibility of performance.\n\nImpossibility of performance refers to a situation where, due to unforeseen circumstances, the party who is supposed to fulfill their contractual obligations can no longer do so. This could be due to events like natural disasters, changes in law, or other factors that make it legally or physically impossible to fulfill the terms of the contract. In such cases, the contract is discharged because it's no longer possible for either party to fulfill their obligations as agreed upon.\n\nLet's briefly look at the other options:\n\nA. Novation involves replacing an existing contract with a new one between the same or different parties. It doesn't typically lead to the discharge of the original contract unless all parties agree to it.\n\nB. Accord and satisfaction involves a new agreement between the parties to settle a dispute over the original contract. It doesn't usually result in the discharge of the original contract unless it is specifically stated in the accord.\n\nC. Anticipatory repudiation occurs when one party informs the other that they will not perform their contractual obligations when due. This can lead to immediate termination of the contract, but it does not necessarily mean the impossibility of performance."
