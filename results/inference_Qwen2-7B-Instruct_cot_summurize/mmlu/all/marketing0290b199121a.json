Social pressure to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles with fewer dangerous emissions.\n\nThe development of Toyota's Prius and Honda's hybrid Civic can largely be attributed to the growing social pressure to reduce environmental impact through more fuel-efficient and cleaner-emitting vehicles. As concerns over climate change increased, there was a global push for industries, including the automotive sector, to innovate and produce vehicles that were less harmful to the environment. This led to significant investments in research and development of alternative technologies, such as hybrid systems, which combine gasoline engines with electric motors to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Therefore, these models represent a response to environmental awareness and the demand for sustainable transportation solutions."
