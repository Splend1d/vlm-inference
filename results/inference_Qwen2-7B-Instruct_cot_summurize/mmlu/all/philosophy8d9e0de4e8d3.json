In essence, Augustine argues that all created things are good, even if they are not eternal and unchangeably so. This perspective aligns more closely with option C: \"good, even taken separately.\" \n\nAugustine believed that God, being being perfectly good, creates only good things. However, the goodness of created things is contingent upon their relation to God and their purpose within the divine plan. They do not possess an inherent, eternal, or unchangeable goodness independent of God. Thus, while they are good, this goodness is not absolute and unchanging like God's own.\n\nIt's important to note that Augustine's views evolved over time, influenced by various philosophical and theological debates. This answer reflects his later thought on the matter, particularly as seen in his works discussing the nature of reality and the divine.\n\nFor a more detailed exploration of Augustine's thoughts on this topic, you might refer to his works such as \"The City of God\" or \"Confessions,\" where he delves into the nature of creation and its goodness in relation to the divine."
