However, it's important to note that the amount of opium found in poppy seeds is typically too small to cause any psychoactive effects. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration ( (DEa) has classified raw or cooked poppy seeds as Schedule II controlled substances because of their potential for abuse, but this classification is primarily related to the risk of intentional contamination rather than the inherent properties of the seeds themselves. In general, eating foods containing poppy seeds will not lead to a significant intake of opium."
