This action actually aligns with ethical conduct and honesty, which are generally considered morally right. However, seeking a promotion is not inherently morally wrong; it's part of career advancement. The issue might arise if the method used to seek the promotion (such as lying about contributions or unfairly comparing oneself to others - was unethical. Without specifics suggesting deceit or unfairness, this scenario doesn't necessarily point to a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character's act of hurting themselves is not morally wrong in the sense that it's an individual's right to make decisions about their own health and well-being. However, it's important to note that self-harm can be a serious mental health issue and is often associated with distress and psychological pain. It's crucial to seek professional help rather than engaging in self-harm as a coping mechanism. So, while the act itself might not be morally wrong from a legal standpoint, it can be ethically problematic given the context of mental health.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, Scenario 1 leans towards potentially being morally wrong due to the lack of acknowledging someone else's work, even though the intention was to seek a promotion, and Scenario 2 is not morally wrong in the traditional sense but could be concerning regarding mental health and well-being."
