The MC curve intersects the ATC curve at the minimum point of the ATC curve. \n\nThis is because when the marginal cost (MC) is less than the average total cost (ATC, the ATC will decrease as each additional unit produced contributes less to the total cost than the average. Conversely, when the MC is greater than the ATC, the ATC increases because each additional unit adds more to the total cost than the average. At the point where MC equals ATC, the ATC stops decreasing and starts increasing, which is also the lowest point of the ATC curve."
