However, it's important to note that while the blue whale lives for an extended period compared to most other animals listed, their lifespan is still relatively short in comparison to many other species on Earth. For instance, some tree species can live much longer than blue whales.\n\n- A Gorilla typically lives around 35 to 40 years in the wild.\n- A Dog can live from 10 to 13 years, but some breeds may live up to 20 years or more in exceptional cases.\n- A Queen Honey Bee lives only about 6 weeks to a few months during the summer season, as she is responsible for laying eggs and dies after her primary task is completed.\n\nBlue whales, on the other hand, can live up to 90 years or more, making them the longest-lived mammal based on current scientific measurements."
