It constitutes negligence and potentially endangering someone's health, which goes against ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, using your glasses to pass a vision test for your driver's license is not necessarily morally wrong. While it might be considered cheating or not being fully honest, it's a common practice that might not have serious consequences if done occasionally and without intent to deceive beyond the test. However, depending on the context and the severity of the potential consequences of having poor vision while driving, some might argue it's not entirely morally justifiable either. But in terms of straightforward morality, it's less clear-cut than the first scenario."
