Co-existence of innumerable genetic variants\n\nQuasi-species viruses, like influenza and HIV, have a characteristic where they co-exist with numerous genetic variants simultaneously. This is due to their high mutation rates and the lack of proofreading by their polymerases during replication. Each variant can be thought of as a member of the quasi-species, contributing to the overall genetic diversity of the viral population."
