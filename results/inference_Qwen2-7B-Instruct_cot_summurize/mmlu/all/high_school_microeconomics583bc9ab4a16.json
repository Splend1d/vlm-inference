Horizontal\n\nIf Matt's total utility from consuming bratwurst increases at a constant rate no matter how many bratwurst he consumes, this implies that each additional bratwurst provides the same marginal utility. In economic terms, this means that the price of bratwurst does not affect Matt's willingness to pay for it, as long as he continues to consume more. Thus, his demand for bratwurst is perfectly inelastic with respect to price changes. A demand curve that represents perfectly inelastic demand is horizontal, indicating that quantity demanded remains constant regardless of price changes."
