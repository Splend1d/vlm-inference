The 16-year-old was developmentally disabled and his mannerisms were a magnet for malicious bullies. One day the boy stole his father's licensed handgun and shot one of the bullies dead. The district attorney announced prosecution of the teen as an adult and asked for the death penalty due to aggravating circumstances. The trial court certified the boy over to adult criminal court. The boy was convicted and sentenced to death. An appeal was taken on his behalf all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on the merits. Will the Court affirm the sentence of death?\n\nA. Yes, children aged 14 and older are treated as adults and, as adults, they are subject to the same capital punishment penalty as other adults.\nB. No, a minor under 16 cannot be tried in adult court because the Eighth Amendment clause against cruel and unusual punishment forbids it, and the whole prosecution was unconstitutional.\nC. Yes, when a crime is committed by malice aforethought, the age of the perpetrator doesn't matter because the same criminal intent requires the same punishment.\nD. No, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between an adolescent and an adult.\n"

No, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between an adolescent and an adult.\n\nIn 2012, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of Miller v. Alabama that mandatory life without parole sentences for juveniles are unconstitutional. In 2016, the Court further clarified in the case of Graham v. Florida that life without parole is also unconstitutional for juveniles who did not commit homicide. More recently, in 2020, the Court in the case of Jackson v. Mississippi ruled that a juvenile defendant must receive a hearing to determine whether he or she should be tried as an adult if that determination is made before the trial starts.\n\nGiven these precedents, the Supreme Court would likely rule that the death penalty for a 16-year-old is unconstitutional, as it discriminates against juveniles based on their age, which is a protected class under the Constitution. The Court has been increasingly recognizing the differences in maturity, judgment, and culpability between adults and juveniles. Therefore, it would be unlikely to affirm the sentence of death for this 16-year-old boy."
