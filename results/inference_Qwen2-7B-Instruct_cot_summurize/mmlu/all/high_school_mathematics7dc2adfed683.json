Since Grady rides \\(60\\% \\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed is \\(N + 0.6N = 1.6N\\) miles per hour.\n\nGiven that Grady rides \\(12\\) miles further than Noah in two hours, we can set up an equation based on the distances each has traveled in those two hours. The distance traveled by an object is given by the formula \\(Distance = Speed \\times Time\\).\n\nFor Noah, the distance traveled in two hours is:\n\\[Distance_{Noah} = N \\times 2\\]\n\nFor Grady, the distance traveled in two hours is:\n\\[Distance_{Grady} = 1.6N \\times 2\\]\n\nWe know that \\(Distance_{Grady} = Distance_{Noah} + 12\\), so substituting the expressions for each distance gives us:\n\\[1.6N \\times 2 = N \\times 2 + 12\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\\[3.2N = 2N + 12\\]\n\nSubtract \\(2N\\) from both sides to solve for \\(N\\):\n\\[1.2N = 12\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(1.2\\) to find \\(N\\):\n\\[N = \\frac{12}{1.2} = 10\\]\n\nTherefore, Noah rides at a speed of \\(10\\) miles per hour, which corresponds to option C."
