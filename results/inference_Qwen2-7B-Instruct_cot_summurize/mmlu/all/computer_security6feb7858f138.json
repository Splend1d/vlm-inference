What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\nA. The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\nB. When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\nC. When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\nD. When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.\n"

When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.\n\nKerberos uses a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) system, where a user's initial authentication results in a TGT with a longer validity period ( typically 14 days. This TGT can then be used to request service tickets (STs, which have a shorter validity period, usually up to 24 hours. \n\nWhen a client attempts to access a service, it sends its service ticket along with other credentials to the server. The server forwards this request to the KDC to validate the ticket's integrity and remaining validity. If the KDC confirms that the ticket is still valid, the server can proceed with authenticating the user. If the ticket has expired or been revoked, the KDC will not confirm its validity, and the server will reject the authentication attempt.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not accurately describe how Kerberos ensures the security and integrity of tickets. The server does not manage the lifetime of client tickets; instead, it relies on the KDC to verify the ticket's status during each authentication attempt."
