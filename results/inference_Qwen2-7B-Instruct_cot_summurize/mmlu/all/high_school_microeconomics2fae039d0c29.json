This means that the additional satisfaction or happiness gained from consuming one more cookie is exactly offset by the disutility (DU, if any, associated with overconsumption, such as feeling full or sick. In other words, at this point, the consumer has maximized their total utility given their preferences and constraints, including any non-monetary costs like health considerations.\n\nTo clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The total utility cannot be equal to zero since utility is typically measured on a scale where higher values represent greater satisfaction.\n\nB. The substitution effect vs. the income effect refers to how changes in the price of a good (or changes in income) affect the quantity demanded. These effects do not directly relate to the decision point at which a consumer stops consuming based on subjective utility.\n\nC. The ratio of marginal utility to total utility being equal to one does not directly correspond to the stopping point of consumption. Instead, it suggests a specific state of utility optimization, but it's not the specific condition under which consumption stops unless marginal utility happens to be zero."
