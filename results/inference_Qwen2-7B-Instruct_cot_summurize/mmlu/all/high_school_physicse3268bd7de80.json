                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Counterclockwise rotation; radius of path = mv/(eB).\n\nTo understand why, we need to apply the principles of electromagnetism and classical mechanics. The electron will experience a force due to the magnetic field, which can be calculated using the formula F = qvB, where q is the charge of the electron (-e), v is its velocity, and B is the magnetic field strength. This force acts perpendicular to both the velocity of the electron and the magnetic field, causing the electron to move in a circular path.\n\nThe direction of this force is determined by the right-hand rule: if you point your right thumb in the direction of the electron's velocity and your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, your palm will point in the direction of the force. Since the electron has a negative charge, the force will act in the opposite direction compared to how it would for a positive charge. Thus, the electron will rotate counterclockwise when viewed from above, looking into the plane of the page.\n\nThe radius of the electron's circular path can be found using the centripetal force equation, which states that the force required to keep an object moving in a circular path is equal to the mass of the object times its velocity squared divided by the radius of the path ( (F = mv^2/r). Equating this to the magnetic force (qvB, we get:\n\nqvB = mv^2/r\n\nSolved for r, the radius becomes:\n\nr = mv/(qB)\n\nSubstituting q = -e ( (the charge of the electron) gives us:\n\nr = mv/(eB)\n\nSo, the electron will rotate counterclockwise with a radius given by mv/(eB)."
