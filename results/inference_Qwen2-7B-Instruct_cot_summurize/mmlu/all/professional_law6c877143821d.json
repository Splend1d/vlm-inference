It provides context and supports the victim's testimony by showing that the defendant was indeed known by the alias \"Speed\" among other inmates, which could imply that he was part of a group or network that included the kidnapper who was also known as \"Speed\". This can strengthen the case against the defendant, making the jury consider him as potentially being involved in the crime. However, it's important to note that the admissibility of such evidence would ultimately depend on local laws and court rules regarding the admissibility of circumstantial evidence and the specific exceptions or provisions related to hearsay."
