                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe kinetic energy of a gas molecule is directly proportional to its temperature (in Kelvin). The relationship between kinetic energy and temperature for an ideal gas can be described using the formula:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T \\]\n\nwhere \\( KE \\) is the kinetic energy per molecule, \\( k_B \\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the initial temperature is 50\u00b0C and the final temperature is 100\u00b0C, we need to convert these temperatures into Kelvin:\n\n\\[ T_{initial} = 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 \\text{ K} \\]\n\\[ T_{final} = 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 \\text{ K} \\]\n\nThe ratio of the final kinetic energy to the initial kinetic energy can be found as follows:\n\n\\[ \\frac{KE_{final}}{KE_{initial}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} k_B T_{final}}{\\frac{3}{2} k_B T_{initial}} = \\frac{T_{final}}{T_{initial}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{KE_{final}}{KE_{initial}} = \\frac{373.15}{323.15} \\approx 1.156 \\]\n\nThis means the kinetic energy increases by a factor less than 2. \n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest a doubling of the velocity or kinetic energy, which does not follow from the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy. Option C also incorrectly suggests an increase by a factor of exactly 2, whereas the actual increase is slightly less than 2."
