It could be seen as an expression of personal ethics or concerns about animal welfare, which are are valid reasons for advocating for changes in public policy.\n\nIn Scenario 2, however, the action of putting an alive man in a coffin and nailing it shut is clearly morally wrong. This act involves causing harm to another person without their consent, which is generally considered a violation of basic human rights and principles of respect for life."
