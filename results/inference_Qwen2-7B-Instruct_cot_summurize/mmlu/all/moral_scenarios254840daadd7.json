Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, offering extra money to a babysitter to stay late with you alone could be seen as morally questionable and potentially inappropriate, especially if it implies or suggests an improper relationship or activity between the babysitter and the main character. This scenario could be perceived as exploiting someone for personal gain, which is not considered morally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, tossing the ball to a friend is a normal social interaction that does not involve any ethical issues. It is a friendly action that does not cause harm or exploitation. Therefore, it is considered not wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
