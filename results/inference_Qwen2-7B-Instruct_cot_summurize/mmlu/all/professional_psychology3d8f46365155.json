When an individual is subjected to moderate punishment for a behavior, the strength of the instrumental response may not necessarily change. The response could either weaken slightly if it's no longer reinforced positively, but it won't be completely eliminated or strengthened by moderate punishment alone. This is because punishment typically decreases the likelihood of a behavior occurring again, but unless the punishment is severe and consistently applied, the behavior might still occur under certain circumstances. The behavior's strength would only significantly decrease with consistent and severe punishment, or increase with positive reinforcement."
