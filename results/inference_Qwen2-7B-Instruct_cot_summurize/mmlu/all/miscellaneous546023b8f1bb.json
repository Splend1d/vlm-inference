It typically lacks many features of a standard language and evolves from a mix of the languages involved. \n\nA dialect refers to a variety of a language used by people in a particular region, often differing in vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar.\n\nA creole is a language that develops when a pidgin becomes the native language for the next generation born to parents who have learned it as a second language.\n\nA regionalism refers to a term, word, or phrase used in a specific geographical region, not necessarily related to language differences between groups of speakers."
