These organisms do not fit into any other traditional kingdom, so they are grouped together in Protista. \n\nB. They do not include the cyanobacteria.\n\nC. They are not necessarily heterotrophic; some protists are autotrophic like chloroplast-containing algae or photosynthetic amoeba.\n\nD. They do not possess cell walls composed of peptidoglycan, which is a feature of bacterial cell walls, not eukaryotic ones."
