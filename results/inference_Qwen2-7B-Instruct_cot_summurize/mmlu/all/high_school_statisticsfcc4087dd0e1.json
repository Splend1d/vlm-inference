By grouping similar experimental units together into blocks, we can minimize the variability within each block and increase the precision of our treatment comparisons. This helps to ensure that any observed differences between treatments are due to the treatments themselves rather than other variables (confounders) that might affect the outcome. Blocking does not directly aim to reduce bias or variation within treatments, but it can help to control for sources of variation that might otherwise obscure the true effects of the treatments."
