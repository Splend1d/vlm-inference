Salt and salt-preserved foods\n\nResearch has shown that high consumption of salt, especially in the form of salt-preserved or processed foods, can increase the risk of stomach cancer. The high salt content can irritate the stomach lining and potentially lead to cellular damage over time, which may contribute to the development of cancerous cells.\n\nWhile obesity (A) and dietary fiber (D) have been linked to other health issues and some types of cancer, there is no strong evidence to suggest they directly increase the risk of stomach cancer. Sugar (B) is not known to significantly increase the risk of stomach cancer, although it is associated with other health problems like diabetes and obesity, which might indirectly affect cancer risk."
