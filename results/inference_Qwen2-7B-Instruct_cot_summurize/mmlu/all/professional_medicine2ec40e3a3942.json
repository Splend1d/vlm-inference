This technique involves quick, forceful thrusts that can help restore normal joint mobility and reduce pain. It is often used to treat joint restrictions, which may contribute to back pain.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that osteopathic manipulative treatment should always be tailored to the individual patient's condition, medical history, and any contraindications they might have. It's also essential that such treatments are provided by a licensed and trained osteopath or DO ( (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) who can assess the patient thoroughly and decide on the best course of treatment."
