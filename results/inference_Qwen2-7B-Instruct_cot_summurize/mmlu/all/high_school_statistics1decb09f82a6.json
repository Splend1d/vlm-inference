This measure is essentially capturing the interquartile range ( (IQR), which is a robust statistic used to quantify variability by indicating the range within which the middle 50% of the data points fall. It is not related to central tendency ( (which would be better represented by measures like the mean or median), symmetry ( (related to the shape of the distribution), or skewness ( (describing the asymmetry of the probability distribution)."
