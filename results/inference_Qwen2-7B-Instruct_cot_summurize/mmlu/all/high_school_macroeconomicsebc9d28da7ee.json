While they can be severe and involve a sustained decline in output (option C is true), it's important to note that not all declines in economic activity are considered recessions; typically, a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months. This is usually measured by a decline in Gross Domestic Product ( (GDP) for two consecutive quarters. And while recessions can be quite severe, they do not necessarily always lead to depressions (option B is partially correct but not the full picture)."
