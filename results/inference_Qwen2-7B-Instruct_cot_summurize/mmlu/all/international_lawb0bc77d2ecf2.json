Secondary rules are the rules that govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of the primary rules, i.e., of the international obligations of the states.\n\nIn the context of international law and specifically the law of international responsibility, secondary rules refer to the norms that determine the legal consequences of a state's violation of its international obligations. These can include rules regarding the remedies available to victims, the enforcement mechanisms for these remedies, and the procedural aspects of holding a state accountable for its wrongful acts. Secondary rules do not directly address the substance of the international obligations themselves (which would be considered primary rules), but rather they deal with the effects of non-compliance with those obligations."
