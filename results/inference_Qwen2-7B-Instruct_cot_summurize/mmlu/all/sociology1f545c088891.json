This wealth generation was facilitated through corporations, which allowed for the pooling of resources, risk management, and expansion of economic activities beyond what could be achieved by an individual or a small group. These individuals and families often accumulated significant fortunes from industries such as manufacturing, banking, finance, and other sectors, thereby positioning themselves within the upper echelons of society based on their economic power and influence."
