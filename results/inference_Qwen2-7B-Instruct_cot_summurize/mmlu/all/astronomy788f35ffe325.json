They were the most abundant elements at the time of the solar system's formation, due to their low atomic weight and high abundance in the early universe.\n\n2. **Hydrogen Compounds**: These include molecules such as water (H2O, methane CH4, and ammonia NH3. While they are present in the solar nebula, their contribution to the total mass is significantly less than that of hydrogen and helium.\n\n3. **Metals**: In this context, \"metals\" refer to elements heavier than helium, including iron, nickel, silicon, and others. Metals are much less abundant in the solar nebula compared to hydrogen and helium but more so than hydrogen compounds.\n\n4. **Rocks**: These are solid materials that are composed of minerals and are made up of silicate materials. They are also less abundant than hydrogen and helium but more so than metals in the solar nebula.\n\nSo, when arranged from highest to lowest percentage of mass in the nebula, it would be: light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, and then rocks. This order matches option C."
