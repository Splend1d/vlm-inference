The girlfriend, who was scared of flying, reluctantly agreed. During the flight, the pilot decided to play a practical joke and shut off the plane's engine. When the plane went into a nosedive, the pilot said, \"Oh my God, we're going to crash. \" The girlfriend became panic- stricken and started screaming hysterically. A few seconds later, the pilot re-started the engine and said, \"Don't worry \u0080\u0094I was only joking. \" The plane landed safely and neither person was injured. If the girlfriend brings suit against the pilot for intentional infliction of emotional distress, she will probably\n\nA. recover, because a reasonable person would have been distressed by the pilot's actions.\nB. recover, because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. not recover, because the pilot intended his actions as a practical joke and, therefore, lacked sufficient intent for an intentional tort.\nD. not recover, because the girlfriend did not suffer any physical injury.\n"

Intentional or reckless.\n2. Extreme and outrageous.\n3. Caused severe emotional distress.\n4. Resulted in a legally cognizable injury.\n\nIn this scenario, the pilot's decision to intentionally shut off the plane's engine during flight, causing the plane to go into a nosedive, and then pretending it was all a joke can be considered extreme and outrageous behavior. This action was not only dangerous but also aimed at causing distress, which is a key element for a successful claim under IIED. The fact that the girlfriend was panic-stricken and screamed hysterically indicates that she suffered severe emotional distress. While the pilot may have intended it as a joke, the potential for harm and the actual distress caused to the girlfriend are factors that could support her case. Additionally, the lack of physical injury might not necessarily bar recovery in cases of IIED, especially when the focus is on the emotional impact rather than physical harm. Therefore, it is likely that the girlfriend would recover under these circumstances."
