The temperature dropped by 11 degrees Fahrenheit from 6 pm to 10 pm, and it was 84 degrees Fahrenheit at 10 pm. \n\nThis means that if you add the 11 degrees Fahrenheit that were lost during the drop back onto the temperature at 10 pm, you will get the temperature at 6 pm. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Temperature at 10 pm} + \\text{Temperature drop} = \\text{Temperature at 6 pm} \\]\n\nOr, in algebraic form:\n\n\\[ t - 11 = 84 \\]\n\nThis corresponds to option D. To solve for \\(t\\), you would add 11 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ t = 84 + 11 \\]\n\\[ t = 95 \\]\n\nTherefore, the temperature at 6 pm was 95 degrees Fahrenheit."
