The performance by the homeowner would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the roofer.\nC. The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be constructive concurrent conditions.\nD. The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.\n"

The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be constructive concurrent conditions.\n\nExplanation:\n- A constructive condition precedent requires one party to perform an act before the other party has any obligation to act. This does not fit the situation described, as the homeowner's payment obligation is concurrent with the roofer's work, not preceding it.\n- An implied condition subsequent typically means that if one party fails to fulfill their obligations after the agreement has been made, the other party may have grounds to terminate the contract. This also doesn't apply here, as both parties' obligations are concurrent and not tied to post-agreement actions.\n- Constructive concurrent conditions mean that both parties' obligations arise simultaneously and must be performed at the same time. In this case, the homeowner's promise to pay $10,000 is concurrent with the roofer's agreement to complete the work within 30 days.\n- D. The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral, is incorrect unless there is a specific legal requirement for the contract to be in writing (which is not stated in the question and varies by jurisdiction. However, in many places, contracts for services like home repair can be enforceable even if they are oral."
