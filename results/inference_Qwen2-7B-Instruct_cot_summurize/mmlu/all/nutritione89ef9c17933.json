The plasma activity of alkaline phosphatase\n\nVitamin D deficiency can lead to increased activity of enzymes like alkaline phosphatase as the body tries to compensate for the lack of vitamin D in maintaining bone health. This is part of the body's response to decreased bone mineral density and bone turnover associated with vitamin D deficiency.\n\nThe other options listed ( prothrombin and preprothrombin, are related to blood clotting mechanisms and are not directly affected by vitamin D levels. Acid phosphatase activity is generally not influenced by vitamin D status either."
