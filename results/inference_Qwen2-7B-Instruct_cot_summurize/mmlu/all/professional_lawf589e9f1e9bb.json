In this case, the court might find that the bathroom work constitutes an \"equivalent amount\" for the completed portion of the agreement.\n\nTherefore, the most probable outcome based on the options given would be:\n\nC. Charlie in an amount of $10,000 if the court finds the contract divisible and the $10,000 is an equivalent amount for the completed portion of the agreement.\n\nThis assumes that Charlie has fulfilled his obligations as per the terms of the contract regarding the bathroom remodel, and the contract allows for partial completion payments or compensation upon completion of specific tasks."
