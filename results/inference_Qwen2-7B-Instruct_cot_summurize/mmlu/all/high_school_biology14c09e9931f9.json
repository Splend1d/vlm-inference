Cells undergo apoptosis in response to various signals, such as when they are no longer needed, when they are damaged beyond repair, or when there are too many mutations accumulating that could lead to cancer. In plants, apoptosis can indeed be a defense mechanism against parasitic infections, so option D is correct."
