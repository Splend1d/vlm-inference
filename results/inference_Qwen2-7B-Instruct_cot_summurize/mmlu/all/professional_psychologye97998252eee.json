It adjusts the group means on the dependent variable (DV) for differences in the covariate. The \"EV\" here refers to the \"Explanatory Variable,\" which could also be referred to as a \"Confounding Variable\" or \"Control Variable.\" This type of analysis is useful when you want to statistically control for the effect of one or more continuous variables that might influence the relationship between your independent variable (IV) and your dependent variable.\n\nFor instance, if you're studying the effect of a training program on test scores but suspect that prior knowledge may affect those scores, you could use ANCOVA to statistically control for the effect of prior knowledge (the covariate), thus isolating the effect of the training program (the IV) on the test scores (the DV)."
