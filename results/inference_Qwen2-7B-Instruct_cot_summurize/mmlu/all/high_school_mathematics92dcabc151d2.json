                    "text": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD of $2^{1001} - 1$ and $2^{1012} - 1$, we can use properties of exponents and the Euclidean algorithm, but in this case, a more insightful approach involves recognizing patterns in powers of two minus one.\n\nFirst, observe that $2^{1012} - 1$ can be rewritten as $2^{1001+11} - 1$. This can be further broken down using the difference of squares formula:\n\n\\[2^{1012} - 1 = ( 2^{1001} \\cdot (2^{11}) - 1\\]\n\nThis expression suggests a relationship to the original terms when considering the properties of numbers of the form $2^n - 1$.\n\nThe key insight comes from realizing that if we have two consecutive powers of two minus one, say $2^m - 1$ and $2^n - 1$, where $n > m$, then their GCD is actually quite straightforward to determine. The reason is that any number of the form $2^k - 1$ divides evenly into any larger power of two minus one, because $2^k - 1$ can be factored into $(2^k)^r - 1^r$, which is a difference of powers and thus divisible by $2^k - 1$ for any positive integer $r$.\n\nGiven our specific case:\n- $2^{1001} - 1$ is of the form $2^k - 1$\n- $2^{1012} - 1$ is $2^{1001} \\cdot 2^{11} - 1$, which is also of the form $2^k - 1$ with $k=1001 + 11 = 1012$\n\nTherefore, the GCD of $2^{1001} - 1$ and $2^{1012} - 1$ is simply $2^k - 1$ where $k$ is the smaller exponent in this context, which is $2^{1001} - 1$ itself. However, the question is asking for the GCD, not the value of either term.\n\nTo clarify the answer based on the insight provided:\n- We know that $2^{1001} - 1$ divides evenly into $2^{1012} - 1$.\n- Thus, the GCD must be a factor of both, but given the structure described, it's clear that the largest such divisor that fits within the context of these expressions is related directly to the smaller exponent, which leads us to understand that the GCD is essentially tied to understanding the factors of numbers of the form $2^n - 1$.\n\nThe correct answer, considering the explanation and insight, aligning with the options provided, is:\n\n**B. 2049**\n\nThis conclusion is based on recognizing the pattern and properties of numbers of the form $2^n - 1$ and understanding how they relate to each other, especially when considering the divisors between them. The direct calculation or exhaustive method isn't necessary here due to the specific nature of these numbers and their relationships."
