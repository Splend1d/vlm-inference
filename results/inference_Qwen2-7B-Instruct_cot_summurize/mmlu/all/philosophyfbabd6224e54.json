This perspective counters the notion that virtue or vice is predetermined or outside of an individual's control. Therefore, Aristotle would likely agree with option A: \"virtue is in our power, and so is vice.\" However, it's important to note that Aristotle also believed that vice could be overcome by the cultivation of virtue, suggesting a certain level of agency over both aspects.\n\nIn the context of Stoic philosophy, which influenced Aristotle's thought, virtues such as wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance are considered part of what is within our control (or 'daimon' ( while external events are considered outside our control. This alignss more closely with a nuanced interpretation of option A, emphasizing that while we can choose to act virtuously, we cannot necessarily control the consequences of our actions or external circumstances.\n\nSo, based on Aristotle's philosophy, the closest answer would be A, acknowledging that virtue and vice are within our power to exert. However, it's crucial to understand that Aristotle's views evolved throughout his life, and interpretations of his works vary among scholars."
