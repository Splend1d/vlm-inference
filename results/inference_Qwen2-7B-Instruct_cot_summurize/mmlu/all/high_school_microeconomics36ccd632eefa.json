Total utility increases as more units of a good are consumed, but at a decreasing rate. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction gained by consuming one more unit of the good.\n\nIn the context of maximizing total utility, a consumer should continue to purchase sardines until the point where the marginal utility of the next unit is equal to zero. This means the consumer has reached the point where the last unit of sardines does not add any further satisfaction, and thus, no more sardines should be purchased beyond this point to maximize overall satisfaction."
