Wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiving opioids to a patient in the hospital care center without a proper medical prescription or under circumstances that could be considered harmful or inappropriate is clearly morally wrong, especially if done without professional oversight. This action could potentially lead to harm, addiction, or overdose, which violates ethical and legal standards in healthcare.\n\nOn the other hand, keeping a prohibited item like a knife in one's pocket when boarding a plane is not necessarily morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. It is illegal and can be seen as a violation of airport security rules, but it does not necessarily involve harm to others or unethical intentions. The act is more appropriately categorized as a legal infraction rather than a moral wrongdoing."
