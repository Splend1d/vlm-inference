This is because if \\(z^N = 1\\), then \\((z_1 \\cdot z_2)^N = z_1^N \\cdot z_2^N = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\\).\n\n2. **Associativity**: Multiplication of complex numbers is associative, i.e., for any three nth roots of unity \\(z_1\\), \\(z_2\\), and \\(z_3\\), \\((z_1 \\cdot z_2) \\cdot z_3 = z_1 \\cdot ( (z_2 \\cdot z_3)\\).\n\n3. **Identity Element**: The number 1 is an nth root of unity (since \\(1^N = 1\\), and it acts as the multiplicative identity in this set.\n\n4. **Inverse Elements**: Every nth root of unity has an inverse that is also an nth root of unity. Specifically, if \\(z\\) is an nth root of unity, then \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) is also an nth root of unity, because if \\(z^N = 1\\), then \\((\\frac{1}{z})^N = (\\frac{1}{z^N}) = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\\).\n\n5. **Commutativity**: The multiplication of complex numbers is commutative, meaning for any two nth roots of unity \\(z_1\\) and \\(z_2\\), \\(z_1 \\cdot z_2 = z_2 \\cdot z_1\\).\n\nTherefore, the set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication of complex numbers forms an abelian group.\n\nSo the correct answer is **D. abelian group**."
