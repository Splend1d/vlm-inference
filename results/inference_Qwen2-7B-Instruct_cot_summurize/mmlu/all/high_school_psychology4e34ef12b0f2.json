Crystallized intelligence\n\nCrystallized intelligence refers to accumulated knowledge and skills that an individual has acquired over their lifetime, which they can apply to new situations. This includes vocabulary, general knowledge, and the ability to use verbal reasoning. As a person ages, they typically gain more life experience and knowledge, leading to an increase in crystallized intelligence.\n\nVisual acuity may decrease with age due to conditions like presbyopia (ability to reason speedily and fluid intelligence may also decline as these involve cognitive functions that can be affected by aging. However, the rate of decline varies among individuals."
