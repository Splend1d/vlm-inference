The predictable rate of mutation results in ongoing variability in a gene pool.\n\nThis statement is actually one of the reasons why the frequency of mutation might appear to be low when observed over time. The predictable rate of mutation contributes to ongoing variability in a gene pool, as it continually introduces new genetic variations into populations. This is not a reason for the frequency of mutation to seem low. \n\nThe other options represent plausible reasons why the frequency of mutations might not be immediately apparent:\n\nA. Mutations that result in recessive alleles may not be expressed in heterozygous individuals, making them less likely to be detected in a population.\n\nB. Unfavorable mutations may lead to reduced fitness and thus fewer offspring, which can prevent their propagation through generations.\n\nC. Mutations that cause significant negative phenotypic changes are can be detrimental enough to reduce an individual's reproductive success, leading to removal of those mutations from the gene pool."
