These factors can affect each family member differently, leading to varying rates of adjustment. Adolescents, in particular, might struggle more with the transition as they navigate their own identity development, peer relationships, and academic pressures. This can lead to conflicts when the adolescent's needs for autonomy clash with the mother's ( or other caregivers' desire to maintain control and protect them, especially in an environment where everything feels uncertain and new. Therefore, it's common for serious conflicts to arise from their differing rates of adjustment to the new environment."
