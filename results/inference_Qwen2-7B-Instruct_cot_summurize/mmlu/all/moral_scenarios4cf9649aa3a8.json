This action is clearly morally wrong and illegal, as it involves taking advantage of someone who is unable to give informed consent due to their condition. It violates ethical principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence.\n\nScenario 2 involves a 14-year-old purchasing alcohol from a liquor store. While this might be considered a legal issue depending on the local laws (since the age of majority for purchasing alcohol varies by state or country, typically ranging from 18 to 21 years old), it is generally not viewed as a moral wrongdoing. The act itself does not inherently cause harm to others or violate any significant moral principles unless the intent is to consume the alcohol illegally or under the influence, which would then be a matter of personal responsibility and potential legal consequences rather than a moral failing."
