Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nThis is because reviewing cutoff bank statements can help identify any transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date but should have been included in the financial statements. This ensures that the financial statements reflect all relevant events that have occurred up until the date they were issued, providing a more accurate representation of the company's financial position. \n\nInspecting inventory items ( (A) is related to inventory accounting and may not necessarily be a part of the auditor's procedures on subsequent events. Testing internal controls ( (B) is typically done during the audit process itself, not specifically focusing on subsequent events. Comparing interim financial statements ( (D) might involve assessing trends or consistency, but it does not specifically address identifying and evaluating subsequent events that occurred after the balance sheet date."
