The man signed an agreement with the facility that he would attend weekly classes at the facility for six months and would pay $500 on the first of each month. Upon signing the contract, the man made his first payment of $500 and attended the weekly class sessions. On the first day of the second month, the man once again made his $500 payment and continued to attend the session. At the start of the third month, the man told the director of the facility's accounting office that he was having financial difficulties, and asked for an extension. The director agreed to permit the man to attend classes while the man tried to get the money to pay the facility. One week later, the man received a letter from the facility informing him that he would be barred from attending any further classes unless the next $500 payment was made. Is the facility justified in refusing to permit the man to attend classes?\n\nA. No, because by permitting the man to attend classes without having paid the third monthly installment, the facility waived its right to have that installment fee paid on time.\nB. No, because the facility's allowing the man to attend classes without paying the third monthly installment created an implied contract, thus permitting him to complete the classes without advance payment of the installments.\nC. Yes, because the man's failure to make the third monthly installment payment constituted an anticipatory breach.\nD. Yes, because there was no consideration to extinguish the payment of the third monthly installment fee, which was a material part of the contract.\n"

Yes, because the man's failure to make the third monthly installment payment constituted an anticipatory breach.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the man entered into a contract with the facility where he agreed to pay $500 on the first of each month for six months as part of his enrollment in a creative writing course. After making the first two payments and attending classes, when he informed the facility of his financial difficulties and requested an extension, the facility agreed to allow him to continue attending classes while he sought to resolve his financial issues. This agreement implies that the facility forgave or deferred the payment for the third month, which is considered a breach of the original contract terms. \n\nThe facility's subsequent letter informing the man that he would be barred from attending further classes unless the third installment was paid suggests that the facility viewed the man's request for an extension as a formal breach of the contract. An anticipatory breach occurs when one party indicates that they will not fulfill their contractual obligations before the due date, effectively making the contract voidable by the other party. In this case, the facility's decision to bar the man from attending classes until the payment is made can be seen as a response to the anticipatory breach, as it was a clear indication that the man would not meet his contractual obligation to pay the third installment on time."
