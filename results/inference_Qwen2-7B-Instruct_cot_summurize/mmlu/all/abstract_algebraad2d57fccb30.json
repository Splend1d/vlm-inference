The product set \\(HK\\) consists of all elements of the form \\(hk\\) for \\(h \\in H\\) and \\(k \\in K\\). For \\(HK\\) to be a subgroup of \\(G\\), it must satisfy the subgroup criteria: closure, identity, inverses, and associativity ( (which is inherited from \\(G\\)). Given that \\(H\\) is normal in \\(G\\), we have for any \\(g \\in G\\) and \\(h \\in H\\), \\(gHg^{-1} = H\\). This implies that for any \\(k \\in K\\), \\(gkg^{-1} \\in K\\) since \\(K\\) is a subgroup. Therefore, if \\(H\\) is normal, \\(gHg^{-1} = H\\) for all \\(g \\in G\\), which means that \\(gH = Hg\\). This property ensures that \\(HK\\) is closed under the operation of \\(G\\), and the other subgroup properties follow. Hence, **Statement 1** is true.\n\n**Statement 2**: \"All groups of order \\(p^2\\), where \\(p\\) is prime, are Abelian.\"\n\nThis statement is also true. A group of order \\(p^2\\) has a specific structure due to Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group. Since \\(p\\) is prime, the only divisors of \\(p^2\\) are are \\(1, p,\\) and \\(p^2\\). This implies that any non-trivial proper subgroup of such a group must have order \\(p\\), making it cyclic ( as the only groups of prime order are cyclic. \n\nGiven that the group can have at most two distinct subgroups (the trivial group, itself, and one cyclic group of order \\(p\\), the group must either be cyclic itself (which automatically makes it Abelian) or have a structure where its non-identity elements commute with each other ( because the only way to distribute these elements into a product that respects the group operation without forming a larger cyclic subgroup ( is if they all commute. This is due to the fact that there cannot be a non-commuting element without forming a larger subgroup, which contradicts the given order. Hence, **Statement 2** is true.\n\n**Answer**: A.
