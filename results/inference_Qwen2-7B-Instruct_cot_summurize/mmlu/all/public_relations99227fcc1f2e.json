However, according to historical trends and general growth patterns in the consulting industry, it's plausible that the number of practitioners working in consultancies in the UK could have quadrupled since 25 years ago (assuming strong growth and consistent demand for consultancy services over that period. \n\nTo confirm the exact percentage increase, you would need to consult official labor market statistics or reports from relevant professional bodies or government agencies that track employment trends in the consulting sector. These sources typically provide detailed analysis and accurate data based on the latest available information.\n\nTherefore, without specific data, the most accurate answer among the options provided is D. Quadrupled, assuming significant growth and no substantial downturns in the consulting industry during that time frame."
