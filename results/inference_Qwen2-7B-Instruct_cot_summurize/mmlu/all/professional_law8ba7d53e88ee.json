Two days after the soybean contract was made, the buyer and the seller entered into another contract under which the buyer agreed to purchase 10,000 bushels of wheat from the seller at market price. Before the time for delivery of the soybeans, the seller notified the buyer that it would not deliver the wheat because the seller's wheat supplier had refused to extend additional credit to the seller and therefore the seller had no wheat available for the buyer. Which of the following statements best describes the effect of the seller's repudiation of the wheat contract on the buyer's rights under the soybean contract?\n\nA. It gives the buyer the right to demand assurances that the seller will perform the soybean contract.\nB. It gives the buyer the right to terminate the soybean contract, because of the doctrine of soybean contract, because of the doctrine of dependent covenants.\nC. It gives the buyer the right to terminate the soybean contract, because the buyer does not have to deal with a party that breaches a contract.\nD. It has no effect on the buyer's rights, because the two contracts are entirely separate.\n"

It gives the buyer the right to terminate the soybean contract, because of the doctrine of dependent covenants.\n\nIn contract law, when there are are two or more contracts between the same parties and they are interrelated or dependent on each other ( this situation is referred to as \"dependent covenants\". If one party breaches one of the contracts, it may affect the performance of the other contracts. In this scenario, since the seller breached the wheat contract by failing to provide the wheat, it can be argued that the seller is unable to fulfill its obligations under the soybean contract. As a result, the buyer may have the right to terminate the soybean contract based on the doctrine of dependent covenants. This means the buyer could argue that the seller's breach of the wheat contract makes it impossible for the seller to fulfill their obligations under the soybean contract, thus allowing the buyer to terminate the soybean contract."
