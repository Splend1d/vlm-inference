It further provides that the maximum punishment increases to 10 years in prison if the defendant possessed a deadly weapon during the assault. The statute designates the deadly weapon element as a sentencing factor. A defendant charged with assault has pleaded not guilty and has requested a jury trial. The prosecutor has announced that she will be seeking a 10- year sentence based on the defendant's alleged possession of a deadly weapon. What finding regarding the defendant's possession of a deadly weapon is necessary for the court to impose a 10-year sentence?\n\nA. A judicial finding by a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. A jury finding by a preponderance of the evidence.\nC. A judicial finding beyond a reasonable doubt.\nD. A jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt.\n"

A jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn criminal cases, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crimes they are charged with. If the additional charge or sentencing factor (in this case, possession of a deadly weapon during the assault - leads to a higher punishment, it would also need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This is because the increase in punishment is essentially an enhancement of the crime, making it a more serious offense, which requires the same high standard of proof as the original crime."
