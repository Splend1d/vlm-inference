Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley, suggests that dreams occur as the brain attempts to interpret and give meaning to the random electrical impulses generated in the brainstem during sleep. This theory posits that the brainstem sends these impulses up to the cerebral cortex, which then tries to \"make sense\" of them, resulting in dream content."
