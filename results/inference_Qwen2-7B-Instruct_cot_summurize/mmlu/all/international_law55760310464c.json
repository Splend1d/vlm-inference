International tribunals share some, but not all, of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts.\n\nInternational tribunals do indeed operate under certain principles that mirror those found in national court systems, such as the requirement for legal process and due process rights for parties involved. However, they also have unique aspects that reflect the international context in which they function. For example, their jurisdiction might be more limited or defined by the specific terms of the treaty or agreement that established them, rather than being universally applicable like in national courts. Additionally, international tribunals often face challenges related to jurisdictional disputes, enforcement of decisions, and the sovereignty of states, which are are not typically concerns in national court systems. They may also operate under a different legal framework, including customary international law and international treaties, which can vary significantly from national law."
