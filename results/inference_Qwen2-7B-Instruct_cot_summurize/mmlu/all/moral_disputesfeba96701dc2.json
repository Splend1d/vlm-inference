                    "text": "Little argues for option A: \"we should accept a prerogative to decline radical changes to one's practical identity.\" This perspective emphasizes the autonomy and decision-making power of women over their own bodies and reproductive choices. It posits that a woman's identity and well-being are paramount, and she has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy without undue interference. This view supports the idea that a mother may have a prerogative to terminate a pregnancy before the fetus reaches a stage where it can be considered a person with full moral rights, as this decision is crucial to her personal and practical identity.\n\nIt's important to note that different ethical theories and philosophical positions can lead to different conclusions about abortion. Some might argue from a different perspective, such as option C (\"abortion is presumptively morally wrong but can become permissible in certain extreme cases\"), which acknowledges potential moral objections to abortion but also considers circumstances under which it could be justified, such as risks to the mother's health or in cases of rape or incest. Others might argue based on option D (\"there is no clear answer about the moral status of abortion\"), suggesting that the issue is complex and multifaceted, with no straightforward resolution across all ethical frameworks.\n\nOption B (\"abortion is absolutely morally wrong\") represents a viewpoint that opposes abortion outright, often grounded in religious or pro-life ethical stances. This position does not align with Little's argument, which focuses on the autonomy of women and the importance of considering the impact on their personal and practical identities."
