At an intersection, she could not stop for a red light and went into the intersection, where she slipped off the bike. While attempting to remount it, a car coming into the intersection with a green light ran her over, causing severe injuries. The car driver was distracted by his cell phone and received a careless driving ticket from the police. The woman filed a claim for damages, asserting that the car driver was negligent per se. She claimed that a finding of negligence per se prevented the driver from asserting comparative negligence under a state statute. Will the trial court likely grant the woman's motion to preclude the man's attempted comparative negligence defense?\n\nA. Yes, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, which abrogates the comparative negligence law.\nB. Yes, because negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence against the driver and it cannot be modified or rebutted.\nC. No, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute.\nD. No, because she entered the intersection knowing it was a red light, thereby putting herself voluntarily and knowingly in danger, and she assumed the risk.\n"

No, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute.\n\nNegligence per se refers to a situation where a person violates a statute or regulation designed to protect a class of individuals that includes the plaintiff. When a violation of such a statute occurs, the court presumes that the defendant was negligent. However, this presumption does not automatically bar the defendant from presenting evidence of comparative negligence. Comparative negligence allows for the apportionment of fault among parties involved in an accident, considering their respective roles in causing the incident.\n\nIn this case, the woman's claim that negligence per se prevents the driver from asserting comparative negligence would not likely be granted by the trial court. The driver's potential comparative negligence (due to being distracted by his cell phone - can still be considered in determining the extent of liability. The fact that the woman may have been running a red light does not necessarily absolve the driver of any responsibility if he was also negligent (e.g., by being distracted."
