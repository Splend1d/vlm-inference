Port States generally do not enforce their criminal jurisdiction over crimes that do not infringe their customs laws or disrupt peace and public order.\n\nUnder international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), port states have the authority to exercise criminal jurisdiction over foreign vessels within their ports. However, this authority is not unlimited. Port states typically have jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes committed on foreign vessels if those crimes affect the port state's public order, national security, or its customs laws. This includes offenses like piracy, terrorism, and certain types of pollution. The enforcement of criminal jurisdiction also depends on the specific circumstances and the type of crime involved. For less serious offenses or crimes that do not impact the port state's interests significantly, the port state may choose not to exercise jurisdiction, especially if the offense is covered by another state's laws or if there is an agreement between the port state and the flag state of the vessel."
