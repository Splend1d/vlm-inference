It seems like business is slow for the pizza place owner and he eyes up his competitor, the burger man, as the reason. The pizza owner starts to make false statements about the burger restaurant and its inferior ingredients, which he says have been causing ptomaine poisoning in some of the customers. When burger joint owner loses customers and business income to pizza place owner, can he sue for conversion?\n\nA.

Yes, conversion is an intentional tort and the pizza owner acted intentionally to convert and did convert part of the burger business.\nC. No, because conversion consists of appropriating another's real property.\nD. No, because there was no interference with his ownership or right of possession to his personal property.\n"

Yes, conversion is an intentional tort and the pizza owner acted intentionally to convert and did convert part of the burger business.\n\nIn this scenario, the pizza owner's actions of making false statements about the burger restaurant and its ingredients can be considered defamation, which is a type of intentional tort. If these statements led to a loss of customers and business income for the burger restaurant owner, it could be argued that the pizza owner converted a portion of the burger restaurant's business by interfering with its right to peaceful enjoyment and disrupting its business activities. Conversion typically involves taking someone else's personal property without permission, but in cases involving business disruption, it can also refer to the unauthorized interference with the use and enjoyment of a business or property. In this case, the pizza owner's actions might be seen as an attempt to \"convert\" or take away a portion of the burger restaurant's business through defamation and misinformation."
