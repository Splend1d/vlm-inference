I only**.\n\nTransmission of knowledge through symbolic culture typically involves the use of language, symbols, and cultural artifacts to convey information or skills. In the case of the macaque monkey (I), this behavior is more instinctual or learned through trial and error rather than symbolic cultural transmission. The other examples (II and III) involve humans who use language, rules, and rituals to transmit knowledge, which aligns with the concept of symbolic culture."
