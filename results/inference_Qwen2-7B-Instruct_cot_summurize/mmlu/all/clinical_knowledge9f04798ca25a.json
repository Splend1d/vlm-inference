A moon face and a buffalo hump are characteristic of the disease.\n\nCushing's syndrome, also known as hypercortisolism, occurs when the body is exposed to high levels of the hormone cortisol for an extended period. This can be due to an excess production by the adrenal glands or an overstimulation of these glands from a tumor in the pituitary gland. The condition is characterized by a number of symptoms, including:\n\n- **Moon face**: This refers to the round, red cheeks and a full, puffy appearance of the face.\n- **Buffalo hump**: A fatty deposit that appears on the upper back.\n- **Central obesity**: Excess fat accumulation around the waist.\n- **Skin changes**: Stretch marks, easy bruising, thinning skin, and purple striae (.\n- **Muscle weakness**: Often due to muscle wasting.\n- **Psychological effects**: Mood swings, anxiety, or depression.\n- **Metabolic changes**: Increased blood sugar levels, high blood pressure, and osteoporosis.\n\nIt is important to note that osteoporosis can indeed be a feature of Cushing's syndrome, which contradicts option C. Therefore, while not all options directly state a fact about Cushing's syndrome, option D correctly identifies two common physical characteristics associated with the condition."
