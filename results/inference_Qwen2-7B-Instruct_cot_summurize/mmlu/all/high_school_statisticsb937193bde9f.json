We'll first calculate the z-score for 225 calories, which tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean ( 225 is.\n\nThe formula for calculating z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( X \\) is the value we're interested in ( here it's 225 calories,\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{225 - 210}{10} = \\frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \\]\n\nSo, 225 calories is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nNext, we want to find the probability that a candy bar has more than 225 calories, which corresponds to the area under the curve to the right of \\( z = 1.5 \\).\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a normal distribution function, we find that the area to the left of \\( z = 1.5 \\) is approximately 0.9332. This means that about 93.32% of the candy bars have less than or equal to 225 calories.\n\nTo find the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories, we subtract this value from 1:\n\n\\[ 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668 \\]\n\nTherefore, about 6.68% of the candy bars contain more than 225 calories.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 6.28%**."
