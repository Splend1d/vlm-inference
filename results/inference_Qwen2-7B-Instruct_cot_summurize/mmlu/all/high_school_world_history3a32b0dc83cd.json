                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\nQuestions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.\nThe Slave Trade\nAll of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for \"black Africans\"]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nHow was the Arab trade in Africans different from the Atlantic slave trade?\n\nA. Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion.\nB. Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did.\nC. Slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male.\nD. Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the information provided in the passage, the Arab trade in Africans differed from the Atlantic slave trade in several aspects:\n\nA. Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion.\n\nThis statement is not accurate based on the information provided. The passage does not mention any religious motivations for either the Arab slave trade or the Atlantic slave trade. Both were driven by economic interests.\n\nB. Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did.\n\nThis statement is also incorrect. The passage does not provide information about the prospects of eventual liberty for slaves in either trade. It simply describes the conditions under which slaves were acquired and the prices they were sold for, without discussing their future status.\n\nC. Slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male.\n\nThis statement is not supported by the information provided. The passage lists prices for various types of slaves\u2014adult males, adult females, adolescents, young males, and young females\u2014indicating that both sexes were traded by both the Arab and Atlantic slave traders. There is no specific mention of sex ratios or preferences between the two trades.\n\nD. Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade.\n\nThis statement cannot be confirmed or denied based on the information provided. The passage does not contain any details about the life spans of the slaves involved in either trade.\n\nNone of the options provided accurately reflects a difference between the Arab trade in Africans and the Atlantic slave trade based on the information given. The passage focuses on the methods of acquiring slaves and the pricing, rather than differences in motivation, prospects of freedom, sex ratios, or life spans."
