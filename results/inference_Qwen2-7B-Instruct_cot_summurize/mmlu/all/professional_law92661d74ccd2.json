Under the law, applicants for certification must attend a monthlong course, pass a test, and pay a fee of $1,000. The stated purpose of the law is to \"promote uniformity in the methods of ski instruction at the state's ski areas.\" Shortly before the law's enactment, when the state did not require certification of ski instructors, a woman moved to the state intending to find employment as a ski instructor. The woman had been a ski instructor in another state for many years. But since her move, even though ski resorts in the state have found her to be highly qualified, no resort will offer her a contract for employment as a ski instructor because she has not received the required state certification. As applied to the woman, does the state certification requirement constitute a violation of the contracts clause?\n\nA. No, because her ability to contract for employment with the state is not being impaired.\nB. No, because she has no existing contract that is being impaired.\nC. Yes, because, as applied to an otherwise qualified ski instructor, the requirement is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\nD. Yes, because the requirement substantially impairs her ability to contract for employment in the absence of an important government objective.\n"

Yes, because, as applied to an otherwise qualified ski instructor, the requirement is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n\nThe Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from passing laws impairing the obligation of contracts. In this scenario, the state certification requirement indirectly affects the woman's ability to enter into a contract for employment as a ski instructor. Even though she has not entered into a formal contract yet, her ability to do so is significantly impacted by the new law. If the law is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest, it could be considered an impairment of her contractual rights.\n\nIn order to determine if the law constitutes a violation of the Contracts Clause, courts would likely consider:\n\n1. Whether the law impairs existing contracts: Since the woman does not have a signed employment contract, this factor might not directly apply. However, the law potentially impacts her future ability to enter into such contracts.\n\n2. The nature of the impairment: If the law disproportionately affects her ability to secure employment as a ski instructor due to the certification requirement, it could be seen as a significant impairment.\n\n3. The existence of an important government objective: The state's interest in promoting uniformity in ski instruction could be considered legitimate, but it needs to be balanced against the impact on the woman's ability to contract.\n\n4. Whether the means chosen are are reasonable: If there is no clear connection between the certification requirement and the goal of ensuring uniformity in ski instruction, or if alternative means could achieve the same goal with less impact on the woman's ability to contract, this could weigh against the law's constitutionality.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to be the most appropriate answer, suggesting that the state certification requirement could potentially violate the Contracts Clause as it is applied to the woman."
