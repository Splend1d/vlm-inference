Given that the husband in this scenario has low self-esteem, is overweight, and is chronically depressed, he would likely prefer:\n\nC. con\ufb01rm his negative self-evaluations.\n\nThis is because such confirmation aligns with his existing self-perception, providing him with a sense of consistency and predictability in his self-image. It's important to note that while self-verification theory can provide insights into how people might react to certain feedback, individual responses can vary based on other factors such as the context, relationship dynamics, and personal resilience."
