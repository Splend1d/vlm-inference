Discussing a client's information with unauthorized individuals, such as family members or friends, without their consent can violate ethical guidelines and potentially harm the therapeutic relationship. If the mother wishes to understand more about her son's progress or how she can support him, it would be appropriate to refer her to speak directly with the client or arrange a consultation during one of the scheduled appointments."
