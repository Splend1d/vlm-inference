At trial, the court has allowed the plaintiff to introduce the deposition testimony of a witness, now deceased, that he was with the plaintiff at the time of the incident. The defendant now seeks to impeach the testimony of the witness with his 13-year-old conviction for burglary (for which he served 18 months in prison) for breaking into the home of a neighbor while she was away and taking some of her valuable jewelry. Should the court allow evidence of the conviction?\n\nA. No, because the witness did not testify at trial.\nB. No, unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\nC. Yes, because prior convictions are probative to impeach the witness's character for truthfulness.\nD. Yes, because the crime involved an act of dishonesty.\n"

No, unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 609 provides guidance on the admissibility of convictions for the purpose of impeachment. It states that a conviction may be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of the conviction \"substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\" The rule also lists certain types of convictions that are generally not admissible, such as those involving dishonesty or false statement, unless they relate directly to the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of the witness. However, this list is not exhaustive, and other convictions may be considered under the balancing test provided by Rule 609.\n\nIn this case, since the witness is deceased, there is no direct testimony to impeach. However, the court could consider the relevance of the conviction to the witness's character for truthfulness. The defendant would need to demonstrate that the probative value of the conviction, given the specifics of the case and the circumstances surrounding the conviction, outweighs any potential prejudice. The court would weigh these factors to determine whether admitting the conviction is in the interests of justice."
