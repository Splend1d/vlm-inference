This leads to a reduced production of alpha-globin chains, which are necessary for the formation of normal red blood cells. There are several types of deletions that can occur, including deletion of a single gene (\u03b1-0 thalassaemia, deletion of two genes (\u03b1+ thalassaemia, and deletion of all four genes leading to a severe form of the disease."
