If either of the two conditions you've mentioned holds true, the argument can become fallacious:\n\nA. If the envisioned results of the action or practice under consideration turn out not to be bad, it undermines the premise of the slippery slope argument. If the supposed negative outcomes do not materialize, the argument's prediction fails, making the slippery slope fallacy invalid.\n\nB. If the central idea of the argument\u2014that the action or practice under consideration will lead us down a path to disaster\u2014turns out not to be plausible, it directly challenges the logic behind the slippery slope argument. If the likelihood of the chain of events leading to disaster is questionable, the argument loses its validity.\n\nTherefore, either condition (A or B being met could make the slippery-slope argument fallacious, as they both challenge the core assumptions and predictions made within such an argument."
