Vaccine has been developed\n\nParoviruses, including viruses like canine parvovirus and feline panleukopenia virus, have indeed seen significant reductions in disease due to the development of vaccines. Vaccination plays a crucial role in controlling and preventing outbreaks of these diseases by stimulating an immune response in animals without causing the disease itself. This helps protect not only individual animals but also entire populations, reducing the spread of the virus.\n\nOptions A, C, and D can help in controlling the spread of the virus or reducing the impact of an outbreak, but they do not specifically target the parovirus family for reduction of disease:\n\nA. Transfusion blood is screened: This practice reduces the risk of transmitting diseases through blood transfusions, but it does not specifically target paroviruses.\n\nC. A range of new antivirals: While antiviral medications can be effective against some viral infections, developing new antivirals is a complex process that may not be as efficient or rapid as vaccine development for targeting specific virus families like paroviruses.\n\nD. Social distancing: This measure helps reduce the spread of many infectious diseases by limiting contact between individuals, but it is not specific to paroviruses and does not directly target them for reduction."
