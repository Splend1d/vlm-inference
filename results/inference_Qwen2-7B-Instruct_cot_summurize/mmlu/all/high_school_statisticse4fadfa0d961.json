Each of the five managers will be asked to place the 200 time cards of their respective employees in a bag, shake them up, and randomly draw out six names. The six names from each plant will be put together to make up the sample. Will this method result in a simple random sample of the 1000 employees?\n\nA. Yes, because every employee has the same chance of being selected.\nB. Yes, because every plant is equally represented.\nC. Yes, because this is an example of stratified sampling, which is a special case of simple random sampling.\nD. No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n"

No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n\nThis method does not ensure that every possible group of 30 employees has an equal chance of being selected. While it ensures that every employee within their respective plant has an equal chance of being selected ( since each manager is randomly selecting 6 names out of 200, it does not guarantee that any arbitrary group of 30 employees has an equal chance of selection across all plants. \n\nThe method described here is more akin to cluster sampling rather than simple random sampling or stratified sampling. In this scenario, the clusters are the assembly plants themselves, and the samples are drawn from these clusters. \n\nIn cluster sampling, the goal is to select clusters at random, then include all individuals within those clusters in the sample. This can be efficient when the cost of sampling each individual is high, but it may introduce bias if the clusters are not homogeneous or if there are are significant differences between the clusters.\n\nIn contrast, simple random sampling involves selecting individuals directly without any grouping, ensuring each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups (strata, then taking a simple random sample from each stratum.\n\nTherefore, the provided method does not meet the criteria for simple random sampling or stratified sampling, and thus cannot be considered a simple random sample of the 1000 employees."
