                    "text": "A state imposes a graduated income tax upon net income calculated under federal law. Section 22 of the city's reform act of 2010, which is to become effective on January 1, 2010, provides: \"Any parent or guardian financially responsible for the education of his ward may claim a direct tax credit against his income tax liability equal to the amount of tuition of a child or children of high school age who does not attend a public high school. \" Other provisions define \"tuition\" very broadly but limit the credit to tuition paid to schools meeting the educational requirements as determined by the state. On December 1, 2009, the parents of two students who attend a public high school in the state sue for a declaratory judgment and injunction in federal court, claiming that Section 22 violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment. The federal court will most likely\n\nA. dismiss the action, because the suit involves a political question.\nB. dismiss the action, because the plaintiffs lack standing as taxpayers.\nC. dismiss the action, because the issues are not ripe.\nD. dismiss the action, because the issues being litigated are moot.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. dismiss the action, because the issues are not ripe.\n\nIn this case, the federal court would likely dismiss the action based on the doctrine of ripeness. Ripeness is a requirement for a court to have jurisdiction over a case, meaning that the dispute must be sufficiently mature to warrant judicial resolution. It ensures that courts do not intervene in disputes that are not yet fully developed or where the parties' rights have not yet been affected in a concrete way.\n\nGiven that the statute (Section 22) is set to become effective on January 1, 2010, but the lawsuit was filed on December 1, 2009, it is possible that the plaintiffs have not yet been directly affected by the legislation. They might not have incurred any tuition expenses for their children attending a public high school yet, nor have they faced any potential tax implications under the new law. Therefore, the court may find that the issue is not ripe for adjudication at this time, as the plaintiffs's interests have not been sufficiently impacted by the statute to justify a legal challenge.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and the actual outcome could depend on various factors, including the specific legal arguments presented by the parties and the court's interpretation of the relevant laws and precedents."
