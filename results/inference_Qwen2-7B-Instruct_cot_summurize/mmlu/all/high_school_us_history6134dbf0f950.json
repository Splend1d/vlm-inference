He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nHow did President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the Civil War?\n\nA. The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.\nB. The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.\nC. President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves.\nD. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n"

The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, had significant implications for the Civil War. It declared that all slaves in the Confederate states \"then in rebellion\" were to be set free. This proclamation shifted the focus of the war from preserving the Union alone to also include the goal of abolishing slavery. \n\nWhile option D accurately reflects this change in focus, it's important to clarify that the proclamation did not immediately lead to Great Britain joining the fight ( (option B), nor did it cause President Jefferson Davis to vow massive resistance to freeing the slaves ( (option C). The British government's decision to remain neutral and not intervene in the conflict was influenced by a variety of factors, including the desire to avoid direct conflict with the United States and the hope that the Confederacy would rejoin the Union once the war ended.\n\nAs for President Davis, while he certainly opposed the abolition of slavery, the Emancipation Proclamation did not directly impact his policy decisions or his stance on the war. The Confederacy continued to pursue its goals of state sovereignty and the preservation of slavery, regardless of the Union's new war aim."
