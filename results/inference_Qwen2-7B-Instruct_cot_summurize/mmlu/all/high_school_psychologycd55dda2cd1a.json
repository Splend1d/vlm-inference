This is a common method to evaluate the reliability of a psychological test. \n\nA. Checking for outliers would involve identifying extreme scores that may not be representative of the typical performance of the participants.\nB. Standardizing the test typically involves ensuring that the test measures what it is intended to measure consistently across different populations and conditions, but this does not directly involve re-administering the test to the same group.\nC. Looking to see if the mean level of perfectionism has changed could indicate an interest in the construct validity over time, but the act of re-administering the test to the same group is more directly related to assessing reliability."
