This is because these stimuli naturally elicit strong, automatic responses in humans and animals alike, making them highly effective for conditioning purposes. The nausea paired with food or drink led to a learned aversion that was more potent and quicker to form compared to other options like performing a task and receiving a food reward, movement and shock, or punishments and rewards. This finding underscores the importance of natural, biologically relevant stimuli in establishing strong conditioned responses."
