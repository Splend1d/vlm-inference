Reconstruction\n\nThe desegregation of schools was largely a response to the unfulfilled promises of Reconstruction, a period in American history following the Civil War aimed at rebuilding the South and ensuring the rights of freed slaves. During Reconstruction, the U.S. government passed several civil rights laws intended to protect African Americans' rights and integration. However, these efforts were largely undone by the end of Reconstruction, leading to widespread segregation and discrimination against African Americans, including in public education. The landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 helped overturn the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which had been used to justify racial segregation in public facilities, including schools."
