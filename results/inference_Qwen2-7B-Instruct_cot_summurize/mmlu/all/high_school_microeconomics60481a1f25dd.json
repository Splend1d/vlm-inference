Expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers.\n\nWhen consumers expect their future income to increase, they may anticipate being able to afford more luxury or discretionary items, including orange juice. This expectation can lead to an immediate increase in the quantity demanded at each price level, shifting the entire demand curve to the right. \n\nExplanation of other options:\n\nA. A bumper crop of oranges in Florida would likely lead to a decrease in the price of orange juice due to an increase in supply, not a shift in the demand curve.\n\nB. A decrease in the price of Tang, a competitor product, might lead to a shift in consumer preferences away from orange juice towards Tang, thus shifting the demand curve for orange juice to the left.\n\nC. Expectations of lower future prices for orange juice do not immediately affect current demand; rather, they could lead to a decrease in current demand as consumers hold off on purchasing, anticipating lower prices later."
