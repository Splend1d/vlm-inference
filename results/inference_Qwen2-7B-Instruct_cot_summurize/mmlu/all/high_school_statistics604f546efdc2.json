The weights of apples are approximately normally distributed. The farmer takes a random sample of 16 apples and computes a mean of 4.3 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces.

However, we don't have an exact formula to find the p-value here without referring to a t-table or a statistical software package, but knowing that we've got a t-value close to 5.17, we can infer that the p-value would be very small because we're looking at such a high t-value.\n\nNow, matching this scenario to the given options:\n\nA. P(Z > 2): This option refers to a standard normal distribution, which doesn't apply directly because we're working with a t-distribution.\nB. P(Z < 2): This option also refers to a standard normal distribution.\nC. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom: This option correctly describes what we're looking for. We're interested in the probability of getting a t-value greater than 2 under the condition that there are are 15 degrees of freedom ( (since df = n - 1).\nD. P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom: This would be incorrect because it refers to the probability of getting a t-value less than 2.\n\nGiven that our calculated t-statistic is approximately 5.17, which is much higher than 2, the correct answer would be something that represents a very small p-value to the right of our t-statistic. Without direct access to a t-distribution table or calculator, we cannot precisely determine the p-value from the options provided, but logically, the closest match that represents a p-value for a t-statistic significantly larger than 2 (with 15 degrees of freedom is:\n\nC. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n\nThis represents the scenario where the p-value is less than the conventional threshold for a 5% level of significance, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis."
