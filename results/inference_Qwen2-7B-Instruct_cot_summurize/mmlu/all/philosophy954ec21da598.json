                    "text": "Without knowing which specific versions of the principle Peter Singer is referring to, it's challenging to provide an exact answer. However, I can offer some insights based on his general views and arguments.\n\nPeter Singer is known for his work in ethical philosophy, particularly in the area of utilitarianism, where the goal is to maximize overall happiness or utility. Here's a breakdown of your options based on common interpretations of his views:\n\nA. He considers the stronger version to be correct: This option suggests that Singer supports a more stringent or demanding version of a principle. In many of his arguments, especially those related to global poverty, Singer advocates for a level of responsibility that goes beyond what might be considered the minimum moral duty. For example, he argues that affluent individuals have a duty to donate to the alleviation of global poverty if they can do so without significantly compromising their own well-being.\n\nB. He considers the weaker version to be correct: This would imply that Singer supports a less demanding principle. While this isn't a typical stance given his advocacy for radical forms of altruism, it's theoretically possible that he might endorse a version of a principle that sets a lower bar for moral action.\n\nC. He ends up rejecting them both: This option is less likely given Singer's prolific work and advocacy for various principles in ethics. His arguments often revolve around establishing the strength of moral obligations.\n\nD. He claims that they are equivalent: This is also not a standard position for Singer. While he does discuss the importance of moral duties and the consequences of our actions, he typically emphasizes the necessity of going beyond mere moral duties to engage in significant acts of altruism when possible.\n\nIn essence, Singer's work often focuses on advocating for stronger versions of principles, especially those related to maximizing utility and addressing global inequalities. Therefore, it's most consistent with his views to assume that he might consider the stronger version of a principle to be correct, unless the context of the principle in question specifically contradicts his established ethical positions."
