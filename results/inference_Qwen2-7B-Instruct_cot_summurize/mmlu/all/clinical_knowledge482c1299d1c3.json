These fibers have the following characteristics:\n\nC. a relatively small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.\n\nFast-twitch fibers lack the high number of mitochondria found in slow-twitch fibers, which helps them to generate energy quickly from glycogen stores rather than oxygen (this is why they are more anaerobic. The high ATPase activity allows for rapid release of energy, but this process doesn't last long because it depletes glycogen stores quickly."
