Wrong, Wrong\n\nDriving while talking on the phone is generally considered unsafe and can be illegal in many states, depending on local laws about hands-free devices or cell phone usage while driving. This action can put not only the driver but also passengers and other road users at risk, making it clearly morally wrong under ordinary US standards.\n\nKicking someone out into the hall for being too loud could be seen as aggressive and unnecessarily harsh, especially if there were less confrontational ways to handle the situation, such as speaking calmly or using mediation techniques. This action might also infringe upon the person's right to be treated with respect and dignity. Therefore, this action is also considered morally wrong according to typical US moral standards."
