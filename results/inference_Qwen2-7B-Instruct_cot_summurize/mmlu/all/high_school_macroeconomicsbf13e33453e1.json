This phenomenon isn't directly caused by a simple shift in either the aggregate supply or demand curves. Instead, stagflation can occur when there is a decrease in aggregate demand ( which leads to lower economic output and higher unemployment ( coupled with an increase in the prices of goods and services.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice that represents a condition leading to stagflation is:\n\nB. a leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve.\n\nThis shift indicates that at any given price level, the total quantity of goods and services demanded in the economy has decreased, potentially leading to a decrease in production, higher unemployment, and rising prices if the decrease in demand is not offset by a sufficient increase in aggregate supply."
