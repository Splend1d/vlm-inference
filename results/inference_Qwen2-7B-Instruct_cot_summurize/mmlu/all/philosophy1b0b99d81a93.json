This crisis is often associated with the tension between different ethical theories and the challenge of justifying moral norms without falling into either purely subjective (enlightened egoism' or absolute 'pure altruism'.\n\nAmong the options provided, the concept that most directly addresses this foundational crisis is:\n\nC. justified constraint.\n\nThis refers to the idea that moral constraints or rules are have a basis in reason and can be justified independently of individual desires or outcomes. Gauthier argues for a form of contractarianism, where moral rules emerge from agreements among individuals, suggesting a way to justify constraints that might otherwise seem to conflict with personal interests or desires. This approach attempts to provide a coherent foundation for morality that avoids the extremes of purely self-interested behavior or blind adherence to others' interests.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C. justified constraint."
