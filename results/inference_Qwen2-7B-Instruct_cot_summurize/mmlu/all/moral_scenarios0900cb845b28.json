However, trying on a shirt in a store and then putting it back on the rack without making a purchase or indicating interest in buying it can be seen as rude and potentially theft-related behavior, especially if the person does this repeatedly or with intent to deceive. Therefore, trying on clothes in a store and not purchasing them when there's no intention to do so could be considered morally wrong."
