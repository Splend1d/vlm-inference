                    "text": "Infrared spectroscopy is particularly useful for detecting vibrations that involve a change in the dipole moment of a molecule. For a molecule like carbon dioxide (CO2, its vibrational modes can be categorized into bending, symmetric stretching, and asymmetric stretching.\n\n- **Symmetric Stretching (**: This mode involves the vibration where both oxygen atoms move towards or away from the carbon atom along the same line. This movement changes the dipole moment of the molecule, making it IR active.\n\n- **Asymmetric Stretching**: In this mode, one oxygen moves closer to the carbon while the other moves further away, causing a change in the dipole moment and making it IR active.\n\n- **Bending**: There are two types of bending motions in CO2: out-of-plane and in-plane. The out-of-plane bending is IR active because it results in a change in the dipole moment. However, the in-plane bending does not change the dipole moment significantly and thus is generally not considered IR active.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer includes both symmetric and asymmetric stretching, which are responsible for CO2's absorption in the infrared region.\n\nThe correct choice is:\n\n**D. I and III only**"
