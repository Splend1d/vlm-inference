                    "text": "A man borrowed $150,000 from a bank to remodel his home and executed a promissory note agreeing to repay the loan over a 10-year period. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the home. The bank promptly recorded the mortgage, which was the only lien on the home at that time. Several months later, the man borrowed $40,000 from his mother in order to purchase a new truck and gave his mother a mortgage on the home to secure repayment of the debt. The mother promptly recorded the mortgage. The man later lost his job and was struggling to make loan payments to both the bank and his mother. To accommodate the man's financial situation, the bank extended the amortization period of its loan to substantially reduce the amount of each monthly payment. The bank did not alter the interest rate or increase the principal amount of the loan. At the time of the modification of the bank loan, the man was not in default in his payments to his mother. Neither the bank nor the man informed the mother of the modification of the bank loan. After the man later missed five payments to his mother, she commenced a foreclosure action. While the action was pending, the mother learned of the bank's loan modification. The mother asserted that her mortgage had become a first lien on the home and that the bank's mortgage had become a second lien. Is the mother's assertion correct?\n\nA. No, because the bank's loan modification was not detrimental to the rights of the mother.\nB. No, because the man was not in default in his payments to his mother at the time of the bank's loan modification.\nC. Yes, because the bank's loan modification was made without the mother's prior consent.\nD. Yes, because the bank's loan modification was material.\n"

Yes, because the bank's loan modification was made without the mother's prior consent.\n\nIn this scenario, the bank modified the terms of the original promissory note without notifying the mother or obtaining her consent. This is a breach of the terms agreed upon when the mother's mortgage was established, as it directly affects the priority of claims against the property. The bank's unilateral decision to extend the amortization period on its loan, thereby reducing the monthly payments, could potentially alter the order of priorities if the property were to be foreclosed upon. In jurisdictions where such modifications can impact lien priorities, the mother's mortgage might be deemed to have priority over the bank's mortgage since it was established before the bank's modification took place.\n\nHowever, the specific outcome would depend on the laws of the jurisdiction in question, as different states may have varying rules regarding the effect of loan modifications on lien priorities during the pendency of a foreclosure action. In general, though, the principle of the bank's modification being made without the mother's consent would support the mother's assertion that her mortgage has priority over the bank's."
