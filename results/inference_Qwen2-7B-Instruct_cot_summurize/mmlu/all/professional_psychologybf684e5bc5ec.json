This is directly specified by the criterion for statistical significance set at 0.05.\n\nLet's clarify why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. The probability of making a type II error ( is not necessarily higher than the probability of making a type I error. In fact, in this scenario, with a statistical power of 0.85, the probability of a type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15. So, the probability of a type II error is not higher than that of a type I error; it is actually identical in this specific case, given the power and significance level provided.\n\nC. The statement that the probability of making a type II error is 0.85 is incorrect. As explained in option B, the probability of a type II error is 0.15, not 0.85.\n\nD. Given the information about the criterion for statistical significance and the statistical power, it is possible to compute the probabilities of type I and type II errors. We've already established these probabilities: type I error = 0.05, and type II error = 0.15. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, only option A correctly states that the probability of making a type I error is 0.05."
