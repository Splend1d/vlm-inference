Deep dissection and erosion\n\nAlluvial landscapes are typically characterized by the accumulation and deposition of sediment in river valleys, floodplains, and coastal areas. These environments are generally associated with processes that involve sediment transport, deposition, and the formation of relatively flat or gently sloped landforms. Deep dissection and erosion, on the other hand, are more typical of landscapes developed in areas with steep slopes, high rates of weathering, and strong erosive forces such as those found in mountainous regions or areas with high rainfall intensity. Therefore, deep dissection and erosion is the least associated with the development of alluvial landscapes."
