A counterexample can be found in the context of modular arithmetic or within certain groups where squaring an element can yield the same result as squaring another distinct element. For instance, consider the group (\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}, +), which consists of equivalence classes modulo 4 under addition. Here, [1]^2 = [1] and [3]^2 = [1], showing that even though 1 \u2260 3, we have 1^2 = 3^2.\n\nStatement 2 is true. In a dihedral group \\(D_n\\), which represents the symmetries of a regular n-sided polygon ( including both rotations and reflections, the set of rotations indeed forms a cyclic subgroup. This is because the group operation (composition of rotations - follows the closure property, contains the identity rotation (which leaves the polygon unchanged), and every element has an inverse (for example, a rotation by \\(\\theta\\) degrees has an inverse rotation by \\(-\\theta\\) degrees. Moreover, there exists a generator for this subgroup: a single rotation by \\(2\\pi/n\\) radians, which when repeatedly applied, generates all other rotations in the group. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. False, True**."
