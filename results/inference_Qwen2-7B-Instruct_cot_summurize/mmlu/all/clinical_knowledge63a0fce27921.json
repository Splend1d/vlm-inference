Each cycle removes two carbons from the fatty acid chain as acetyl-CoA and generates a net of one molecule of NADH, one molecule of FADH2, and a small amount of ATP. After all eight cycles, the remaining two-carbon molecule is also converted into acetyl-CoA. Therefore, you end up with 8 molecules of acetyl-CoA, along with some ATP and water produced from the reduction reactions involving NAD+ and FAD."
