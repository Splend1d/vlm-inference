While bitmap graphics can represent images composed of individual pixels, achieving realistic lighting and shading effects often requires more sophisticated techniques like rasterization with lighting models, which might not be as efficient or direct as in vector graphics or more advanced rendering methods. \n\nOptions A, C, and D are generally properties of bitmap graphics:\n- A. Fast hardware exists to move blocks of pixels efficiently: Bitmap graphics are often optimized for fast display on monitors, allowing for quick rendering and manipulation of images.\n- C. All line segments can be displayed as straight: Bitmap graphics can represent lines directly using pixels, though the visual quality might depend on the resolution and anti-aliasing techniques used.\n- D. Polygons can be filled with solid colors and textures: This is possible in bitmap graphics, although it might require additional processing to ensure that the fill appears smooth and consistent across different resolutions or when scaled."
