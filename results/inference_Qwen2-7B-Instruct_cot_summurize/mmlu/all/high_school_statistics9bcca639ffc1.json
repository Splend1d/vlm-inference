The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.\n\nThe probability of committing a Type I error (also known as the significance level or alpha) is set by the researcher and does not change with the number of experimental units. It represents the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n\nThe power of a test, on the other hand, is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. Increasing the number of experimental units generally increases the power of the test because it provides more information about the effect being tested, thereby making it more likely that the test will detect a true effect if one exists. \n\nTherefore, if the researchers double the number of experimental units for each treatment while keeping the significance level at 0.05, the probability of a Type I error remains unchanged, but the power of the test to detect a true effect increases."
