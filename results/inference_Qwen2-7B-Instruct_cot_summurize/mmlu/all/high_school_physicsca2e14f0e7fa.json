The wave's height has become smaller.\n\nExplanation: When a wave travels through a medium (like water), its energy can be distributed over a larger area as it spreads out. This means that as the wave moves away from the point of impact (in this case, where the rock hits the water), the energy density of the wave decreases. Since energy is spread out over a larger area, the amplitude (or height) of the wave also decreases. Therefore, the wave hitting the child's ankles carries less energy because its height is smaller compared to when it was first created by the rock's impact."
