The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\n\nWhen a law is challenged under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (which prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws), the burden of proof lies with the party challenging the law (in this case, the largest platinum mining company. If the mining company argues that the tax statute violates the equal protection of the laws, it must show that the law discriminates based on impermissible classifications or treats similarly situated individuals differently without a rational basis for doing so.\n\nUnder the rational basis review, which is the standard applied when a law discriminates on the basis of race, national origin, alienage, or sex, or when it involves fundamental rights or suspect classifications, the government must only demonstrate that the challenged classification bears some reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest. This is known as \"rational basis\" review.\n\nIn the scenario described, since the mining company is challenging the tax statute, it would need to argue that the classification in the statute (i.e., taxing only the extraction of platinum but not other minerals like silver, turquoise, sulfur, and stone\u2014does not have a rational basis and thus violates the equal protection clause. Therefore, the burden of persuasion would be on the mining company to prove that the classification is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest, which would require a higher level of scrutiny than rational basis review. However, under the rational basis test, the state's position would be upheld unless the mining company can demonstrate that the classification is arbitrary or capricious, or that there is no conceivable legitimate state interest served by the classification."
