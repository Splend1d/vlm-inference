He argues that animals should be granted moral consideration because they can experience suffering and have interests. According to Singer, there is no precise point at which an animal ceases to have rights based solely on its capacity to suffer. This is because as an animal grows and develops, its ability to suffer also increases. Therefore, Singer would argue that we should not seek a precise boundary for when it becomes morally acceptable to kill an animal without causing pain, but rather consider the context and the specific circumstances of each case."
