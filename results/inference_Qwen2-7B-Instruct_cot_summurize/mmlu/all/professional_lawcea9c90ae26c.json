The witness also states that she told the restaurant about her injury immediately after suffering it. Upon objection by the restaurant's attorney, the trial judge should rule the witness's testimony\n\nA. admissible to prove the restaurant's negligence, provided that the court gives a cautionary instruction that the testimony should not be considered as bearing on the issue of damages.\nB. admissible to prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger of frostbite posed by its soft drinks.\nC. inadmissible, because it is not probative of a fact in issue.\nD. inadmissible, because it seeks to put into evidence separate, unrelated transactions with a third party.\n"

There is no clear connection between the two incidents that would allow the jury to infer negligence or foreseeability on the part of the restaurant based solely on the witness's testimony. Therefore, the testimony is likely to be deemed inadmissible under the rules of evidence."
