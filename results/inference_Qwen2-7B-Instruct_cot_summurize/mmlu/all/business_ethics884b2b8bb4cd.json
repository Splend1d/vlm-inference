Normative, Descriptive and Instrumental.\n\nDonaldson and Preston's stakeholder theory classifies stakeholders into three types:\n\n1. **Normative Stakeholders**: These are the stakeholders that are considered as normative because they have rights or claims that should be respected by the organization. This includes employees, customers, and communities where the business operates.\n\n2. **Descriptive Stakeholders**: These are the stakeholders who are actually involved with the organization, or who can be reasonably expected to be affected by the organization's actions. This could include suppliers, competitors, and shareholders.\n\n3. **Instrumental Stakeholders**: These are the stakeholders whose interests may not be directly related to the organization but can influence its operations or performance. This might include government regulators, special interest groups, and the media.\n\nUnderstanding these different types helps organizations to better manage their relationships with various stakeholders in a strategic and effective manner."
