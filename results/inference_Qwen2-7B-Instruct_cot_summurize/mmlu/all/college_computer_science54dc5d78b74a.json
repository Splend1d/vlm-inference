The loop iterates over array A, performing an operation on each element using array B's corresponding elements (i.e., `A[i] = A[i] + B[2*i];`. \n\nGiven the cache setup:\n\n- Cache size: 2K bytes = 2048 bytes\n- Block size: 8 bytes\n- Array A accesses: 256 * 4 bytes = 1024 bytes\n- Array B accesses: Since every second element of B is accessed, it would be 256 * 4 bytes = 1024 bytes\n\nWhen the loop executes, the following happens:\n\n1. **Array A accesses**: Each access hits the cache since there's a 1-to-1 mapping for A's elements due to the cache being physically tagged and direct-mapped. No writes to memory occur for A as the write-back policy keeps the data in the cache until evicted or replaced.\n\n2. **Array B accesses**: For every access to B, the data is read from the cache if already present (or from memory otherwise. Since the cache size is 2K bytes and each block is 8 bytes, the entire array B cannot fit into the cache at once. However, because only every second element of B is accessed in the loop (`B[2*i]`), and given the cache's capacity, the accesses to B will likely cause some eviction of previously accessed elements of B out of the cache as new elements are fetched. \n\n   Considering the total size of B (1024 bytes fits within the cache, but because of the pattern of access (`B[2*i]`), the cache will not maintain all elements of B in the cache simultaneously. This means that each access to B requires a memory hit, leading to 256 accesses to memory (for the first half of B, and another set of 256 accesses for the second half, totaling 512 accesses. However, considering the question's context and the options provided, the focus seems to be on the total number of bytes written to memory rather than the number of memory accesses. \n\n   In a write-back policy, when data is written back to memory, it's typically done so when the cache line is evicted, not necessarily after every write. Given the nature of the problem and the options, the key point is recognizing that the write-back policy affects how data is managed in the cache, but does not directly correlate to a simple calculation of bytes written to memory based on the number of accesses alone. \n\nGiven the complexity and the specific nature of the question regarding the cache policy and its impact on memory writes versus simply understanding the access pattern, the correct interpretation focusing on the direct calculation of bytes written to memory based on the question's premise should consider the total size of data involved in the operations. \n\nSince each iteration of the loop involves accessing one element from A (which is always cached) and one element from B (which could potentially require a memory access depending on the cache's state, and considering the loop iterates 256 times, the total bytes written to memory would be the sum of the sizes of elements from both arrays accessed in the loop. \n\nTherefore, the total bytes written to memory is calculated as follows:\n- Bytes from A: 256 elements * 4 bytes = 1024 bytes\n- Bytes from B: 256 elements * 4 bytes = 1024 bytes\n\nAdding these together gives a total of 2048 bytes written to memory. However, given the options provided and the clarification in the explanation, it seems there might have been an oversight in the direct calculation aligning with the provided choices. \n\nGiven the constraints and the focus on the options provided (A. 0, B. 256, C. 1. 1024, D. 2000, and the explanation above suggesting a total more aligned with option C or D, the closest correct answer considering the question's intent and the typical understanding of such cache behavior questions, would be:\n\n**D. 2000**\n\nThis choice reflects an interpretation that aligns with the total size of data involved in the operations across both arrays, considering the potential for memory accesses to occur during the loop's execution based on the cache's limitations and the write-back policy's implications on data eviction and subsequent memory writes."
