This can be represented mathematically as:\n\\[10 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5\\]\n\nCalculating this directly:\n\\[10 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5 = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{243} = \\frac{10}{243}\\]\n\nJohn wants to find a single fraction \\(x\\) such that multiplying 10 by \\(x\\) gives the same result. In other words, he wants to solve for \\(x\\) in:\n\\[10 \\times x = \\frac{10}{243}\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 10 gives:\n\\[x = \\frac{1}{243}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\(\\frac{1}{243}\\)"
