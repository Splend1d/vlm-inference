This system involves a division of labor where different regions or countries specialize in producing certain goods or services, which they then trade with other parts of the world. This setup transcends ethnic and cultural boundaries and is characterized by a core-periphery relationship, where developed economies (the core) dominate less developed ones (the periphery.\n\nA.
