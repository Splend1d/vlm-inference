                    "text": "The correct answer would be B. The proportion of the population that is heterozygous at this locus should remain constant.\n\nStabilizing selection tends to favor the intermediate phenotype, in this case, the heterozygote (genotype. This means that individuals with the heterozygote genotype (one dominant and one recessive allele) would likely have a selective advantage over those with either homozygote genotype (both dominant or both recessive alleles). As a result, the frequency of the heterozygote genotype would increase while the frequencies of the homozygote genotypes would decrease over time. Therefore, the proportion of the population that is heterozygous would remain relatively stable.\n\nOption A suggests that the proportions of both types of homozygotes should decrease, but since stabilizing selection favors the heterozygote, it implies a simultaneous decrease in homozygotes, which isn't necessarily true; it would rather imply that both homozygote frequencies decrease relative to the heterozygote.\n\nOption C suggests that the population's average heterozygosity should increase, but given that stabilizing selection decreases the frequencies of the homozygote genotypes, the overall heterozygosity (the proportion of heterozygotes in the population divided by the total number of possible genotypes ( would actually decrease if we consider only the alleles in question.\n\nOption D is incorrect based on the explanation provided for options A and C."
