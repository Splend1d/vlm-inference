The Pinochet case, also known as the \"House of Lords (Human Rights Act 1998\" judgment, clarified that former heads of state do not enjoy absolute immunity once they are removed from office. This means that if a former leader is accused of serious crimes committed while in power, they can be held accountable in courts of the country where the crimes were alleged to have been committed, even if they are no longer in power.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that former heads of state enjoy absolute immunity, which is not the case according to the Pinochet ruling.\nOption B is incorrect because it incorrectly states that all public acts enjoy immunity; this is not a principle established by the Pinochet case.\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests there is no difference between a current and a former head of state in terms of immunity, which contradicts the clarification provided by the Pinochet case."
