Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?\n\nA. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.\nB. The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.\nC. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\nD.

In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\n\nThe phenomenon described can be explained by environmental factors affecting the expression of the gene for flower color. The color of hydrangea flowers changes based on the pH level of the soil, which is an environmental factor. This means that even if the plant has the same genetic makeup (the alleles for flower color), the outcome (the color of the flower) can vary depending on the conditions in which it grows. This is not an example of incomplete dominance or codominance between two alleles, nor does it necessarily involve multiple genes (though it could, as some genetic studies suggest that more than one gene can influence flower color in hydrangeas)."
