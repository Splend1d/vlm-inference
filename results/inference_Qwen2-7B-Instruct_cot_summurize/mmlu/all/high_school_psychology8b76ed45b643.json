Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation?\n\nA. Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English.\nB. The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.\nC. The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.\nD.  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.\n"

The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.\n\nThis answer choice acknowledges that the student performed well in reading in her native language, suggesting a strong foundational reading skill set. However, when transitioning to English, she encounters difficulties, which can be attributed to the differences in linguistic complexity between her native language and English. English often has more complex grammatical structures, a wider vocabulary, and different spelling rules, which might require additional time and effort to master compared to her previous language environment. This does not imply that her home environment is interfering with her English development ( it could support her learning, or that her academic problems will necessarily increase due to reading difficulties. Instead, it highlights a specific challenge associated with learning to read in a new language."
