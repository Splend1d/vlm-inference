This means that if one parent carries the gene mutation associated with the condition, there is a 50% chance that each child they have will inherit the mutation and thus be at risk for developing the condition upon exposure to certain anesthetics or muscle relaxants. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Autosomal dominant."
