Our own interpretation.\n\nResearch has shown that memories are not stored verbatim but are subject to change over time due to various factors such as the passage of time, the influence of new information, and the individual's emotional state at the time of the event. Additionally, when people recall memories, they often reconstruct them based on their current understanding and beliefs, which can lead to distortions or inaccuracies.\n\nSenior View interviewees may also provide insights into how their memories may have been influenced by their personal experiences, biases, or the context in which the events occurred. While some memories might be quite accurate, others might be more subjective and open to interpretation. It is important to consider these factors when evaluating the reliability of memories and to approach the reconstruction of past events with a critical and nuanced perspective."
