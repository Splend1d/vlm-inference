Given that the index of refraction of water is \\(n = \\frac{4}{3}\\), we can calculate the speed of light in water as:\n\n\\[v = \\frac{c}{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\frac{3}{4}c\\]\n\nThis means the speed of light in water, relative to the lab frame, is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times the speed of light in a vacuum, or \\(0.75c\\). However, this value isn't directly listed among your options, which suggests there might have been a misunderstanding in the question's presentation or in interpreting the answer choices.\n\nGiven the context and the calculation, none of the provided options A through D directly match \\(\\frac{3}{4}c\\). It seems there might be a typo or misinterpretation in the question or the options. Based on standard physics principles:\n\n- Option A ( \\(1/2 c\\) is clearly not correct.\n- Option B \\(2/3 c\\) is also incorrect based on our calculation.\n- Option C \\(5/6 c\\) doesn't align with the calculation.\n- Option D \\(10/11 c\\) is also incorrect based on the calculation.\n\nThe correct answer, based on the principle of light slowing down in a medium, should indeed be closer to \\(0.75c\\), but since this exact fraction isn't an option, and assuming the question intended to ask about the speed of light in the water relative to its speed in vacuum rather than comparing it to the tube's velocity, the closest option to \\(0.75c\\) is actually not listed as presented. \n\nIf the question was aiming for a conceptual understanding rather than a direct numerical match from the provided choices, the correct interpretation would be that the speed of light in water is indeed reduced compared to its speed in a vacuum, and thus, if one were to choose the closest option, it would incorrectly still be among those listed, indicating a discrepancy between the question's intent and the provided answer choices."
