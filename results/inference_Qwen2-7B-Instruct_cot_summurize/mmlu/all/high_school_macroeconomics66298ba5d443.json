An increase in the production possibility curve and a rightward shift in long-run aggregate supply.\n\nEconomic growth refers to an increase in the productive capacity of an economy, which can be measured by an increase in the production possibility curve ( (PPC) or a rightward shift in the long-run aggregate supply ( (LRAS). This means that at any given price level, the economy can now produce more goods and services than before. The PPC represents the maximum possible output of all goods and services in an economy given the available resources and technology, while LRAS represents the total quantity of goods and services an economy can produce at different price levels over the long run, assuming full employment of resources. \n\nAn increase in economic growth typically leads to higher incomes, lower unemployment, and improved living standards for the population. It often results from improvements in technology, education, infrastructure, and productivity."
