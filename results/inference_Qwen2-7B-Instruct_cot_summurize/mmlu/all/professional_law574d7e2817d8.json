The wife, who weighed more than 300 pounds, was unable to find a size large enough to fit her. She then saw a store clerk and asked if the store carried the dress in her size. The clerk looked at the wife and said, \"You look like a hippopotamus, and I'm sorry, but we don't carry this dress in the hippo size. \" Another customer in the store overheard the comment and began to laugh. The wife became very upset and hurried out of the store. If the wife asserts a tort action against the department store based upon the clerk's actions, the wife will\n\nA. win, because the statement was overheard byanother customer.\nB. win, because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. lose, because the clerk was merely statingan opinion.\nD. lose, because the wife only suffered hurt feelings.\n"

The statement made by the store clerk could potentially meet the standard for IIED if it can be shown that:\n\n1. The statement was intentionally or recklessly made in a manner that was extreme and outrageous.\n2. The statement caused severe emotional distress to the plaintiff.\n3. The defendant had a relationship with the plaintiff that would make such behavior intolerable as an incident to the relationship.\n4. The plaintiff suffered actual and measurable damages, which could include medical expenses, lost wages, and emotional distress.\n\nIn this case, the statement made by the clerk is highly offensive and could be considered extreme and outrageous given its context. The fact that the statement was overheard by another customer may also contribute to the severity of the situation, as it suggests that the clerk's behavior was not confined to a private conversation but was directed at a third party in front of others. The wife's reaction of becoming upset and leaving the store indicates that she suffered emotional distress, which is a key element for the plaintiff to demonstrate.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the court might find that the department store is liable for the clerk's actions under the doctrine of IIED, especially considering that the statement was both egregious and publicized in a manner that would cause significant emotional harm. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
