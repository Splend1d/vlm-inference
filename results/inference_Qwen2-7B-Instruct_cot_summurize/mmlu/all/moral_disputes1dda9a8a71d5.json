We know that wasteful driving is morally permissible.\nB. We know that particularism is true.\nD. We know that wasteful driving is not wrong.\n\nInstead, it suggests that:\n\nC. We do not know whether wasteful driving is wrong.\n\nThis conclusion aligns with Sinnott-Armstrong's argument that moral intuitions need to be justified by moral principles or reasons. Without such justification, the status of the moral judgment remains uncertain. It does not automatically make the action permissible or wrong; rather, it indicates a gap in our understanding or justification for our moral stance on wasteful driving."
