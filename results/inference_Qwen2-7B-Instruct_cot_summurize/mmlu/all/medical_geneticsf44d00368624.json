Sickle cell disease\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of genetic disorders that affect the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. In sickle cell disease, hemoglobin molecules become deformed and cause the red blood cells to become rigid and sickle-shaped. This can lead to severe anemia, especially in newborns, due to the destruction of these abnormal red blood cells. \n\nAlpha-thalassemia ( (Option A), beta-thalassemia ( (Option B), and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin ( (Option C) also involve defects in hemoglobin production but typically present with different clinical manifestations and severity compared to sickle cell disease."
