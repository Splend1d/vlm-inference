Under dualism, international and domestic laws comprise distinct legal systems\n\nIn the context of public international law, dualism refers to a theory that treats international law and domestic law as separate and distinct legal systems. Under this theory, international treaties and agreements must be incorporated into the domestic legal system before they can have any effect within a state's territory. This means that international law and domestic law are not seen as parts of a unified legal system, but rather as separate systems that need to interact with each other through specific legal mechanisms."
