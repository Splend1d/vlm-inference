Assess for suicidal ideation\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including crying often, not wanting to get out of bed, and self-perceived low pain level, may indicate depression or other psychological distress. The presence of major depressive disorder further suggests that the patient might be experiencing exacerbation of her mental health condition. It's important to assess for suicidal ideation given her current state and history of depression. This is crucial for ensuring her safety and well-being. \n\nThe other options are less relevant to the current situation:\n\nA. Reassurance: While providing reassurance can be part of the supportive care, it does not address the underlying issue of the patient's mental state.\n\nC. Begin dextroamphetamine therapy: Stimulants like dextroamphetamine are not typically used to manage symptoms of depression or anxiety in this context. They might be considered for other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, but not for depression or lack of motivation.\n\nD. Increase oxycodone dosage: Increasing the pain medication without addressing potential mental health issues could lead to over-medication or dependency, and might not effectively address the patient's overall well-being."
