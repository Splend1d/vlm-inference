Jim and Tim will have very similar IQs.\n\nMonozygotic ( or identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg, while dizygotic or fraternal twins come from two different eggs each fertilized by a separate sperm. This means that monozygotic twins share 100% of their genes, whereas dizygotic twins share only about 50% of their segregating genes, similar to siblings born at different times.\n\nHeritability studies of intelligence suggest that about 80% of the variation in intelligence among individuals is due to genetic factors. Since Jim and Tim share 100% of their genes, they are more likely to have very similar IQs due to the strong genetic influence on intelligence. In contrast, Scott and Michael, who share about 50% of their segregating genes, might show more variation in their IQs because they also have a larger influence from their unique environmental experiences. However, it's important to note that even identical twins can have differences in IQ due to environmental factors and individual experiences."
