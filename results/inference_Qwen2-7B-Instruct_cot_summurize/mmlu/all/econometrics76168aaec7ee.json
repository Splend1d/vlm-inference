Thus, for each equation in the system, there are 2p parameters to be estimated.\n\nIn your case, you have a VAR(4) model, meaning p=4. Since you're dealing with a tri-variate model, which means you have 3 variables, the total number of parameters to be estimated is 3 equations * 2p = 3*8 = 24 parameters.\n\nHowever, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the options provided based on this explanation. It seems none of the provided options (A. 12, B. 4, C. 3, D. 36 match the correct answer, which would be 24 parameters for a tri-variate VAR(4) model, ignoring the intercepts."
