They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire.\n\u2014Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847\nWhich event or period in Japan's history best reflects Lord Ii's concerns?\n\nA.

Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade\n\nLord Ii's concerns in the given quote reflects the fear that Japan might fall behind the modernizing nations due to its adherence to traditional systems. This sentiment is most closely aligned with the period when Commodore Matthew Perry forced Japan to open its ports to international trade in the mid-19th century. This event, known as the \"Perry Expedition,\" marked the beginning of the end for Japan's isolationist policy (known as sakoku. It led to significant changes in Japanese society, politics, and economy, often referred to as the Meiji Restoration. The arrival of the steamship and the introduction of Western military technology were part of the broader process of modernization that Japan underwent during this time, which addressed Lord Ii's fears about the condition of foreign states and their advancements."
