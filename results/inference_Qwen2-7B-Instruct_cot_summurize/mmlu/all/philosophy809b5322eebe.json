She has also discussed the challenges of cross-cultural communication, particularly in relation to differing conceptual schemes or ways of understanding the world. In this context, she might suggest that participants in cross-cultural interactions often view these interactions through a relativist lens. This means they recognize and respect the validity of perspectives that differ from their own, acknowledging that what is 'right' or 'correct' can vary across cultures. This does not necessarily mean they abandon their own views, but rather engage with others in a manner that respects and seeks to understand cultural differences."
