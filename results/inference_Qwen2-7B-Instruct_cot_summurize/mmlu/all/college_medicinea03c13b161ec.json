In this case, the enzyme transfers a nitrogen group from one reactant to the other, fitting the definition of a transferase. \n\nA. Oxidoreductases are enzymes that catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, where electrons are transferred between molecules.\n\nC. Hydrolases are enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis reactions, breaking down molecules with water.\n\nD. Lyases are enzymes that catalyze reactions where bonds are cleaved without the addition or removal of a molecule, often involving the rearrangement of functional groups."
