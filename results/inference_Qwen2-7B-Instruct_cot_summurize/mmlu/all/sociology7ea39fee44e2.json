This alienation manifested in three main ways:\n\nA. The product they were making: Workers produced goods and commodities that they did not own or benefit from directly. They often had little control over the final product, which was instead owned by capitalists.\n\nB. The production process: In capitalist societies, the means of production (like factories, machinery, and raw materials) were owned by capitalists, not the workers who operated them. This meant that workers were forced to sell their labor power to access the means of production, leading to a separation between their labor and the means of production.\n\nC. Each other and humanity in general: Alienation also extended beyond individual workers to affect their social relationships. Workers were isolated from each other due to competition for jobs and the dehumanizing nature of the capitalist workplace. Additionally, they were alienated from humanity as a whole because their work focused on creating wealth for others rather than contributing meaningfully to society.\n\nThus, Marx believed that under capitalism, workers experienced a profound sense of estrangement and disconnection across these dimensions of their lives and labor."
