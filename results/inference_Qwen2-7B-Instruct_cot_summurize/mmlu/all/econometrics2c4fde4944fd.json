It is difficult to determine the appropriate explanatory variables for use in pure time-series models.\n\nPure time-series models focus solely on the historical data of a single variable without considering external factors or explanatory variables. This can make it challenging to capture all relevant dynamics and patterns, especially when trying to forecast future values accurately. In contrast, structural models incorporate additional variables that might influence the variable of interest, providing a more comprehensive framework but also requiring a solid theoretical foundation to identify these variables correctly."
