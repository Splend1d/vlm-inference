                    "text": "The measure of spread that must remain unchanged when you correct the tallest person's height by adding two inches is:\n\nD. Interquartile range\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion, or in simpler terms, it tells us about the spread of the middle 50% of the data. It is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1. Since the IQR only considers the values within these quartiles, any change outside this range (like adjusting the tallest value) does not affect the IQR.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options change:\n\nA. Mean absolute deviation ( The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is the average distance of each data point from the mean. If you increase the height of the tallest individual, the mean will also increase, and consequently, the MAD will also change because the distances of the other data points from the new mean will be different.\n\nB. Standard deviation: This is the square root of the variance and measures the average amount of variation or dispersion from the mean. Similar to the MAD, increasing the height of the tallest individual will change the mean and thus the standard deviation.\n\nC. Variance: Variance is the square of the standard deviation and also measures the dispersion of the data points around the mean. Any change in the data points, including increasing the height of the tallest individual, will affect the variance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Interquartile range."
