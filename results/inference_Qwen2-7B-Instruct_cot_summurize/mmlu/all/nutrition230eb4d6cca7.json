It encompasses both A and B:\n\nA. Investigating how certain nutrients or dietary patterns might contribute to the development of diseases within a population. This includes identifying dietary risk factors for chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, as well as exploring protective factors that may reduce the risk of these diseases.\n\nB. Examining how changes in food intake within a population can influence health and well-being. This could involve studying the effects of dietary interventions aimed at improving public health, such as the impact of increased fruit and vegetable consumption on reducing the risk of obesity or the benefits of a Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular health."
