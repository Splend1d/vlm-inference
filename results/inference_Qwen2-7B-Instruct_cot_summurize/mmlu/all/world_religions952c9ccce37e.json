Inspiration for personal meditation throughout the day.\n\nWhile the other options might be related to certain practices or understandings within the Sikh community, the core purpose of starting the day with the Guru's Vak is to imbibe spiritual wisdom and guidance. This practice aims to inspire Sikhs to reflect on the teachings, integrate them into their daily lives, and use this inspiration as a guide for their actions and decisions. The Guru's words provide moral support, spiritual direction, and a sense of community connection, which can influence one's thoughts, behaviors, and interactions throughout the day."
