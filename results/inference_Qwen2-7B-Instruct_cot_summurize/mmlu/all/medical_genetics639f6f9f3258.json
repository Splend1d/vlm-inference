It is favored in research due to its small size, ease of cultivation, short life cycle, and relatively simple genome. Its genome was one of the first plant genomes to be sequenced, which makes it particularly useful for genetic studies. Unlike many other plants, Arabidopsis has a diploid genome (meaning it has two copies of each chromosome), making it easier to study gene functions through genetic manipulation techniques such as gene knockout or overexpression. Additionally, its genome is well-annotated, which facilitates the identification and study of specific genes."
