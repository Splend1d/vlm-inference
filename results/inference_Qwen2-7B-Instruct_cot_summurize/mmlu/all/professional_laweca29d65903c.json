The purpose of the statute was to protect children from accessing pornographic materials. The law imposed a blanket prohibition on any communications that could be accessed by children and which might contain the feared material. A group of Internet publishers filed an action to have the law declared unconstitutional and unenforceable. They proved that many instances of artistic expression and non-prurient broadcasts could fall within the wide parameters of the law. The government argued that its interest in protecting children outweighed the other considerations, and that millions of parents who are now afraid to access the Internet would use the service because the new law made it safe for children. What will the Supreme Court decide?\n\nA. The law violates the First Amendment because it does not precisely regulate the content of speech and can be broadly applied to eliminate free speech for adults.\nB. The law is a precise and narrow proscription that applies only to pornographic materials and its wording will be approved because it is necessary to protect children.\nC. The law is constitutional because it is a reasonable exercise of the police power of the federal government.\nD. The law is unconstitutional because it invades the absolute right to privacy that adults expect to be protected when using the Internet.\n"

The court may consider several factors, including the clarity and specificity of the law, the potential for overbreadth, and whether the law serves a compelling governmental interest.\n\nGiven the description provided:\n\nA. This option suggests that the law is too broad and could potentially chill legitimate forms of speech (i.e., artistic expression or non-explicit content). If the court agrees with this assessment, they might rule the law unconstitutional under the First Amendment.\n\nB. This option implies that the law is narrowly tailored to address the issue of child protection without excessively restricting adult speech. However, if the court finds that the law encompasses a significant amount of non-pornographic content that could be considered \"indecent\" or \"patently offensive,\" it might not uphold the law as a precise and narrow proscription.\n\nC. The argument here leans towards the government's authority to regulate under its police powers, especially when it comes to issues involving public welfare such as protecting children. However, the court would likely scrutinize whether the means chosen to achieve this end are proportional to the objective.\n\nD. This option questions the law's constitutionality based on the principle of an individual's privacy rights when using the internet. While the concept of privacy is important, it must be balanced against other societal interests, particularly when it comes to laws aimed at protecting vulnerable groups like children.\n\nIn practice, the Supreme Court might rule that the law is overly broad and therefore unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it does not provide adequate protection against the risk of unintended censorship of non-explicit content that is nonetheless protected speech. Thus, the most likely outcome would align with option A. The court would find that the law violates the First Amendment by being too broad and potentially infringing on the rights of adults to access a wide variety of information and expressions online."
