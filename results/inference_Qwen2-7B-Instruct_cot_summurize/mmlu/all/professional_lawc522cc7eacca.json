The woman's sister owns parcel \"C,\" which lies the lowest on the mountain. Parcel \"B\" lies between Parcels \"A\" andIn 2000, the woman who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the sister purchased parcel \"C\" from the woman. The deed to the sister did not contain any mention of the woman's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. A portion of the sister's unimproved land began to subside over the drainage system. This was because of an especially pliable soil condition of which the woman was unaware prior to construction of the drainage system. In an action brought by the sister against the woman to recover property damage for the subsidence of her land, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The sister, because she is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition.\nB. The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.\nC. The sister, because she is entitled to support for her land in its improved condition.\nD. The woman, unless she sister proves that the woman was negligent in constructing the drainage system.\n"

The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSubjacent support refers to the support provided by the ground below a property, particularly in cases where one property is built on top of or adjacent to another. When a structure (in this case, the drainage system - is built on one parcel of land and causes damage to the land beneath it ( here, the sister's parcel \"C\" - the party responsible for the structure ( the woman) may be liable for subjacent support damages if the damage is caused by the structure and is not justified under normal conditions. \n\nIn this scenario, the woman's drainage system caused the sister's land to subside due to the pliable soil condition. Since the sister is the current owner of parcel \"C\" and claims property damage, she would likely have a claim for subjacent support damages based on the theory that the woman's actions (constructing the drainage system without knowledge of the soil condition - led to damage on parcel \"C\".\n\nOptions A, C, and D involve different concepts:\n\nA. Lateral support refers to the support provided by neighboring properties to prevent lateral movement (i.e., side-to-side shifting or settling - but does not apply directly to the situation described.\n\nC. Support for land in its improved condition typically involves damages to improvements made to the land, such as buildings, rather than the land itself.\n\nD. Negligence could potentially be a factor in determining liability, but the basis for recovery of damages in this case is more likely rooted in the principle of subjacent support, as the sister's land subsided due to the drainage system on parcel \"A\"."
