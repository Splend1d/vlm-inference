It emphasizes the importance of efficiency and productivity in the workplace through systematic methods of organizing work. The guiding principle of scientific management is that there is one best way to perform each task or job, and this optimal method should be identified and implemented. This approach involves breaking down tasks into their smallest components, studying these components to determine the most efficient way to complete them, and then implementing standardized procedures for performing those tasks. This method aims to increase productivity, reduce waste, and improve overall efficiency in industrial settings."
