In this scenario, you need to learn list 1, then list 2, and so on. If you start learning list 3 before completing list 2, the information from list 2 may interfere with your ability to remember it later, causing proactive interference. Similarly, if you start learning list 4 before completing list 3, the information from list 3 might interfere with your memory of list 3 when trying to recall it later.\n\nLists 1 and 2 do not cause proactive interference because you are learning them sequentially without any overlap. Therefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect."
