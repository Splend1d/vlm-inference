                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Posterior fragment to be displaced anteriorly by the action of the lateral pterygoid muscle.\n\nExplanation:\n- The mandible is the lower jaw bone and is composed of two parts: the body (which connects the mandible to the skull via the temporomandibular joint) and the ramus (which extends downward from the body and ends in the chin. \n- When a patient suffers an unfavorable fracture of the body of the mandible, the fracture can lead to displacement of fragments due to the action of muscles attached to the mandible.\n- The lateral pterygoid muscle is attached to the posterior part of the mandible (body). Its function includes elevating the mandible (opening the mouth) and protruding the lower lip. In case of a fracture, particularly if it's a depression or a transverse fracture, the posterior fragment may be displaced anteriorly due to the contraction of the lateral pterygoid muscle trying to perform its functions.\n  \nLet's also clarify why the other options are not correct:\n\n- A. Anterior fragment to be displaced downwards by the action of the digastric muscle: The digastric muscle is attached to the mandible but primarily functions to elevate the mandible and move the tongue. It wouldn't typically cause significant displacement of a fracture fragment.\n  \n- C. Anterior fragment to be displaced backwards by the action of the temporalis muscle: The temporalis muscle is attached to the zygomatic arch and helps in elevating the mandible and closing the jaw. It wouldn't typically cause a backward displacement of a fracture fragment unless the force of its contraction were directed in that manner, which is not a typical response for this muscle.\n  \n- D. Posterior fragment to be displaced medially by action of the medial pterygoid muscle: The medial pterygoid muscle is located on the inner side of the mandible and assists in opening the mouth. It would not typically cause a medial displacement of a fracture fragment; instead, it might contribute to the opening of the jaw following a fracture."
