This challenges the traditional notion of free will, which is often tied to moral responsibility. If individuals do not have complete control over their actions due to external factors (the luck aspect), then their moral responsibility might be questioned or diluted. Hence, the problem of moral luck is closely connected to debates about the extent to which human beings can be said to possess free will."
