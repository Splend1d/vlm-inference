Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves taking advantage of a situation where the homeowners were not present and leaving a package outside without permission, which can be seen as theft or at least trespassing, depending on the context. This is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves seeking medical care when sick with the flu. This action is not only reasonable but also encouraged by societal norms, as it promotes health and well-being for oneself and others around them. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong."
