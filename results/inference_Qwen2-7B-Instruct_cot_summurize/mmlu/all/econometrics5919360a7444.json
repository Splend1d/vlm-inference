An AR and an MA model\n\nThe partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is particularly useful in determining whether a time series is best modeled by an autoregressive (AR) process or a moving average (MA) process. \n\nIn an AR model, the PACF will typically show a sharp cutoff after a certain lag, while the autocorrelation function (ACF) will decay gradually. This is because each value in an AR model depends on its own previous values.\n\nOn the other hand, in an MA model, the ACF will typically show a sharp cutoff after a certain lag, while the PACF will decay gradually. This is because each value in an MA model depends on the errors (or \"shocks\") that occurred before it.\n\nSo, by looking at the patterns of the PACF and ACF, one can distinguish between an AR and an MA model. The PACF is thus necessary for this task."
