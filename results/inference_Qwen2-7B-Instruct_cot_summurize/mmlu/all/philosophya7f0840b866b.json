John Stuart Mill, a prominent figure in utilitarian philosophy, argued that the ultimate goal of actions should be to maximize overall happiness or pleasure. According to Mill, this does not necessarily mean focusing solely on \"lower pleasures\" ( (which he considered less fulfilling) but rather on a broad range of experiences that contribute to a rich and fulfilling life, which he refers to as \"enjoyments.\" These can include physical pleasures, intellectual pursuits, emotional connections, and spiritual experiences, among others."
