Fallacy of Composition\n\nThe statement made by John Stuart Mill reflects an understanding that what is true for each individual (each person's happiness being a good to that person) does not necessarily extend to the whole (the general happiness being a good to the aggregate of all persons). This is an example of the fallacy of composition, which occurs when one assumes that what is true of the parts must also be true of the whole. In reality, while each person's happiness contributes to the overall happiness, it doesn't automatically mean that the sum total of individual happiness equals the overall happiness in a straightforward or additive way. The relationship between individual and collective happiness can be more complex than simply adding up individual instances of happiness."
