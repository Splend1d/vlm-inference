They are primarily used for endurance activities and have a slower contraction speed compared to Type II fibers. These fibers contain more mitochondria and myoglobin ( a protein that binds to oxygen and helps deliver it to the muscles. They also have a lower myosin ATPase activity, which contributes to their slower contraction rate."
