The correct answer is:\n\nC. Companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, sieve tube\n\nIn this pathway:\n1. **Mesophyll cells** produce sucrose as a product of photosynthesis.\n2. **Companion cells** are associated with sieve tubes and facilitate the movement of sugars by maintaining turgor pressure and regulating the flow of substances between the companion cells and the sieve tubes.\n3. **Phloem parenchyma cells** store excess sugars and can transport them to other parts of the plant.\n4. **Fibers** and **bundle sheath** are not directly involved in the symplastic pathway but are part of the phloem tissue structure.\n\nThe movement continues through the sieve tubes, which are are specialized cells that allow the unidirectional flow of dissolved substances like sugars, from source to sink tissues."
