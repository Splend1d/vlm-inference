The charter included provisions for religious freedom and tolerance, which were reflected in the Charter of Privileges that Penn later issued in 1701. This charter guaranteed freedom of conscience and worship for its inhabitants, making Pennsylvania a haven for religious minorities such as Quakers and other nonconformists."
