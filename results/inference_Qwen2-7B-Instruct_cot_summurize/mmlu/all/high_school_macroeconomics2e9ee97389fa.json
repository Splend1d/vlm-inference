                    "text": "An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Chinese yuan would occur when the demand for U.S. dollars increases compared to the supply of U.S. dollars, or when the supply of Chinese yuan decreases compared to the demand for Chinese yuan. This can be influenced by various economic factors.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Lower interest rates in the United States relative to China: When interest rates are lower in the U.S. than in China, it makes investments in China more attractive due to higher returns on savings and loans. This leads to increased demand for Chinese yuan, causing its value to rise against the U.S. dollar, not the other way around.\n\nB. Lower price levels in China relative to the United States: Lower prices in China do not directly cause the U.S. dollar to appreciate against the Chinese yuan. While this might encourage more Americans to buy cheaper goods from China, it doesn't necessarily mean there's an increase in demand for Chinese yuan over U.S. dollars.\n\nC. Growing American preference to consume more Chinese-made goods: If Americans increasingly prefer to consume Chinese-made goods, it indicates higher demand for Chinese goods, thus potentially increasing demand for Chinese yuan. However, this does not necessarily lead to the U.S. dollar appreciatingating against the Chinese yuan.\n\nD. Rising per capita GDP in China increasing imports from the United States: As China's per capita GDP rises, its citizens' purchasing power increases, leading to higher demand for imported goods like those from the U.S. This would likely increase the demand for U.S. dollars to purchase these goods, thus causing the U.S. dollar to appreciate against the Chinese yuan.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Rising per capita GDP in China increasing imports from the United States**."
