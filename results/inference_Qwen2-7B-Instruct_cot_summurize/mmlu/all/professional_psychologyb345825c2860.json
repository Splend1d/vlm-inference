Cognitive dissonance theory predicts that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment, while self-perception theory predicts that participants in the $20.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment.\n\nCognitive dissonance theory suggests that when people experience a conflict between their actions and beliefs (or between two cognitions), they feel uncomfortable. This discomfort motivates them to reduce the dissonance by changing one of the cognitions to make them consistent. In this context, if participants are paid a small amount ($1.00) to endorse an uninteresting experiment, they might feel a slight dissonance because their endorsement conflicts with their personal judgment of the experiment's quality. However, the dissonance would be relatively minor since the payment is low, and thus, they may not change their liking for the experiment much.\n\nSelf-perception theory, on the other hand, posits that people infer their attitudes from their own behavior when there is no prior attitude available. When participants are paid a higher amount ($20.00) to endorse the experiment, they might feel more pressure to justify this behavior, leading to a stronger inference about their liking for the experiment. Thus, according to this theory, they might report a higher liking for the experiment after being paid such a substantial sum to endorse it."
