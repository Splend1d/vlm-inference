When the short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal, it indicates that there exist many unemployed resources in the economy, such as labor and capital. In this scenario, if output needs to be increased, firms can do so by utilizing these idle resources without having to raise wages and prices immediately. This is because the available resources can absorb the additional production without encountering constraints that would force an increase in costs.\n\nOption B suggests a situation where any increase in output directly requires a corresponding increase in wages and prices, which is not characteristic of a horizontal short-run aggregate supply curve. \n\nOption C implies that increases in output lead to price increases, but wages adjust less quickly, which could potentially flatten the short-run aggregate supply curve but does not describe a horizontal curve specifically.\n\nOption D refers to a scenario where falling interest rates increase the demand for goods and services, leading to upward pressure on prices. This is related to the aggregate demand side of the economy, rather than explaining the shape of the short-run aggregate supply curve."
