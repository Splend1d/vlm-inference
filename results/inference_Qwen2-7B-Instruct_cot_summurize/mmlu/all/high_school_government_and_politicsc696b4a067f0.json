This often leads to a \"winner-takes-all\" scenario where the candidate with the most votes wins, which can favor larger, well-funded parties over smaller third parties due to the difficulty of appealing to a broader base in each individual district. Thus, in such systems, it's more challenging for third parties to gain representation compared to systems that allow for proportional representation or multi-member districts."
