Both of the interventions\n\nNumerous studies have shown that both protein-energy supplementation during pregnancy and during the first two years of life can significantly improve child development. \n\nProtein-energy malnutrition during pregnancy can lead to low birth weight, stunting, and impaired cognitive development in children. On the other hand, inadequate nutrition in early childhood can also result in growth retardation and developmental delays. Therefore, providing adequate protein and energy is crucial for optimal child development at all stages.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the effectiveness of these interventions can depend on various factors, including the specific nutritional deficiencies being addressed, the quality and type of supplements provided, and the overall health status of the individuals receiving them. Always consult with healthcare professionals or nutritionists for tailored advice."
