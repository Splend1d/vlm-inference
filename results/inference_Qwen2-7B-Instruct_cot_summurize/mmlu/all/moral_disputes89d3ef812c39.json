She might argue that this distinction implies a utilitarian view where the morality of an action depends on its consequences rather than the nature of the action itself. This alignss with the idea that if something is merely treated ( i.e., remedied to correct an imbalance or defect, it carries less moral weight than when something is enhanced, which might imply altering nature in ways that may not necessarily correct anything but rather improve upon it.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Kamm's specific argument would depend on the context of her critique and the exact positions she takes in her work. Sandel's distinction, as presented in his book \"The Case Against Perfection,\" posits that while treatments aim to restore someone to their original state, enhancements seek to go beyond that, aiming for a better-than-original state. Kamm might critique this distinction by arguing that it doesn't properly account for the moral value inherent in the natural state of things, thus undermining the very basis of Sandel's distinction."
