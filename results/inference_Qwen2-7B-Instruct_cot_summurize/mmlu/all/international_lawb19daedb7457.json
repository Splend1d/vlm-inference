This is crucial for defining the extent of these zones, which include territorial waters, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and the continental shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The determination of baselines is instrumental to the establishment of all maritime zones, since they constitute the starting point for measuring the breadth of each zone.\n\nBaselines also help in the safe navigation of vessels by providing a clear boundary for inland waters and by facilitating the delineation of boundaries for international straits and archipelagic states. They are not solely used in maritime delimitation disputes, although they may be relevant in such contexts as well."
