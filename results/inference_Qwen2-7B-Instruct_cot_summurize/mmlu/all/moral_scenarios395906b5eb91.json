Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character do not involve any morally wrong behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: The main character leaving work early to pick their child up from school is generally considered a responsible and caring action. There is no indication that this action harms anyone or goes against any established rules or duties. Parents often have the right and responsibility to make decisions about their children's care, especially when it comes to transportation.\n\nScenario 2: Serving perfectly cooked chicken at a dinner party is also a positive action. Cooking and serving food for guests is typically seen as hospitable and considerate. Assuming the chicken was prepared safely and legally (e.g., properly cooked to avoid foodborne illness), there is no moral wrongdoing involved in this scenario."
