The stationarity of an AR(p) process depends on the roots of its characteristic equation. For an AR(2) process, the characteristic equation is given by:\n\n\u03bb^2 - \u03b11*\u03bb - \u03b12 = 0,\n\nwhere \u03bb represents the roots of the equation, and \u03b11 and \u03b12 are are the coefficients from the original AR(2) model (in this case, \u03b11 = 1.5 and \u03b12 = 0.5.\n\nSubstituting these values into the characteristic equation yields:\n\n\u03bb^2 - 1.5*\u03bb - 0.5 = 0.\n\nTo determine if this AR(2) process is stationary, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. The roots can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\n\u03bb = [1.5 \u00b1 sqrt((1.5)^2 - 4*(-0.5))]/2.\n\nCalculating the discriminant (\u0394 = ( (1.5)^2 - 4*(-0.5) = 2.25 + 2 = 4.25 > 0, which means there are two distinct real roots for the equation. However, for the process to be considered stationary, both roots must lie within the unit circle in the complex plane, i.e., their absolute values must be less than 1.\n\nGiven that \u0394 > 0, we know that there are indeed two roots. Without explicitly calculating them, we can infer that since the sum of the coefficients \u03b11 and \u03b12 is less than 2 ( (1.5 + 0.5 = 2), and the product of the coefficients \u03b11 * \u03b12 is negative (-0.5), it suggests that one root will be greater than 1 in magnitude, and the other will be less than 1 in magnitude. This implies that the AR(2) process described here is not stationary.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Explosive process"
