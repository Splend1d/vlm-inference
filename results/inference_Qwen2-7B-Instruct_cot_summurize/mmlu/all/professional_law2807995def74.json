In September 1989, the doctor executed a warranty deed conveying the timberland property to a dentist in fee simple. The dentist recorded immediately in the Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Index. Then in April 1990, the dentist conveyed the same tract to a buyer in fee simple by warranty deed. The buyer paid full market value and recorded the deed at once in the Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Index. The land in question had never been occupied, fenced, or cleared except that between the years 1986 \u0080\u00942010, a mining company, one mile from the property, regularly drove trucks over a cleared path pursuant to a 1986 agreement with the doctor. The agreement, which was duly recorded, provided that \"the parties expressly agree and the doctor promises that the doctor and his successors shall refrain from obstructing the said described pathway across the doctor's land, which the mining company and its successors may perpetually use as a road, in consideration of which the mining company and its successors will pay the sum of $700 per annum. \"In 1990, after the conveyance from the dentist, the buyer informed the mining company that he would no longer honor the 1986 agreement permitting the mining company to use the pathway. The mining company brought an action for specific performance. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the mining company, because their property interest would \"run with the land. \"\nB. the mining company, because the possessor of a servient interest would prevail against subsequent owners.\nC. the buyer, because the mining company's interest was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance.\nD. the buyer, because there was no privity of estate between the buyer and the mining company.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. the mining company, because their property interest would \"run with the land.\"\n\nWhen a property right, such as an easement, is granted to one party and runs with the land, it binds not only the original grantee but also any future owners of the property. This means that the easement continues to exist regardless of changes in ownership. In this scenario, the doctor granted the mining company an easement to use a pathway across the land in exchange for annual payments. This easement was properly recorded, indicating that it was intended to run with the land.\n\nUpon the dentist's conveyance of the property to the buyer, the easement did not automatically terminate. Instead, it became part of the land and continued to bind the new owner ( the buyer. The buyer's decision to discontinue the use of the pathway does not affect the legal validity of the easement that was already established.\n\nTherefore, when the mining company sought specific performance of the agreement (essentially asking the court to enforce the terms of the easement), the court would likely rule in favor of the mining company, upholding the easement rights that were conveyed through the original agreement and have run with the land since its inception."
