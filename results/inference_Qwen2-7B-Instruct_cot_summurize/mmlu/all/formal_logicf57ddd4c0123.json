Since there are three propositions, there will be 2^3 = 8 rows in our truth table.\n\nThe argument consists of three premises:\n1. ~X \u2283 Y ( (Negation of X implies Y)\n2. Y \u2283 Z  ( (Y implies Z)\n3. ~Z       ( (Negation of Z)\n\nAnd the conclusion is: ~X ( (Negation of X)\n\nLet's construct the truth table:\n\n| X | Y | Z | ~X | ~X \u2283 Y | Y \u2283 Z | ~Z | Conclusion |\n|---|---|---|----|--------|-------|----|-------------|\n| T | T | T | F  |   T    |   T   | F  |     F        |\n| T | T | F | F  |   T    |   T   | T  |     F        |\n| T | F | T | F  |   T    |   F   | F  |     F        |\n| T | F | F | F  |   T    |   T   | T  |     F        |\n| F | T | T | T  |   T    |   T   | F  |     T        |\n| F | T | F | T  |   T    |   T   | T  |     T        |\n| F | F | T | T  |   F    |   T   | F  |     T        |\n| F | F | F | T  |   T    |   T   | T  |     T        |\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nPremise 1: ~X \u2283 Y\nPremise 2: Y \u2283 Z\nConclusion: ~X\n\nThe argument claims that if the negation of X leads to Y, and Y leads to Z, then the negation of X must be true whenever Z is false.\n\nLooking at the truth table, we see that when Z is false ( (~Z), the conclusion ~X is true in row 4 and row 7. However, this does not necessarily mean that the premises are always true when the conclusion is true. In fact, the argument is invalid because it fails to hold in row 1 where all premises are true but the conclusion is false.\n\nThe correct answer is B. Invalid. Counterexample when X, Y, and Z are true.\n\nThe counterexample when X, Y, and Z are true shows that the argument can be invalid even when all premises seem to be true in reality. This demonstrates that the argument is not sound, meaning that it is not both valid and having all true premises."
