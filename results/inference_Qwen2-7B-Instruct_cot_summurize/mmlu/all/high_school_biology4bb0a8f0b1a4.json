HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines.\nB. The patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses.\nC. HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.\nD. A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n"

HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.\n\nThis is because when a drug like 3TC (also known as Tenofovir) is introduced into a population of HIV viruses, it selectively kills off the viruses that are not resistant to the drug. This is due to how 3TC works by interfering with the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is essential for the virus to replicate inside the host cells. When some HIV particles have mutations that make them resistant to 3TC, those viruses can survive and multiply, passing on their resistance genes to their offspring. Over time, if the treatment continues, these resistant strains can become more prevalent until they dominate the viral population."
