Therefore, it can be used for:\n\nA. Prolapsed stomas: A prolapsed stoma occurs when the stoma bulges out from the abdominal wall. A surgical support can help to keep the stoma in place and prevent further prolapse.\n\nC. Herniation around the stoma: If there is a hernia near the stoma site, a surgical support may help to stabilize the area and reduce pressure on the herniated, potentially helping to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.\n\nD. Retraction of the stoma: A retracted stoma means that the stoma has moved inward, away from the normal position. A surgical support can help to bring the stoma back to its proper location and maintain its function.\n\nOptions B ( High output stomas typically refer to conditions where the stoma produces an unusually large amount of output, which usually does not require a specific surgical support but rather appropriate dietary adjustments and management of dehydration.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers would depend on the context, but generally, options A, C, and D describe situations where a surgical support might be beneficial."
