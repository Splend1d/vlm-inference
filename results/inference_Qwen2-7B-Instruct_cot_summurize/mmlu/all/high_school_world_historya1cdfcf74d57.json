However, based on historical knowledge:\n\nBoth the French Revolution and the American Revolution were responses to several factors, but one significant commonality is related to **B. Unfair systems of taxation**.\n\nIn the case of the American Revolution, the colonists were unhappy with British taxation policies, particularly the Stamp Act and the Tea Act, which imposed taxes without their consent as part of the British Parliament.\n\nSimilarly, during the French Revolution, the system of taxation was also seen as unfair. The Estates-General, representing the three estates of French society ( clergy, nobility, and commoners), met in 1789 to address the financial crisis of the French monarchy. However, the commoners ( Third Estate) felt that their taxes were much higher than those paid by the clergy and nobility, who enjoyed tax exemptions, despite owning substantial land. This led to the formation of the National Assembly, which eventually became the National Constituent Assembly, and was a precursor to the modern French Republic.\n\nTherefore, while the passage does not explicitly state this, it's clear that both revolutions were partly driven by dissatisfaction with existing taxation systems that were perceived as unjust."
