                    "text": "D. all of the above\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. Known to exist for all of the jovian planets: While planetary rings systems are most famously associated with Jupiter and Saturn, they do not actually exist for all jovian planets. Uranus and Neptune do not have visible ring systems. However, it is theorized that they may have extremely faint or difficult-to-detect rings. Therefore, while rings are are associated with some jovian planets, not all of them possess ring systems.\n\nB. Composed of a large number of individual particles that orbit their planet in accord with Kepler's third law: This statement is accurate. Planetary rings systems consist of countless small particles, typically dust, ice, and rock, which orbit around the planet in a manner consistent with Kepler's third law. This law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nC. Nearer to their planet than any of the planet's large moons: This statement is also true. The rings of a planet are typically located closer to the planet than any of its larger moons. For example, Saturn's innermost moon, Mimas, orbits at a distance greater than Saturn's A Ring, which is one of its most prominent rings systems.\n\nIn summary, all of the statements provided accurately describe aspects of planetary rings systems, making option D the correct answer."
