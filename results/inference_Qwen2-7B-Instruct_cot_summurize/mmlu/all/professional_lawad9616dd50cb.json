False imprisonment occurs when someone restrains another person's freedom of movement without lawful authority. If the police did not have a valid reason for detaining the student, they may be liable for false imprisonment. However, this answer assumes that there was no valid arrest or other legal justification for the police's actions. If the police had probable cause for an arrest, the claim might not hold up."
