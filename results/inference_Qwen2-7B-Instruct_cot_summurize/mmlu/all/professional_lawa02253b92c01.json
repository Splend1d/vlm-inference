A church in a city located in the state wanted to acquire larger facilities for its school. The city's school board proposed a new state law that would authorize it to sell a vacant public school building, at a price below its fair market value, to the church for use as its school. If enacted, would this law be constitutional?\n\nA. No, because a statute specially authorizing the sale of the building without competitive bidding would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nC. Yes, because surplus government property is not subject to the limitations imposed by the establishment clause as incorporated into the establishment clause as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. Yes, because the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church.\n"

No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nExplanation: The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or favoring one religion over another. This principle is known as the \"wall of separation\" between church and state. When the government sells property at a discount to a religious organization, it can potentially be seen as supporting or endorsing that particular religion, which would violate the Establishment Clause. Additionally, the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause ensures that laws do not discriminate against individuals or groups based on their religious beliefs, further supporting the argument that such a law could be unconstitutional."
