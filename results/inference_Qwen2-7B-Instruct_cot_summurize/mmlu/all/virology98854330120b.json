Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the replication of RNA viruses, such as HIV. For this work, Baltimore shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975 with Renato Dulbecco and Howard Martin Temin. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The enzyme reverse transcriptase"
