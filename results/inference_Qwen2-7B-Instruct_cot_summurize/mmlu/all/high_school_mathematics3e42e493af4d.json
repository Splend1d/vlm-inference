Since he has 3 choices ( apple, orange, or banana) for each meal, the total number of combinations is:\n\n\\[3^3 = 27\\]\n\nNext, we'll calculate the number of ways he can eat only one kind of fruit across all three meals. For each type of fruit (apple, orange, or banana), there is exactly 1 way he can eat only that fruit for all three meals. Since there are 3 types of fruits, there are 3 ways he can eat only one kind of fruit:\n\n- All apples\n- All oranges\n- All bananas\n\nSo, there are 3 ways he eats only one kind of fruit.\n\nThe probability that Joe eats only one kind of fruit is therefore:\n\n\\[\\frac{3}{27} = \\frac{1}{9}\\]\n\nThus, the probability that he eats at least two different kinds of fruits is the complement of eating only one kind, which is:\n\n\\[1 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. \\(\\frac{8}{9}\\)."
