There is no harm intended or caused, and it is a reasonable response to an unexpected situation.\n\nScenario 2: Waking up on the wrong side of the bed and making the best of the day simply means that the individual had a poor start to their day but chose to proceed with a positive attitude. This does not involve any immoral actions; rather, it reflects personal emotional state and coping mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves actions that would be considered morally wrong."
