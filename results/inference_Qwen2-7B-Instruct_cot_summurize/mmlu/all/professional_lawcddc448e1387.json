                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The driver of the car should recover $27,000.\n\nHere's how the calculation works:\n\n1. **Total Fault Percentage**: The total fault percentage among the three parties (motorcyclist, car driver, and truck driver is 100% ( (or equivalently, 1).\n\n2. **Motorcyclist's Fault Percentage**: The motorcyclist is found to be 55% at fault.\n\n3. **Truck Driver's Fault Percentage**: The truck driver is found to be 20% at fault.\n\n4. **Car Driver's Fault Percentage**: The car driver is found to be 25% at fault.\n\n5. **Motorcyclist's Compensation**: The total compensation awarded to the motorcyclist is $100,000.\n\n6. **Contribution from Car Driver**: The car driver collected $45,000 from the motorcyclist, which means the car driver has paid out 45% of the total compensation ($100,000). \n\n7. **Calculating Contribution Amount**: To determine the amount the car driver should recover from the truck driver, we need to calculate the share of the total fault that corresponds to the amount the car driver has already paid out. This is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Recovery Amount} = (\\text{Car Driver's Fault Percentage}) \\times (\\text{Total Compensation})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Recovery Amount} = ( (25\\%) \\times ($100,000) = $25,000\n   \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation gives us the amount the car driver would have paid if they were solely responsible for their portion of the fault. Since the car driver only needs to pay out 25% of the total fault but has already paid out $45,000, we need to adjust our approach.\n\nInstead, we should calculate based on the proportion of the fault each party bears towards the $45,000 payment made by the car driver:\n\n- **Car Driver's Payment**: $45,000\n- **Total Fault Percentage**: 100%\n- **Motorcyclist's Fault Percentage**: 55%\n- **Truck Driver's Fault Percentage**: 20%\n- **Car Driver's Fault Percentage**: 25%\n\nTo find the proportion of the $45,000 that corresponds to the truck driver's fault percentage, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Proportion of $45,000 based on Truck Driver's Fault} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Truck Driver's Fault Percentage}}{\\text{Total Fault Percentage}}\\right) \\times \\$45,000\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\left(\\frac{20\\%}{100\\%}\\right) \\times \\$45,000 = \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\$45,000 = \\$9,000\n\\]\n\nBut since the car driver's payment is actually $45,000, which is 45% of the total $100,000, we need to calculate the correct proportion based on the actual amounts paid out:\n\nGiven that the car driver has paid out $45,000, we need to find what fraction of the total $100,000 this represents and apply it to the truck driver's fault percentage:\n\n- The car driver's $45,000 is 45% of the total compensation ($100,000), which matches the percentage of fault they bear (25%. However, to directly address the question about contribution from the truck driver, we consider the distribution based on fault percentages.\n\nThe correct approach to determine the recovery amount for the car driver from the truck driver involves understanding that the car driver has effectively paid out 25% of the total fault, corresponding to their percentage of fault. Given that the car driver has already paid $45,000, which is the amount corresponding to their 25% of the total $100,000, the calculation to determine the recovery amount from the truck driver should directly relate to the truck driver's percentage of fault in relation to the total compensation.\n\nThe correct interpretation for the recovery amount, considering the proportional fault, leads to recognizing that the car driver's payment of $45,000 aligns with their 25% fault responsibility. Thus, to determine the recovery amount from the truck driver, one should consider the proportional share of the total fault that the truck driver bears relative to the car driver's payment. However, my previous explanation inadvertently led to a misinterpretation in the final calculation step, focusing on the direct application of percentages without correctly applying the proportional share based"
