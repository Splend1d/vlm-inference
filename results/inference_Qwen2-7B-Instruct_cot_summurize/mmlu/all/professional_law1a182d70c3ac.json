The landowner accepted the award of fair market value and did not appeal. For the next 15 years, the agency held the property but did not implement an educational use for it. In year 16, the agency abandoned the intended education use and sold it at a properly advertised auction under state law. The original landowner appealed, arguing that the agency only took a fee simple determinable and when it ceased its intended educational use, superior fee simple title reverted back to the original owner. Will the appellate court likely rule that the landowner can assert rights to stop the attempted transfer?\n\nA. No, because the state also acquired fee simple title by adverse possession after 11 continuous, uninterrupted years of possession.\nB. No, because the original transfer was legally conducted and the landowner received fair market value, thereby allowing a presumption of fee simple title in the agency.\nC. Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency.\nD. Yes, because every eminent domain taking implies a fee simple determinable aspect to the governmental acquisition.\n"

Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency.\n\nIn this scenario, the state initially obtained the land through eminent domain, which typically means the property was taken for a public use with just compensation. However, if the state failed to use the property for its intended educational purpose within a reasonable time (after acquiring it, this could potentially undermine the nature of the taking as an urgent necessity for public use. \n\nIf the state held the property for 15 years without implementing the educational use and then abandoned it, this could indicate that the original purpose for which eminent domain was invoked may no longer qualify as an \"urgent need\" or \"public use.\" In legal terms, this could imply that the state's interest in the property had lapsed, possibly leading to the reversion of the title to the original owner or, in some cases, to the state itself if the property is deemed surplus and returned to public ownership.\n\nIt's important to note that the specifics of eminent domain laws can vary significantly between jurisdictions, and the precise outcome would depend on the laws applicable in the specific state where the case occurred. However, the principle that the property must be used for the stated public purpose or face potential reversion is a common legal concept."
