During the course of their marriage, the beatings became more violent and more frequent. Unable to endure the physical abuse any longer, the wife hired a hit man to kill her husband. One night while the husband was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the wife and shot the husband to death. Afterward, the wife was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. At trial, the prosecution presented the facts outlined above. Thereafter, the defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the wife acted in self- defense under the battered women's syndrome. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury?\n\nA. No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.\nB. No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.\nC. Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self- defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.\nD. Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury.\n"

Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self-defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.\n\nThe battered women's syndrome refers to a condition where a woman who has been subjected to chronic abuse may perceive threats differently than others. In such situations, the victim may believe that she is in imminent danger, and thus, might feel justified in using deadly force to protect herself. This belief can be influenced by a pattern of abuse and fear of further harm.\n\nIn this case, the wife had endured years of physical abuse at the hands of her husband, which escalated over time. The fact that the husband's violence was consistent and increasingly severe suggests that the wife might genuinely perceive her situation as one of continuous threat, necessitating self-defense measures. \n\nGiven the wife's situation, it is plausible for a jury to consider her actions as a response to a perceived immediate and serious threat to her life, justifying her use of deadly force, and conclude that she acted in self-defense. Therefore, the judge should provide the instruction that the wife acted under the battered women's syndrome, allowing the jury to deliberate on whether her actions constituted self-defense in the context of the specific circumstances described."
