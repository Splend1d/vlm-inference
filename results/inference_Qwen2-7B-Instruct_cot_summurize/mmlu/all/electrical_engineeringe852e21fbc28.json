Increased Power Transfer Capability: Higher voltages allow for more power to be transmitted through a given conductor or set of conductors, without needing to significantly increase the size of the conductors themselves. This increases the efficiency and capacity of the transmission system.\n\nB. Reduced Transmission Line Losses: At higher voltages, the current flowing through the transmission lines is lower compared to lower voltage systems. Since electrical resistance causes power loss in the form of heat (which is proportional to the square of the current), reducing the current results in less power loss.\n\nC. Smaller Cross-Section and Volume of Conductors: Using higher voltages means that you can use thinner, smaller conductors to transmit the same amount of power as you would with lower voltages. This reduces the materials needed for the conductors, which can lead to cost savings and also simplifies the design and construction of the transmission infrastructure. It also allows for easier handling, transportation, and installation of the conductors."
