This is because variable costs include expenses that vary with the level of production such as raw materials and labor. If the price falls below the minimum average variable cost, it means the firm cannot even cover its variable costs, let alone contribute to covering fixed costs. Thus, it would be more financially prudent for the firm to shut down in the short run to minimize losses by not producing any output."
