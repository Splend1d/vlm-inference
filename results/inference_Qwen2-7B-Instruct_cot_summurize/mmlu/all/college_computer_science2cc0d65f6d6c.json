The program executes on a time-sharing system.\n\nBusy-waiting (or polling) is a technique where the program repeatedly checks if the event it's waiting for has occurred, without doing any other useful work in between checks. This approach might not be reasonable in a time-sharing system, where multiple tasks are running concurrently and efficiently using CPU time is crucial. The system scheduler would likely prefer that the program yield control to other processes rather than wasting CPU cycles by busy-waiting.\n\nReasons for not considering busy-waiting as a reasonable choice:\n\nA. If the wait is expected to be short, busy-waiting can be efficient since there's little need for other work to do. However, this doesn't necessarily make it a reasonable choice across all scenarios.\n\nB. While it's true that implementing a busy-wait loop might be simpler than coding an interrupt handler, the simplicity should not override efficiency considerations, especially in resource-constrained environments or when dealing with long waits.\n\nC. If there is no other work for the processor to do, busy-waiting might seem like an efficient use of resources. However, in most practical cases, there will be better ways to utilize the processor's time, such as performing useful computations or waiting for other I/O events.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct answer: On a time-sharing system, busy-waiting is generally not considered a reasonable justification because it can lead to inefficient use of CPU time, potentially causing delays for other processes waiting for their turn."
