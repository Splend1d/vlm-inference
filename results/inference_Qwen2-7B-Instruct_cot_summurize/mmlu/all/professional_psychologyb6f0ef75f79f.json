They help individuals know what is expected of them and how they should act in various contexts, such as at a faculty meeting, at a wedding, or in a restaurant. Heuristics and prototypes are cognitive shortcuts used for problem-solving and categorization, while \"life space\" does not specifically refer to a concept used in social psychology for determining behavior in specific situations."
