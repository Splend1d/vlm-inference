Biased and inconsistent\n\nWhen Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is applied to an equation that is part of a simultaneous system without accounting for the interdependencies between the equations, the estimates will typically be biased and inconsistent. This is because the error terms in each equation may be correlated with the explanatory variables due to omitted variable bias or simultaneity, which violates one of the key assumptions of OLS. In such cases, methods like instrumental variables or two-stage least squares might be more appropriate."
