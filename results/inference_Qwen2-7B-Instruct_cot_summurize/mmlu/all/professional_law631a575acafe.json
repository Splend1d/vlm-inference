Yes, statement against interest.\n\nOfficer Friendly's testimony would likely fall under the category of a \"statement against interest.\" This is because Polly's statement could reasonably be seen as incriminating herself in the wrongful death of Justin. She admits to negligence which led to the death, potentially implicating herself in criminal wrongdoing or civil liability. Such statements are often admissible under certain exceptions to the hearsay rule, specifically when they are against the declarant's own interest at the time they were made."
