Context effects in perception refer to how our understanding and interpretation of sensory information can be influenced by the surrounding environment or the presence of other stimuli. In Michelle's case, her familiarity with David Letterman from watching him on television is likely due to the context provided by the media, whereas encountering him in everyday life without that context led to her not recognizing him."
