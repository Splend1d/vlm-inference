She argues that the specification of virtues is not a straightforward process and involves several complexities:\n\nB. Might sometimes turn out to be a disjunction: Nussbaum suggests that virtues might not always have a single, clear-cut definition or expression but could sometimes involve a disjunction\u2014meaning that there could be multiple ways or forms of expressing a virtue depending on the context or cultural setting.\n\nC. Is necessarily relative to a culture: Nussbaum emphasizes that virtues are not universal but are culturally specific. This means that what is considered a virtue in one culture might not be so in another. Virtues are are shaped by and reflect the values, norms, and social conditions of a particular society.\n\nA. Will always consist of a single answer: This claim does not align with Nussbaum's views. She acknowledges the complexity and diversity in how virtues manifest and suggests that virtues can have multifaceted expressions.\n\nD. Can be settled in such a way as to be no longer revisable: This statement goes against the idea of virtues being adaptable and responsive to societal changes and philosophical advancements. Nussbaum advocates for a dynamic understanding of virtues that allows for revision and adaptation based on new insights, experiences, and cultural shifts.\n\nIn summary, Nussbaum's view on virtues is nuanced, emphasizing their cultural specificity, contextual variability, and the need for them to be open to revision and reinterpretation."
