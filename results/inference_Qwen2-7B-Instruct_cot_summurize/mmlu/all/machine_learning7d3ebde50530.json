The computation of the gradient requires evaluating the partial derivatives with respect to each parameter. Therefore, for each iteration, the computational complexity is generally considered to be linear in \\(D\\), because we need to perform \\(D\\) operations (one for each dimension.\n\nSo, option A. \"linear in \\(D\\)\" is correct in terms of the per-iteration complexity, assuming that the cost of performing one operation does not vary significantly across dimensions.\n\nHowever, if we also consider the total number of iterations \\(N\\) required to reach a certain level of accuracy or convergence, then the overall computational complexity would be dependent on both \\(D\\) and \\(N\\). In practice, without specific details about how the algorithm performs over time (e.g., whether it converges quickly or slowly), it's difficult to precisely state the complexity in terms of \\(N\\). \n\nTherefore, based solely on the information provided, the most accurate answer is **A. linear in D**, as this directly addresses the complexity per iteration. If the question implied a broader view considering multiple iterations, then the complexity could also depend on \\(N\\), but without additional context, option A is the most appropriate choice."
