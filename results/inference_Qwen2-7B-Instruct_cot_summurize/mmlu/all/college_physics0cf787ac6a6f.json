Its motion can be described using circular motion equations. The centripetal acceleration \\(a_c\\) for an object moving in a circle is given by:\n\n\\[a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r}\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity,\n- \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven that the radius \\(r = 10\\) meters, we can express the centripetal acceleration as:\n\n\\[a_c = \\frac{v^2}{10}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Given Information\nAt one instant, the particle's speed \\(v = 10\\) m/s and its acceleration is increasing at a rate of \\(10\\) m/s\u00b2. This rate of change of acceleration is actually the angular acceleration (\\(\\alpha\\)) because the linear acceleration (which is tangential to the circle and changes due to the centripetal acceleration) is what's increasing at \\(10\\) m/s\u00b2.\n\n### Step 3: Relating Linear and Angular Accelerations\nAngular acceleration (\\(\\alpha\\)) is related to linear acceleration (\\(a\\)) and the radius (\\(r\\)) by:\n\n\\[\\alpha = \\frac{a}{r}\\]\n\nGiven \\(a = 10\\) m/s\u00b2 and \\(r = 10\\) m, we find:\n\n\\[\\alpha = \\frac{10}{10} = 1\\] rad/s\u00b2\n\n### Step 4: Velocity and Acceleration Vectors\nIn circular motion, the velocity vector is always tangent to the circle, and the acceleration vector is always directed towards the center of the circle, known as centripetal acceleration. The velocity vector changes direction but not magnitude, while the centripetal acceleration changes both direction and magnitude. \n\n### Step 5: Angle Between Velocity and Acceleration Vectors\nThe angle between these two vectors is always \\(90^\\circ\\) in circular motion. This is because they are perpendicular to each other. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. 0\u00b0**\n\nThis is a bit of a trick question since it's asking for the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors, which are are always perpendicular in circular motion, thus the angle is \\(90^\\circ\\). However, since this option isn't available, there seems to be a misunderstanding in interpreting the answer choices. Typically, in circular motion, the angle between velocity and acceleration (when considering their direction relative to each other, would be \\(90^\\circ\\), not matching any of the provided options directly."
