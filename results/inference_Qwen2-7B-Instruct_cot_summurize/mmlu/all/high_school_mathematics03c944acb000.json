Given that seven pens cost $9.24, we can find the cost of one pen by dividing the total cost by the number of pens:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one pen} = \\frac{\\$9.24}{7} = \\$1.32 \\]\n\nNext, we know that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. Since we've found the cost of one pen to be $1.32, the cost of three pens would be:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times \\$1.32 = \\$3.96 \\]\n\nThis means that eleven pencils together cost $3.96. To find the cost of one pencil, we divide this amount by eleven:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\frac{\\$3.96}{11} = \\$0.36 \\]\n\nSince the question asks for the cost in cents, and $0.36 equals 36 cents, the answer is:\n\nC. 36"
