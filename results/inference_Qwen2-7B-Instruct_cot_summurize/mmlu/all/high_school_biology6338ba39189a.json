Tropical rainforest.\n\nTropical rainforests are known for their high biodiversity, often referred to as the \"lungs of the Earth\" due to their high levels of plant and animal life. They have an incredibly diverse range of species, which is why a researcher would likely find 35% more species in a tropical rainforest compared to other biomes. \n\nHere's a brief comparison:\n\nA. Tundra: These are cold, treeless landscapes that receive very little precipitation and have permafrost ( perennially frozen ground. Biodiversity in tundra regions is low due to the harsh climate.\n\nB. Taiga: Also known as boreal forests, they cover large areas in Russia, Canada, and Alaska. Taigas are home to fewer species compared to rainforests but more than tundras.\n\nD. Temperate Deciduous Forest: These forests are characterized by trees that lose their leaves annually. They typically have less species diversity compared to tropical rainforests but more than taiga or tundra environments.\n\nSo, considering the high biodiversity associated with tropical rainforests, the researcher is most likely in a tropical rainforest."
