Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, sitting astride a horse and prodding it to carry you is generally considered acceptable behavior, assuming the person has the right to ride the horse and the horse is capable and willing to be ridden. There's no clear violation of rights or laws in this scenario, making it not wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, driving away from a campsite with smoldering coals left unattended could potentially lead to wildfires, which is a serious environmental hazard and illegal in many jurisdictions. This action disregards the responsibility to prevent harm to others and the environment, making it morally wrong according to ordinary standards."
