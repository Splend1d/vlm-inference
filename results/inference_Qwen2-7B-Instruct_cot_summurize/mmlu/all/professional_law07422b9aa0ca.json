They should also have the opportunity to present their case in a formal setting where evidence can be presented, examined, and considered. This ensures that the decision-making process is fair and transparent, respecting the rights of the individual involved.\n\nOptions B, C, and D may be part of the process but do not fully capture the requirement for an evidentiary hearing which is crucial in such legal proceedings."
