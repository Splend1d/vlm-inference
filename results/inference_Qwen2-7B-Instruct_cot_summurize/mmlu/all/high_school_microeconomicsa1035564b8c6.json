This is because marginal revenue represents the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit of a product, and in a monopoly, this can be calculated as the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. Since the demand curve is downward sloping, the marginal revenue curve will be below it, reflecting the fact that each additional unit sold requires a lower price than the previous one. However, it won't touch the vertical axis because if the price were set infinitely high, the quantity demanded would be zero, and thus there would be no additional revenue from selling any units. Therefore, the marginal revenue curve will be at half the distance between the demand curve and the vertical axis."
