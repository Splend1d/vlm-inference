An open elevator, which had been installed in the building by the elevator manufacturer, was used to haul workers and building materials between floors. While the worker was riding the elevator, it stalled between floors due to a manufacturing defect in the elevator. The worker called for assistance and was in no danger, but after waiting 15 minutes for help, he became anxious and jumped 12 feet to get out. He severely injured his back when he landed. In an action by the worker against the elevator manufacturer to recover for his back injury, is the worker likely to obtain a judgment for 100% of his damages?\n\nA. No, because such risks are inherent in construction work.\nB. No, because the worker was not in danger while on the stalled elevator. while on the stalled elevator.\nC. Yes, because the elevator stalled due to a manufacturing defect.\nD. Yes, because the worker was falsely imprisoned in the stalled elevator.\n"

Yes, because the elevator stalled due to a manufacturing defect.\n\nIn this scenario, the worker's injury occurred as a direct result of a manufacturing defect in the elevator, which was under the control and responsibility of the elevator manufacturer. The worker did not assume any inherent risk specific to the construction work itself; rather, the injury was caused by the malfunction of a piece of equipment provided and maintained by the elevator manufacturer. \n\nIn legal terms, a manufacturer may be held liable for defects in their product that cause harm, particularly if the defect is proven to be a direct cause of the injury. The fact that the worker was not in immediate danger while on the stalled elevator does not negate the manufacturer's liability for the defect that led to the need for him to jump and sustain injuries. \n\nTherefore, the worker is more likely to obtain a judgment for his damages based on the manufacturer's negligence in producing a defective elevator, assuming the other conditions for liability ( such as breach of duty, causation, and damages - are also met."
