A positive cross-price elasticity, such as +2.0, indicates that goods X and Y are substitutes. When the price of one good (X) increases, consumers tend to buy more of the other good (Y), and vice versa. The magnitude of the elasticity (+2.0) shows how sensitive the demand for one good is to changes in the price of the other."
