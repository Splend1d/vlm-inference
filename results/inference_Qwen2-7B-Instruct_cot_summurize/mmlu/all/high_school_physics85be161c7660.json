                    "text": "In an elastic collision between two objects, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Given an object of mass \\(m_1\\) experiencing a linear, elastic collision with a stationary object ( implying the second object has mass \\(m_2\\), we can apply these principles to solve for \\(m_2\\).\n\nThe equations representing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy in such a scenario are:\n\n\\[m_1v_{1i} + m_2v_{2i} = m_1v_{1f} + m_2v_{2f}\\]  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1i}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2i}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1f}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2f}^2\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(v_{1i}\\) and \\(v_{2i}\\) are the initial velocities,\n- \\(v_{1f}\\) and \\(v_{2f}\\) are the final velocities.\n\nGiven the second object is initially stationary (\\(v_{2i}=0\\)), the equations simplify, but we still need at least one velocity value from each object to solve for the mass of the other object.\n\nOption A provides the final velocity of object 1, which gives us \\(v_{1f}\\). However, without knowing either the initial velocity of object 1 or the final velocity of object 2, we cannot directly solve for \\(m_2\\). Option C provides the final velocity of object 2, which could be used if we know \\(v_{1i}\\) to solve for \\(m_2\\), but it's not enough on its own since we also need \\(v_{1f}\\) to use the conservation of momentum equation effectively.\n\nOption B provides the initial velocity of object 1, which allows us to find \\(v_{1f}\\) if we know \\(v_{2f}\\) using the conservation of momentum equation. However, without knowing \\(v_{2f}\\), we cannot solve for \\(m_2\\) directly from this information alone.\n\nOption D suggests using any two of the above values. If we combine options A and B, we have \\(v_{1f}\\) and \\(v_{1i}\\), which, along with \\(v_{2i}=0\\), allow us to solve for \\(m_2\\) using the conservation of momentum equation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Any 2 of the above values**. Specifically, knowing the final velocity of object 1 and the initial velocity of object 1 ( (option A and option B respectively) allows us to determine the mass of the second object through the principle of conservation of momentum."
