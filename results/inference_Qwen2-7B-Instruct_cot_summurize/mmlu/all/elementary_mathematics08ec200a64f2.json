Since the total cost for four tickets is $112, we can express this as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one ticket} \\times \\text{Number of tickets} = \\text{Total cost} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we have:\n\n\\[ t \\times 4 = 112 \\]\n\nTo find the cost of one ticket (\\(t\\)), we need to isolate \\(t\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ \\frac{t \\times 4}{4} = \\frac{112}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ t = 28 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of one ticket is $28. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\(4t = 112\\); $28"
