He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?\n\nA. Carvedilol\nB. Furosemide\nC. Metoprolol\nD. Phentolamine\n"

                    "text": "The most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time would be C. Metoprolol.\n\nThis is based on the patient's symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, which may suggest an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), despite not having ST-segment elevation on the ECG, which would indicate a more specific diagnosis like STEMI. However, the high blood pressure (200/100 mmHg) suggests the presence of hypertension, which could contribute to the symptoms. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, can help control hypertension, reduce myocardial oxygen demand, and alleviate symptoms of ACS by reducing heart rate and contractility.\n\nCarvedilol (A. is also a beta-blocker but also has alpha-blocking properties, which might not be necessary immediately given the patient's condition.\nF. Furosemide is a diuretic, primarily used for managing fluid overload and congestion, which does not seem to be a primary concern based on the description.\n d. Phentolamine is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, typically used for treating hypertension or pheochromocytoma (a rare adrenal tumor, but it is not typically used as initial treatment for suspected ACS.\n\nTherefore, Metoprolol is the most suitable choice considering the patient's current symptoms and potential diagnosis."
