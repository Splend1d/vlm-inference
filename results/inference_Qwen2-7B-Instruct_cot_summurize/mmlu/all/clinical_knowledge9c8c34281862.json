This is because purines ( adenine (A and guanine G) always pair with pyrimidines ( thymine T and cytosine C) in a double helix structure. This pairing rule, known as base pairing or complementary base pairing, ensures that for every A there is a T, and for every G there is a C. Since each strand of DNA must be complementary to its partner, this leads to a consistent ratio of 1:1 for purines to pyrimidines per base pair. This ratio can vary between different organisms due to differences in their genetic makeup, but within a given organism, it is consistent across all DNA molecules."
