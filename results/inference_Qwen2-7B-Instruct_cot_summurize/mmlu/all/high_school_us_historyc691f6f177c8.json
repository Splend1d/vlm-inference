Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nWhich other nineteenth-century reform movement made similar arguments to those written here by Susan B.

This sentiment alignes most closely with the principles espoused by the C. Abolition movement, particularly as it relates to the fight against slavery and the broader implications for justice and equality.\n\nThe abolition movement sought to end slavery in the United States, advocating that the practice was inherently unjust and morally wrong. Leaders within this movement argued that the institution of slavery affected the entire nation and that freedom for enslaved people was essential for the moral and social health of the country. They also highlighted the interdependence of all citizens and the shared responsibility to work towards justice and equality for all, not just for those directly impacted by a specific issue.\n\nWhile each of the other options listed ( A. Temperance movement, B. Utopian communities, and D. Public school advocates \u2013 had their own unique goals and arguments for reform, they do not directly echo the interconnectedness and universal responsibility for justice that is central to King's message."
