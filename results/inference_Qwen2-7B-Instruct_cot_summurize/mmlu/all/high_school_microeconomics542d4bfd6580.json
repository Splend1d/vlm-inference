The total welfare is maximized.\n\nIn a competitive market, the interaction of supply and demand leads to an efficient allocation of resources where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded at the market price. This results in a situation where the total welfare ( or the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus, is maximized. Consumer surplus represents the benefit consumers receive by paying a price lower than what they are willing to pay, while producer surplus represents the benefit producers receive by selling their goods for more than their cost of production. \n\nA competitive market ensures that these surpluses are distributed efficiently, with no waste or deadweight loss, leading to the best overall outcome for society. Therefore, option B correctly identifies the reason why a competitive market provides the best outcome for society."
