It works by reducing the amount of fluid produced in the eye and decreasing the pressure within the eye, thus helping to prevent or reduce glaucoma damage. However, beta-blockers can also block the effects of adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) in the body. This includes the lungs, where adrenaline helps to open the airways. In people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, beta-blockers like timolol can potentially worsen symptoms like shortness of breath.\n\nApraclonidine, epinephrine, and latanoprost are not typically associated with causing shortness of breath as a side effect when used for glaucoma treatment. Therefore, among the options provided, timolol is the most likely culprit based on its mechanism of action and potential side effects."
