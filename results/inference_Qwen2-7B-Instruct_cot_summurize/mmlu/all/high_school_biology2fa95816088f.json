It must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population.\n\nGenetic variation is crucial for evolution because it provides the raw material that natural selection acts upon. Natural selection does not create genetic variation; it acts on the variation that already exists within a population. Therefore, option C correctly states that genetic variation must be present in a population before natural selection can occur. \n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because natural selection itself does not create genetic variation (it selects for or against existing variation based on its impact on survival and reproduction. Option D is also incorrect because while genetic processes like meiosis can reduce the variety of alleles through random assortment and independent assortment, this reduction is not inherently a result of natural selection but rather a consequence of sexual reproduction."
