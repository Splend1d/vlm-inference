A grayish, milky fluid\n\nThe presence of water in a hydraulic system is often indicated by a fluid that appears cloudy or milky, which can turn the oil a grayish color. This is because water has a lower specific gravity than oil and floats on top, creating this appearance. It's important to address this issue promptly as it can lead to decreased performance and potential damage to the hydraulic components."
