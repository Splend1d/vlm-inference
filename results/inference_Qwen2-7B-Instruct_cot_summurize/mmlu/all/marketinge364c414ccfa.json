Translation equivalence. \n\nTranslation equivalence refers to the process of translating text from one language to another while maintaining its meaning and structure. While it is an important aspect of international market research, it is not considered one of the three main types of equivalence.\n\nConceptual equivalence refers to the idea that the meaning of a concept or term is the same across different languages and cultures. Market equivalence refers to the idea that the market conditions and behaviors are similar across different countries. Functional equivalence refers to the idea that a product or service can be used in the same way across different markets, regardless of cultural differences."
