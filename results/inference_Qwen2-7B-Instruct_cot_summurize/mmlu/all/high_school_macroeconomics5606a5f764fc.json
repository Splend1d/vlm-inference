An increase in the cost of resources (like raw materials or energy, for example, can make it more expensive and less profitable for businesses to produce, thus reducing the overall supply in the market. This is considered a negative supply shock because it leads to higher prices and potentially lower economic output. \n\nLet's quickly go through the other options:\n\nA. A decrease in government spending could reduce demand in the economy but does not directly impact the supply side unless it affects investment or confidence in the economy.\n\nB. A decrease in the real interest rate might stimulate borrowing and investment, potentially increasing supply if businesses invest in more production capacity. It doesn't qualify as a negative supply shock.\n\nC. An increase in the money supply typically leads to lower interest rates and increased spending, which can boost demand rather than negatively impacting supply. However, if the increase in money supply leads to inflation without a corresponding increase in productive capacity, it could indirectly lead to higher costs and lower supply, but this isn't the direct cause of supply shocks."
