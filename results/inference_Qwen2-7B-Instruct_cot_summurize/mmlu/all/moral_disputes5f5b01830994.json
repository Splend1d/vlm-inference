This form of consequentialism suggests that the morality of an action is determined solely by its consequences, with the rightness or wrongness of the action depending on whether it produces the greatest overall good (utility. \n\nIn his book \"Why Terrorists Don't Win: Defeating Fundamentalism in the Global Arena\", Dershowitz discusses how, in his view, if a specific terrorist attack results in significantly greater long-term benefits than harms, such as preventing a far greater number of deaths from an opposing group's genocidal ambitions, then from the perspective of act utilitarianism, the act of terrorism could be morally justifiable. However, this is a controversial stance and not universally accepted within the ethical community."
