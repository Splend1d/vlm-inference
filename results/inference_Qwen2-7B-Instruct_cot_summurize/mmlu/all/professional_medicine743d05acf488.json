Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 100/mm3 (5% segmented neutrophils and 95% lymphocytes).

It stimulates the bone marrow to produce more neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell important for fighting infections. In patients undergoing chemotherapy who develop neutropenia (low neutrophil count, G-CSF like filgrastim can be used to stimulate white blood cell production. \n\nThe patient described in the question is experiencing fever, which could indicate infection, and has low leukocyte count with a predominance of lymphocytes. This suggests neutropenia. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count would be Filgrastim (Option C.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not fit the situation:\n\nA. Darbepoetin is used to treat anemia, not to increase white blood cell count.\n\nB. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can suppress the immune system and is not typically used to increase leukocyte counts.\n\nD. Interferon alpha is used to treat viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer, but it does not directly increase white blood cell count."
