After apply batch normalization, the layer\u2019s activations will follow a standard Gaussian distribution.\n\nBatch normalization ( or \"batch norm\" for short, does not necessarily force the activations to follow a standard Gaussian distribution. It normalizes the inputs of each layer to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, which can help in stabilizing and accelerating the training process, but it doesn't change the distribution of the input data itself.\n\nB. The bias parameter of affine layers becomes redundant if a batch normalization layer follows immediately afterward.\n\nThis statement is generally true. Batch normalization shifts the normalized output by a learned bias term. This means that while the bias is still necessary to learn an offset for the normalized values, its role might be considered less critical than in non-normalized networks, as the normalization process already adjusts the scale and shifts the mean of the inputs. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the bias parameter is redundant in the strictest sense, as it still contributes to the learning process.\n\nC. The standard weight initialization must be changed when using Batch Normalization.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. While some guidelines suggest using different weight initialization techniques when using batch normalization, it's not a strict requirement. The choice of weight initialization often depends on other factors such as the activation function used, the architecture of the network, and the specific problem being addressed. However, it's commonly advised to use a smaller standard deviation for the initial weights to help stabilize the training process.\n\nD. Batch Normalization is equivalent to Layer Normalization for convolutional neural networks.\n\nThis statement is false. While both batch normalization and layer normalization normalize the activations across neurons within a layer, they do so under different contexts. Batch normalization operates on mini-batches of data, normalizing activations across examples within a single mini-batch. In contrast, layer normalization ( also known as \"group normalization\" - normalizes across the entire feature map of each channel, making it more computationally efficient and suitable for larger mini-batches and smaller models."
