After a hearing, the state court ordered possession of the land surrendered to the corporation, prior to determination of compensation, upon deposit in court of a sum deemed adequate to cover damages that might be awarded. The timber company immediately commenced an action to enjoin the court-ordered sale of its property. Which of the following would be the best ground for upholding the state court's order?\n\nA. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity.\nB. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\nC. The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a \"taking. \"\nD. The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain, incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states, does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n"

The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\n\nThis is because the power of eminent domain is typically granted to the government (whether federal, state, or local, depending on jurisdiction, to take private property for a public use. When a state delegation of eminent domain authority occurs, it must be done through a legislative act. This ensures that the process is transparent and subject to oversight by the legislature, which can review and potentially revise the delegation if necessary. It also helps protect against potential misuse of the power by private interests. \n\nOptions A and C are not accurate grounds for upholding the state court's order because they involve specific legal principles that do not necessarily apply to the question of whether a particular delegation of eminent domain authority is valid. Option D pertains to the due process rights of the property owner regarding compensation but does not address the validity of the delegation of eminent domain authority itself."
