Confounding.\n\nConfounding occurs when a third variable (confounding variable) influences both the independent and dependent variables, potentially distorting the observed association. In this scenario, the knowledge of the patient's race by the first group of pathologists could lead to biased interpretations or diagnoses based on preconceived notions about race and disease, rather than solely on the specimen itself. This introduces confounding bias, where the effect of race on diagnosis is mixed with the effect of the pathologist's expectations influenced by racial stereotypes. The second group, being blinded to the patient's race, helps to mitigate this bias by reducing the influence of such expectations on their diagnostic conclusions."
