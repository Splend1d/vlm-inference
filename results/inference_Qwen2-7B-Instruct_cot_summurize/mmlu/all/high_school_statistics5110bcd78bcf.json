Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\n\nThe reason for choosing stratified sampling in this context is that the company operates in offices across different countries, each potentially having distinct cultural, social, and legal perspectives on smoking bans. By dividing the population into strata based on these offices (or countries, if considering them as separate entities for the purpose of the study), the company can ensure that the sample reflects the diversity of opinions within each distinct environment. This approach allows for more accurate and representative estimates of the proportion of employees in favor of a smoking ban, taking into account the potential variability across locations.\n\nCluster sampling could also be considered if the offices themselves were not easily accessible or if it was logistically challenging to reach all employees within an office. However, given that the offices are likely already known and accessible, stratified sampling seems more appropriate.\n\nSimple random sampling could provide unbiased results under ideal conditions, but it might not adequately capture the complexities introduced by geographical and cultural differences. Stratified sampling specifically addresses these differences by ensuring that each stratum is represented in the sample, thus providing a more nuanced understanding of the overall population's views."
