She was running late for the meeting and could not find a legal parking spot, so she decided to park illegally in front of a fire hydrant. This was in violation of a local ordinance that prohibited parking within 50 feet of a fire hydrant. The lawyer figured that it was better to get a ticket than to miss her meeting with an important client. The spot where she parked was next to the site of the construction of the new building. While the lawyer was at her meeting, an accident occurred at the construction site. A large crane was being used to lift a load of bricks. A cable on the crane broke, and the bricks fell. Most of them landed on top of the lawyer's car. The load of bricks that fell on the lawyer's car caused the gas tank of the car to rupture and explode. Shrapnel from the explosion flew in all directions and injured a pedestrian who was talking on the sidewalk near the lawyer's car. If the pedestrian sues the lawyer and relies on the doctrine of negligence per Se, which of the following, if true, is the lawyer's best defense?\n\nA. Payment of a small fine is the only penalty provided in the ordinance for those who park too close to fire hydrants.\nB. The police never issued a ticket to the lawyer for parking in front of the fire hydrant.\nC. The purpose. of the parking ordinance was tofacilitate access to the hydrant by fire trucks,not to protect against accidents like the onethat occurred when bricks fell on the lawyer'scar.\nD. The pedestrian would not have been injured ifthe construction company had properly maintained the crane.\n"

In this case, the lawyer violated the local ordinance by parking illegally in front of a fire hydrant. However, to successfully assert negligence per se as a defense, the lawyer must show that the violation of the statute or regulation directly relates to the harm suffered.\n\nOption C addresses this relationship by suggesting that the parking ordinance was designed with a different purpose in mind (\u2014 facilitating access to the hydrant for fire trucks \u2014 rather than preventing accidents involving falling debris from construction sites. This distinction may weaken the argument that the lawyer's violation of the parking ordinance directly contributed to the pedestrian's injuries.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not effectively address the issue of whether the parking ordinance was relevant to the harm caused by the construction site accident. Option A focuses on the legal penalties for parking violations, which does not directly address the relationship between the parking violation and the accident. Option B simply confirms the violation but does not provide a defense. Option D suggests that proper maintenance of the crane could have prevented the accident, shifting blame away from the parking violation.\n\nTherefore, option C is the lawyer's best defense because it questions the direct relevance of the parking ordinance to the harm caused by the construction accident."
