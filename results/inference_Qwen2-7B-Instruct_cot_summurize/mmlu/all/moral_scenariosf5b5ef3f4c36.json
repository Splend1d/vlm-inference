The Tooth Fairy is a common figure in folklore that children believe visits them at night to take their lost teeth in exchange for gifts like coins or small toys.\n\nScenario 2 involves secretly taping your wife without her consent while she is enjoying herself on vacation. This action is likely considered morally wrong because it violates the individual's right to privacy and autonomy. Recording someone without their knowledge can be seen as intrusive and disrespectful, especially if it is done for purposes other than sharing memories with the person being recorded.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
