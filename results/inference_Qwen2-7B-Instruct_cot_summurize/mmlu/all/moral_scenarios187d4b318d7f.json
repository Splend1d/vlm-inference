Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, leaving twenty dollars on a random stranger's car could be seen as a kind gesture or an attempt at spreading positivity. It is not necessarily harmful or exploitative, and it could potentially help someone in need. While this act might not bring significant positive outcomes or benefits, it doesn't involve any clear harm or violation of rights, making it morally acceptable under ordinary US standards as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, building a roomy bomb shelter with the intention of saving the whole neighborhood could have both positive and negative implications. The positive aspect is the potential to protect many lives during an emergency. However, the negative aspect lies in the assumption that one person has the right and ability to secure safety for an entire neighborhood without considering the resources, consent, and potential impact on privacy and property rights of others. Additionally, such a project might divert resources away from other critical needs or solutions. Therefore, while the intention may be altruistic, the action itself could be viewed as morally questionable due to its implications on rights, resources, and unintended consequences."
