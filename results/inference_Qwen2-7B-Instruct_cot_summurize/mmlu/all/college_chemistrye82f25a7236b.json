However, the question seems to have been designed around a simplified or rounded calculation. Let's consider the options given and see which one matches:\n\nA. 14N - Nitrogen-14 has a nuclear spin of 1/2, not 1, so it would not match the given magnetic moment.\nB. 2H - Deuterium (hydrogen-2 has a nuclear spin of 1, and its magnetic moment is approximately \\( 2.79 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{J T}^{-1} \\), close to the given value.\nC. 19F - Fluorine-19 also has a nuclear spin of 1, but its magnetic moment is significantly higher, around \\( 9.26 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{J T}^{-1} \\).\nD. 6Li - Lithium-6 has a nuclear spin of 1/2, not 1, so it wouldn't match the given magnetic moment.\n\nGiven the provided information, option B (Deuterium (2H) is the most likely candidate for the nuclide with the given magnetic moment, considering the typical magnetic moments for nuclides nuclear spins and the given value being closest to the expected value for a nuclear spin of 1."
