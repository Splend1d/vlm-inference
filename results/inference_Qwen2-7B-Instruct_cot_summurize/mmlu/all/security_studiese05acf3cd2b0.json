Women did not actively engage in warfare as combatants and so questions of gender or the role of women were not important in considerations of security.\nB. The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.\nC. The role of women was given appropriate consideration; women have fulfilled many vital roles in the support of the dominant security system.\nD. Women are generally unsupportive of warfare and prefer to engage in anti-war or opposition movements, rendering their contribution to the study of warfare as marginal.\n"

The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators, or otherwise, were often framed in terms of how their actions impacted the state, rather than considering them as individuals or focusing on gender-specific issues. This perspective neglected the unique experiences and contributions of women in conflict situations and security studies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it's true that women historically participated less directly in combat roles, they still played critical supportive roles and have experienced conflict-related violence and displacement, which are valid areas of concern in security studies.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while women do fulfill important roles in supporting security systems, this option does not address the historical neglect of their roles as a distinct focus within security studies.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that women are generally unsupportive of warfare, which is not accurate. Women can be supporters of war efforts or opposition movements, and their involvement should be studied from a gender perspective rather than dismissed."
