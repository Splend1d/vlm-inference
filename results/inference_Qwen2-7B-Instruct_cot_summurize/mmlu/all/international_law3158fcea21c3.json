GA Resolutions are considered as material source, in the sense that they may enunciate statements of customary law.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly (GA) can adopt resolutions on various matters related to international relations, cooperation, and peacekeeping. However, it's important to note that GA resolutions themselves do not have the same legal force as treaties or customary international law. They are not legally binding on states unless they are incorporated into national law through legislation or other means.\n\nGA resolutions serve several purposes:\n\n1. **Declaration of Principles:** They can declare principles and policies that guide the behavior of states and the international community.\n2. **Setting Standards:** They can set standards for international behavior or norms.\n3. **Documentation of International Opinion:** They document the views and concerns of the international community, which can influence state behavior and the development of international norms.\n4. **Recommendations:** They often contain recommendations that states are encouraged to follow, but these are not enforceable under international law.\n\nIn terms of their role as a 'source' of international law, GA resolutions can contribute to the development of customary international law when they repeatedly and consistently reflect widely accepted practices and opinio juris ( (the belief that such practices are are required by law). This means that if a resolution reflects a practice that states consistently follow out of a sense of legal obligation, and this practice becomes widely recognized as a norm from which no derogation is permitted, then it can become part of customary international law."
