The friend, who was a fanatic baseball fan, eagerly agreed. The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice. They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red. As he reached the intersection, the fan was traveling at 50 m. p. h. although the posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h. Simultaneously, a car entered the intersection on red and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend suffered a broken pelvis in the collision. This jurisdiction has adopted the following \"modified\" comparative negligence statute:\"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted. \"Suppose the friend brings suit against the driver of the car that entered the intersection on the red light to recover damages for his injury. Ajury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light; and (3) The friend suffered $100,000 in damages. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of\n\nA. $100,000. 00\nB. $55,000. 00\nC. $45,000. 00\nD. nothing, because the fan was more negligentthan the driver.\n"

In this case, the fan is found to be 55% negligent and the driver is found to be 45% negligent.\n\nTo calculate the friend's recovery, we apply each party's percentage of fault to the total damages:\n\n- Friend's share of damages: 55% of $100,000 = $55,000\n- Driver's share of damages: 45% of $100,000 = $45,000\n\nSince the friend's damages ($100,000) are are not reduced by his own percentage of fault (55%, the full amount of damages applies to the friend's recovery. However, the friend must then subtract the driver's portion of the damages ($45,000) from the total damages to determine the net recovery.\n\nNet recovery for the friend = Total damages - Driver's share of damages\nNet recovery for the friend = $100,000 - $45,000 = $55,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. $55,000.00**."
