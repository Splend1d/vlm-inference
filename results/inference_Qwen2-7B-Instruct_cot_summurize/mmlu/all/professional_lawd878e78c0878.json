Soon thereafter, she had sex with her husband, who contracted the disease within a few days. The woman revealed the source to her husband, and he then sued the paramour for negligence in failing to tell the woman that he had the disease. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. What will the appellate court decide?\n\nA. There is a cause of action because one who transmits a sexually communicable disease is strictly liable to all who contracts it.\nB. There is no cause of action because the wife assumed the risk that the paramour had a sexually transmittable disease.\nC. There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\nD. There is no cause of action because the paramour's negligence was cut off by the wife's intervening negligence which became a superseding cause.\n"

There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\n\nUnder the law of negligence, a person who knowingly carries a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and engages in sexual activity without disclosing this information to their sexual partner may be held liable for any resulting injuries or damages caused by the transmission of the STI. This is based on the principle that such individuals have a duty to use reasonable care to prevent harm to others, including their sexual partners.\n\nIn this scenario, the paramour knew of the presence of a venereal disease and failed to disclose this information to his sexual partner, the woman. As a result, she unknowingly transmitted the disease to her husband, causing him injury. The paramour's failure to disclose the STI could be considered a breach of this duty of care, leading to a potential cause of action for negligence against the paramour.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific laws regarding liability for transmitting STIs can vary significantly between jurisdictions, so this analysis is based on general principles of negligence law."
