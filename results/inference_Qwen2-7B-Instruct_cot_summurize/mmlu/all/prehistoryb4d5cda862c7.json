The Hopewell culture, which existed from approximately 200 BCE to 500 CE, was in the eastern Woodlands region of North America, primarily relied on agriculture and gathered foods. Important components of their diet and agricultural practices included maize ( (corn), sunflower, and squash. Squash was often grown alongside corn and beans in the Three Sisters farming technique, enhancing soil fertility and providing a balanced diet. Knotweed, while a widespread plant species, does not have significant historical documentation as a cultivated food source within the Hopewell culture."
