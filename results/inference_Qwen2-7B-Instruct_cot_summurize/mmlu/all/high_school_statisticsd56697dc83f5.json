The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.\n\nVoluntary response bias occurs when the sample consists of people who choose to participate in the survey, rather than being randomly selected. In this case, only those who felt strongly enough about the issue to send an email response were included in the data set. This means that the responses are not representative of all listeners or even all of the people who might have an opinion on the matter. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to the broader population, and the survey's findings are likely skewed by the preferences of those who chose to respond, potentially overrepresenting strong opinions on both sides of the issue."
