A positive \u0394H indicates that the reaction is endothermic ( it absorbs heat from the surroundings.\n  \n- **\u0394S ( (Entropy change)**: This refers to the change in disorder or randomness of the system. A negative \u0394S indicates that the reaction leads to a decrease in disorder or randomness.\n\n- **\u0394G ( (Gibbs free energy change)**: This is the driving force for the spontaneity of the reaction. A negative \u0394G indicates that the reaction is spontaneous under the given conditions.\n\nGiven that the reaction is non-spontaneous at 1 atm and 298 K ( but becomes spontaneous upon cooling ( which means \u0394T < 0 ( (from -78\u00b0C to warmer temperatures), we can deduce the following:\n\n1. **\u0394H > 0**: Cooling the system (by adding more entropy (from the surroundings to the system) does not make the reaction spontaneous if \u0394H were negative. Since the reaction becomes spontaneous after cooling, \u0394H must be positive ( indicating an endothermic process.\n\n2. **\u0394S < 0**: The cooling process increases the entropy of the surroundings ( thus decreasing the entropy change of the system ( making \u0394S negative.\n\n3. **\u0394G > 0 initially, \u0394G < 0 after cooling**: Initially, \u0394G is positive, meaning the reaction is non-spontaneous. After cooling, \u0394G becomes negative, meaning the reaction is now spontaneous.\n\nTherefore, the combination that applies to this reaction is **B. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0** initially, then **\u0394G < 0** after cooling."
