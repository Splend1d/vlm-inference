Real evidence refers to physical objects that can be introduced into court to prove a fact in question, such as weapons, implements, marks, scars, wounds, and photographs. Hearsay, on the other hand, refers to out-of-court statements made by someone other than the witness who is testifying in court. These statements are generally not admissible as evidence because they lack the opportunity for cross-examination that would occur if the original speaker were present in court."
