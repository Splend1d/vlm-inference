Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, borrowing money and not returning it is considered morally wrong because it involves deception and the violation of trust. It is an action that typically leads to financial loss for the person from whom the money was borrowed and can harm the relationship between the two individuals.\n\nIn Scenario 2, having a pet dog put down to punish a child for crying is not considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. While it may be emotionally distressing for the child, the act itself is not generally seen as morally reprehensible. However, it could be seen as a form of emotional abuse or mismanagement of discipline, which are are not specifically asked about but are important considerations in discussions of morality."
