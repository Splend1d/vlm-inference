Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the liberty to use one\u2019s powers to preserve one\u2019s life.\n\nIn Hobbes' view, before the establishment of a civil society and a social contract, individuals live in a state of \"war of all against all\" ( where the right of nature allows each person to pursue their own self-interest without any constraints. This state of nature is characterized by chaos, fear, and constant threat to life, which leads people to seek a commonwealth governed by a sovereign power that can ensure peace and security through laws and authority."
