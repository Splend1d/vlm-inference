This is particularly useful in multivariate time series analysis where multiple non-stationary variables may move together in the long run, but each pair of variables may have its own unique cointegration relationship. The EY procedure thus provides a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing systems with multiple interrelated cointegrating vectors."
