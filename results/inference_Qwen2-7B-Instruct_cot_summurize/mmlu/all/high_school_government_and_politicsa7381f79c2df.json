It occurs every 10 years to reflect changes in population according to the census. \n\nThis is true because congressional districts are redrawn based on population changes as determined by the decennial census, which is conducted by the United States Census Bureau. This process ensures that each district has roughly equal populations, adhering to the principle of \"one person, one vote.\" \n\nA. The responsibility for redrawing congressional districts does not belong to congressional committees; rather, this process is typically handled by state legislatures or through independent redistricting commissions in some states.\n\nB. Redistricting can be a highly contentious and controversial process, as it can affect political power dynamics and influence electoral outcomes, leading to accusations of gerrymandering ( the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to favor one party or class.\n\nD. The Supreme Court has ruled that race cannot be the predominant factor in drawing congressional districts, but it has not explicitly ruled out considering racial demographics entirely. In the case of Shaw v. Reno ( (1993) and Miller v. Johnson ( (1992), the court established that racial gerrymandering was unconstitutional, but it also acknowledged that race could be considered as one factor among many in the redistricting process to achieve other constitutional requirements, such as complying with the Voting Rights Act or ensuring effective representation of minority groups."
