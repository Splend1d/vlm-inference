This is because disposable income is what remains after taxes have been deducted from total income, and if all of this disposable income is spent on consumption, there will be no amount left over for saving. \n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are not necessarily true:\n\nA. Household saving can never be negative: This statement is false. Households can indeed spend more than they earn, leading to negative saving ( or a household deficit.\n\nB. Investment is always greater than savings: This statement is also false. In a closed economy, investment and savings can be equal, as in the case where households save exactly what businesses invest, or one can be greater than the other depending on the economic situation.\n\nC. The economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving: This statement is not universally true. Economists generally use the term \"equilibrium\" to refer to a situation where aggregate demand equals aggregate supply. Consumption and saving being equal does not necessarily imply that the overall economy is in equilibrium; it only implies that household behavior is balanced in terms of spending and saving."
