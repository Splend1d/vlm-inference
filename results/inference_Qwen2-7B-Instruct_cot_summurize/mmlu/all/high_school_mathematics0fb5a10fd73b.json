The discriminant is given by \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\).\n\nGiven the equation \\(x^2 - 6x + c = 0\\), we have \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -6\\), and \\(c\\) is what we're solving for. The discriminant in this case is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c\n\\]\n\nFor the inequality \\(x^2 - 6x + c < 0\\) to have real solutions, we need \\(\\Delta > 0\\):\n\n\\[\n36 - 4c > 0 \\\\\n36 > 4c \\\\\n9 > c\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(c\\) must be less than 9 for the inequality to have real solutions. However, since \\(c\\) must be a positive value, the solution set for \\(c\\) is \\(0 < c < 9\\). \n\nExpressed in interval notation, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n(0, 9)\n\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **A.
