The defendant timely moved for postconviction relief under the Sixth Amendment on the ground that his attorney had provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial judge, after a hearing, found that the attorney had performed deficiently by failing to raise a proper objection that would have resulted in exclusion of important prosecution evidence. What more, if anything, must the trial court find in order to sustain the defendant's Sixth Amendment claim?\n\nA. Nothing more, because the unjustifiable failure to object to important prosecution evidence is structural error.\nB. That the attorney was court-appointed and not privately retained.\nC.

That there is a reasonable probability that the trial's outcome would have been different if the attorney had objected.\n\nUnder the Sixth Amendment, a defendant can bring a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel if they can show that their counsel's performance was deficient (and that this deficiency prejudiced the defense. To establish prejudice, the defendant must demonstrate that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the outcome of the trial would have been different had the attorney acted properly. This standard does not require proof of a \"probability of success\" or a \"probability of a more favorable result\"; rather, it asksks whether the deficient performance \"undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process.\"\n\nThe other options do not directly address the requirements for establishing a Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of counsel:\n\nA. Structural errors are a subset of ineffective assistance claims where the error is so fundamental that it affects the fairness of the trial itself. While failing to object to important prosecution evidence could be considered structural error in some cases, the existence of such an error is not sufficient to sustain the claim; the defendant must also show prejudice as described above.\n\nB. Whether the attorney was court-appointed or privately retained is relevant to certain issues under the Sixth Amendment, such as the right to counsel and the availability of funding for representation, but it does not directly address the elements needed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nD. Clear and convincing evidence is a higher burden than the \"reasonable probability\" standard used to establish prejudice in ineffective assistance claims. Therefore, while it may be used in other contexts, it is not the standard that must be met to sustain a Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of counsel."
