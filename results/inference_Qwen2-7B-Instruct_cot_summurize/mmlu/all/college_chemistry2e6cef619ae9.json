The MnO4- : Mn2+ ratio is 3:1.\n   - Incorrect; it's actually 10:10 or simplified to 1:1.\n\nD. The H+ : I\u2212 ratio is 2:1.\n   - Incorrect; it's actually 16:5 when simplified from the balanced equation.\n\nGiven the options provided, none of them directly match the correct ratios derived from the balanced equation. However, based on the standard rules of balancing redox reactions, the closest correct answer in the spirit of the question might be to recognize that the ratio of MnO4- to Mn2+ is 1:1, not listed among the options. \n\nThe correct interpretation of the balanced equation should show that for every mole of MnO4-, there is an equal mole of Mn2+, which is not explicitly stated as an option. Therefore, none of the provided options A through D accurately represent the balanced equation's ratios."
