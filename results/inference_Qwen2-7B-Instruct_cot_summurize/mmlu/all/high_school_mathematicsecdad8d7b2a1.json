Then, she needs to determine her orientation after spinning an additional 75% of a circle.\n\n75% of a full circle (or 360 degrees is:\n\\[ 0.75 \\times 360 = 270 \\text{ degrees} \\]\n\nStarting from north and spinning 270 degrees clockwise, she will face south.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. south."
