Block on exercise level because it is associated with cholesterol level.\n\nIn a randomized block design, the goal is to reduce variability within groups ( by grouping similar subjects together based on a characteristic that could influence the outcome of the study. In this case, since the company anticipates an association between cholesterol levels and the amount of exercise a person gets, blocking on exercise level would help to ensure that differences in cholesterol levels due to exercise do not confound the results comparing the two drugs. This allows for a more precise comparison of the effects of the new drug versus the old one.\n\nBlocking on gender alone (option A or B) might not be as effective, as while gender may not have a strong direct effect on cholesterol levels, it can still introduce variability into the study if there are are significant differences in exercise habits or other factors related to cholesterol levels between genders. Blocking on the type of drug ( option C is also not necessary because the purpose of the experiment is to compare the effectiveness of the new drug to the old one, not to account for any potential variability introduced by the type of drug.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most appropriate choice for the randomized block design in this scenario."
