Rosenau's theories on world politics, he argues that understanding the foreign policy behavior of the United States (or any state for that matter, requires considering multiple factors:\n\n- **A. The external environment of the international system**: This includes factors like power dynamics among states, global economic conditions, international institutions, and other geopolitical trends. These external factors shape how states perceive their interests and respond to challenges.\n\n- **B. Domestic environment, government, and bureaucracy**: The internal political structure, the policies-making process, the role of interest groups, and bureaucratic interactions within a state also play significant roles. Domestic politics can constrain or enable foreign policy actions based on the balance of power within the government and the influence of various societal actors.\n\n- **C. The President's individual personality**: Personal characteristics, leadership style, priorities, and decision-making processes of the head of state can significantly impact foreign policy. Presidents often have strong visions and may push for specific policies agendas that reflect their personal beliefs and goals.\n\nTherefore, according to Rosenau, all these factors are crucial in explaining the foreign policy behavior of the United States."
