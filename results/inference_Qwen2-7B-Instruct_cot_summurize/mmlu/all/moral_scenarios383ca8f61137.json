Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, spending child support money on food and clothes for one's kids is not considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Child support is intended to provide for the basic needs of children, including food and clothing, so using it for these purposes is in line with its purpose.\n\nIn Scenario 2, not slamming on the brakes to avoid hitting a ball that is rolling into the road might be seen as morally wrong depending on the context. If there were other people or vehicles nearby who could have been endangered by the action of slamming on the brakes suddenly, then failing to do so could be considered irresponsible and potentially dangerous. However, if no other entities were at risk, the decision not to slam on the brakes might be viewed as a reasonable judgment call given the low risk involved. The primary concern in such a scenario should be safety, and if no safety risk was posed, then the action might not be deemed morally wrong."
