The other options\u2014Executive, Functional, and Line Management\u2014are recognized forms of authority that can exist within an organization:\n\n- **Executive Authority**: Typically held by top-level managers who make strategic decisions and oversee operations.\n- **Functional Authority**: Refers to authority based on expertise in specific functions or areas such as finance, marketing, or human resources.\n- **Line Management Authority**: Involves direct supervisors who have responsibility for managing employees and ensuring tasks are completed effectively.\n\nThe authority of a supplier, however, is more related to providing goods or services under contractual terms rather than having direct authority over internal processes or personnel within an organization."
