However, it's important to note that while the form of the argument is valid, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises due to the specific content of the argument.\n\nA categorical syllogism consists of three parts: two premises and a conclusion, each containing exactly three terms. In this case, the argument can be represented as:\n\nPremise 1: If A (then B ( (where \"A\" represents \"the sky is blue\" and \"B\" represents \"there won't be rain\")\nPremise 2: A ( (where \"A\" again represents \"the sky is blue\")\nConclusion: Therefore, B ( (where \"B\" again represents \"there won't be rain\")\n\nThe form of this argument fits the structure of a valid categorical syllogism known as \"modus ponens\", which has the standard form:\n\nIf P then Q.\nP.\nTherefore, Q.\n\nSo, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. It is a formally valid categorical syllogism\n\nHowever, it's crucial to emphasize that the validity of the argument does not guarantee its truth. The conclusion might still be false if other relevant information is not considered ( for instance, there could be other reasons for no rain even when the sky is blue."
