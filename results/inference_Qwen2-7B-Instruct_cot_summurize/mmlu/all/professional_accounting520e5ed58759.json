Payments mailed to the client that have not been recorded.\n\nWhen an auditor categorizes accounts receivable as \"exceptions,\" it usually means they've identified discrepancies or unusual items during their audit process. These exceptions can include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Payments received from customers that have not yet been recorded in the company's accounting system ( (This directly affects the reconciliation between the company's records and what the auditor has received).\n- Errors in recording transactions, such as incorrect amounts or dates.\n- Outstanding invoices that should have been recorded as revenues but have not been.\n- Accounts that may be misclassified or inaccurately valued.\n- Issues related to customer disputes or returns that haven't been properly accounted for.\n\nOptions A, B, and C might be reasons for other types of discrepancies or issues during an audit, but they don't specifically address the typical category of \"exceptions\" in the context of accounts receivable verification. For instance:\n- Option A refers to customers with no balance owing, which would not typically be flagged as an exception unless there was an error in recording payments or adjustments.\n- Option B pertains to the method of communication between the auditor and the client, which does not necessarily indicate an exception in the accounts receivable itself.\n- Option C involves accounts deemed uncollectible, which might be correctly categorized based on the company's policies but would still need to be handled appropriately in the financial statements, potentially leading to an exception if not properly accounted for or disclosed.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D, as it directly addresses an issue where a payment made by a customer has not been recorded by the client, thus creating an exception in the accounts receivable process."
