The concept of \\(aH\\) being a subgroup of \\(G\\) does not depend solely on whether \\(a\\) is in \\(H\\). Rather, for \\(aH\\) to be a subgroup of \\(G\\), it must satisfy the subgroup properties: closure under the group operation, existence of inverses, and containing the identity element of \\(G\\). Specifically, \\(aH\\) being a subgroup implies that for every element \\(h \\in H\\), \\(ah\\) (and its inverse) must also be in \\(G\\), which is true by definition of left cosets. However, this does not require \\(a\\) to be in \\(H\\). For instance, consider \\(G = (\\mathbb{Z}, +)\\), \\(H = 2\\mathbb{Z}\\) ( (the even integers), and \\(a = 1\\). Here, \\(1H = H\\) is indeed a subgroup of \\(G\\), but \\(1\\) is not an element of \\(H\\).\n\n**Statement 2:** \"If \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) belong to \\(G\\), then \\(aH = bH\\) if and only if \\(ab\\) is in \\(H\\).\"\n\nThis statement is also false. The equality of left cosets \\(aH = bH\\) does not necessarily imply that \\(ab\\) is in \\(H\\). Instead, \\(aH = bH\\) means that every element of \\(aH\\) can be written as \\(bh\\) for some \\(h \\in H\\), and vice versa. This happens if and only if \\(b^{-1}a \\in H\\), which means \\(b^{-1}a\\) is in \\(H\\). This condition reflects the fact that multiplying every element of \\(H\\) by \\(b\\) is equivalent to multiplying every element of \\(H\\) by \\(a\\) after multiplying all elements of \\(H\\) by \\(b^{-1}\\). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. False, False**."
