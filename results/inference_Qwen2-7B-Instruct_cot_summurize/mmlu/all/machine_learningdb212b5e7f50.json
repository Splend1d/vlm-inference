L2 regularization tends to distribute the weight values more evenly across all features, making it less likely to drive some feature weights exactly to zero. This means that L2 regularization does not induce sparsity as effectively as L1 regularization, which tends to produce sparse models by driving some weights to exactly zero.\n\nStatement 2 is false. Residual connections are indeed a key component of ResNets (Residual Networks), but they are not typically found in Transformers. Transformers use mechanisms like self-attention and positional encoding instead of residual connections to model dependencies between input elements."
