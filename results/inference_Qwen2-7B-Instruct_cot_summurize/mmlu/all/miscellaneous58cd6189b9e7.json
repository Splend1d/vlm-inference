                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Energy flow between trophic levels is inefficient. In an ecosystem, energy transfer from one trophic level to the next is typically inefficient, with only about 10% of the energy being passed on to the next level. This means that most of the energy is lost as heat or used by the organism for its own metabolic processes.\n\nLet's briefly review why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Smaller organisms need less energy per gram of body weight than do larger organisms. While it's true that smaller organisms generally have lower energy needs per unit of body mass due to their smaller surface area-to-volume ratios, this fact does not directly relate to the efficiency of energy transfer in an ecosystem.\n\nB. Energy transfer between organisms normally involves conservation of heat energy. This statement is incorrect because energy is not conserved in the same way in biological systems as it is in physical systems. Energy is transferred and transformed, but not necessarily conserved in its original form; much of it is lost as heat.\n\nD. Chemical energy is converted into radiant energy, which is then converted into chemical energy at the next trophic level. This statement inaccurately describes the typical pathway of energy transfer in ecosystems. Energy in ecosystems flows from chemical to chemical, not via a direct conversion to and from radiant energy."
