It is an obligation of conduct, i.e., States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means. This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes to a specific outcome. The obligation emphasizes the process and the intent to use peaceful methods rather than specifying the result.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this obligation is not limited to international courts and tribunals (option D), nor is it merely a peremptory norm with a universal legal interest (option C). Instead, it is a fundamental principle applicable to all states under their duties as members of the international community."
