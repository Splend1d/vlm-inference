Fund financial statement.\n\nFund financial statements are indeed considered part of the required supplementary information for general purpose external financial reporting of a local government. These statements provide detailed information about the financial activities of each governmental, enterprise, and internal service fund within the government, allowing stakeholders to understand the financial position and performance of these specific funds.\n\nB. Combining nonmajor fund statements are not typically required or considered standard in the context of general purpose external financial reporting as they are more specific to combining statements from similar types of funds.\n\nC. Notes to the financial statements are are indeed a part of the financial reporting process, but they are not specifically tied to the category of \"fund financial statement\" as described in option A. The notes provide additional detail and explanation about the financial statements themselves.\n\nD. Management discussion and analysis ( (MD&A) is a narrative section that provides context and insight into the financial statements, discussing the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and other relevant factors. While it is often included in annual reports and can be an important part of understanding a government's financial health, it is not considered part of the required supplementary information for the fundamental financial statements of a local government.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice among the options provided is A: Fund financial statement."
