Customer participation and environmental relationship.\n\nPine and Gilmore's 1999 framework identifies four realms of experience based on two dimensions:\n\n1. **Customer Participation**: This dimension refers to the level of involvement or engagement that customers have in the experience. High levels of participation involve more direct interaction with the product or service, while low levels involve less interaction.\n\n2. **Environmental Relationship**: This dimension pertains to the nature of the relationship between the customer and their environment during the experience. It can be characterized as either personal or impersonal, depending on whether the environment is perceived as having a human-like quality or not.\n\nThe four realms of experience derived from this framework are:\n- **Performative Realms**: These are experiences where the customer actively participates and the environment has a personal relationship, such as theater or live performances.\n- **Immersive Realms**: Involves high customer participation but an impersonal environment, like theme parks or virtual reality experiences.\n- **Interactive Realms**: Characterized by low customer participation but a personal environment, such as personal shopping assistants or one-on-one consultations.\n- **Transactional Realms**: These are experiences with low customer participation and an impersonal environment, like traditional retail transactions or online purchases.\n\nThis framework helps businesses understand how different elements of their offerings can influence customer experiences and satisfaction."
