This fallacy overlooks the multifaceted nature of causes and assumes that one factor is responsible for an outcome when multiple factors might be involved. \n\nFor example, if someone claims that eating chocolate is the sole reason for getting acne, ignoring other potential contributing factors such as genetics, hormonal changes, diet, and skincare routine, they are committing a fallacy of attributing a complex cause (getting acne) to a simple cause (eating chocolate."
