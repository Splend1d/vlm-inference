From a behaviorist perspective, this process could be seen as similar to several mechanisms, but it's most closely aligned with option C: \"reduction of emotional response by an extinction procedure.\"\n\nBehaviorists focus on observable behaviors and their environmental determinants, rather than internal psychological processes. Extinction procedures involve removing a reinforcement (such as positive or negative reinforcement\u2014when it's paired with a behavior. Over time, if the reinforcement is no longer present, the behavior eventually decreases.\n\nIn the context of catharsis, a behaviorist might view it as a form of extinction where, through therapy, the patient learns not to associate certain triggers with negative emotions. The patient might initially respond emotionally to these triggers (much like a conditioned response), but through repeated exposure without the negative outcome (or reinforcement of that emotion), the emotional response diminishes over time.\n\nSo, while options A, B, and D all describe ways in which emotions might be managed or controlled, option C best aligns with a behaviorist's understanding of how cathartic effects might occur within a therapeutic setting."
