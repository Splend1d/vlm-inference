When employees are satisfied with their jobs, they tend to be more motivated, engaged, and productive at work, which can lead to better job performance. Additionally, higher job satisfaction is often associated with better mental and physical health outcomes. However, the relationship can be complex, as other factors also play significant roles in both job performance and health."
