The perchlorate ion (ClO4\u2013 has a -1 charge. Oxygen typically has an oxidation state of -2 in most compounds. Since there are four oxygen atoms in perchlorate, their total contribution to the charge is -8. \n\nTherefore, to balance the charge, chlorine must have an oxidation state of +2:\n\n-8 (from oxygen atoms + Oxidation state of chlorine = -1 (from the ion as a whole\n\nSolving for the oxidation state of chlorine gives us +2."
