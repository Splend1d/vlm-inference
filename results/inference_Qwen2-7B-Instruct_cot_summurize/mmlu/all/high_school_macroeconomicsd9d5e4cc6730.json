To close this gap, policymakers typically aim to stimulate the economy. One way to do this is by decreasing taxes. This puts more money in the hands of consumers and businesses, potentially increasing consumer spending and business investment, thus boosting economic activity and real GDP.\n\nAs for the impact on unemployment, it's important to note that the relationship between tax cuts and unemployment is not always straightforward. While tax cuts can stimulate the economy and potentially lower unemployment, they might also lead to higher budget deficits if government spending isn't reduced simultaneously. However, assuming that the government finances these tax cuts through borrowing rather than cutting other expenditures, the net effect could be an increase in aggregate demand, which might help to reduce unemployment over time. \n\nSo, the correct prediction would be:\n\nD. Decrease taxes. \nIncrease ( (for real GDP)\nDecrease. ( ( for unemployment, assuming the economy is able to respond to the stimulus)\n\nPlease note that the exact impact of fiscal policy depends on various factors such as the size of the recessionary gap, the effectiveness of the policy in stimulating spending, and the overall state of the economy."
