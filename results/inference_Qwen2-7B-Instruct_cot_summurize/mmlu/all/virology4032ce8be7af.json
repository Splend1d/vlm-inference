They are found in a variety of mammalian hosts, including rodents, which serve as their natural reservoirs. Infections can occur in humans through direct contact with infected animals or their tissues, or indirectly through contaminated food or water. \n\nThe other options are not correct for the following reasons:\n\nB. Russia: While some arenaviruses may be found globally, Russia is not typically identified as a predominant location for these viruses.\n\nC. Africa and S. America: Arenaviruses are indeed found in these regions, but they are not as predominantly located there compared to Southeast Asia. These viruses have been identified in various parts of Africa and South America, particularly in countries with high biodiversity and rodent populations.\n\nD. N. America: While some arenaviruses may be found in North America, it is not the predominant location for these viruses when compared to Southeast Asia."
