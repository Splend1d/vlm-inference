The man locked the door and quietly took the female's purse, emptied all of the money into his pockets, and removed the jewelry from her person. He was apprehended and charged with robbery. Can he be convicted of that crime?\n\nA. Yes, robbery is the unlawful taking of property from another's person by intimidation or force.\nB.

Yes, robbery does not require that the victim be subdued by force or be placed in fear.\nD.

In fact, many jurisdictions consider crimes committed against unconscious or incapacitateded victims as forms of robbery or theft, even if the victim is unable to resist or be intimidated. The key elements typically considered in a robbery case are the unlawful taking of property and the intent to deprive the owner of it. The victim's state of consciousness or ability to resist at the time of the incident is generally not a determining factor in such cases. Therefore, the man could potentially be convicted of robbery based on the actions described."
