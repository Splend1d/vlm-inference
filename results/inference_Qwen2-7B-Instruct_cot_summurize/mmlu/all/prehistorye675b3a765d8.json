This means that their diet likely consisted mainly of grasses, which include wild wheat and other similar plants. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. C4 grasses that may have included wild wheat.\n\nThis dietary pattern indicates an adaptation to environments rich in grasslands, which became increasingly prevalent during this time period in Earth's history. The ability to consume and digest C4 plants would have provided these early hominids with a more efficient source of energy compared to C3 plants ( like fruits and leaves, which might require more energy to process."
