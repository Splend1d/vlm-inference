It undermines the educational process and can be unfair to other students who put in the effort to complete their assignments themselves. This action could also have serious consequences such as academic penalties or the perpetuation of an unfair advantage over peers.\n\nIn Scenario 2, reaching for a host's trash can when feeling ill might be seen as slightly intrusive but it is not necessarily morally wrong, especially if there are no other available options and assuming that the action was discreet and respectful. The primary concern would be the health and comfort of the person feeling ill rather than the propriety of using the trash can. However, in most situations, it would be more appropriate to ask for permission before using a host's personal items, even if they are in a less conventional location like a trash can."
