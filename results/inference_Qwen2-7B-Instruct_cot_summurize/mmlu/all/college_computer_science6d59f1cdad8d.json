This statement is always true because if A has a finite number of elements, then any subset of A (such as B in this case, will also have a finite number of elements.\n\nII. If A is regular, then B is regular. This statement is also always true. Regular languages are closed under intersection with any language. That means if you take the intersection of any regular language (A) with any other language (B, the resulting language is still regular. Since B is a subset of A, it can be considered as an intersection of A with itself, thus preserving its regularity.\n\nIII. If A is context-free, then B is context-free. This statement is not always true. Context-free languages are not closed under intersection with arbitrary languages. While it's true that the intersection of two context-free languages is context-free, intersecting a context-free language with an arbitrary language does not necessarily yield a context-free language. In this specific case, since B is a subset of A, and assuming A is context-free, the context-freeness of B depends on whether the intersection operation preserves context-freeness when applied to arbitrary languages, which is not guaranteed. Therefore, we cannot say with certainty that B must always be context-free just because A is context-free."
