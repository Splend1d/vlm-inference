The light for the carpenter was green, so the carpenter proceeded to drive through the intersection. A bus entered the intersection from the west and slammed into the carpenter's car. The carpenter was seriously injured in the crash and missed several weeks of work while recovering from the injuries. Which of the following facts or inferences, if true, would be most helpful in an action by the carpenter against the driver of the bus?\n\nA. The bus driver had received three speeding tickets in the past.\nB. The carpenter's car was in good condition, and it had passed a safety inspection just a week before the accident.\nC. The traffic signal at the intersection had been inspected the day before the accident and found to be functioning properly.\nD. The bus driver was operating the bus without a driver's license in violation of the State Motor Vehicle Code.\n"

The bus driver was operating the bus without a driver's license in violation of the State Motor Vehicle Code.\n\nThis fact would be most helpful in an action by the carpenter against the driver of the bus, as it directly implicates the bus driver's negligence or recklessness leading up to the accident. Operating a vehicle without a valid license is typically considered a serious violation of traffic laws, which could contribute to proving that the bus driver was not exercising due care and responsibility. This could potentially be used to argue that the bus driver's lack of licensure contributed to their inability to safely navigate the intersection, thus causing the accident and resulting injury to the carpenter."
