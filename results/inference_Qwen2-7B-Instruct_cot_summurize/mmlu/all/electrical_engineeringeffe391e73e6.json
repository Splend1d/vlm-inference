It is highly accurate but typically has lower sensitivity because it relies on achieving a precise balance rather than detecting minute changes in force, displacement, or other measured parameters directly.\n\nA deflected type instrument, such as a spring balance or a deflection gauge, measures the amount of movement or deformation caused by the applied force. These instruments generally have higher sensitivity because they directly measure the displacement or change in position resulting from the force applied.\n\nThe response time can vary depending on the specific design and application of both types of instruments, so option B ( a faster response, is not necessarily true for all cases. The accuracy of both types of instruments depends on their design, calibration, and use, making option C \"a higher accuracy\" incorrect without further context."
