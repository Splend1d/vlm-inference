A well-planned vegan diet can provide all essential amino acids (the building blocks for proteins) through the combination of various plant-based foods. For example, combining cereals (which are typically low in lysine but high in other essential amino acids like tryptophan and threonine with legumes which lack methionine but contain other essential amino acids can help to provide a complete protein profile. Similarly, tofu and tempeh made from soybeans are rich sources of all essential amino acids and are considered a complete protein source.\n\nLegumes are actually rich in methionine and dairy products are indeed good sources of tryptophan. So, while some plant-based proteins might require strategic combinations to ensure adequate intake of all essential amino acids, they do not inherently fall short in this regard. \n\nCereals, on the other hand, are often considered incomplete proteins because they tend to be low in lysine, but not deficient in it. They still contain other essential amino acids."
