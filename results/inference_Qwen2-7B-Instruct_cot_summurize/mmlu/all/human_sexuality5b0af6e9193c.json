In vitro fertilization ( (IVF) \n\nThis is often the recommended course of action for women who have experienced multiple miscarriages, especially if there are issues with egg quality or fertilization problems. IVF involves retrieving eggs from the ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory setting. The resulting embryos are then transferred into the uterus. This process allows for closer monitoring and control over the factors that might contribute to miscarriage, such as genetic abnormalities, hormone imbalances, or uterine conditions. It's important to note that each case is unique, and decisions about fertility treatments should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider."
