Warner, was an American sociologist who conducted extensive research on racial dynamics and segregation in the American Deep South. His work highlighted the persistence of a \"colour line\" or racial divide in cities like Natchez, Mississippi. He demonstrated that this \"colour line\" was not just a physical boundary but a deeply ingrained social construct that shaped every aspect of life, from housing and employment to education and social interactions. The belief in white superiority was central to maintaining this system of segregation and inequality. Therefore, option D best captures the essence of Warner's findings regarding the racial dynamics in Natchez and similar southern cities during his time."
