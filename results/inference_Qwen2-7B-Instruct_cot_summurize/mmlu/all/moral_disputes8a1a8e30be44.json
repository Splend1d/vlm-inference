He describes virtue as a mean between two extremes of character or behavior. For example, courage is considered a virtue that lies between the extremes of recklessness ( which is too much (excess), and cowardice, which is not enough (deficiency). \n\nSo, while Aristotle does emphasize the importance of controlling one's anger (which can indeed be seen as part of a virtuous disposition), his overarching definition of virtue encompasses more than just anger management. It's about finding the right balance in all aspects of life, including emotions, actions, and intellectual pursuits."
