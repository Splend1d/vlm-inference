Eukarya utilize the general transcription factors TBP (TATA-binding protein) and TFIIB in transcription, whereas Bacteria do not. At least one member of Archaea has a protein similar to TBP and a protein similar to TFIIB. Based on this observation, which of the following scenarios is most likely?\n\nA. Archaea and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Bacteria.\nB. Archaea and Bacteria diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Eukarya.\nC. Bacteria and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Archaea.\nD. Archaea, Eukarya, and Bacteria diverged simultaneously from a common ancestor.\n"

This is because these proteins are characteristic of eukaryotic transcription machinery, suggesting a closer evolutionary link with Eukarya.\n\nGiven this information, the scenario that best fits the evolutionary relationships described is:\n\nA. Archaea and Eukarya diverge after their common ancestor diverges from Bacteria.\n\nThis implies that the common ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya had features similar to those found in Eukarya, and they diverged later than when Bacteria diverged from this common ancestor. This scenario align with the observed evolutionary relationships and the presence of eukaryotic transcription factors in some Archaea species."
