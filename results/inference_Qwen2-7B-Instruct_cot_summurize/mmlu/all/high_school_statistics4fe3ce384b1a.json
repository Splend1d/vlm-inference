I and II.\n\nIncreasing the sample size (I) generally increases the power of a hypothesis test because it reduces the standard error, making it easier to detect a true effect if one exists.\n\nIncreasing the significance level (II) also increases the power of a hypothesis test. This is because a higher alpha level means that you're more willing to accept a false positive ( (Type I error), which in turn makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis when it's false, thus increasing the chance of correctly identifying an effect (power).\n\nOn the other hand, increasing the probability of a Type II error (III) actually decreases the power of the test. A Type II error occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. Thus, increasing the likelihood of this error directly reduces the test's ability to correctly identify effects when they exist, thereby decreasing its power."
