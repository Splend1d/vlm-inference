This is because the speed of sound is dependent on the medium through which it is traveling. However, the frequency of the sound wave remains constant as it crosses the boundary between the two media. This is because frequency is a measure of the number of cycles per unit time, and it is not affected by changes in the medium's properties. \n\nIntensity, which is related to the energy carried by the wave, can also change when the wave moves into a denser medium because the energy may be more tightly packed, leading to an increase in intensity. Conversely, if the new medium is less dense, the energy may spread out more, leading to a decrease in intensity. Therefore, all of the options except for frequency can change when a sound wave moves from one medium to another."
