                    "text": "Gauthier's theory of deliberative justification primarily argues that moral decisions are derived from rational self-interest within a cooperative society. This theory does not refute or replace morality outright; rather, it offers a different perspective on how moral norms can emerge and be justified through a process of mutual agreement among individuals in pursuit of their own interests.\n\nThe correct answer here might not directly correspond to the options provided as they seem to present a binary or opposing view, which doesn't fully capture Gauthier's nuanced position. However, if we interpret the options given:\n\nA. \"is refuted by moral requirements\" - This statement could be seen as incorrect since Gauthier's theory does not refute morality but rather proposes a different framework for understanding its emergence.\n\nB. \"is replaced once we acknowledge moral requirements\" - This option might imply a misunderstanding of Gauthier\u2019s theory. While his approach focuses on the role of rational self-interest in shaping moral norms, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that deliberative justification replaces moral requirements entirely. Instead, it suggests a process where moral norms are arise out of rational deliberation among individuals.\n\nC. \"refutes morality\" - This statement contradicts Gauthier's theory, which does not refute morality but rather explains how moral norms might develop within a society based on individual interests.\n\nD. \"ignores morality and seemingly replaces it\" - Similar to option B, this statement oversimplifies Gauthier's theory. It suggests an action of ignoring morality, which isn't aligned with his approach, and also implies a complete replacement, which is not the case according to his theory.\n\nGiven these interpretations, none of the options provided accurately encapsulate Gauthier's theory of deliberative justification. Gauthier's theory doesn't refute, replace, or ignore morality; instead, it offers a way to understand how moral norms might be rationally derived within a cooperative framework."
