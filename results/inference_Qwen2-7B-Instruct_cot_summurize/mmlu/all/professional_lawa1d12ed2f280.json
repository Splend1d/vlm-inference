After the contract was executed, the man leased a store in a shopping center where he planned to open his restaurant. City public officials, however, refused to grant the man the necessary food vendor's license despite the fact that he could prove that his restaurant complied with all provisions of the municipal licensing ordinance. Section 1287 of the city food vending ordinance provides, in part, that \"a food vendor's license shall be issued to any applicant who properly complies with all of the health requirements of this ordinance. \" After the man's application for a food vendor's license was rejected, he requested a hearing to establish his qualifications. City officials refused this request and also declined to give any reason for his license denial. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument that the man may use to challenge the refusal of the city officials to grant him a food vendor's license?\n\nA. The city action denies him procedural due process.\nB. The city action denies him substantive due process by arbitrarily regulating economic activity.\nC. The city action constitutes an undue burden on the potential interstate commerce between the man and his out-of-state franchisor.\nD. The city action impairs the obligation of the man's contract with the franchising company and his rental agreement with the shopping mall.\n"

                    "text": "A. The city action denies him procedural due process.\n\nThe strongest constitutional argument in this scenario would likely be that the city's actions deny the man procedural due process. This is because the man was denied the opportunity for a fair hearing after being refused a food vendor's license, which is a critical step before enforcing the denial. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees due process of law, and the Fourteenth Amendment extends this protection to state actions.\n\nProcedural due process requires that the government provide fair procedures before deprivinging someone of life, liberty, or property. In this case, the man was not given a chance to present his case for obtaining a food vendor's license and demonstrate his compliance with the municipal licensing ordinance. The refusal without providing a hearing or a reason for the denial violates the principle of procedural fairness.\n\nThe other options presented might have some merit in certain contexts, but they do not directly address the constitutional violation in this scenario:\n\n- B. Substantive due process is related to the reasonableness of a regulation, not the process used to enforce it. Here, the issue is the lack of due process, not the substantive fairness of the ordinance itself.\n  \n- C. The argument about interstate commerce is relevant if there is a significant impact on trade between states, which is not clearly demonstrated from the information provided. The focus here should be on the procedural aspect of the city's action rather than its potential impact on commerce.\n  \n- D. The impairment of contractual obligations could be a legal issue, but it does not directly address the constitutional question of whether the city's action violated the man's right to due process. \n\nThus, option A is the strongest constitutional argument based on the information provided."
