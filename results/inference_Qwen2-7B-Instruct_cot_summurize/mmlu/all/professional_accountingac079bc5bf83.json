Seven months.\n\nTo determine the bond interest expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, we need to calculate the portion of the interest that accrues during this period. The bond's interest payment dates are in April and October. Since the bond was issued on June 1, year 1, it means that there is no interest payment due within the first six months of the year (i.e., until December 31, year 1.\n\nHowever, the bond will have its next interest payment on October 1, year 1. This means that from June 1, year 1, to October 1, year 1, is the period where interest accrues for the year ended December 31, year 1. This period covers approximately 4 months from June to September, plus an additional month (October, since the interest payment date falls on October 1.\n\nTherefore, the total period considered for the bond interest expense calculation is 5 months from June to October, but considering the interest payment on October 1, effectively making it 7 months when including the partial month of October."
