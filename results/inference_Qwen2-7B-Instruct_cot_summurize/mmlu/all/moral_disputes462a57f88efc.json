By burdening a patient with having to justify his or her continued existence.\n\nVelleman is concerned about the moral and psychological burdens that might be placed on patients if they have to consider their right to end their own life. He worries that this could lead to feelings of guilt, shame, or inadequacy, especially when patients are confronted with the decision of whether to continue living or not. This justification process could undermine their sense of dignity and well-being, even if they ultimately decide against euthanasia."
