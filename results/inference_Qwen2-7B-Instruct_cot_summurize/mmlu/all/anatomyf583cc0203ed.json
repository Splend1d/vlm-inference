Pupillary dilatation and a lateral strabismus.\n\nExplanation: The third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) innervates the superior, medial, and inferior rectus muscles which help in maintaining eye position. It also innervates the\u77b3\u5b54\u62ec\u7ea6\u808c (which constricts the pupil. Damage to this nerve would result in loss of pupillary constriction ( thus leading to a dilated pupil (\u9009\u9879 B is incorrect), and an inability to move the eye medially ( resulting in a lateral strabismus or squint (\u9009\u9879 C is incorrect).\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\nA. Pupillary constriction indicates that the sympathetic nervous system is functioning properly, not damaged as per the question.\nB. Pupillary dilatation usually indicates a problem with the sympathetic nervous system, not the oculomotor nerve.\nC. Pupillary constriction and a lateral strabismus would indicate damage to the fourth cranial nerve ( trochlear nerve), not the third cranial nerve."
