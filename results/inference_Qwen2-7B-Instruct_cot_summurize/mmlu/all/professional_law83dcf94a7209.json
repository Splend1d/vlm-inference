Most of the coastline is privately owned by persons who have permanent or vacation residences on their coastal lands. A man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral (i. e. , coastal) land in the state. When the man bought the property, there was a narrow concrete walkway (about 20 feet in length and 5 feet in width) adjoining the land. The walkway, which was designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach, was owned by the State Coastal Commission. When the man moved into his beach house, he noticed that the walkway was rarely used. As a result, the man decided to enclose the walkway and construct a paddle ball court over the entire area. He did so without notifying the State Coastal Commission. He has continued to use this area in excess of the period required for adverse possession. In an appropriate action brought by the man to establish title to the walkway area, which of the following must he establish if he is to prevail?\n\nA. Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\nD. Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.\n"

Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\n\nIn order for the man to establish title to the walkway area through adverse possession, he would need to show that he has been using the land openly, notoriously, continuously, and exclusively for a period of time equal to the statutory period required for adverse possession in that state. This typically involves demonstrating that he has been in possession of the land for a certain number of years, and that during that time he has used it as his own, despite any claims to the contrary by the original owner or the state. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while a governmental entity might have the authority to abandon property under certain circumstances, such decisions typically involve legal processes and cannot simply be made by an individual without proper authorization. \n\nOption B is incorrect because lack of use by the state does not necessarily create an irrevocable license in another party. An irrevocable license would typically involve an agreement between parties granting permission for one to use something, with the right to revoke that permission at any time.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the question doesn't address any defects in the chain of title. Establishing title through adverse possession is about proving open, notorious, continuous, and exclusive use of the property, not about any issues with the title itself."
