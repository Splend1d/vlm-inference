So, the probability of drawing another red marble is \\(\\frac{3}{9}\\).\n\nThus, the probability of drawing two red marbles in succession is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{15}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the probability of selecting two blue marbles:\n\nThe probability of drawing one blue marble first is \\(\\frac{6}{10}\\), as there are 6 blue marbles out of 10 total marbles.\n\nAfter removing one blue marble, there are now 5 blue marbles left out of 9 total marbles. So, the probability of drawing another blue marble is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\nThus, the probability of drawing two blue marbles in succession is:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{10} \\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo find the total probability of both being the same color, we add the probabilities of these two independent events:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{7}{15}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\)."
