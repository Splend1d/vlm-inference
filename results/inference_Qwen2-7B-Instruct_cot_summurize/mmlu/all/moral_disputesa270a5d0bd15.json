This is in contrast to Garrett Hardin's approach, which relies on the concept of the \"tragedy of the commons\" and suggests that individuals will overuse shared resources if there is no enforcement mechanism, such as coercion or punishment. \n\nIn Confucian philosophy, the emphasis is on personal virtue, moral development, and social harmony rather than on external control or punishment. Confucius believed that people should cultivate their own moral character and act according to principles of righteousness, respect for others, and filial piety. He saw society as an organic whole where individuals have interdependent roles and responsibilities, and emphasized education and self-cultivation as means to achieve social order and stability.\n\nThus, Confucianism promotes a system based on mutual respect, reciprocity, and moral education, rather than coercion, to encourage cooperation and prevent collective action problems."
