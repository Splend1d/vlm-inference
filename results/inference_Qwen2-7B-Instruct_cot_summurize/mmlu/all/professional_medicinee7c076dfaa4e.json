He has had recurrent cervical lymphadenitis and pneumonia since infancy. Two years ago, a culture from an abscess in the cervical region grew Staphylococcus aureus. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination shows a tender, erythematous, edematous left ankle; there is point tenderness over the medial malleolus. A bone scan shows increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis. Culture of bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens. Nitroblue tetrazolium test shows no color change. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for these findings?\n\nA. Developmental arrest of maturation of B lymphocytes\nB. Dysmorphogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches\nC. Impaired chemotaxis\nD. Impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism\n"

Impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism.\n\nSerratia marcescens is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause a variety of infections including urinary tract infections, sepsis, and wound infections. It is often resistant to multiple antibiotics. In this case, the patient also has a history of recurrent infections, which suggests an underlying immunodeficiency.\n\nThe nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is used to measure the phagocytic activity of neutrophils, which is part of the body's immune system. If the NBT test shows no color change, it suggests that there may be an impairment in the phagocytic oxidative metabolism, which could contribute to recurrent infections like the ones experienced by the patient.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not directly explain the specific mechanism involving the bacterium Serratia marcescens and its resistance to the NBT test results. Therefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate choice given the information provided."
