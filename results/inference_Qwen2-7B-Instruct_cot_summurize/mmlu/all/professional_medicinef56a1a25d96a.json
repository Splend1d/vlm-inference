Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms. Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Conversion disorder\nB. Histrionic personality disorder\nC. Occult medical disorder\nD. Somatic symptom disorder\n"

This condition involves a persistent or recurrent somatic symptom (like abdominal pain in this case) that is not explained by a known medical condition, and is often accompanied by significant distress or impairment in daily functioning. The patient's history of multiple hospitalizations, dramatic symptom presentation, and difficulty in finding definitive medical causes are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nConversion disorder (A), while characterized by physical symptoms that are not fully explained by a medical condition, typically involves symptoms that are are perceived as being caused by psychological factors or stress. The patient's symptoms might also suggest B. Histrionic personality disorder, characterized by a pattern of excessive emotional expressiveness, a need for attention, and a tendency to present themselves in an overly theatrical manner, but the description does not strongly align with the diagnostic criteria for this condition. C. Occult medical disorder suggests there is an underlying medical cause for the symptoms that has not yet been discovered, which seems less fitting given the patient's extensive medical history and the lack of definitive diagnosis."
