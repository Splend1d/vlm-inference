The vintner sold the vineyard to a husband and wife as tenants in common, who did not record the warranty deed by which the vintner conveyed the vineyard to them. The husband subsequently sold and conveyed his undivided one-half interest in the vineyard to a friend. The friend promptly recorded his deed. Some time later, the vintner purported to convey the vineyard to a farmer, for valuable consideration. The farmer, who had no actual knowledge of any previous conveyances of the vineyard, recorded her deed. The jurisdiction maintains alphabetical grantor and grantee indices. The applicable recording statute provides, \"Every conveyance of real property is void as against any subsequent purchaser of the same property (or any part thereof) in good faith and for a valuable consideration, whose conveyance is first duly recorded. \" None of the various grantees of the vineyard has entered into possession in a manner that would put anyone on inquiry notice as to their interest therein. Who owns the vineyard?\n\nA. The friend, because he recorded his deed before the farmer recorded.\nB. The friend and the wife, because the friend's deed would put the farmer on inquiry notice as to the wife's interest in the vineyard.\nC. The farmer, because the husband \u0080\u0094friend deed is outside the farmer's chain of title.\nD. The friend and the farmer, as tenants in common.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The farmer owns the vineyard.\n\nThe principle at play here is the \"race-notice\" statute. This type of statute operates under two conditions: the subsequent purchaser must have purchased in good faith and for a valuable consideration, and they must record their deed before the prior claimant or their successors in interest. \n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- The vintner sold the vineyard to the husband and wife as tenants in common but did not record the deed.\n- The husband then sold his undivided half to the friend, who promptly recorded the deed.\n- The vintner then attempted to sell the vineyard to the farmer, who recorded her deed before the friend's deed could be recorded.\n- The jurisdiction maintains alphabetical grantor and grantee indices, meaning that records are are kept in order of when deeds were recorded.\n\nGiven these facts, the farmer's deed is recorded before the friend's deed. Since the farmer purchased in good faith for valuable consideration and recorded her deed first, she has priority over the friend's interest in the vineyard. Moreover, the farmer's deed does not put the vintner or the husband on notice of the friend's interest since none of the various grantees of the vineyard has entered into possession in a manner that would put anyone on inquiry notice as to their interest therein.\n\nTherefore, according to the race-notice statute, the farmer owns the vineyard."
