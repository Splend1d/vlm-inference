The parties entered into a valid, written construction contract that contained a provision that called for an architect's certificate of completion. After completion of the cottage, the owner hired an architect to inspect the contractor's work and issue the certificate. The architect refused in bad faith to execute the certificate. The contractor then sued the owner for the entire contract amount. The owner argued that the lack of issuance of the certificate excused her from further performance under the contract. Upon hearing this argument, most courts will\n\nA. order the architect to execute the certificate.\nB. require the contractor to proceed in equity for reformation to eliminate the clause.\nC. award the contractor damages against the architect.\nD. excuse the condition and require the owner to pay damages to the contractor.\n"

As a result, the other party (the contractor in this scenario\u2014can argue that they are are no longer bound by the contract's terms because the condition for payment has not been met. The courts are likely to excuse this condition, allowing the contractor to seek damages from the owner instead of requiring them to complete the work without compensation. This is based on the principle of substantial performance, which allows a party to enforce a contract if they have substantially performed their obligations despite minor breaches by the other party."
