Feedback circuits in oscillators are used to maintain and sustain this oscillation. Depending on the type of oscillator ( such as RC, LC, or crystal oscillator, the feedback mechanism might use resistive, capacitive, or inductive coupling between the input and output stages. In some cases, a combination of these methods could also be used."
