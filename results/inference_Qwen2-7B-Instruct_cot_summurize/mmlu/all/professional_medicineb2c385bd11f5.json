Her daughter had moved away from the area, and nursing home placement was necessary because the patient could no longer function independently. Her present medications include furosemide and digoxin. Physical examination is normal except for a weight loss of 3.5 kg (7 lb) during the past 3 months. In your conversation with the patient, she says, \"No, I'm not depressed, I just don't have an appetite anymore. Nothing tastes good to me. I have a little bit of nausea most of the time.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study?\n\nA. Chest x-ray\nB. Complete blood count\nC. Determination of serum albumin concentration\nD. Determination of serum digoxin level\n"

Determination of serum albumin concentration\n\nSerum albumin is a protein produced by the liver and it is often used as a marker for nutritional status. Low levels of serum albumin can indicate malnutrition or other underlying health issues such as chronic illness, liver disease, or kidney disease. The patient's weight loss and lack of appetite suggest potential nutritional deficiencies, which may be contributing to her poor eating habits. Therefore, assessing her serum albumin levels will provide important information about her overall nutritional state.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily the first line of investigation based on the presented symptoms:\n\nA. Chest x-ray - While it could be relevant if there were signs of respiratory distress or other lung-related conditions, it is not the primary indicator for evaluating a patient's nutritional status or appetite.\n  \nB. Complete blood count ( - This test provides information about the patient's red and white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin levels, which can indicate anemia or infection, but it does not specifically address nutritional status or appetite.\n\nD. Determination of serum digoxin level - This is particularly relevant if the patient is experiencing symptoms potentially related to digoxin toxicity ( like nausea, but given that it is not a primary symptom, it might not be the most pressing concern initially. However, it should still be considered if the patient reports any new or worsening symptoms related to their cardiac medication. \n\nGiven the context, evaluating her nutritional status through serum albumin concentration seems the most pertinent first step."
