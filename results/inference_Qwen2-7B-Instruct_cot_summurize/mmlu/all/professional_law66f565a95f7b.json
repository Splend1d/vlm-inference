As part of an elaborate plan to increase the city's tourist trade and revive the local economy, the city planned to sell the beach houses to a company that would demolish the houses and build a luxury hotel in their place. The owners of the beach houses have challenged the city's exercise of eminent domain, contending only that the city's plan is unconstitutional. Will the owners of the beach houses be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a property owner can challenge an exercise of eminent domain only on the ground of the sufficiency of the compensation.\nB. No, because the planned sale to the private developer to increase the tourist trade qualifies as a public use.\nC. Yes, because a public entity cannot seize the property of one person in order to transfer that property intact to other private parties.\nD. Yes, because the city's action would deprive the owners of all economic use of their property.\n"

No, because the planned sale to the private developer to increase the tourist trade qualifies as a public use.\n\nIn the United States, the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution allows for the taking of private property for \"public use,\" provided there is just compensation to the property owner. This concept is often referred to as the \"public use\" requirement of eminent domain. The courts have generally interpreted this clause broadly, allowing governments to take private property for projects that promote public welfare, even if they may not directly benefit the original property owners.\n\nThe Supreme Court case Kelo v. City of New London ( (2005) established that the public use requirement can include takings for economic development, as long as the ultimate beneficiaries of the project are themselves public entities or public uses. In that case, the Court upheld the city's use of eminent domain to transfer property from one private owner to another with the goal of spurring economic development, as the new owner intended to build a facility that would serve both commercial and public purposes.\n\nThus, in this scenario, if the city's plan is to sell the beach houses to a private developer who intends to build a hotel that will serve a public purpose (such as increasing tourism and reviving the local economy, it could potentially qualify as a \"public use\" under the law. This would allow the city to proceed with the eminent domain action without violating the property owners' constitutional rights, assuming the compensation offered is fair and adequate."
