Studies have shown that following bariatric surgery, the incidence of type 2 diabetes can be reduced by 80-90%. This is because weight loss achieved through bariatric surgery can lead to improvements in insulin resistance and glucose metabolism, which are are key factors in the development of type 2 diabetes."
