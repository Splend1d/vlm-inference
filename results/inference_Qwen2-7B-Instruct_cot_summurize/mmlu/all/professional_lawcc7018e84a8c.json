A passenger in the struck vehicle had a rare medical condition that made her highly vulnerable to any slight physical impact or intrusion. The minimal impact caused the passenger to lightly bump her shoulder against the door, which triggered her rare immunosuppressant disease to surface. The passenger became permanently incapacitated from the impact. She sued the negligent motorist for all of her injuries. A physician submitted a report stating that the collision was a substantial factor in causing the disability. Has the plaintiff stated a claim for relief under prevailing legal principles?\n\nA. Yes, because in the law of negligence the defendant takes the plaintiff \"as he finds her.\"\nB. No, because the motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries that are not of psychological origin.\nC. No, because the victim's psychosomatic reaction is usually held to be malingering under the law.\nD. Yes, because the victim in this case is called a \"predictably unpredictable plaintiff.\"\n"

Yes, because in the law of negligence the defendant takes the plaintiff \"as he finds her.\"\n\nExplanation: Under the principle of negligence, a defendant is liable for any damages that were reasonably foreseeable as a result of their actions, and they must take the plaintiff as they find them. This means that if a person has an underlying medical condition, the defendant cannot escape liability just because the injury would not have occurred but for the pre-existing condition. If the defendant's actions significantly contributed to the exacerbation or manifestation of the condition, they can still be held liable for the resulting damages. In this scenario, the motorist's negligent action led to a significant event (the minor collision - which triggered the passenger's rare medical condition and caused permanent incapacitation. Thus, the motorist could potentially be held liable for all injuries resulting from their negligence."
