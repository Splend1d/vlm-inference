Erythromycin. \n\nErythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has been found to enhance gastric motility by acting as a smooth muscle relaxant in the gastrointestinal tract. This effect helps to increase the rate and efficiency of food movement through the stomach, which can be beneficial in conditions such as gastroparesis. \n\nThe other options listed do not typically have an effect on gastric motility:\n- A. Adrenaline ( would actually slow down gastric emptying due to its stimulatory effects on smooth muscles.\n- B. Ditropan ( is an anticholinergic medication primarily used to treat overactive bladder by relaxing the muscles in the bladder and prostate gland, not enhancing gastric motility.\n- D. Carbemazepine, while it can have various effects on the gastrointestinal tract, is not known for enhancing gastric motility."
