( (now known as Russia) and the U.S. have sent landers to Venus. \n\n- The Soviet Union's Venera 7 became the first spacecraft to land on Venus in 1970, and Venera 13 and 14 followed with successful landings in 1975 and 1982 respectively.\n- The United States' Pioneer Venus Orbiter was launched in 1977, but it did not include a lander. However, the Pioneer Venus Mission did deploy two atmospheric probes named VeneraD and Venera 11 that entered the Venusian atmosphere but did not land.\n\nFrance, on the other hand, has not sent a lander to Venus."
