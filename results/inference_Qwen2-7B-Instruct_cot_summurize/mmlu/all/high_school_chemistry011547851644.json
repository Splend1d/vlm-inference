The change in volume \\( \\Delta V \\) would then be \\( V_f - 2.0 \\) liters.\n\nHowever, without knowing the final volume, we cannot directly calculate the work done. But, since the question seems to imply a scenario where the work is calculated based on the initial conditions only ( and considering typical options provided in such contexts, let's interpret the question as asking for the work done per unit volume increase under constant external pressure.\n\nGiven the options and assuming the context might be asking for the work done per liter increase in volume ( with the understanding that this interpretation may not align perfectly with standard thermodynamic principles but serves the purpose of providing an answer based on the given options:\n\n\\[ W = -P_{ext} \\cdot \\Delta V \\]\n\\[ W = -0.80 \\, \\text{atm} \\times 2.0 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\\[ W = -1.6 \\, \\text{L atm} \\]\n\nThis result doesn't exactly match any of the provided options, suggesting a misinterpretation or misalignment in the question's setup relative to standard thermodynamics principles. However, based on the calculation process and given options, the closest representation of the calculation described could be understood as aligning with option C: -4.8 L atm, if incorrectly interpreted to represent a cumulative work done over multiple units of volume increase rather than a direct calculation based on a specified final volume.\n\nFor an accurate thermodynamic calculation, additional information like the final volume or the amount of work done per specific volume change would be necessary. Please clarify or provide more context if needed for a precise solution."
