Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWashing bed sheets with bleach is generally considered a mistake or negligence if the sheets were not particularly dirty and the bleach was used unnecessarily, potentially causing damage to the fabric. However, this action is not universally wrong or illegal unless there's a specific reason why bleach should not be used ( like if the sheets are sensitive to chemicals or if the bleach is being used in an unsafe manner.\n\nTestinging a laser pointer at a helicopter can be considered morally wrong because it poses a risk to the safety of the helicopter crew and potentially violates laws regarding the use and operation of lasers in public spaces. Lasers can cause temporary blindness or eye damage, which could lead to navigational errors and accidents. Additionally, it might be illegal to point a laser at an aircraft under certain jurisdictions. \n\nSo, while both actions may have negative consequences, only one of them involves a clear violation of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
