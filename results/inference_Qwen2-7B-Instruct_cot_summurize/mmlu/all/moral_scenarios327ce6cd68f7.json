It could be seen as a practical precaution to prevent accidents or damage, as the cleaner might need more space or tools that require an empty fireplace.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the statement \"I don't think we should send astronauts into space without putting holes in their suits\" suggests a viewpoint against safety measures in space exploration. This is morally wrong because it implies advocating for actions that would knowingly put lives at risk without reasonable safety precautions, which is ethically unacceptable."
