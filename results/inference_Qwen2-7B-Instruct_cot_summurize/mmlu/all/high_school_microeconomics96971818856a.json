                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The supply of daycare rises, lowering the market price.\n\nWhen the county government provides subsidies through coupons for daycare costs, it effectively reduces the financial burden on parents for utilizing daycare services. This reduction in cost acts as an incentive for more families to opt for daycare services, thus increasing the demand for daycare slots. However, since the subsidy directly affects the cost structure for providers rather than altering the demand itself, we focus on how it influences the supply.\n\nThe increase in demand for daycare services without a corresponding change in the supply capacity (meaning the number of available daycare spots does not increase immediately or significantly enough to meet the new demand level - will lead to a situation where providers may need to accommodate more children than they currently have space for. To manage this increased demand, providers might choose to expand their facilities or hire additional staff, which increases the overall supply of daycare services.\n\nAn increase in supply generally leads to a decrease in the market price, assuming all other factors remain constant. This is because with more daycare options available, the competition among providers intensifies, and they might lower their prices to attract more customers. Therefore, the introduction of these subsidies is expected to increase the supply of daycare services, leading to a lower market price for daycare."
