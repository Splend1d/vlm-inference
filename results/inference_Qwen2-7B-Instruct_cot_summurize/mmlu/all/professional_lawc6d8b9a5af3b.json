The youth thereafter entered into a written contract with the dealership, which provided that the youth would make monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. During the first year of the contract, the youth made 12 monthly payments totaling $12,000. However, the youth failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The dealership repeatedly threatened to sue the youth for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. Finally, in order to avoid litigation, the youth sent the dealership the following letter:\"The car I purchased from you is a real lemon. I have spent a considerable sum of money during the last two years in repair work. I don't believe that the car is worth $36,000, but I am willing to pay you $10,000 if I find ajob in the next month. \"The youth had just turned 18 when he sent this letter to the dealership. The day after mailing this letter, the youth was involved in an automobile accident, and the sports car was totally demolished. Following the accident, the youth remained unemployed, and he refused to make any payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. In this jurisdiction, the age of majority is18 years of age. If the dealership brings suit against the youth for breach of contract, what, if any, is the plaintiff's proper recovery?\n\nA. Nothing.\nB. $10,000. 00\nC. $18,000. 00\nD. $24,000. 00\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Nothing.\n\nIn this scenario, the youth (who is now 18 years old, thus considered an adult in the jurisdiction - sends a letter to the dealership indicating that he believes the car is a \"lemon\" and offers to pay $10,000 if he finds a job within a month. This offer does not constitute a valid payment or settlement of the debt owed under the contract, as it is conditional upon finding a job, which is uncertain.\n\nFurthermore, after sending this letter, the youth gets into an accident where the car is destroyed. This event does not absolve him of his contractual obligations, nor does it provide a legal basis for reducing the amount he owes. \n\nTherefore, when the dealership sues the youth for breach of contract, the court would likely uphold the original agreement and require the youth to pay the remaining balance, minus any payments he has already made ($12,000). However, since the question asks about the plaintiff's \"proper recovery,\" and considering the options given, none of them directly address the outcome of the lawsuit based on the information provided. Typically, in such a situation, the recovery would be the amount due under the contract, minus any payments already made, which in this case would be $24,000 ($36,000 total price - $12,000 paid). None of the provided options (A through C explicitly state this outcome, but option D ($24,000) most closely aligns with the potential recovery under the contract terms. However, given the question's phrasing and lack of clarity around the court's decision, the most accurate response based on standard contract law principles would imply that the youth owes the remaining balance, which isn't directly represented by any of the options."
