Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\n\nExplanation:\n- A is incorrect because only bases that ionize completely (strong bases, donate hydroxide ions (OH\u207b into solution. Weak bases do not ionize completely and thus do not donate significant amounts of OH\u207b ions.\n- B is incorrect because while strong bases definitely produce solutions with high concentrations of OH\u207b ions, it's not accurate to say that only strong bases can do so. Weak bases also produce some OH\u207b ions, though in smaller quantities.\n- C is correct because strong bases ionize completely in water, producing a high concentration of ions (including both the base ion and the OH\u207b ions, which makes the solution a good conductor of electricity.\n- D is incorrect because for weak bases, the concentration of OH\u207b ions is typically less than the concentration of the base itself, as they do not ionize completely in solution. The concentration of OH\u207b ions would exceed the concentration of the base if the base were relatively strong or if the conditions were such to increase its ionization significantly."
