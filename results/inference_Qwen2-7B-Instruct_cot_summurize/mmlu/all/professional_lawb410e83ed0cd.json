The fairway for the ninth hole was 65 feet wide and 437 yards long, with a dogleg in an easterly direction. Between the fairway and the homeowner's property was a \"rough,\" containing brush and low-lying trees. The boy had hit a towering shot down the middle of the fairway that deflected off a tree and struck the homeowner in the head. The homeowner brought suit against the boy for his injuries suffered when he was hit by the golf ball. At trial, the boy offered uncontested evidence that golf balls from the golf course regularly traversed onto the homeowner's property two to three times a day. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the boy's liability for trespass?\n\nA. The boy is not liable, because he did not intentionally cause the golf ball to traverse onto theplaintiff's property.\nB. The boy would be liable for the unpermittedintrusion of the golf ball onto the plaintiff'sproperty.\nC. Because the plaintiff should have reasonablyanticipated that living next to a golf coursewould result in stray golf balls landing on hisproperty, the boy would not be held liable.\nD. Because the golf ball did not substantiallyinterfere with the plaintiff's use and enjoymentof his land, the boy would not be held liable.\n"

The boy would be liable for the unpermitted intrusion of the golf ball onto the plaintiff's property.\n\nIn this scenario, the boy's act of hitting a golf ball that struck the homeowner can be considered a form of trespass, as the ball landed on the homeowner's property without their permission. The fact that golf balls regularly travel onto the homeowner's property does not automatically absolve the boy of liability. Each instance of a golf ball crossing onto private property could potentially be considered a separate act of trespass. \n\nThe homeowner might argue that the boy should have exercised reasonable care to prevent the ball from striking someone, given the proximity of the golf course to residential areas. Therefore, the court would likely consider whether the boy's actions were reasonable under the circumstances, including the frequency of balls landing on the property, the potential risks involved, and the foreseeability of injury to persons on neighboring properties."
