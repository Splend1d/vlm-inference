Upon delivery, the buyer was surprised to find an assortment of pacific wild salmon, domestic salmon raised in captivity, and mixed east coast salmon. In prior discussions, the parties agreed on all pacific wild salmon for fulfillment of the order, and none of the other inferior types were discussed. Does the parol evidence rule apply to preclude the buyer's testimony regarding what kind of salmon the parties' intended by the term \"quality salmon\" in the written contract?\n\nA. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply to preclude testimony in cases such as this one where the testimony would explain what the parties meant by the terms they used.\nB. Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the testimony would add to or contradict the final signed writing.\nC. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply because the contract was reduced to writing.\nD. Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the terms of the contract were not recorded and preserved at the time of signing the contract.\n"

Yes, the parol evidence rule generally applies to preclude the testimony because the testimony would add to or contradict the final signed writing. The parol evidence rule refers to the legal principle that a signed writing that fully expresses the agreement between parties supersedes and integrates all prior agreements or understandings. In this scenario, since the contract was a written document that specified the purchase of \"quality salmon,\" and there was an understanding that only Pacific wild salmon would be included, any testimony about what the parties meant by \"quality salmon\" would either add to (if it contradicts the written terms) or contradict (if it adds information not present in the written contract) the final signed writing. Therefore, under most legal systems, the testimony would likely be excluded based on the parol evidence rule."
