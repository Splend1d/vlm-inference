Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages. \n\nCurrent thinking in the field of mass communication recognizes that audiences are not passive but rather active participants who engage with media content based on their own values, beliefs, and experiences. This means that people do not simply absorb information presented to them; instead, they interpret and process it in ways that align with their existing viewpoints. Moreover, the effects of mass communication can vary significantly among different individuals and groups, depending on factors such as age, education, culture, and personal interests."
