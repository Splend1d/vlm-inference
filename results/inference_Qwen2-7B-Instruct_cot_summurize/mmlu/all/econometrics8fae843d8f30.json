                    "text": "The correct answer is D. All of the statements (i), ii), iii), and iv) are true.\n\n(i) The standard error of the slope coefficient in an OLS regression model is indeed positively related to the residual variance. This is because the residual variance (also known as the variance of the error term) quantifies how much the observed values deviate from the predicted values. A larger residual variance implies greater uncertainty in the prediction, leading to a larger standard error for the slope coefficient.\n\n(ii) The standard error is negatively related to the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable about their mean value. This dispersion is often captured by the variance or standard deviation of the explanatory variable. When the observations are more tightly clustered around their mean (indicating less dispersion), the standard error of the slope coefficient tends to be smaller, reflecting greater precision in estimating the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n\n(iii) The standard error is also negatively related to the sample size. Generally, as the sample size increases, the precision with which we can estimate the population parameters improves. This leads to a decrease in the standard error, as larger samples provide more information and reduce the variability in our estimates.\n\n(iv) The standard error does give a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate. It indicates how much the coefficient estimate might vary from one sample to another if we were to repeat the sampling process. A smaller standard error suggests that the coefficient estimate is more precise and likely closer to the true population parameter.\n\nTherefore, all four statements are true, making option D the correct choice."
