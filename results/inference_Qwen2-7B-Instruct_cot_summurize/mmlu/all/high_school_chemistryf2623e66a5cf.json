In each structure, nitrogen atom forms three sigma bonds with three oxygen atoms, and one of the oxygen atoms carries a negative charge. Nitrogen is in the +5 oxidation state which can be achieved by forming three single (sigma- bonds with oxygen atoms. \n\nIn terms of pi bonds, only one of the resonance structures will have a pi bond between the negatively charged oxygen atom and the nitrogen atom because that's where the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen is located. This lone pair is available to form a pi bond when the structure resonates.\n\nSo, considering all resonance structures together, the nitrate ion has a total of 3 sigma bonds (from the three single bonds formed by nitrogen atom, and 1 pi bond (formed by the lone pair of electrons on one oxygen atom available for resonance."
