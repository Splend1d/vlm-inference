                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The forward force of the horse on the cart is greater than the backward force of the cart on the horse, providing a forward acceleration.\n\nWhen a horse pulls a cart, it exerts a force on the cart in the forward direction. According to Newton's third law of motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, the cart also exerts a force back on the horse, but this force acts in the backward direction. For the horse to move the cart forward, the force exerted by the horse must be greater than the opposing force (in this case, the friction forces acting backward on the cart, as well as any other forces resisting the motion.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not correctly explain the acceleration of the horse-cart system from rest:\n\n- A suggests that static friction between the horse and the ground provides the force for acceleration, which is incorrect because static friction opposes motion rather than causing it. It would only come into play if the horse were trying to stop or maintain its position relative to the ground.\n  \n- C implies that the force of the horse\u2019s muscles directly accelerates the horse-cart system, which is not sufficient by itself since the cart also needs to move forward for them to accelerate together.\n  \n- D refers to the upward normal force of the ground on the horse, which simply supports the weight of the horse and does not contribute to the forward acceleration of the horse-cart system. The weight of the horse (mg (where m is mass and g is gravitational acceleration) must be balanced by the normal force for the horse to remain stationary or move without falling."
