I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\u2026Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\"\nAlbert J. Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" 1898\nThe sentiment expressed by Beveridge best exemplifies which of the following?\n\nA. Imperialism\nB. Anti-imperialism\nC. Isolationism\nD.

                    "text": "The sentiment expressed by Beveridge best exemplifies:\n\nA. Imperialism\n\nIn his speech, Albert J. Beveridge advocates for the expansion of American power and influence overseas, particularly in the context of the Spanish-American War and the subsequent colonization of territories such as the Philippines. He argues that it is the duty of the United States to govern and \"civilize\" other peoples, suggesting a belief in the superiority of American governance and the need to exert control over territories and populations beyond its borders. This perspective aligns with the concept of imperialism, which involves the political, economic, and cultural domination of one nation over another.\n\nWhile some of the other options could also be relevant in certain contexts or aspects of Beveridge's speech:\n\n- B. Anti-imperialism would oppose the expansionist policies he advocates.\n- C. Isolationism refers to avoiding involvement in international affairs, which Beveridge does not advocate for here.\n- D. Manifest Destiny was a belief in the inevitable expansion of the United States across the North American continent, which Beveridge's speech does touch upon in terms of territorial expansion, but the focus is more on the moral justification for governing others, rather than justifying territorial expansion itself.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is A. Imperialism, as Beveridge's argument centers around the moral and strategic imperative of American governance over territories and populations considered less developed or self-governing."
