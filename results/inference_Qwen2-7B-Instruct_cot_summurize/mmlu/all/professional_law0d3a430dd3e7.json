After the meeting, she was injured in the building's elevator as it suddenly fell and crashed to the basement from the third floor. She sued the building's owner, but at trial the only evidence she had regarding the issue of negligence was that she was in the elevator when it malfunctioned. Will the trial judge dismiss the case as a matter of law without letting it go to the jury?\n\nA. Yes, because the injured person always has the affirmative burden of proving negligence.\nB. Yes, because it cannot be presumed that the building owner was negligent.\nC. No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the woman assumed the risk when she decided to use an obviously dangerous instrumentality.\n"

No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman is suing the building owner based on the assumption that the elevator malfunction was due to the owner's negligence. Since the elevator is under the owner's exclusive control, it would be reasonable to infer that if an accident like this occurred, there might have been some form of negligence involved. This means that the case should not be dismissed outright; instead, it should be presented to the jury to determine if the owner was indeed negligent or if the accident was due to other unforeseen circumstances. The plaintiff's lack of direct evidence of negligence does not automatically disqualify her case, especially considering the context of the incident and the building owner's responsibility for the elevator's maintenance and operation."
