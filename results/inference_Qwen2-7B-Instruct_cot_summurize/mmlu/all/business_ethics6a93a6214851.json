Huge power, Major contribution, Business malpractice.\n\nBusinesses do indeed possess significant power within society due to their economic influence and their role in shaping various aspects of daily life. They have the potential to make substantial contributions to society by creating jobs, driving innovation, and providing essential goods and services. However, this power also comes with responsibilities. Businesses can sometimes engage in practices that harm individuals, communities, or the environment, which is referred to as \"business malpractice.\" Therefore, it's crucial for companies to uphold principles of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to ensure they operate ethically and sustainably."
