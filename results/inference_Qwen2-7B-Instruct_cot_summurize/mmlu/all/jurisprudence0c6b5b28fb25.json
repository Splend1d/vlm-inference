This is encapsulated in his principle of justice in transfer, which he argues applies not only to the initial acquisition of resources but also to subsequent transfers between individuals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: If each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just. \n\nThis implies that Nozick would argue against the idea that merely redistributing wealth could lead to a just society. Instead, he focuses on the justification for one's holdings, suggesting that if each person has acquired their possessions through fair means, then the distribution as a whole can be considered just, even if it is not equal."
