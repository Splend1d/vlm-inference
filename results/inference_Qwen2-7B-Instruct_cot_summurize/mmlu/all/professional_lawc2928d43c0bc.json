The man has \u00d2Beware of Dogs\u00d3 signs clearly posted around a fenced-in yard where he keeps the dogs. The man\u00d5s next-door neighbor frequently walks past the man\u00d5s house and knows about the dogs\u00d5 ferocity. One summer day, the neighbor entered the man\u00d5s fenced-in yard to retrieve a snow shovel that the man had borrowed during the past winter. The neighbor was attacked by one of the dogs and was severely injured. In a suit against the man, is the neighbor likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor knew that the man had dan-gerous dogs in the yard.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing when he entered the man\u00d5s property.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor was an invitee for the pur-pose of retrieving the shovel.\nD. Yes, because the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

Yes, because the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\n\nIn this scenario, the man's act of breeding and keeping potentially dangerous German Shepherd dogs for guard duty can be considered an \"abnormally dangerous activity.\" This type of activity involves a high degree of risk that cannot be eliminated through reasonable care. As such, the man would have a heightened duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent harm to others.\n\nWhen someone engages in an abnormally dangerous activity, they must take appropriate precautions to protect others from the potential risks involved. In this case, the man should have taken additional measures to ensure that the dogs were contained and did not pose a threat to visitors or passersby. By failing to do so, the man could be held liable for any injuries caused by the dogs.\n\nTherefore, if the neighbor successfully proves that the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity (breedinging and guarding dogs, and that the man failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent harm, the neighbor is likely to prevail in their lawsuit against the man."
