Failure to retain copies of prepared tax returns or a list of taxpayers for whom such returns were prepared for the last three years.\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Code and the Regulations, there are no specific penalties imposed on tax return preparers for failing to retain copies of prepared tax returns or a list of taxpayers for whom such returns were prepared for the last three years. However, it's important to note that good record-keeping practices are generally recommended by the IRS to ensure compliance and facilitate audits if necessary. \n\nPenalties can apply in other situations:\n- A. Failure to sign a prepared tax return as a tax preparer could result in penalties if it leads to non-compliance issues with the tax return.\n- B. Failure to provide a copy of a prepared tax return to the taxpayer may cause confusion or legal issues for the taxpayer, but it does not directly result in penalties against the preparer under the IRC and Regulations.\n- C. Failure to notify a taxpayer about an inadvertent error on a tax return filed 10 years ago might lead to penalties if the error impacts the current year's taxes or creates other non-compliance issues, rather than the past return itself."
