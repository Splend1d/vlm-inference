This means that they have no control over the prices at which they sell their goods, and thus, they cannot charge more for their products just because they've made an innovation that increases their marginal physical product.\n\nHowever, firms are also price takers when it comes to buying inputs such as labor. The hourly wage is determined by the market and is not influenced by the specific productivity of individual workers within the firm. \n\nThe technological innovation that raises the firm's marginal physical product means that each worker is producing more output than before. This increases the value of the marginal product of labor for the firm. However, since the firm is a price taker in the labor market, it can't increase wages due to its own productivity gains. \n\nTo take advantage of the increased productivity, the firm would need to hire more workers, as each additional worker contributes more to total output. But, since the firm cannot raise wages due to its own productivity gains, it will hire more workers at the existing wage rate."
