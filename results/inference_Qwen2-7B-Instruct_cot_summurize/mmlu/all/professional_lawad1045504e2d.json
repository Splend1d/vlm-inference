He hires a crop-duster to spray the field, but the crop- duster mistakenly sprays a strong herbicide, rather than a pesticide, and kills all the corn plants in the field. Several days later, a construction company building a house near the farmer's field negligently hits a gas line and starts a fire that burns everything in the area, including the farmer's field. If the farmer brings negligence claims against the crop-duster and the construction company in order to recover damages for the destruction of his corn crop, the most likely result is\n\nA. only the crop-duster is liable, because its negligence occurred before the construction company's negligence.\nB. only the construction company is liable, because its negligence would have destroyed the farmer's corn crop no matter what the crop- duster did.\nC. both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because each engaged in a negligent action that was sufficient to destroy the farmer's corn crop.\nD. neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because neither is a \"but for\" cause of the harm.\n"

In this case, both the crop-duster's mistake in spraying the wrong chemical and the construction company's negligence in hitting the gas line and starting a fire were direct causes of the destruction of the farmer's corn crop. Each act alone could not have caused the loss without the other; together, they created a chain of events leading to the damage. Therefore, both entities can be held liable for their respective negligent actions.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they incorrectly assume that one party's liability is independent of the other's. Option D is also incorrect because the negligence of both parties was a contributing factor to the harm suffered by the farmer."
