In fact, it could be seen as thoughtful and considerate, especially if you were aware that she might feel cooler with a blanket on.\n\nIn scenario 2, pulling your neighbor's weeds without their permission can be seen as disrespectful and possibly even malicious, depending on the context. This action assumes control over someone else's property without their consent, which is generally viewed as a violation of their rights and can be considered morally wrong."
