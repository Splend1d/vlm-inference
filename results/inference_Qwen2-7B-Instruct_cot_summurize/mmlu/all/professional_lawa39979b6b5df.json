The parties entered into a contract whereby the seller agreed to deliver to the buyer 1,000 flanges for $10,000. The contract stipulated that it was FOB at the seller's place of business. The seller then delivered the flanges to a delivery company, which was to transport them to the buyer. While en route, the vehicle that was transporting the flanges was involved in an accident and the flanges were destroyed. When the buyer received notice of the accident, the buyer immediately contacted the seller and demanded that it ship replacement flanges. The seller refused to do so. In an action by the buyer against the seller for breach of contract, the buyer will\n\nA. succeed, because the risk of loss was on the seller.\nB. succeed, because the carrier was the seller's agent.\nC. not succeed, because the risk of loss was on the buyer.\nD. not succeed, because of frustration of purpose.\n"

This means that if the goods get damaged or lost during transportation, the responsibility for the loss falls on the buyer. Therefore, since the contract specified that the flanges would be FOB at the seller's place of business, the risk of loss due to the accident would typically be on the buyer.\n\nThe buyer's demand for replacement flanges after the accident does not change the fact that the original shipment was lost before it reached the buyer's hands. The buyer cannot hold the seller responsible for the loss under the terms of the contract they agreed upon.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the risk of loss is not with the seller, and the carrier is not necessarily the seller's agent unless specifically stated in the contract. Option D, frustration of purpose, is also not applicable here because it refers to a situation where an unforeseen event undermines the very purpose of the contract, which is not the case when the goods are lost in transit as expected under the FOB terms."
