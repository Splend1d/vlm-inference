As the temperature increases, the molecules in the air move faster and can transmit sound waves more quickly. Therefore, the speed of sound increases with higher temperatures. \n\nFrequency and wavelength do not directly affect the speed of sound in air. Frequency refers to the number of cycles per second of a sound wave, while wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points in a wave that are in phase (such as two peaks or troughs. Both are are properties of the sound wave itself, rather than the medium through which it travels."
