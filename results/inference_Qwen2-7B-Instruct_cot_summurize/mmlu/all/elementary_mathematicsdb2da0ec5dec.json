A more accurate estimation would be to consider rounding to the nearest ten:\n\nRounding to the nearest ten:\n- 711 rounds to 710\n- 497 rounds to 500\n\nAdding these rounded numbers: \\(710 + 500 = 1210\\)\n\nThis is still an overestimate but gives us a better idea of the actual sum's vicinity.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 50 and 400 - Incorrect range, as the sum will be much higher.\nB. 450 and 700 - This range is too low, considering the actual sum will be closer to 1200 when using a rough estimate.\nC. 750 and 1,000 - This range is still quite low, but it's closer than the others given our estimation process. It suggests that the sum is likely above 750 but below 1,000.\nD. 1,050 and 1,300 - This range is correct if we're considering the actual sum could be around 1,200.\n\nThus, the most appropriate answer based on the estimation and the provided options is **C. 750 and 1,000**."
