For example, Genesis 1:28 states, \"Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it,\" which presents sexuality as a means for procreation and population growth. However, the Bible also discusses how sexual behaviors can have societal impacts and consequences, such as in Leviticus 18, which lists prohibitions against certain sexual relationships due to concerns about family structure and purity."
