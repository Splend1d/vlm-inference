The mean of the residuals is always zero.\n\nIn regression analysis, residuals represent the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the regression model. Ideally, a good model will have residuals that are randomly distributed around zero, meaning that on average, the model neither systematically overestimates nor underestimates the response variable. Therefore, the mean of these residuals should ideally be close to zero.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not necessarily true:\n\nA. Influential scores do not necessarily have large residuals. An influential score can significantly affect the slope of the regression line but does not inherently correlate with the size of the residual. Residuals depend on how far an observation deviates from the fitted regression line, not just whether it is an influential point.\n\nB. If the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals will not necessarily be the same as the number of negative residuals. A well-fitted model aims for residuals to be randomly scattered around zero, not symmetrically balanced above and below zero. The distribution of residuals should be random, not necessarily balanced.\n\nD. If the correlation is 0, there will not be a distinct pattern in the residual plot. A correlation of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables, but this does not imply that the residual plot will show a distinct pattern; rather, it would suggest that the residuals are randomly distributed without any discernible pattern. However, a residual plot should ideally show randomness around zero, regardless of the correlation value."
