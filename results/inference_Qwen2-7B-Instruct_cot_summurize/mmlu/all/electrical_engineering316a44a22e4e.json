Potentiometer\n\nA variable displacement transducer is an instrument that converts a physical quantity into an electrical signal whose magnitude varies in proportion to the quantity. Among the options given, a potentiometer can be considered as a type of variable displacement transducer. It works on the principle of resistance change with displacement, thereby converting mechanical movement into an electrical output. \n\n- A tachometer measures rotational speed and doesn't necessarily involve displacement.\n- Synchros are another type of transducer that uses electromagnetic principles but isn't typically classified as a variable displacement transducer.\n- None of the above would not be correct since option B (potentiometer) fits the description."
