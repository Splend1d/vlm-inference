In positive nitrogen balance, the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.\n\nPositive nitrogen balance occurs when the body takes in more nitrogen through food than it excretes. This typically happens during growth, development, and recovery from illness or injury, as the body needs more proteins to build or repair tissues. \n\nTo clarify the other options:\nA. This describes a situation known as negative nitrogen balance or protein catabolism, where the body breaks down more proteins than it synthesizes, often seen during malnutrition or severe illness.\nB. A positive nitrogen balance does not mean a net loss of protein from the body; instead, it indicates an overall increase in protein synthesis.\nD. Negative nitrogen balance (occurs when the body's excretion of nitrogenous waste exceeds its dietary intake, which can be indicative of malnutrition, starvation, or disease states."
