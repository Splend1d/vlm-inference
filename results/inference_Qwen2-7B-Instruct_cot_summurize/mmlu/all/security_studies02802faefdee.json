A sudden influx of refugees fleeing conflict from neighboring states.\n\nWhile all the options presented can pose significant challenges to weak states, the influx of refugees generally represents an external pressure rather than an internal challenge like warlordism, coup d'\u00e9tat, military rebellion, or competition for authoritative power. The other options ( A, C, and D - warlordism, coup d'\u00e9tat/military rebellion, and competition for authoritative power - directly involve internal political instability or power dynamics within the state itself. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that all these factors are interconnected and can exacerbate each other in a fragile state context. For example, weak governance might facilitate the rise of warlords or criminal gangs ( and a coup or military rebellion might lead to the displacement of populations causing a refugee crisis. Similarly, competition for authoritative power might lead to civil unrest or even warlordism. Therefore, each of these options poses serious threats to the stability and sovereignty of weak states."
