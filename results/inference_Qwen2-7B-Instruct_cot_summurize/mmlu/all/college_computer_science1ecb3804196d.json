It can be shown by reduction from the Hamiltonian Cycle problem, which is known to be NP-complete. Therefore, there is no known algorithm that can solve this problem in polynomial time.\n\nB. Finding a shortest cycle in G: This problem can be solved in polynomial time using algorithms such as Johnson's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm. These algorithms find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, and from there, the shortest cycle can be determined. Thus, this problem is solvable in polynomial time.\n\nC. Finding ALL spanning trees of G: There are n^(n-2) possible spanning trees for a complete graph with n vertices. However, the number of spanning trees in any given graph G can be calculated efficiently using Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem, which involves the computation of the determinant of a certain matrix derived from the adjacency matrix of G. While the calculation itself might seem to imply exponential complexity due to the determinant computation, it is actually polynomial in the size of the input ( since the matrix involved is sparse and its size is linear in the number of edges. Therefore, this problem is solvable in polynomial time.\n\nD. Finding a largest clique in G: This problem is NP-hard. It is known as the Maximum Clique Problem, and there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for solving it exactly for arbitrary graphs. The best known algorithms have exponential running time in the worst case.\n\nSo, the problems that are currently known to be solvable in polynomial time are:\n\nB. Finding a shortest cycle in G\nC.
