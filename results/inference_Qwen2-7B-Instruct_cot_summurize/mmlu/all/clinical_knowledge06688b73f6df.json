This leads to an underactive thyroid, and one of the key diagnostic indicators is a raised level of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( (TSH). When the thyroid gland isn't producing enough hormones, the pituitary gland senses this and increases the production of TSH in an attempt to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more hormones.\n\nThe other options are not typically associated with hypothyroidism:\n- A. Weight loss: Hypothyroidism often results in weight gain, not weight loss, due to the metabolic slowdown.\n- B. Pre-tibial myxoedema: This is a specific skin condition that can occur as a complication of untreated or poorly managed hypothyroidism, particularly in tropical climates. It's not a defining characteristic of hypothyroidism but rather a potential complication.\n- D. An aversion to warm places: While people with hypothyroidism might feel cold more than others because their metabolism is slower, they may not necessarily have an \"aversion\" to warm places. The symptom is related to the general feeling of being cold and lethargy, which are common symptoms of hypothyroidism."
