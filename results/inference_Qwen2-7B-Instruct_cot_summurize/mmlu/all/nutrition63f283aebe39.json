                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.\n\nTrypsinogen, an inactive form of the proteolytic enzyme trypsin, is produced in the pancreas. It must be converted into its active form, trypsin, before it can effectively break down proteins in the food. This conversion happens when enteropeptidase, another enzyme secreted by the pancreas, removes a specific peptide sequence from trypsinogen, thus exposing the active site of the enzyme. The resulting trypsin then goes on to digest proteins in the small intestine. \n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. Pepsinogen is indeed the chief enzyme that digests proteins in the stomach, not the pancreas. Pepsinogen requires activation by the action of hydrochloric acid and rennin ( in the stomach environment to become pepsin, which then breaks down proteins.\n\nB. Pancreatic \u03b1-amylase does not hydrolyze starch to free glucose; instead, it breaks down starch into smaller sugars like maltose, which can then be further broken down into glucose by other enzymes in the small intestine.\n\nD. While hydrochloric acid is indeed secreted by the stomach, not the pancreas, it is crucial for creating an acidic environment in the stomach that allows pancreatic enzymes to function properly. However, it is not directly involved in the secretion or activation of pancreatic enzymes themselves."
