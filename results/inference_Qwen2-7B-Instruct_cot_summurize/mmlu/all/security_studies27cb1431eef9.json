Reduced health, education, and social welfare spending and the introduction of cost-recovery and user-fees put healthcare and education beyond the reach of many ordinary people. Public sector redundancies and salary freezes lead to fewer teachers and doctors.\nC.

All of these options. \n\nStructural adjustment policies, often advocated by international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund ( and World Bank, typically involves economic reforms aimed at promoting growth and stability. However, these policies can have significant impacts on the poor, as outlined in each of the options:\n\nA. The cost of imports soaring, especially for essential goods like medicines, and basic food prices rising can disproportionately affect the poor, who spend a larger portion of their income on necessities.\n\nB. Reductions in public spending on health, education, and social welfare, along with the introduction of cost-recovery and user fees, can make these services less accessible to the poor. This can lead to reduced health outcomes and educational opportunities, exacerbating poverty.\n\nC. Massive redundancies and increased unemployment without adequate social security provisions can push families further into poverty. This not only affects those directly losing their jobs but also has broader economic and social impacts through reduced consumption, increased stress, and potential migration.\n\nTherefore, all of the options listed represent impacts that can be associated with the implementation of common structural adjustment policies on the poor."
