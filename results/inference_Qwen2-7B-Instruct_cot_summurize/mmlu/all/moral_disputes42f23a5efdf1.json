Given the options provided, Fine might choose:\n\nA. The liberal state cannot claim to be primarily an intimate or expressive association.\n\nThis choice aligns with Fine's response because it emphasizes that while the state may have certain responsibilities and powers, it should not prioritize intimate or expressive associations over individual rights and welfare. The state has a duty to protect and promote the rights of all its citizens, including those who might be affected by its policies or decisions, even if those decisions cause inconvenience or hardship to some individuals. This perspective counters Wellman's assertion that the state can exclude others without considering potential harms, by highlighting the importance of balancing state power with individual rights and the need for the state to act in ways that uphold and protect these rights, rather than merely excluding individuals based on arbitrary criteria."
