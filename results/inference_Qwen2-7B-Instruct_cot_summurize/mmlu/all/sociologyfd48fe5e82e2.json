The punishment or stigmatization of deviant acts: This refers to the societal response to deviance, such as legal sanctions, moral condemnation, or social exclusion, which can further discourage or punish individuals for their deviant behavior.\n\nB. The labelling of an act as deviant through social reactions to it: This involves the process by which society collectively identifies and labels certain behaviors as deviant. Once labeled, these behaviors can gain a deviant status and attract negative social reactions.\n\nC. The ways in which taking on a deviant role affects future action: This aspect looks at how being being labeled as deviant can influence an individual's subsequent behavior and interactions with society. It may lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the individual behaves in accordance with the deviant label, often due to feelings of marginalization, lack of opportunities, or a desire to conform to the expectations set by society.\n\nTherefore, secondary deviation encompasses all three of these components."
