He is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium. Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he becomes very anxious. Vital signs are temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.7\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a dry neck dressing and no stridor. Extremities are warm, with brisk capillary refill time. Additional physical examination is most likely to show which of the following?\n\nA. Babinski sign present bilaterally\nB. Chvostek sign\nC. Deviation of the tongue to the left side\nD. A drooping left shoulder\n"

Chvostek sign\n\nThe patient's symptoms of circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, along with anxiety, suggest possible complications related to electrolyte imbalance or neurological issues. The Chvostek sign, which involves a spasm of the facial muscles when a small amount of a 5% sodium chloride solution is injected intracutaneously on the forehead or cheek, can indicate hyperkalemia ( (high potassium levels) or other electrolyte imbalances. This would be an important finding in this case, as it could point to a potential cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nThe other options listed do not typically correlate with the symptoms described:\n\nA. Babinski sign present bilaterally: This is usually associated with neurological disorders like spinal cord injuries or diseases rather than electrolyte imbalances or thyroid surgery complications.\n\nC. Deviation of the tongue to the left side: This symptom might suggest a neurological issue but is not directly related to the presented symptoms or the patient's history.\n\nD. A drooping left shoulder: This could potentially be related to a neurological condition, but without more specific information about the patient's neurological examination, it's hard to diagnose based on the symptoms provided.\n\nGiven the context and symptoms, the Chvostek sign would be the most appropriate answer, indicating the need for further assessment of electrolyte balance."
