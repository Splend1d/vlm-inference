Hardin is known for his work in environmental ethics, particularly for his essay \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" which discusses the consequences of individuals acting in their own self-interest on a shared resource, leading to its depletion or degradation. His approach often involves evaluating actions based on their outcomes or consequences, which alignss with the principles of consequentialism.\n\nConsequentialism, also known as utilitarianism, argues that the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes; an action is right if it produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people. This contrasts with other ethical theories such as virtue ethics, which focus on the character traits of the moral agent, and deontological theories, which emphasize duties and rules regardless of the consequences."
