The producer sent the manufacturer a sheet containing the dimensions of the boxes' needs, as well as the logo to be placed on each box. After negotiations, the parties entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer agreed to supply the producer with as many of the boxes as the producer may require up to a maximum of 10,000 per month. Later that day, the producer telephoned the manufacturer and said that they were running a one-time promotion and expected to sell an unusually large number of widgets. Therefore, for the first month only, they would need 15,000 boxes. The manufacturer agreed to this request. The manufacturer's oral agreement to supply the producer with the 15,000 boxes for the first month would most likely be held\n\nA. enforceable.\nB. unenforceable, because their written contract on the same date was the final integration of the terms of their agreement.\nC. unenforceable, because the agreement was violative of the parol evidence rule.\nD. unenforceable, because there was inadequate consideration to support the manufacturer's unilateral promise.\n"

In this scenario, after negotiating and signing a written contract that limits the monthly supply to 10,000 boxes, the manufacturer orally agreed to supply 15,000 boxes for the first month in response to the producer's one-time promotional need. This oral agreement is considered supplementary to the existing written contract and does not violate the principle of final integration since the written contract does not explicitly prohibit or limit such additional agreements for specific occasions.\n\nThe key factors that would support the enforceability of this oral agreement include:\n\n1. **Consistency with the written contract**: The oral agreement does not change the fundamental terms of the written contract, such as price, payment terms, or quality standards. It merely expands the quantity of goods to be delivered for a specific period (in this case, just the first month.\n\n2. **Mutual understanding**: Both parties must have a clear and mutual understanding of the terms of the oral agreement, which in this case seems to be the case based on the producer's request and the manufacturer's subsequent agreement.\n\n3. **Legal capacity**: Both the producer and the manufacturer must have the legal capacity to enter into contracts, which generally means they are are of sound mind, not minors, and not legally incapacitated.\n\n4. **Consideration**: There is consideration for the manufacturer's promise, which is the expectation of receiving payment for supplying the additional boxes, even if the exact amount is not specified in the question.\n\nGiven these points, the oral agreement for the first month's supply of 15,000 boxes would likely be held enforceable by a court."
