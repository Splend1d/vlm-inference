Any craters that existed have been eroded through the strong winds on Io's surface.\n"

Its surface is constantly being reshaped by volcanic activity, which results in lava flows covering over any pre-existing impact craters. This is why, despite having received impacts throughout its history, its surface today appears relatively crater-free compared to other moons in the Solar System with less volcanic activity."
