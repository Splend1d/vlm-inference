This fallacy occurs when an argument's conclusion is assumed within one of its premises, essentially making the argument circular and not providing any substantive evidence or support for the conclusion beyond what is already being assumed. \n\nIn other words, \"begging the question\" means that the argument is circular, where the reason given for something is actually just a restatement of what it is supposed to prove. This type of reasoning does not actually provide any additional support or proof for the conclusion."
