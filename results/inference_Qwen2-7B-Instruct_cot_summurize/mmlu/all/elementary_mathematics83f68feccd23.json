Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days. This means he hiked a total of \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) miles. This matches the expression 6 x 2.\n\nB. Rocco had six baseballs and gave away two of them. This scenario involves subtraction rather than multiplication.\n\nC. Rocco had a total of six tennis balls in two cans. This does not necessarily imply multiplication unless we know that there were an equal number of tennis balls in each can. Without this information, it's not clear whether this represents multiplication.\n\nD. Rocco biked six miles and then continued for two more miles. This scenario adds miles together rather than multiplying.\n\nTherefore, the situation that could be represented by the expression 6 x 2 is:\n\nA. Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days."
