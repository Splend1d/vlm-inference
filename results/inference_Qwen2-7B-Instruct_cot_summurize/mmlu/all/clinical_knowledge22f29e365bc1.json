They can occur due to errors during DNA replication, or as a result of exposure to certain chemicals, radiation, or viruses. While some mutations can be harmful and lead to diseases like cancer, others might have no effect or could even be beneficial, depending on the context and location within the genome. Therefore, not all mutations are inherently harmful, and they play a crucial role in genetic diversity and evolution."
