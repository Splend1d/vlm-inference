External intercostal muscles and diaphragm.\n\nDuring quiet inspiration, the primary muscles involved are the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. The external intercostal muscles elevate the ribs, increasing the thoracic cavity volume. Simultaneously, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward, further expanding the thoracic cavity and increasing air intake."
