Light leaving the Sun is indeed slowed by gravity. This effect is due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the Sun's mass, which bends the path of light.\n\nB. Light passing near the Sun is deflected. This happens because the gravitational field of the Sun curves the path of light rays, similar to how it would curve the path of a planet orbiting around the Sun.\n\nC. A clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs slower compared to a clock on Earth. This is known as time dilation and is a consequence of general relativity. Clocks run slower in stronger gravitational fields or when moving closer to massive objects like the Sun.\n\nTherefore, all of the options A, B, and C accurately describe predictions made by general relativity."
