It involves misleading a court or other authority, which undermines the integrity of legal proceedings and trust in the justice system.\n\nScenario 2: Renting out property at better than market rates when one knowingly has an advantage over tenants (such as being the sole landlord or having exclusive access to high-demand properties that are are not easily available elsewhere\u2014can be seen as exploitative and unfair. This practice may not necessarily violate any specific laws but is generally viewed as morally wrong due to its potential to cause harm to others, particularly if it leads to financial hardship for tenants who have few alternatives."
