The line on which the call was made was a line owned by a woman. Immediately after receiving the call, the telephone operator reported the threatening conversation to the police. About half an hour later, during which time she had handled a number of other calls, the telephone operator received a call from a police officer who was at the woman's home. He asked her to listen to a voice. After she did, the officer asked the telephone operator if she could identify it. The telephone operator responded that she was positive that it was the voice of the person who had made the threat. As a result of the telephone operator's identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested and charged with the crime of terrorist threatening. As a consequence of the arrest, the boyfriend lost his job and suffered embarrassment and ridicule in the community. At trial, however, the telephone operator's identification proved to be erroneous, and the boyfriend was exonerated. In a defamation action for slander by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company, he will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification constituted slander per Se.\nB. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in the loss of his good reputation in the community.\nC. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.\nD. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.\n"

For defamation claims, there is often a defense available when the statement is made in good faith and without malice, particularly when the statement serves a public interest or necessity. \n\nSlander per se refers to statements that are so obviously defamatory that no malice need be proven. However, the fact that the identification was erroneous does not necessarily equate to slander per se, as it depends on whether the false accusation was inherently defamatory without needing additional context or interpretation. \n\nS. The boyfriend losing his job and suffering embarrassment does not automatically constitute slander per se unless the false statement was so clearly damaging that it needed no further elaboration or context.\n\n D. The qualified privilege argument might apply here. Statements made by a party under a legal duty ( such as a witness or a person providing information to law enforcement, can be protected by a qualified privilege, provided the statement was made honestly and reasonably in the circumstances. In this case, the telephone operator was acting under a legal duty to report threats to the police.\n\nGiven these considerations, the boyfriend would most likely not succeed in his defamation claim against the telephone operator because the identification was made in the course of her duties and without actual malice. The specific legal outcome may also depend on jurisdictional laws regarding defamation, slander, and the extent of the privilege afforded in such situations."
