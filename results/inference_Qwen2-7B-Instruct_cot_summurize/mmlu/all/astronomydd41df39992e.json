It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.\n\nEarth's strong magnetic field is generated by the dynamo effect in its outer core, which is a partially molten layer of iron and nickel. The movement of this liquid metal generates electric currents, which in turn create a magnetic field. The rapid rotation of the Earth provides the necessary motion to maintain these currents, as it causes convection currents in the liquid metal. This combination of a partially molten metallic core and a reasonably rapid rotation is unique to Earth among the terrestrial planets, making it the only one with a strong global magnetic field."
