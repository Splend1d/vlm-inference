A program that finds the shortest driving route between two locations on a map.\n\nThis task is more suited for a heuristic approach because it involves searching through a large number of possible routes, which can be computationally intensive using an exact algorithm like Dijkstra's or A*. Heuristics such as the A* search algorithm or the nearest neighbor algorithm can provide good approximations to the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time, making them suitable for real-world applications where finding the absolute best solution may not be feasible due to time constraints."
