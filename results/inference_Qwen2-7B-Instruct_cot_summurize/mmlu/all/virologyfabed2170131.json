This process typically involves the use of cellular scaffolding in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (A. Viruses often hijack the host cell's machinery and resources to facilitate their assembly. They utilize the cell's membrane structures and proteins, as well as lipids, to construct their capsid (the protein shell around the viral genome) and envelope (if present in enveloped viruses). The master plan that guides this process is indeed embedded in the viral genome, but it is not the sole factor. Therefore, option A provides a more comprehensive description of how assembly is often accomplished."
