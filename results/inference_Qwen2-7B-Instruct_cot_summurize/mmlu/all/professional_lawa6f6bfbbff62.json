The husband was present and denied the allegation. Police asked for permission to search the premises for drugs, which was consented to by the wife. The husband, however, refused to consent to the search. The police went ahead anyway and found drugs in the husband's belongings. After being arrested on drug charges, the husband filed a motion for suppression of the evidence based on lack of consent. What should be the likely decision of the trial court?\n\nA. The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.\nB. The search was valid because the cases say that one occupant's consent to the search overrules the other occupant's refusal to consent.\nC. The search was valid because the wife's statement established probable cause that a crime was being committed \u0080\u0093 this created exigent circumstances for the search.\nD. The search was invalid because, even though consent was given, the police must first attempt to get a search warrant to enter a home.\n"

The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.\n\nIn the United States, under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, a search of a person's home generally requires a warrant based on probable cause, unless there are are exigent circumstances or the individual consents to the search. In the scenario presented, both the wife and the husband are co-occupants of the premises. While the wife consented to the search, the husband, who is also a co-occupant with rights to privacy, specifically refused to consent. Therefore, without the consent of both co-occupants or exigent circumstances, the police cannot legally search the premises. \n\nThe Supreme Court case of United States v. Matlock ( (415 U.S. 164 ( (1974) established that when a co-occupant consents to a search, that consent can override another co-occupant's refusal to consent, but only if the consenting co-occupant has the authority to do so. In this case, since the husband specifically refused consent, the search conducted without his explicit permission would not be justified under these circumstances. Thus, the evidence obtained through such an unlawful search would likely be suppressed."
