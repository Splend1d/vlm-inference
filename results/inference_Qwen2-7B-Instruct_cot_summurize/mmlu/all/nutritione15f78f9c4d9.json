Brassicas\n\nGoitrogens are compounds that can interfere with the function of the thyroid gland, which is responsible for producing hormones that regulate metabolism and growth. Some foods contain goitrogenous compounds in their raw form but lose their goitrogenic properties when cooked. Brassicas, such as broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and bok choy, are examples of these types of foods. \n\nFish, meat, and rice do not generally contain significant amounts of goitrogenic compounds."
