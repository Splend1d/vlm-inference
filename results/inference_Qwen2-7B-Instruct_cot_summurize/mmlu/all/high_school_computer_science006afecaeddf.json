Interchanging line 6 and line 7**.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **Option A**: Interchanging line 1 and line 2 would not reduce the number of operations since both lines are executed for each element in the list, regardless of their order.\n- **Option B**: Interchanging line 5 and line 6 would not reduce the number of operations either, as they both increment `count` and add a value to `sum`, respectively, for each element in the list.\n- **Option C**: Interchanging line 6 and line 7 is the correct choice. By moving the calculation of `average` after the loop ends (line 9), we avoid performing the division operation within the loop, which can be costly in terms of computational resources. This change reduces the number of operations because the division operation is only performed once, outside the loop, instead of for each iteration.\n- **Option D**: Interchanging line 7 and line 8 would not reduce the number of operations significantly. The division operation is still performed after all elements have been processed, but it's not dependent on reducing the number of operations inside the loop.\n\nTherefore, the most effective change to reduce the number of operations performed is option **C**, by interchanging line 6 and line 7."
