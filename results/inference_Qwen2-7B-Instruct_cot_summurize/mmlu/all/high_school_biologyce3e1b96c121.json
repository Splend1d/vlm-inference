This results in a completely different set of codons being translated into the protein.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HAS HIT\" - This does not involve an addition or deletion of nucleotides, so it is not a frameshift mutation.\n\nB. \"CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HSH ISA\" - In this case, one nucleotide (S has been added to the sequence, which would cause a frameshift as the reading frame would be altered.\n\nC. \"CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HIS HAT\" - Here, two nucleotides have been added (IS and T at the end, resulting in a frameshift.\n\nD. \"CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT WAS HIT\" - This involves the deletion of IS and the addition of W, which also shifts the reading frame.\n\nBoth B and C are technically frameshift mutations, but since you asked for a single answer, I'll choose the most straightforward example of a frameshift mutation based on the addition of nucleotides(s), which is option **B** (\"CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HSH ISA\")."
