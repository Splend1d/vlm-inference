The law established a commission, consisting of five individuals, that was in charge of licensing and overseeing the activities of the casinos. The members of the commission were to be appointed by the mayor. Pursuant to his statutory power, the mayor appointed four private citizens and a clergy member to the Commission. There is a constitutional challenge to the appointment of the clergy member as violating the establishment clause of the First Amendment. The mayor's action is\n\nA. unconstitutional, because the appointment of a clergy member to the commission fosters excessive governmental entanglement with religion.\nB. unconstitutional on its face, because members of the commission are vested with enforcement powers.\nC. constitutional, because the primary effect of appointing only one religious member to the commission does not, per Se, advance or inhibit religion.\nD. constitutional, because commission membership is an appointive privilege and not an elective right.\n"

When making appointments to a public body like a commission, it is generally permissible for the government to consider religious affiliation if the position requires a specific religious background, such as when the role involves leading religious services or teaching religious doctrine. However, if the position is secular and unrelated to religious duties, then the appointment should be based solely on qualifications relevant to the job.\n\nIn this case, since the commission is responsible for licensing and overseeing casinos, which are are secular activities, the primary effect of appointing a clergy member would likely not be seen as advancing or inhibiting religion. The presence of a single religious member on a secular commission would not, by itself, indicate a preference for that religion over others or establish a state-sponsored religious institution. Therefore, unless there are other circumstances not mentioned in the question that might suggest otherwise, the appointment would be considered constitutional under the Establishment Clause."
