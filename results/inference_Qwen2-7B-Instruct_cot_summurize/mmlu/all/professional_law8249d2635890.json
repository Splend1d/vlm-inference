However, the admissibility of such evidence can vary widely based on legal precedent and rules of evidence in different jurisdictions.\n\nAssuming that the evidence of intoxication could potentially support a defense of diminished capacity ( i.e., suggesting that the defendant lacked the requisite mental state to commit murder due to impaired judgment or control caused by intoxication \u2014 the evidence might be deemed admissible under certain circumstances. This would allow the jury to consider whether the defendant's state of mind at the time of the crime was such that they did not have the intent required for higher degrees of murder.\n\nHowever, if the evidence of intoxication is not directly linked to any defenses related to the mental state required for the murder charge ( or if its admission is restricted by specific evidentiary rules ( such as the rule against admitting character evidence to prove conduct in a criminal case\u2014 then the court may exclude the evidence altogether.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer would likely be:\n\nC. admissible, but the jury must be cautioned that it does not pertain to felony murder or second-degree murder. \n\nThis assumes that the court recognizes the potential relevance of the intoxication evidence to the issue of intent or premeditation in the context of first-degree murder, while also cautioning the jury that this evidence should not influence their decision on lesser degrees of murder where intent is not a primary factor. However, the exact ruling would depend on the specifics of the legal framework and precedent in the jurisdiction handling the case."
