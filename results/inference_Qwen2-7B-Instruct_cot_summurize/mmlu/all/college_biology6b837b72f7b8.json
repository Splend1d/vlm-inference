The discovery of fossils is a key piece of evidence supporting the theory of evolution, but the understanding of fossils and their significance as records of past life predates Charles Darwin's work on the origin of species. Fossils were known to scientists long before Darwin's time, with early discoveries by figures like Georges Cuvier in the late 18th and early 19th centuries helping to establish the concept of extinction and the idea that life forms change over time."
