Likely be sucked into the black hole: The strong gravitational pull of a black hole is such that nothing can escape it once it crosses the event horizon, which is the boundary around the black hole from which no light or matter can escape. This includes planets like Earth. So, if the Sun were to become a black hole, Earth would likely be drawn towards it due to the intense gravitational force.\n\nC. Be pulled apart by tidal forces: Even before reaching the event horizon, the intense gravity near a black hole can cause tidal forces to become very strong. These tidal forces can stretch objects (like planets) along the direction of the black hole's gravity, potentially causing them to be elongateded or even torn apart. This effect could occur as Earth approaches the black hole.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the scenario of the Sun collapsing into a black hole is extremely unlikely based on our current understanding of astrophysics and the life cycle of stars. The Sun is expected to end its life as a red giant, engulfing Mercury and Venus, but not collapsing into a black hole."
