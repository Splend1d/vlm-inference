According to Weber, a class situation refers to an individual's or group's position within the economic structure of society, which is determined by their economic resources, specifically their access to capital, products, and labor. This concept encompasses not just wealth but also power and prestige, which can influence an individual's or group's opportunities and life chances within society. It is a multidimensional concept that includes more than just financial wealth, incorporating aspects like ownership of means of production and control over economic processes."
