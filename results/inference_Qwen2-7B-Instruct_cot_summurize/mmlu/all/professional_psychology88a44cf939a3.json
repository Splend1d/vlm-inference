Eventually the infant settles down and returns to playing, apparently happily, with the toys provided. Which attachment classification is most likely to be appropriate for this infant\n\nA.

Infants with this type of attachment tend to show distress when their primary caregiver leaves but may also show frustration or anger towards the caregiver upon reunion, which seems to be the case here. They often exhibit inconsistent behaviors that don't clearly fall into the categories of seeking comfort or avoiding it. \n\nIt's important to note that attachment styles can be complex and not all infants will neatly fit into one category. Also, these classifications are based on general patterns observed over time rather than single incidents."
