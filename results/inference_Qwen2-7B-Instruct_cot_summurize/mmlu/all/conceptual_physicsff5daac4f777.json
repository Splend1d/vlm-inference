                    "text": "In an ideal pulley system, the force applied to lift an object is halved because the force is distributed equally on both sides of the pulley. Given that you are applying a force of 25 N to pull the rope, and the crate weighs 100 N (the mass of which can be calculated as \\(m = \\frac{W}{g} = \\frac{100 N}{9.8 m/m^2} \\approx 10.2 kg\\), the acceleration due to gravity being \\(9.8 m/m^2\\)).\n\nHowever, in an ideal scenario without any friction or other resistive forces, the force you apply (25 N would effectively double in terms of lifting capacity, making it 50 N when considering the action on the crate.\n\nThe distance the crate rises for every meter of rope pulled down is determined by the mechanical advantage of the pulley system. In this case, since you're using a simple pulley system ( (one rope attached to the load), the mechanical advantage is 1:1. This means:\n\nFor every meter of rope you pull down, the crate will rise 1 meter.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 25 m"
