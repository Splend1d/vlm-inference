This means that it allows part of the data bus to be used for addressing purposes, which is essential for accessing memory or I/O devices in a system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Enable the data bus to be used as a low-order address bus\n\nOptions B and C are not accurate because the primary function of ALE is not to latch data from the data bus nor to disable the data bus. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that ALE achieves all the functions listed above, which is not the case based on its primary function."
