S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to \"dirty tricks\" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.\nB. prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.\nC. not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no \"false light. \"\nD. not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.\n"

The lawyer can argue that the publication of truthful information does not constitute an invasion of privacy, especially if the information pertains to actions relevant to their professional role or public duties. In defamation cases, truth is a complete defense, meaning that if the statements made are accurate, the defendant cannot be held liable for defamation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual outcome would depend on the specific laws and legal standards applicable in the jurisdiction where the incident took place, as well as the details of how the information was obtained ( (e.g., whether it was through lawful means or if it involved illegal activities like breaking and entering). In many jurisdictions, even if the information published is true, if it was obtained through unlawful means, the individual or entity responsible for obtaining the information may still face legal consequences, such as criminal charges for the illegal act ( (the burglary), rather than liability for defamation."
