Refuse to make a recommendation about which parent should be granted child custody under any circumstances.\n\nThe reason for this choice is that as an impartial expert, it's not your role to decide who should have custody of the children. Your job is to provide an objective psychological evaluation based on the information gathered during the assessment. You should present the findings accurately and provide professional insights into the woman's capabilities as a parent, but leave the decision regarding custody to the legal system. It's important to maintain professional boundaries and avoid making recommendations that could potentially influence the legal outcome."
