All the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties.\n\nIn international arbitration, the composition of the arbitral tribunal is typically determined by agreement between the parties involved in the dispute. This process often begins with the appointment of an \"appointing authority\" or \"institution,\" which may be specified in the arbitration agreement or the applicable arbitration rules (such as those of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC, the American Arbitration Association (AAA), or the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). Once the appointing authority is agreed upon, it is responsible for appointing one or more arbitrators, depending on whether the arbitration will be conducted under a single arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators system.\n\nIn either case, the parties agree on the number of arbitrators and whether they will appoint the arbitrator(s) themselves or if there will be a third-party appointment. If the parties choose to appoint the arbitrator(s) themselves, this can be done directly or through a process that involves the appointing authority to ensure impartiality and fairness.\n\nIn some circumstances, particularly when there is a disagreement between the parties over the appointment of an arbitrator, the parties may agree to refer the appointment to an impartial third party, such as the president of an international court or an institution known for its impartiality and expertise in arbitration. However, this is not the standard procedure and is more of an exception rather than the general rule."
