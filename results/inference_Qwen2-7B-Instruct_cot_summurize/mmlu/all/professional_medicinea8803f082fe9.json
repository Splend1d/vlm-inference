No treatment is needed at this time\n\nIn most cases, mild bowlegs in children are a normal part of their growth and development and do not require any specific treatment. These types of deformities often resolve on their own as the child grows and develops stronger muscles and bones. However, it's always good practice to consult with a pediatrician or orthopedist for a professional opinion, especially if there are other concerns about the child's development or health."
