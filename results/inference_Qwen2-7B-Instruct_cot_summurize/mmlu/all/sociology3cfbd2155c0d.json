These systems are designed to isolate individuals, regulate their behavior, and monitor their activities. Therefore, the most accurate description according to Foucault's theory would be:\n\nD. isolated people and put them under surveillance\n\nThis option encapsulates the essence of how carceral organizations function by emphasizing control and monitoring over individuals."
