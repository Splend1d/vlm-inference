Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, helping someone by writing an essay for them might be seen as going above and beyond the bounds of friendship or kindness, but it's not necessarily morally wrong. It could be considered unethical or unfair to the person who was supposed to write the essay, depending on the context, but it's not typically viewed as a clear-cut moral wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, telling a disabled person to \"crawl up the stairs\" or implying they should \"remember how to walk\" is clearly morally wrong. This behavior is discriminatory and disrespectful, violating the person's rights and dignity. It does not take into account their physical limitations and disregards the accessibility needs that are are legally required in public spaces under the Americans with Disabilities Act ( (ADA)."
