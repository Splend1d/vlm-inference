The I2 molecule is much larger than Br2 (atomic radii are 114 and 133 pm, respectively). Which is the best reason for the large difference in boiling points?\n\nA. Bromine is a liquid and boils; iodine is a solid and sublimes.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in I2 are much weaker than those in Br2.\nC. The I2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the Br2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\nD. The mass of iodine is much greater than the mass of bromine.\n"

The I2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the Br2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\n\nLondon dispersion forces are the weakest type of intermolecular forces, but they become stronger as the size of the molecules increases because larger molecules have more electrons to participate in these instantaneous dipoles. Since iodine (I2 has larger molecules than bromine (Br2, its electron clouds are more polarizable, leading to stronger London dispersion forces and hence higher boiling points. \n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\nA. This statement doesn't explain why iodine boils at a much higher temperature compared to bromine. It also incorrectly states that iodine is a solid and boils while bromine is a liquid and boils.\nB. Intramolecular bonds do not play a role in determining the boiling point of substances when comparing two different molecules like bromine and iodine. The strength of the intermolecular forces is what matters in this context.\nD. The mass of the elements does not significantly contribute to the difference in boiling points between these two compounds. The key factor here is the size of the molecules and their electron clouds, not the atomic masses."
