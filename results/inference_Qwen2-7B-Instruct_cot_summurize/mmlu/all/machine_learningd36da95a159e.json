Bias decrease; Variance decrease\n\nWhen you add $\\ell_2$ regularization ( also known as Ridge Regression, to your linear model, it introduces a penalty on the size of the coefficients. This has two main effects:\n\n1. **Bias Increase**: The regularization term adds a cost proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients to the loss function. This effectively shrinks the coefficients towards zero, leading to a simpler model. A simpler model can be thought of as having higher bias because it makes stronger assumptions about the form of the underlying function ( compared to an unregularized model which might fit the noise in the training data.\n\n2. **Variance Decrease**: By shrinking the coefficients, the model becomes less sensitive to fluctuations in the training data. This results in lower variance because the predictions made by the model are more consistent across different datasets drawn from the same distribution. \n\nThus, increasing the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient leads to a trade-off between bias and variance: higher bias due to the simplification of the model and lower variance because the model's predictions are less sensitive to the specific dataset used for training."
