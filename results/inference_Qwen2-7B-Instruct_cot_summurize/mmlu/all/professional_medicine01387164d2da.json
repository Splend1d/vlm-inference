Inquiry about an egg allergy.\n\nInfluenza vaccines can be administered in several forms including inactivated whole or split viruses, recombinant hemagglutinin, and live attenuated vaccines. Some of these formulations may contain residual egg protein due to the process of manufacture, which can trigger an allergic reaction in individuals with egg allergy. Therefore, asking about any known allergies before administering the vaccine can help identify if the patient might have a risk of an allergic reaction and thus avoid giving them a vaccine that contains egg proteins.\n\nThe other options listed do not directly address the prevention of the specific adverse reaction described:\n\nB. Heterophile agglutination test is a type of serological test used to detect antibodies against various organisms but does not specifically identify allergies or potential vaccine reactions.\n\nC. A skin test with histamine reagent would assess for an immediate allergic response to histamine, not necessarily indicating a reaction to the vaccine itself.\n\nD. \u03b2-Adrenergic blocking agent therapy would not prevent a vaccine-induced allergic reaction but might be used as part of treatment if the reaction occurs and the patient requires management of their symptoms."
