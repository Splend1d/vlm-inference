The buyer tried to stop the van for a red light, but the brakes failed to operate. As a consequence, the buyer drove through the red light and collided with a car driven by a woman. Subsequently, the woman asserted a claim against the buyer to recover for the injuries she suffered in the accident. At trial, the only evidence offered by the plaintiff concerning the cause of the accident was the testimony of an engineering expert. He testified that a manufacturing defect had caused the brakes to suddenly fail. Based on the facts stated above, a motion by the buyer to dismiss at the end of the woman's case should be\n\nA. granted, because the woman presented no evidence that the buyer was negligent.\nB. granted, because the woman was neither the user nor the consumer of the defective product.\nC. denied, because the buyer had a non-delegable duty to maintain the brakes in a safe condition.\nD. denied, because the buyer is strictly liable for injuries caused by a manufacturing defect in an auto that he had purchased.\n"

This is often referred to as a non-delegable duty, meaning that the responsibility cannot be transferred to another party. If the brakes fail due to a manufacturing defect and cause an accident, the buyer could potentially be held liable for any damages resulting from the unsafe condition of the vehicle, even if the buyer did not personally inspect or maintain the brakes before the accident occurred.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest that the woman (the plaintiff) has not presented sufficient evidence regarding negligence or that she is not entitled to sue as a result of her relationship to the product. However, the question does not directly address the plaintiff's role in causing the accident; it focuses on the defendant's (buyer's) liability for the product's condition.\n\nOption D suggests that the buyer is strictly liable for any injuries caused by a manufacturing defect. While strict liability can apply in certain cases involving defective products, the focus here is more on the buyer's duty to maintain the safety of the vehicle rather than the strict liability principle. The non-delegable duty to maintain safety applies regardless of whether the defect arises from manufacturing or other issues."
