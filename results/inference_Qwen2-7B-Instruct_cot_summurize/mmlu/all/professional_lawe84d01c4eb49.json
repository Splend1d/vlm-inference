Even if she was not present during the incident, her emotional distress was a direct result of the neighbor's actions. This type of emotional harm can be considered as part of a negligence or intentional infliction of emotional distress lawsuit. However, the specific laws regarding such cases can vary significantly between jurisdictions, so the outcome would depend on the legal framework of the applicable location."
