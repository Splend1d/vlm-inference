Wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed\n\nExplanation:\nSafety precautions are essential when working with chemicals like acetone, especially considering its properties as an eye and skin irritant and its flammable vapors. Here's why each option is considered:\n\nA. Putting on fire-retardant gloves to carry the chamber to a fume hood if the acetone catches fire: While this would be useful in case of a fire, it doesn't address the ongoing safety during the experiment. It also might not prevent skin irritation or inhalation of fumes.\n\nB. Placing the chamber in a closed, darkened cabinet for the duration of the pigment separation: This might help minimize exposure to fumes, but it doesn't address the immediate need for protection against skin and eye contact with acetone.\n\nC. Wearing leather gloves and covering the nose and mouth with a particle mask: Leather gloves provide some protection against skin contact, but they are not typically designed to withstand chemical exposure, and a particle mask may not filter out acetone vapors effectively.\n\nD. Wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed: Goggles protect the eyes from splashes and spills, while nitrile gloves offer a barrier against skin contact with the solvent. Keeping the acetone containers closed reduces the risk of accidental exposure through spills or leaks. This option provides comprehensive protection against the risks associated with acetone, making it the most appropriate choice for the given scenario."
