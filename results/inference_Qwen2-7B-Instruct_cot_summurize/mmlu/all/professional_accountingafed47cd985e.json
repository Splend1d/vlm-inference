                    "text": "When a company declares a common stock dividend, the appropriate adjustment to record this transaction involves recognizing the increase in the number of shares outstanding and the corresponding decrease in retained earnings.\n\nHere's how the journal entry would look:\n\n1. **Retained Earnings** decreases by the total value of the stock dividend. The value of the stock dividend is calculated as the number of new shares issued (times the market price per share before the dividend. In this case:\n   - Number of new shares = 30% of 1,000 shares = 300 shares\n   - Market price per share = $10\n   - Total value of the stock dividend = 300 shares * $10 = $3,000\n\n2. **Common Stock** increases by the par value of the new shares. Since the par value is $1 per share:\n   - Increase in Common Stock = 300 shares * $1 = $300\n\n3. **Additional Paid-in Capital** increases by the difference between the market value of the stock dividend and the par value of the new shares. This represents the premium over the par value that shareholders receive through the stock dividend:\n   - Increase in Additional Paid-in Capital = $3,000 ( (market value) - $300 ( (par value) = $2,700\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700."
