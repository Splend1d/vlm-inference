Creating a school safety and response team\n\nThe National Association of School Psychologists (NASP, among other recommendations for improving school safety, advocates for the creation of a comprehensive approach to school safety which includes multidisciplinary teams. These teams can help in developing and implement policies, programs, and practices aimed at creating a safe learning environment. This alignss with NASP's emphasis on prevention, intervention, and support strategies rather than punitive measures.\n\nOptions A, B, and C may not be considered best practices by NASP because:\n- A. Immediate expulsion after a minor infraction is seen as a harsh and potentially ineffective response.\n- B. Zero-tolerance policies can lead to over-disciplining students and does not necessarily address underlying issues or promote long-term behavioral change.\n- C. While communication about safety is important, it should be part of a broader strategy that includes proactive measures and interventions, not just a statement or reassurance to parents."
