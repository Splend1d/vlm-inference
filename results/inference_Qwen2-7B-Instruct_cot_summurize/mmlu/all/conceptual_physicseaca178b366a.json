Not enough information to say.\n\nThe current flowing through the filament of the lamp and the connecting wire depends on how the circuit is set up. In an ideal scenario with no resistance in the connecting wire (which is practically never the case due to some inherent resistance in all wires), the current would be the same throughout the circuit, including the filament, according to Ohm's Law. However, in real-world conditions, the connecting wire will have some resistance, causing a slight drop in voltage as the current flows through it. This drop in voltage across the wire results in a slightly lower voltage available at the filament, leading to a slightly lower current in the filament compared to the wire.\n\nWithout knowing the specifics of the circuit (such as the resistance of the wire, the total resistance of the circuit, or the voltage supply, it's not possible to definitively state whether the current in the filament is less than, equal to, or greater than 3 A."
