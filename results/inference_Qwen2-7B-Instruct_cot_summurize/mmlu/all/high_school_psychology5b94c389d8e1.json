Arrive on time for work\n\nCultural norms and values can significantly influence how individuals perceive and behave in social settings, including the importance placed on punctuality. What is considered \"on time\" can vary greatly across different cultures, with some societies valuing promptness more highly than others. This cultural expectation is not inherently tied to universal psychological needs or drives but rather shaped by societal norms and values.\n\nIn contrast, attributes like caring for one's children (A), having the desire to reproduce  C), and seeking food and water  D) are generally seen as fundamental aspects of human psychology and are not heavily influenced by cultural context. These behaviors are driven by biological instincts and personal values, rather than external cultural expectations."
