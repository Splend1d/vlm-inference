The ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has indeed considered the concept of an \"armed attack\" in various contexts, including in its 1986 advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons and in the 1984-1986 case concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua ( (Nicaragua case). In the latter case, the ICJ did address the notion of an armed attack arising from a series of lower intensity actions.\n\nIn the Nicaragua case, the ICJ recognized that an armed attack could be the result of a series of incidents, which can cumulatively amount to an armed attack under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This article permits states to use force in self-defense if an armed attack occurs against it. The court acknowledged that there could be a threshold below which individual acts do not constitute an armed attack but that when such acts accumulate and reach a certain level of gravity, they could amount to an armed attack.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct, as the ICJ has not been hostile to the idea of an armed attack arising through a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force."
