Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \nIn scenario 1, pulling a kitten around on a rug can be seen as potentially harmful or abusive behavior towards an animal, which is generally considered morally wrong. While it might seem like playful behavior to the person involved, it can cause distress or injury to the kitten, especially if the action is repeated or done in a manner that lacks care for the animal's well-being.\n\nIn scenario 2, feeling guilty about having a full refrigerator while thinking of people starving in the Third World is not necessarily a morally wrong action. It indicates empathy and awareness of global issues, which is often viewed positively. However, it does not directly involve any action that could be considered wrong. The feeling of guilt might lead someone to take actions to help alleviate hunger, which would be morally commendable. Therefore, this scenario does not involve a morally wrong action by the main character."
