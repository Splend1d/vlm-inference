By presenting a clear, structured argument, he aims to engage readers' rational faculties rather than solely relying on emotional appeals. This approach allows him to construct a case that can withstand scrutiny and invites readers to consider the implications of their actions based on logical reasoning rather than purely emotional responses. While emotional appeals certainly play a role in his argument (as they do in many ethical discussions\u2014they serve to illustrate the practical consequences of the premises he lays out. The primary focus, however, remains on the logical strength of the argument itself."
