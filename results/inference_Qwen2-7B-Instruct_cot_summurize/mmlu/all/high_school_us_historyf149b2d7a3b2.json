I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nWhich of the following documents encouraged church membership in the Massachusetts Bay Colony?\n\nA. The Mayflower Compact\nB. The Fundamental Orders\nC. The Halfway Covenant\nD. The Cambridge Agreement\n"

This covenant allowed individuals who were not full church members but had been baptized and lived as members of the church for several years to participate in certain aspects of church governance and hold leadership positions. It was an attempt to balance the strict requirements for full church membership with the need for religious tolerance and inclusion within the colony."
