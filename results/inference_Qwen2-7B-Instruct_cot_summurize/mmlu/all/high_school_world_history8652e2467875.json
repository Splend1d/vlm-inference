Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the following most likely prompted the complaint voiced in the passage?\n\nA. British sale of opium in China\nB. British exports of tobacco to China\nC. British introduction of gunpowder to China\nD. British encouragement of heroin use to China\n"

British sale of opium in China\n\nLin Zexu, the Chinese trade commissioner, was addressing the issue of the widespread sale and harmful effects of opium in China, particularly from foreign traders, notably the British. He criticized the British for not only permitting but actively facilitating the spread of a drug that he believed was causing significant harm to Chinese society. The passage highlights the concern over the moral implications of allowing a destructive substance to be traded across borders, especially when it is known to cause injury to mankind. Therefore, the most fitting answer choice is A, as it directly relates to the opium trade between Britain and China that Lin Zexu was objecting to."
