                    "text": "The correct answer is B. It will fall with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\n\nIn free fall, an object accelerates due to gravity, but as it falls, air resistance ( or drag force, increases because it's moving faster. This drag force acts in the opposite direction to the motion of the object. \n\nInitially, when the object starts falling, the gravitational force pulling it down is greater than the drag force pushing up. So, the net force causes the object to accelerate. As the object picks up speed, the drag force increases, eventually reaching a point where it balances out the gravitational force. This point is called the terminal velocity.\n\nBefore reaching terminal velocity, the object's acceleration is due to gravity minus the drag force, which decreases as the object's speed increases. Therefore, the acceleration decreases over time while the speed keeps increasing until it reaches the terminal velocity. After reaching terminal velocity, the object will continue to fall at a constant speed, experiencing only a constant downward acceleration due to gravity, but not increasing speed anymore because the drag force equals the gravitational force. \n\nSo, during the phase before reaching terminal velocity, the motion is described by \"increasing speed\" and \"decreasing acceleration\", making option B the correct choice."
