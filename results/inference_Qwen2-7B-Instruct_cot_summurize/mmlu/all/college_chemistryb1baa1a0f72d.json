This increases the number of free electrons, making it a conductor. Arsenic (As) when doped into silicon introduces additional electron carriers, thus making it an n-type semiconductor.\n\nA. Silicon - In its pure form, silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, but it is p-type when doped with boron or other similar elements.\n\nB. Diamond - Diamond is an insulator and does not naturally occur as either an n-type or p-type semiconductor.\n\nC. Silicon carbide - Similarly to diamond, silicon carbide is also an insulator and does not naturally occur as an n-type or p-type semiconductor."
