Even in combination current drugs do not completely block viral replication\n\nWhile antiretroviral drugs regimens can effectively manage HIV and keep the virus under control, they cannot eradicate the virus entirely. HIV has the unique ability to integrate its genetic material into the host's genome, allowing it to lie dormant in certain cells (like memory CD4+ T cells) for extended periods. This integrated viral DNA is not directly targeted by current antiretroviral drugs, which primarily inhibit the production of new viral particles.\n\nThus, even when viral replication seems to be suppressed, the virus can reactivate from these reservoirs, leading to viral rebound if treatment is stopped. While some integrase inhibitors can prevent new integration, they do not remove existing viral DNA. Therefore, the current approach focuses on maintaining low levels of HIV through continuous medication to prevent the risk of transmitting the virus and to minimize the development of drug-resistant strains, rather than aiming for a complete cure."
