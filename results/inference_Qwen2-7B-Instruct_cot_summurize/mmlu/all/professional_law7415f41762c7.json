The contract provided that the construction company would be paid upon completion of the warehouse. The contractor finished the warehouse but it had some minor deviations from the plans due to substitution for certain building materials that were not available in the market. The construction company finished working and demanded payment. The paper company refused to pay based on deviations from the specifications. Will the construction company likely prevail in a breach of contract action against the paper company?\n\nA. Yes, a company that performs construction work can always collect for what it has done on a job.\nB. No, the construction company cannot change the specifications and hope to get paid.\nC. No, the construction company is guilty of fraud and misrepresentation.\nD. Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n"

Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n\nIn general, if a party to a contract substantially fulfills their obligations under the agreement, they should still be entitled to receive payment even if there are are minor deviations or changes from the original specifications. This is because substantial performance means that the party has completed the majority of the obligations as agreed upon, despite some minor breaches. In this case, the construction company finished the warehouse, which implies that they have substantially fulfilled their part of the contract. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of the contract and local laws will determine the outcome. If the contract explicitly states that the work must be performed exactly as specified without any deviations, and the deviations caused significant issues (such as structural problems or safety concerns, then the paper company might have grounds to dispute the payment. But based on the information given, the construction company is more likely to prevail in a breach of contract action against the paper company, assuming the deviations did not significantly affect the overall purpose and use of the warehouse."
