There is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures.\n\nThis statement is not entirely accurate. The relationship between calcium intake and bone health is complex. Adequate calcium intake is important for maintaining strong bones, but very high intakes (much above the recommended daily allowance (RDA) do not necessarily lead to further benefits or lower fracture risk. In fact, some studies suggest that very high intakes may be associated with certain risks, such as kidney stone formation. The RDA for calcium varies by age and sex, and it's generally recommended to aim for this level rather than significantly exceeding it.\n\nThe other statements provided are contain inaccuracies or oversimplifications:\n\nA. Typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day - This statement is incorrect. The recommended daily intake for adults is around 1000-1300 mg per day, depending on age and sex.\n\nB. Activated Vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium - This statement is also incorrect. Vitamin D actually increases the absorption of dietary calcium in the intestines.\n\nD. Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low - This statement is not accurate. The efficiency of calcium absorption is primarily influenced by the body's need for calcium, not by the total intake level. When dietary calcium intake is low, the body increases its absorption efficiency to meet its needs. Conversely, when intake is high, absorption efficiency tends to decrease."
