This implies:\n\n- **i)** All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero: This is correct because if the model fails to explain any variability in \\(y\\), none of the independent variables can have a significant relationship with \\(y\\), leading to slope coefficients being estimated as zero.\n  \n- **ii) The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables:** This is also correct because with no explanatory power, the best fit line ( or plane in higher dimensions, would be horizontal, indicating that there is no change in the predicted \\(y\\) values as any of the explanatory variables change.\n  \n- **iii) The regression line has not explained any of the variability of \\(y\\) about its mean value:** This directly follows from the definition of \\(R^2\\), which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. An \\(R^2\\) of 0 means none of this variability is explained by the model.\n  \n- **iv) The intercept coefficient estimate must be zero:** This statement is incorrect. The intercept (\\(b_0\\)) represents the expected mean value of \\(y\\) when all predictors \\(x_i\\) are equal to zero. It being not necessarily zero even if \\(R^2 = 0\\). The intercept can still be non-zero if the mean of \\(y\\) is not exactly zero when all predictors are are at their zero level.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. (i) and (iii) only**."
