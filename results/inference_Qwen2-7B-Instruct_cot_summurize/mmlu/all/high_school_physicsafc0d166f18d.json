The final velocity vf is given as 30 m/s, and the acceleration a is due to gravity, which is approximately -9.81 m/s^2 ( (negative because it acts downward). We want to find the displacement d, which in this case is the height of the cliff.\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n(30 m/s)^2 = 0^2 + 2(-9.81 m/s^2)d\n\n900 = -19.62d\n\nNow solve for d:\n\nd = 900 / 19.62 \u2248 45.8 meters\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\n\nC. 45 m"
