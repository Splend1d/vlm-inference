The standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of a binomial distribution is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{n \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of trials, and \\(p\\) is the probability of success on each trial.\n\nFor the first game:\n- \\(p = 0.5\\) ( (since it's a fair coin)\n- For 30 trials: \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{30 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot (1-0.5)} = \\sqrt{7.5}\\)\n- For 300 trials: \\(\\sigma_2 = \\sqrt{300 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot (1-0.5)} = \\sqrt{75}\\)\n\nFor the second game:\n- \\(p = 0.8\\) ( (since we're looking for more than 80% heads)\n- For 30 trials: \\(\\sigma_3 = \\sqrt{30 \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot (1-0.8)} = \\sqrt{7.2}\\)\n- For 300 trials: \\(\\sigma_4 = \\sqrt{300 \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot (1-0.8)} = \\sqrt{72}\\)\n\nThe standard deviation gives us an idea of how much the outcomes will vary from the expected value. A lower standard deviation means that the outcomes are will be closer to the expected value, making it easier to achieve the desired outcome with fewer trials.\n\nFor the first game, aiming for between 45% and 55% heads, using a fair coin, the standard deviation is relatively high, suggesting that achieving the desired outcome might require more trials to reduce the variability around the mean.\n\nFor the second game, aiming for more than 80% heads, the standard deviation is also not negligible but still suggests that with a higher probability of success, fewer trials might suffice.\n\nTherefore, considering the goal of minimizing variance in outcomes and maximizing the likelihood of success within the given constraints:\n\n**C. 30 times for the first game and 300 times for the second game**\n\nis the most reasonable choice. This allows for a more precise targeting of the desired outcomes in each game, given their different probabilities and ranges of success."
