It is not always limited to the colon (answer A is incorrect). It often causes inflammation and damage to the lining of the digestive tract, which may result in complications such as intestinal obstruction (answer B is correct).\n\nSurgical intervention may be necessary for Crohn's disease, particularly when severe complications occur, but it's not the first line of treatment for everyone. The decision to undergo surgery depends on various factors, including the severity of symptoms, response to medications, and the presence of complications. Therefore, answer C is not universally accurate.\n\nAs for dietary changes, while there isn't a specific \"gluten-free\" diet required for Crohn's disease (answer D is incorrect), dietary modifications might be recommended by healthcare providers to help manage symptoms or prevent malnutrition. The diet typically varies depending on the individual's needs and response to different foods. Gluten sensitivity is a separate condition and does not apply to everyone with Crohn's disease."
