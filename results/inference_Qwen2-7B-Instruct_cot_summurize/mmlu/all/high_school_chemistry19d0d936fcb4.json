The temperature\n\nThe numerical value of the equilibrium constant (K) changes with temperature because it is an intensive property, meaning its value depends only on the thermodynamic state of the system and not on the amount of substance present. According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium towards the exothermic direction. This means that if the reaction is exothermic, the equilibrium will shift to the left (favoring the reactants), decreasing the value of K. Conversely, if the reaction is endothermic, the equilibrium will shift to the right (favoring the products), increasing the value of K.\n\nThe other options do not directly affect the equilibrium constant:\n\nA. Changing the pressure of reactants or products does not change the numerical value of K because the equilibrium constant is defined in terms of concentrations (or partial pressures for gases), not absolute amounts. However, changing the pressure can shift the position of equilibrium (as described by Boyle's law or Henry's law).\n\nB. Similarly, changing the pressure of reactants or products does not change the numerical value of K directly, but it can shift the position of equilibrium.\n\nD. Changing the total mass of the chemicals present does not change the numerical value of K, as it is defined in terms of concentrations or partial pressures per unit volume, not overall mass."
