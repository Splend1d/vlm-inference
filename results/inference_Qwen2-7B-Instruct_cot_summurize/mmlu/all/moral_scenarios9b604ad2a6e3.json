Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, calling the police on a band for playing music is generally not considered morally wrong unless the music is causing significant disturbance or violating specific noise ordinances that have been communicated and agreed upon with the community or the property owner. However, under most circumstances, it would be seen as an overreaction and potentially as harassment if done without any just cause.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pushing an old lady across a busy highway is clearly morally wrong. This action endangers the life of another person and shows a disregard for their safety and well-being. It violates fundamental moral principles of respect for human life and the duty to prevent harm to others."
