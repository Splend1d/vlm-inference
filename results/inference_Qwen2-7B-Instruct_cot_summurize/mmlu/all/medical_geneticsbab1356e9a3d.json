Since males have only one X chromosome ( derived from their mother, they can inherit the mutant allele directly from their affected mother and pass it on to all their daughters but not to their sons. This leads to \"male to male transmission\" when considering the pattern of inheritance within families. However, it's important to note that males cannot pass the condition to other males as they do not have a second X chromosome to transmit."
