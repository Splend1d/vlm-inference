In the long run, this situation leads to several outcomes:\n\nEconomic Profits Attract New Firms: The presence of positive economic profits will attract new firms into the market, as they see an opportunity to earn profits by entering the market. This influx of new firms increases competition.\n\nAs more firms enter the market, the supply of the product or service increases. With more suppliers, the market becomes more competitive, and the market price tends to fall towards the level of the minimum average total cost of production for the new firms entering the market.\n\nIn the long run, the entry of new firms continues until the market reaches a state where the price equals the minimum point of the average total cost curve. At this equilibrium, each firm earns only normal profit, which covers their opportunity costs but does not allow them to make any additional economic profit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the industry expands as firms enter the market."
