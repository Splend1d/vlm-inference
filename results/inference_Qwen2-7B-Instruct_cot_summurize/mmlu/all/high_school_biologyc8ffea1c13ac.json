All cells carry out cellular respiration in mitochondria.\n\nThis statement highlights a fundamental commonality among all known forms of life, as every organism, regardless of its complexity or type ( whether plant, animal, fungus, protist, archaeon, or bacterium, uses mitochondria for energy production through cellular respiration. This process is crucial for the survival and function of all living cells.\n\nOptions A and B also highlight shared features across different types of cells, but they do not necessarily reveal the fundamental unity of life since variations can exist within these characteristics. For example, while all cells are indeed surrounded by a plasma membrane, the composition and functions of this membrane can vary significantly between different types of cells. Similarly, while most eukaryotic cells contain at least one nucleus, some specialized cells may lack nuclei.\n\nOption D refers to the surface-to-volume ratio of cells, which can indeed be similar in many cell types due to biological constraints and efficiency considerations. However, this characteristic is more about optimization of cellular function rather than revealing a fundamental unity of all life. Cells with different shapes and sizes must manage their surface-to-volume ratios differently, and this adaptation is not necessarily indicative of a universal principle that underlies all life."
