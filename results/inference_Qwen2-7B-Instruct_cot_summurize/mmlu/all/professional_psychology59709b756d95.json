When squaring the correlation coefficient ( \\( r^2 \\), it becomes known as the coefficient of determination. This value indicates the proportion of the variance in one variable that can be explained by the other variable.\n\nIf the correlation between high school students' GPA and the amount of time they spend studying each week is 0.15, then \\( r^2 = 0.15^2 = 0.0225 \\). However, since the question asks for the percentage of variability in GPA accounted for by the amount of time spent studying, we multiply the coefficient of determination by 100 to convert it into a percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.0225 \\times 100 = 2.25\\% \\]\n\nThis doesn't match any of the options exactly, but it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation or the options provided. Given the context of the question and the typical understanding of correlation coefficients, option B ( 0.15 represents the direct correlation without squaring, which would imply an incorrect interpretation if squared, but correctly identifies the correlation coefficient value given in the question's format. \n\nHowever, if considering the precise interpretation asked in the question regarding the percentage of variability accounted for ( (which is essentially asking for \\( r^2 \\)), none of the options directly represent this calculation based on the provided answer choices. It appears there might be a misalignment between the question's intent and the provided options. \n\nGiven the standard interpretation and the options available, the closest and technically correct answer in terms of correlation coefficient is **B. 0.15**, acknowledging that the question might have intended to ask for the square of the correlation coefficient ( \\( r^2 \\) instead."
