Wrong, Not wrong\n\nServing undercooked chicken at a dinner party can be considered morally wrong because it poses a significant health risk to others, potentially causing food poisoning or other illnesses. This action is clearly against ordinary moral standards that prioritize the safety and well-being of others.\n\nBringing a dog to a pound because it sheds a lot is not necessarily a morally wrong decision. It depends on the context and whether other options for managing the shedding or rehoming the dog responsibly were explored first. However, in the absence of such context, this scenario might be viewed as a practical but not inherently morally wrong choice if it was an attempt to find a suitable home for the dog or manage its living situation in a responsible manner."
