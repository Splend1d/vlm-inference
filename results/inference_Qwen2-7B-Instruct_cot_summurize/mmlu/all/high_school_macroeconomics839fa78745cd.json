As a result:\n\nA. Consumers might seek substitutes for sugar or products that use sugar, as the price of sugar increases, making it relatively more expensive.\n\nD. Net exports in the United States may fall if the quota makes domestic sugar more expensive compared to international markets, potentially reducing exports. However, it's important to note that this effect can be nuanced depending on various factors like the elasticity of demand for sugar and the availability of alternative sources.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that options B and C do not accurately describe the typical effect of an import quota on sugar. Option B suggests an increase in consumption, which is unlikely given the higher prices resulting from the quota, and option C suggests an increase in the supply of sugar, which contradicts the purpose of imposing an import quota ( to limit the quantity of sugar entering the market."
