As we age, changes can occur in various areas of the brain, leading to declines in cognitive function, memory, and other mental abilities. These changes might include decreased neural efficiency, loss of neurons, and alterations in the structure and connectivity of neural pathways.\n\nWhile aging can affect different parts of the body, including the sense organs ( (A), muscles ( (C), and the peripheral nervous system ( (D), it's typically the brain where these effects are most prominently observed. However, it's important to note that these processes are interconnected and influence each other. For example, changes in the brain can impact motor skills and sensory perception, while changes in muscle fibers or the peripheral nervous system can affect cognitive function by impacting sensory input or motor output."
