It's not a contra-indication to colonoscopy; in fact, it's often recommended for patients with IBS to rule out other possible gastrointestinal disorders. And while some people may find that following a gluten-free diet helps manage their symptoms, it does not always resolve the condition. IBS is typically characterized by a range of symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, altered bowel habits, and changes in stool consistency, and the specific triggers or causes can vary from person to person."
