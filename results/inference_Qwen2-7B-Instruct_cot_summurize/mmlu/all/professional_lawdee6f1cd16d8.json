The city council has enacted an ordinance requiring illegal aliens to pay a $100 \"school fee\" for each child enrolled in a city public school. Citizens and legal aliens are not required to pay the school fee. The city council has enacted this law to raise funds to hire additional teachers who are bilingual. The city determined that over 15% of children attending public schools in the city were illegal aliens. Furthermore, the city conducted a study and found that the overwhelming majority of illegal aliens residing in the city did not pay any local property taxes. As a result, since the city provided educational benefits to the children of illegal aliens, the school fee furthered a significant governmental interest. The illegal alien, who is indigent, is unable to pay the city school fee. The city will not allow her children to attend school unless the fee is paid. If she seeks your legal advice regarding the constitutionality of the fee, you should advise her that the ordinance is\n\nA. valid, because the city can demonstrate that the school fee is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest.\nB. valid, because the imposition of the school fee is substantially related to a legitimate governmental interest.\nC. invalid, because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.\nD. invalid, because the cost of educating the children imposed an undue burden on the public school system by requiring the school board to hire additional bilingual teachers.\n"

                    "text": "C. invalid, because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires states and municipalities to provide equal protection to all persons within their jurisdiction, regardless of immigration status. This means that the government cannot deny educational services to children based solely on their parents' immigration status.\n\nIn this case, the city council's ordinance appears to impose an unfair and discriminatory burden on the children of illegal aliens by requiring them to pay a school fee while citizens and legal aliens are not subject to such a fee. The city's argument that the fee is necessary to raise funds to hire additional bilingual teachers does not justify the discriminatory treatment of the children of illegal aliens. Denying access to education based on parental immigration status is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.\n\nTherefore, the illegal alien would be advised that the ordinance is likely unconstitutional, and she should seek further legal assistance to challenge the ordinance on behalf of her children."
