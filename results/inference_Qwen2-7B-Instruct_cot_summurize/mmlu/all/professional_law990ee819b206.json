The brothers would inherit the uncle's estate when he died. The housekeeper agreed, but on the condition that they would pay her $10,000 from their inheritance. After the brothers agreed to her demand, the housekeeper decided to place some cyanide in the uncle's tea one morning. As the housekeeper was preparing the tea, the uncle was visited by his personal physician. When the housekeeper was ready to serve the tea, the uncle asked her to fix some tea for his physician also. The housekeeper did so and then carefully set the tea on the table so that the uncle's cup was facing him. However, when the physician reached over to get some sugar, he inadvertently took the uncle's cup with the cyanide and drank it. Seconds later, the physician died from the poison. Which of the following crimes are the brothers guilty of?\n\nA. Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle only.\nB. Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle and the physician.\nC. Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.\nD. Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.\n\nSolicitation is the act of encouraging or soliciting someone else to commit a crime. In this case, the brothers solicited the housekeeper to commit murder, which is punishable under the law.\n\nConspiracy involves two or more persons coming together with the intent to commit a crime. Here, the brothers and the housekeeper had an agreement to commit murder, making them both part of a conspiracy.\n\nMurder occurred when the physician accidentally drank the poisoned tea meant for the uncle. Although the brothers did not directly cause the death of the physician, they were involved in a criminal plan that led to his death, making them indirectly responsible for his murder as part of the broader conspiracy."
