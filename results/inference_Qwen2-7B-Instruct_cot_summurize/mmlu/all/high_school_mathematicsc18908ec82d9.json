Applying this condition to our equation, where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = 7 - b\\), we have:\n\n\\[\\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(7 - b) = 0\\]\n\\[16 - 4(7 - b) = 0\\]\n\\[16 - 28 + 4b = 0\\]\n\\[4b = 12\\]\n\\[b = 3\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(b\\) that ensures the parabola \\(y_1 = x^2 + 2x + 7\\) and the line \\(y_2 = 6x + b\\) intersect at only one point is \\(b = 3\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 3**."
