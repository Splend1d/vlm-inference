                    "text": "A. If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level.\n\nExplanation: This statement is true because if you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at a 10% significance level, that means the p-value is less than 0.10. Since the 5% level is stricter (0.05), if your p-value is less than 0.10, it will also be less than 0.05, allowing you to reject the null hypothesis at both levels.\n\nB. Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\n\nExplanation: This statement is false. The choice between a one-sided and two-sided test should be determined before the data are collected based on the research question and hypothesis. A one-sided test is used when the direction of the effect is known in advance, while a two-sided test is used when the direction is not specified.\n\nC. If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nExplanation: This statement is partially correct but misleading. It's more accurate to say that if the null hypothesis is true, there is a 1% chance of incorrectly rejecting it ( (the type I error rate). However, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis depends on various factors such as sample size, effect size, and variability.\n\nD. The power of a test concern its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\n\nExplanation: This statement is true. The power of a statistical test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. In other words, it measures the test's ability to detect an effect if there is one."
