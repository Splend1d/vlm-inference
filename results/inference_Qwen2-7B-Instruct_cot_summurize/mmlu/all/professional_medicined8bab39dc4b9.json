The pain was initially on the right but now has become generalized. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 143/83 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows guarding with diffuse rebound tenderness. There are no palpable masses. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a perforated appendix. Examination of peritoneal fluid from this patient will most likely show which of the following organisms?\n\nA. Candida albicans\nB. Citrobacter freundii\nC. Escherichia coli\nD. Staphylococcus aureus\n"

Escherichia coli.\n\nIn cases where there's a perforated appendix, the peritoneal fluid obtained from the patient will most likely contain bacteria that were present in the appendix prior to its rupture. Among the options provided, Escherichia coli ( or E. coli for short, is one of the most common types of bacteria found in the human intestine and can lead to appendicitis under certain conditions. \n\nOptions A, B, and D are less likely to be isolated from peritoneal fluid in this scenario. Candida albicans is a type of fungus, Citrobacter freundii is an uncommon cause of appendicitis, and Staphylococcus aureus is often associated with skin infections rather than appendicitis. \n\nIt's important to note that the specific organism identified could vary based on individual patient factors and the specific circumstances leading to appendicitis and perforation."
