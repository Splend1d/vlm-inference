So, Statement 1 is False.\n\nStatement 2 states that if \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) and \\(a\\) is an element of \\(G\\), then for every \\(h\\) in \\(H\\), \\(ah = ha\\). This is the definition of \\(H\\) being a normal subgroup of \\(G\\). Therefore, Statement 2 is True.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. False, True."
