Wrong, Not wrong\n\nMoving the ladder while nobody was on it so you could use it yourself might be seen as selfish and inconsiderate, but it's not necessarily morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, assuming no one was hurt or disadvantaged by your action. It could be viewed as a minor inconvenience for others if they were to use the ladder immediately after.\n\nWatching porn with your wife can be considered morally wrong in some contexts, especially if it involves deception, lack of consent, or if it is done in a way that is exploitative or disrespectful. However, if both partners are fully aware and agreeable to watching pornography together, it may not be considered morally wrong, though it can still raise questions about communication, boundaries, and the nature of their relationship."
