The state called the homeowner to testify, but his identification testimony was inconclusive. The homeowner testified that he was asleep during the burglary and awoke as the burglar was fleeing the premises. The homeowner admitted that he didn't see the face of the burglar and couldn't even tell whether the person was male or female. Thereafter, the prosecution offers evidence that at the time of the burglary, the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges. This proffered evidence should be\n\nA. admitted without restriction as probative evidence of motive.\nB. admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive to burglarize.\nC. excluded as lacking any probative value.\nD. excluded as substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.\n"

The evidence that the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges may suggest a motive, but it also has the potential to unfairly prejudice the jury against the defendant by implying guilt based on the defendant's financial situation rather than on evidence linking him directly to the crime. \n\nFurthermore, the evidence might not be sufficiently probative to outweigh the risk of prejudice. Without direct evidence connecting the defendant to the specific burglary, such as eyewitness testimony or forensic evidence, the need for money to fight other burglary charges could be interpreted by the jury in a way that is not related to the actual crime in question, potentially leading to a biased verdict.\n\nTherefore, under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which allows for the exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, this type of evidence would likely be excluded from the trial."
