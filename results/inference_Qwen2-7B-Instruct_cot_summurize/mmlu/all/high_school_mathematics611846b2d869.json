Let's correct the final step:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{4 - x}{5}\\]\n\nSo, the correct inverse function is actually:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{4 - x}{5}\\]\n\nGiven the options, this corresponds to option C after correcting the presentation: it should be interpreted as:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{4 - x}{5}\\]\n\nHowever, based on the initial setup and the correct algebraic manipulation, the intended answer that aligns's with the process described should be presented as:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{4 - x}{5}\\]\n\nThus, the correct choice among the provided options, considering the corrected understanding, would indeed be represented as option C in the context of matching the derived formula, albeit with an important clarification on the proper interpretation or presentation of the final answer."
