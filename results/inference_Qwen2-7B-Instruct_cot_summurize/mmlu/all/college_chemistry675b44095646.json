It is influenced by the charges of the ions and their distances from each other.\n\nThe formula for lattice enthalpy (\u0394H_lattice can be simplified as:\n\n\\[ \\Delta H_{\\text{lattice}} = Z \\cdot F \\cdot (\\Delta E_{\\text{ion}}) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(Z\\) is the charge on the ion,\n- \\(F\\) is the ionization energy (or first ionization energy for monoatomic ions, and\n- \\(\\Delta E_{\\text{ion}}\\) is the difference in the electron affinity or second ionization energy between the cation and anion.\n\nHowever, in this context, since we're comparing different compounds, and assuming similar ion sizes, the key factor is the magnitude of the charges on the ions.\n\n1. **MgO** and **MgS** both have Mg^2+ ions.\n2. **NaF** and **NaCl** both have Na^+ ions.\n3. The anions are F^- and Cl^- respectively, with Cl^- having a larger charge magnitude than F^-.\n\nGiven that the cation charge is more significant in determining lattice enthalpy than the anion charge ( and considering the charges involved:\n\n- **MgO** has the highest cation charge (2+.\n- **NaCl** has the lowest cation charge (+1).\n\nTherefore, **MgO** will have the greatest lattice enthalpy among the given options due to its higher cation charge."
