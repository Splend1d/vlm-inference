The contract contained a provision wherein the restaurant promised to purchase \"a minimum of 100 loaves per month at $1 per loaf. \" On a separate sheet, there was a note stating that any modifications must be in writing. The parties signed each sheet. Both sides performed fully under the contract for the first four months. On May 1, the president of the bakery telephoned the manager of the restaurant and told him that, because of an increase in the cost of wheat, the bakery would be forced to raise its prices to $1. 20 per loaf. The manager said he understood and agreed to the price increase. The bakery then shipped 100 loaves (the amount ordered by the restaurant) to the restaurant, along with a bill for $120. The restaurant sent the bakery a check for$100 and refused to pay any more. Is the restaurant obligated to pay the additional $20?\n\nA. Yes, because the May 1 modification was enforceable even though it was not supported by new consideration.\nB. Yes, because the bakery detrimentally relied on the modification by making the May shipment to the restaurant.\nC. No, because there was no consideration to support the modification.\nD. No, because the modifying contract was not in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. No, because the modifying contract was not in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.\n\nThe Uniform Commercial Code ( (UCC) Section 2-209(2) states that \"an agreement modifying a contract for the sale of goods requires a written document if the original contract required one.\" In this case, the original contract required a written document for any modifications ( as stated on the separate sheet. Thus, when the bakery increased the price from $1 to $1.20 per loaf without a written agreement, the modification became unenforceable under the UCC's requirement for written modifications to sales contracts.\n\nThe other options do not accurately reflect the legal principles at play here:\n\nA. Even if the modification might have been enforceable under certain doctrines such as promissory estoppel ( which deals with situations where one party has relied on a promise to their detriment, there is no mention of the bakery having any specific reliance or change in position in the given scenario. Moreover, the lack of a written agreement means that the modification is not enforceable regardless of whether it was supported by new consideration.\n\nB. Detrimental reliance occurs when a party relies on a promise to their detriment, but again, since the modification was not made in writing and thus not enforceable under the UCC, the bakery cannot claim detrimental reliance to enforce the modification.\n\nC. The lack of consideration does not directly address the issue of whether a modification is enforceable under the UCC. The key point here is the failure to adhere to the written modification requirement, not the existence or absence of consideration."
