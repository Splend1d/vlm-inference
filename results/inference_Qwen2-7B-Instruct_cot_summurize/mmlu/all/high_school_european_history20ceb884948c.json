At any time the French capital affords rare advantages to the anthropologist. The Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, the anthropometric operations of Bertillon in the Palais de Justice, the courses of lectures in the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, the collections in the Jardin de Plantes, the facilities for original work in the \u00e9coles de Medicine, and the hospitals give to the comparative anatomist and biologist abundant employment.\"\nOtis T. Mason, American ethnologist and curator, 1889\nIt can be inferred from the text that at the time of the Paris Exposition, the scientific community was changing due to\n\nA. the inclusion of women\nB. an increase in funding from officials in the French capital\nC. the development of universal public education in many European countries\nD. the development of new, specialized fields\n"

However, it does suggest that the opportunities for studying anthropology were unparalleled because of various resources available in Paris, such as museums, laboratories, and educational institutions.\n\nGiven this context, the most plausible inference about the reason for the change in the scientific community during that time would be:\n\nD. the development of new, specialized fields\n\nThe text highlights the establishment of new fields like anthropology, which was gaining momentum and providing unique opportunities for research and education. The advancements in these specialized fields contributed to the overall evolution of scientific thought and practice."
