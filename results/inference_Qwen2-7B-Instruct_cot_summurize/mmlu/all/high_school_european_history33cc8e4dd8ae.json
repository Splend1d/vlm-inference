These concessions allowed British traders greater freedom to operate within China, establishing areas where British influence was dominant, hence creating spheres of influence. \n\nOptions A ( colonies, C protectorates, and D businesses are not accurate in describing the direct outcomes of the Treaty of Nanjing. Colonies status would imply full annexation of territory, which is not what happened; protectorate suggests a country under the protection of another but still maintains sovereignty, which is also not the case here; and while the treaty did facilitate business activities, it did not establish new businesses but rather expanded existing commercial rights."
