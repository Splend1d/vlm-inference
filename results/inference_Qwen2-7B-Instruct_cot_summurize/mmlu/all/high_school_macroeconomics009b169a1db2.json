This statement is incorrect because, under the fractional-reserve banking system, banks are not required to hold all deposits as reserves and can lend out a portion, so the money supply is not directly backed by gold reserves.\n- B. This statement is incorrect because M2 is less liquid than M1; it includes items like savings deposits, small time deposits, and money market mutual funds, which are generally more liquid than checking accounts.\n- C. This statement cannot be assumed without specific data at any given point in time, as the size of M1 and M3 can fluctuate based on economic conditions and financial activities.\n- D. This statement is correct. M1 consists of the most liquid forms of money, including currency in circulation, demand deposits (checking accounts, and other checkable deposits. It represents the money that is readily available for spending or withdrawal.\n\nTherefore, the accurate statement regarding the money supply in the United States is that the most liquid measure of money is M1."
