Barbara neglected to record the deed, and three years later, Alice conveyed the same property to Charlene who immediately filed the deed she received from Alice. Greyacre's jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system. If an action is filed for title to the property, the likely outcome would be for\n\nA.

Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.\n\nIn jurisdictions with a race-notice statute, the person who acquires property through a good faith purchase and records the deed first ( provided they did not have actual or constructive notice of any earlier unrecorded interests in the property - will be recognized as the owner. The recording serves as public notice of the claim to the property, which protects subsequent purchasers from claims by prior interests if they were unaware of them and acted in good faith.\n\nThe fact that Barbara occupied the property does not affect the outcome, as in property law, possession does not necessarily imply ownership. Furthermore, the neglect to record the deed by Barbara means her interest in the property is subordinate to any other validly recorded interest. Therefore, despite Barbara being the first occupant, and thus potentially having a continuous presence on the property, the legal title passed to Charlene when her deed was recorded, making Charlene the rightful owner according to the rules described."
