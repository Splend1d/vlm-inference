May be helpful in diverticular disease: True, fiber supplements can help manage symptoms of diverticular disease by promoting regular bowel movements and reducing the risk of constipation.\n\nB. Are always easily fermented by colonic bacteria: False, not all fiber supplements are easily fermented by colonic bacteria. Fiber types like insoluble fiber do not get digested or absorbed in the small intestine and pass through to the colon largely intact where they can promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Soluble fibers, on the other hand, are partially fermented in the colon.\n\nC. Are usually derived from soluble fibre sources: False, fiber supplements can come from both soluble and insoluble sources. Soluble fiber supplements include items like psyllium husk, oat bran, and pectin. Insoluble fiber supplements typically include wheat bran, cellulose, and lignin.\n\nD. Should be avoided in constipation: False, in fact, fiber supplements can be very helpful for managing constipation. They add bulk to the stool, making it easier to pass, and also help retain water in the stool, making it softer. However, it's important to increase fluid intake when increasing fiber intake to avoid potential issues with hardening of the stool.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers is none of the options provided as a whole. Each statement contains an element of truth but also an element that needs correction or clarification."
