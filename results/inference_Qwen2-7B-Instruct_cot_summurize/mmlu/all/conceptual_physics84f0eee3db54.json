This phenomenon is observed with both sound waves and light waves.\n\nFor sound waves, interference can result in constructive interference ( where the waves reinforce each other, leading to louder sounds at certain points, and destructive interference, where the waves cancel each other out, potentially leading to quieter or silent regions.\n\nSimilarly, with light waves, which are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, interference can also be constructive or destructive. Constructive interference results in an increase in the intensity of the light, while destructive interference can lead to dark fringes on an interference pattern.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Both of these."
