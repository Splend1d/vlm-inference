Participants are selected for inclusion in the study because of their extremely high or low scores on the pretest.\n\nStatistical regression refers to the phenomenon where, over time, extreme scores tend to move towards the average. In the context of a study, if participants are selected for inclusion based on their extremely high or low scores on a pretest, this can introduce bias. Those with unusually high or low scores might naturally regress towards the mean over time, which could skew results and make it seem like the intervention had an effect when, in fact, any observed changes were simply due to statistical regression rather than the treatment itself. This can threaten the internal validity of the study, as it may not accurately reflect the true effect of the treatment."
