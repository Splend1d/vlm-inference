He immediately sent a purchase order which stated \"our law firm accepts your $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF.\"\u009d Costco then sent Rainmaking an order confirmation which stated \"Envelope order acceptance conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes.\" If the parties disagree on the proper contract relationship, a court would likely rule:\n\nA. A contract at $1,000 because the offer terms CIF means cost, insurance and freight including all loading charges.\nB. A contract at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included.\nC. No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.\nD. No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.\n\nIn contract law, when one party sends an offer (in this case, the purchase order, it must receive an acceptance without any modifications or changes to the original terms in order for a binding contract to be formed. The order confirmation from Costco essentially proposed a new term, the inclusion of a loading charge, which was not agreed upon by Rainmaking Lawfirm.\n\nOption A incorrectly assumes that the CIF price includes loading charges, which is not necessarily true based on the information provided. CIF typically refers to the price paid by the buyer plus the costs of shipping and insurance to bring goods to a specified location, but does not always include additional charges such as loading fees.\n\nOption B suggests a contract at $1,500, implying that the loading charges should be added to the original offer price. However, since there was no agreement on these additional charges, a contract cannot be formed at this adjusted price.\n\nOption D refers to the mirror image rule, which states that for a contract to be formed, the acceptance must mirror the original offer exactly, including all terms. Since the order confirmation from Costco introduced new terms, this rule is not satisfied and would suggest no contract, similar to option C.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most accurate choice, indicating that no contract exists because Costco's order confirmation was a counteroffer that was not accepted by Rainmaking Lawfirm."
