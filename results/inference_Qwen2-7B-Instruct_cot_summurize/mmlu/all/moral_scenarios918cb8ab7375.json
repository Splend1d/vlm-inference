Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nScenario 1: In this scenario, the main character informs the hospital that their son is seriously ill with the intention of getting immediate medical attention. This action can be seen as morally justified under the context of seeking urgent medical care for a family member, as it prioritizes the health and well-being of their child. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action would not be considered wrong.\n\nScenario 2: The main character takes a child to the mall but subsequently forgets where the child is located. This scenario involves neglect or irresponsibility, which are can be viewed as morally wrong. The failure to keep track of a child in a public place could result in distress or harm to the child, which goes against the ethical responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of others, especially vulnerable individuals like children. Therefore, this action would be considered morally wrong under the ordinary standards of the US in 2020."
