A process of securitization is when an issue not included in the political sphere becomes politicized and is managed within the political system. A securitized issue is part of public policy requiring governmental action; decision-making, resource allocation and even communal governance.\nB. A securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitised when it is outside of the political domain. An existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even when it is not included within public debate. Securitization refers to the recognition of the threat prior to its emergence in the political process.\nC. Securitization refers to the move of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once placed above the political sphere it cannot be returned to the public sphere, having been translated into a state interest above normal proceedings.\nD. An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.\n"

                    "text": "The process of securitization involves several key steps and elements:\n\n1. **Identification of the Issue**: The first step involves identifying an issue that is not currently considered a part of the political agenda but which the securitizing actor believes warrants urgent attention. This could be due to perceived threats or crises.\n\n2. **Presentation of the Issue as an Exceptional Threat**: The securitizing actor then frames the issue as an existential threat to the referent object ( (the entity whose security is being claimeded to be threatened). This requires invoking the principle of 'emergency', which allows the issue to transcend normal political processes.\n\n3. **Establishing Legitimacy**: The securitizing actor must gain the support of a key political authority ( often a leader or a government body. This legitimacy is crucial to bypass normal political procedures and to enact extraordinary measures.\n\n4. **Discursive Construction**: Using rhetoric and language, the securitizing actor constructs the issue as an urgent and exceptional problem that requires immediate and special attention. This involves creating a narrative around the issue that emphasizes its severity and the need for exceptional measures.\n\n5. **Decoupling from Routine Politics**: Once the issue has been successfully securitized, it moves out of the regular political arena and becomes part of a 'politics of exception'. This means that the issue is no longer subject to routine political processes and can receive priority resources and attention.\n\n6. **Implementation of Exceptional Measures**: The securitized issue is then addressed through policies actions that may include new laws, regulations, or other measures that were not part of the regular legislative process. These measures are often characterized by their intensity and speed.\n\n7. **Maintenance and Normalization**: After the issue has been addressed, the securitized status might become normalized, and the issue is integrated back into the political agenda as a regular concern. However, the process of securitization can be cyclical, with issues potentially being re-securitized in the future.\n\n8. **Reversibility**: In theory, the securitization process can be reversed, although this is rarely done without significant political controversy and resistance. Once an issue has been securitized, it often becomes entrenched within the political system, making de-securitization a challenging task.\n\nUnderstanding these steps helps clarify how an issue can transition from being considered non-political to being treated as a matter of utmost urgency and importance by the state, often involving extraordinary measures that depart from standard democratic processes."
