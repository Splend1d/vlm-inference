After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. She has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F). Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm3 , a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Bacterial meningitis\nB. Dextromethorphan intoxication\nC. Herpes simplex encephalitis\nD. HIV encephalopathy\n"

Herpes simplex encephalitis\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n- The patient's symptoms (fever, headache, confusion, short-term memory deficits, and difficulty naming objects with literal paraphasic errors are consistent with herpes simplex encephalitis.\n- The MRI showing bitemporal hyperintensities is characteristic of herpes simplex encephalitis.\n- The cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals an elevated number of monocytes ( typically indicative of a viral infection, which aligns with herpes simplex encephalitis. The presence of more monocytes than neutrophils is also typical of viral meningitis compared to bacterial meningitis where neutrophils predominate.\n- While other options could theoretically present with similar symptoms or findings, the combination of temporal lobe signs on MRI, monocyte predominance in CSF, and the patient's history of recent illness points strongly towards herpes simplex encephalitis.\n\nIt's important to note that without a full clinical picture, definitive diagnosis often relies on specific patterns of symptoms, imaging findings, and laboratory tests, particularly in infectious diseases like these. Treatment for herpes simplex encephalitis typically involves antiviral therapy, and prompt recognition is crucial for effective management."
