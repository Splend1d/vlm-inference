The purpose of these rules is to assist the agency in attaining the clean water standards required by the statute. After the agency issued such rules, several states filed an action challenging the rules on the sole ground that they are unconstitutional. Should the court uphold the constitutionality of the agency's rules?\n\nA. No, because the federal government may not compel a state legislature to enact into state law a federally mandated regulatory program.\nB. No, because the Tenth Amendment grants states immunity from all direct federal states immunity from all direct federal regulation.\nC. Yes, because the rules serve an important purpose, and the requirements they impose on the states are only temporary and do not excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments.\nD. Yes, because the supremacy clause of Article VI requires states to enforce federal law.\n"

Yes, because the rules serve an important purpose, and the requirements they impose on the states are only temporary and do not excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments.\n\nUnder the Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, which includes matters affecting the environment, such as water pollution. Federal agencies have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations under the guidance of Congress to achieve environmental objectives. In this case, if the federal statute authorizing the agency to issue rules is constitutional, then the agency's rules aimed at reducing water pollution from gasoline-powered boat motors could also be upheld as long as they serve a legitimate purpose and do not excessively interfere with state governments.\n\nThe supremacy clause (D mentioned in the options does indeed come into play, establishing that federal law takes precedence over state law when there is a conflict. However, it does not automatically imply that the state cannot be compelled to enact state laws; rather, it means that any state laws that conflict with federal law must be adjusted or replaced to comply with federal requirements. The Tenth Amendment (B mentioned in the options pertains to the powers reserved to the states, but it does not provide an absolute immunity for states from federal regulation."
