While the party was in progress, a few teenagers from the neighborhood vandalized some of the cars parked outside the house. They broke the headlights and stole the battery from the boyfriend's car. When the party ended, the boyfriend and his girlfriend left the house and got into his car. The boyfriend, who was about to drive his girlfriend home, was unaware of what had happened. He tried to start the car, but it wouldn't turn on. Two police officers, who were parked outside the house, watched the boyfriend as he tried to start the car. They then approached the boyfriend and charged him with attempting to violate a local ordinance making it a misdemeanor to drive at night without headlights. The boyfriend's best defense to the charge is\n\nA. factual impossibility.\nB. mistake of fact.\nC. entrapment.\nD. no requisite intent.\n"

This means that he honestly believed that he did not violate the law because he was unaware of the broken headlights on his car. The defense argues that he lacked the necessary intent to commit the crime since he genuinely believed he was in compliance with the law. If the court accepts this defense, the boyfriend may be acquitted or have the charges reduced."
