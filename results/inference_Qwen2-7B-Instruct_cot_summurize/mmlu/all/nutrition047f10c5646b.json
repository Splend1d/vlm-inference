Broccoli. \n\nBroccoli is a nutrient-dense vegetable that provides a wide range of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin K, fiber, and potassium, among others. It is also low in calories, making it an excellent choice for those looking to maintain or lose weight.\n\nApples (A are also nutritious and provide fiber, vitamin C, and other antioxidants, but they generally have more calories than broccoli.\n\nSlice of bread B has fewer calories per gram than broccoli, but it is typically lower in nutrients compared to vegetables like broccoli. Bread can be high in refined carbohydrates, which may not provide lasting energy or contribute significantly to overall health.\n\nCheeseburger C, on the other hand, is relatively high in calories and fat, with fewer nutrients per calorie compared to broccoli. It often contains processed meats and cheese, which can be less healthy choices in terms of overall nutrition."
