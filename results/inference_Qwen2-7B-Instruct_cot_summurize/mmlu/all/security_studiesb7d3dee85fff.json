Non-state actors, including private military companies, arms dealers, and sometimes even criminal organizations, play significant roles in the global defence trade. This trade encompasses not only weapons but also military equipment, technology, services, and intelligence sharing. While state-to-state transactions are common and often regulated by international laws and agreements, the involvement of non-state actors can complicate matters due to potential lack of oversight, ethical concerns, and the risk of misuse of military items.\n\nA. This statement is partially correct but does not fully capture the complexity of the defence trade. It correctly identifies that the trade involves legitimate business interactions between states, but it overlooks the role of non-state actors and the broader scope of goods and services exchanged.\n\nB. This statement is incorrect because while military organizations are indeed major players in the defence trade, they are not the sole actors. Non-state entities also significantly influence this market.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect because the defence trade does not exclusively refer to the illegal trade of weapons and small arms outside of legal interactions between states. It includes both legal and illegal activities, and the trade encompasses a wide range of military items and services."
