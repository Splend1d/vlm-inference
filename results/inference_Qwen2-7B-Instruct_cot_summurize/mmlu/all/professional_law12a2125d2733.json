Before receiving an answer, the purchasing agent called the wholesaler to state, \"We are confronting a critical financial crisis and cannot afford to make the purchase.\" The seller sent an acceptance form the next day, and shipped the goods with an invoice. When the purchasing company did not pay and shipped the goods back, the seller sued for his lost profit. The seller claimed that the purchasing agent's words did not clearly communicate a revocation of the offer. Will the seller prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because a revocation of an offer requires explicit words of rejection in order to be enforced.\nB. Yes, because the seller must be able to rely on a definite order of goods.\nC. No, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\nD. No, because a buyer is never in breach of an agreement when it rejects goods prior to their shipment.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would be:\n\nB. Yes, because the seller must be able to rely on a definite order of goods.\n\nIn contract law, an offer can generally be revoked by the offeror (the person making the offer, before acceptance has occurred. However, once the offeree (the person receiving the offer) has relied on the offer to their detriment, the revocation may be deemed ineffective. In this scenario, the purchasing agent's statement to the seller about facing a financial crisis and not being able to afford the purchase could potentially be seen as a revocation of the original offer. However, the question of whether this statement constituted a clear and effective revocation would depend on various factors, including the context, tone, and specific language used by the purchasing agent.\n\nFor the seller to prevail in a lawsuit for lost profit, they would need to demonstrate that they reasonably relied on the purchasing agent's statement as a revocation of the offer, which would then allow them to ship the goods under the assumption that the offer had been revoked. If the court finds that the seller had a reasonable basis to believe that the offer had been revoked, they might be able to argue that they have a claim for damages based on their reliance on that belief.\n\nTherefore, without more information about the specifics of the conversation and any subsequent actions or communications between the parties, it's challenging to definitively state which option is correct. However, given the general principles of contract law, option B aligns with the idea that the seller needs assurance that the terms of the offer are set and cannot be changed after the offeree has relied on those terms."
