                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to find the mean setting for the soft drink dispenser so that the cup overflows less than 1% of the time. This implies that we're looking at the scenario where more than 99% of the time, the amount dispensed is less than or equal to 12 ounces. \n\nIn terms of probability distributions, this corresponds to finding the z-score ( \\(z\\) such that the area under the standard normal curve to the left of \\(z\\) is 0.99 ( because we want 99% of the data to fall below our target value, which means only 1% falls above it.\n\nThe z-score corresponding to an area of 0.99 under the standard normal curve is approximately 2.326 ( (This value comes from the standard normal distribution table or using statistical software).\n\nThe formula to adjust the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) based on the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) and desired z-score (\\(z\\)) for a given value (\\(X\\)) is:\n\n\\[ X = \\mu + z\\sigma \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(X = 12\\) ounces ( (the target value)\n- \\(\\sigma = 0.3\\) ounce ( (the standard deviation)\n- \\(z = 2.326\\) ( (from the previous step)\n\nWe rearrange the formula to solve for \\(\\mu\\):\n\n\\[ \\mu = X - z\\sigma \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\mu = 12 - 2.326 \\times 0.3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu = 12 - 0.6968 \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu \\approx 11.3032 \\]\n\nTherefore, the mean setting should be around 11.3032 ounces to ensure that a 12-ounce cup will overflow less than 1% of the time. However, none of the options provided directly matches this calculation. The closest option to achieving this setup indirectly involves understanding the concept but is presented differently. The correct interpretation aligning with the process involves recognizing that the calculation suggests a mean slightly below 12 ounces, adjusting for the standard deviation and z-score. Given the options, the correct answer choice should conceptually guide towards adjusting the mean to account for the excess over 12 ounces, which indirectly align with the concept of ensuring less than 1% overflow. \n\nThe precise calculation does not directly match any of the provided options due to rounding and interpretation differences, but conceptually, option B might seem to suggest subtracting a value related to the standard deviation from 12, aligning loosely with the idea of adjusting the mean to avoid overfilling. The correct approach to solving the question as posed would involve understanding the concept of z-scores in relation to standard deviations and areas under the normal distribution curve, rather than directly selecting an option based on the calculation without the context provided by the options. \n\nHowever, if we were to select based on the conceptual understanding and the closest fit among the given options, option B: \"12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces\" seems to align most closely with the process described, though it's important to note that the precise calculation did not yield exactly one of these choices due to differences in how the options are structured versus how the problem was solved mathematically."
