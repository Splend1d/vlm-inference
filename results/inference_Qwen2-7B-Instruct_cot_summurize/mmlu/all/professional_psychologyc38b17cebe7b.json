Describe development as a process of growth (gain) and decline (loss)\n\nBaltes's Selective Optimization with Compensation (SOC) theory focuses on how individuals adapt to life's challenges throughout their lifespan. The theory suggests that development is not merely about gaining or losing capabilities but involves a dynamic interplay between optimization (finding ways to achieve goals despite limitations, and compensation, adapting to changes in one's abilities.\n\nHowever, it would be incorrect to say that this theory does not account for environmental influences on development. Baltes's SOC theory actually highlights the importance of environmental factors, suggesting that individuals optimize their functioning within the context of their social environment and adjust their strategies based on the resources and constraints they encounter. This includes both positive and negative environmental influences.\n\nSo, option A is incorrect because Baltes's theory does consider the development of skills and mental states, not just psychopathology. Option C is also incorrect because Baltes's theory does indeed account for environmental influences on development. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
