(which was within the posted speed limit), the passenger suddenly pointed to an overturned vehicle along the side of the highway and said, \"Look at that car upside down. \" The driver turned to look at the overturned vehicle. As he was looking toward the side of the road, the driver failed to see an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire in the highway about 200 feet in front of his approaching auto. Seconds later, the driver crashed into the rear of the abandoned auto and was injured. The jurisdiction has a relevant comparative negligence statute in effect. If the driver asserts a claim against the owner of the abandoned auto, the most likely result is that the driver will\n\nA. recover all of his damages, because the defendant created a dangerous condition.\nB. recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was in plain view.\nC. recover nothing, because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.\nD. recover nothing, because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.\n"

Here, the driver's failure to maintain adequate lookout and observe the abandoned vehicle in the road contributed significantly to the accident. The fact that the driver was distracted by the overturned vehicle on the side of the road does not absolve him of responsibility for not paying attention to the road ahead. The driver had the last clear opportunity to avoid the collision by braking or swerving before impact, which he did not do.\n\nThe owner of the abandoned vehicle, while negligent for leaving the vehicle unattended and in the middle of the road, may also be found to have some level of fault if it can be determined that there were signs or conditions that should have prompted them to remove the vehicle from the road more promptly or to secure it properly.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the court would likely find that the driver's actions were a substantial contributing factor to the accident, thus precluding recovery of damages. Comparative negligence statutes typically reduce the recovery amount based on the percentage of fault attributed to each party involved in the incident. In this case, since the driver had the last clear opportunity to avoid the collision, it is likely that the court would find the driver to be more at fault than the owner of the abandoned vehicle, resulting in no recovery for the driver."
