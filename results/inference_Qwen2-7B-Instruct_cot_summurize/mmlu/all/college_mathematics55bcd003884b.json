Then \\(f'(x)\\) must exist and equal 0?\"\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The statement assumes that the derivative of \\(f\\) exists at the point where it reaches a local maximum. However, this is only guaranteed if \\(f\\) is differentiable at that point. A counterexample would be a function with a sharp corner or a cusp at the point of the local maximum. At such points, the derivative does not exist, even though there is a local maximum. For instance, consider the function \\(f(x) = |x|\\) on any interval containing \\(x=0\\). At \\(x=0\\), \\(f(x)\\) has a local (and in fact global) maximum, but \\(f'(0)\\) does not exist because the left-hand derivative and the right-hand derivative are not equal (they are both undefined).\n\n**Statement 2:** \"There exist non-constant continuous maps from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)?\"\n\nThis statement is **True**. While it might seem counterintuitive given that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and contains no \"gaps\" like \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) does, it's possible to construct a non-constant continuous function from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). One way to do this is by considering a function that maps rationals to themselves and irrationals to some fixed rational number. For example, we could define a function \\(g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that for any \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\), \\(g(x) = x\\), and for any \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R} - \\mathbb{Q}\\), \\(g(x) = 0\\) ( (or any other fixed rational number). This function is continuous everywhere except possibly at points where the rationals and irrationals intersect, which is nowhere since these sets have no points in common. Thus, \\(g\\) is continuous on its entire domain, making the statement true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. True, False**. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the options provided as they do not align correctly with the analysis. Based on the corrected understanding:\n\n- Statement 1 is actually **False**, as explained.\n- Statement 2 is indeed **True**.\n\nGiven the standard format of multiple-choice questions, there might have been an expectation for an answer choice that reflects both statements being false, which is not aligned with the analysis. In a perfect scenario, the question would either ask about each statement independently or provide options that accurately reflect the truth value of each statement based on the analysis."
