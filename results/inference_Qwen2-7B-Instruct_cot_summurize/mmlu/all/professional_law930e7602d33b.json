The defendant admitted that she told the victim she could save him if he brought a large sum of money wrapped in a handkerchief to a ritual. After the ritual, the defendant returned the handkerchief to the victim filled with waste paper rather than the money. After the defendant was convicted of false pretenses, she moved for a new trial and offered the affidavits of several jurors who sat on the case. An affidavit containing which of the following facts will most likely furnish the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial?\n\nA. A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.\nB. A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.\nC. Ajuror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument.\nD. A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.\n"

A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.\n\nThis option provides the strongest basis for a new trial because it involves a potential bias of one of the jurors. If a juror has a personal animosity toward the defendant, this could influence their decision-making process in a way that is not aligned with the facts or the law. This kind of bias can compromise the fairness of the trial, as the juror might be more inclined to convict the defendant due to their pre-existing feelings rather than the evidence presented in court. In such a case, the defendant's right to a fair and impartial jury is violated, which is a strong ground for seeking a new trial."
