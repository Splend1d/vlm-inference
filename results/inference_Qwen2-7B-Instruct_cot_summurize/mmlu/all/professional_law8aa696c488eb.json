An undercover police officer knocked on the woman's door and told her that he was willing to pay for usable credit cards. When the woman asked if he was a police officer, the officer replied, \"No,\" giving her a false name and saying, \"You can call Harvey \u0080\u0094he'll vouch for me.\" The woman admitted him to her house. After she left the room to call Harvey, the officer lifted some papers off a desk and underneath discovered three credit cards bearing different names. He seized the cards, and when the woman returned, he arrested her. The woman has moved to suppress the evidence seized on the ground that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\n\nA. No, because it was immediately apparent that the cards were stolen.\nB. No, because the woman assumed the risk that the officer would seize items in plain sight.\nC. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer lifted the papers.\nD. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n"

Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n\nThe situation described involves the use of deceit or misrepresentation by the undercover police officer to gain entry into the woman's residence. This tactic, known as tricking or decoying, undermines the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The officer's false claim of identity and his fabricated reference to another individual (Harvey, as a guarantor of his authenticity, was a deceptive method designed to bypass the usual safeguards and consensually based entry procedures.\n\nUnder the law, such deception by law enforcement officers to enter a private residence without a warrant or probable cause can be considered a violation of the Fourth Amendment, even if the officer later discovers evidence that appears to be in plain view. This is because the deceptive entry itself constitutes an illegal search under the Constitution.\n\nThe fact that the cards were stolen does not automatically justify the officer's actions. The legality of the search depends on whether the officer had a valid basis for entering the premises without deception. Since the officer's entry was based on deceit, any evidence subsequently found during that entry cannot be used as grounds for prosecution without a separate lawful search or seizure following the truth of the matter being revealed.\n\nTherefore, the court should grant the motion to suppress the evidence seized, as the means by which the officer entered the woman's home violated her constitutional rights."
