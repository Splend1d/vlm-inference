Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. Which of the following statements is correct about the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests?\n\nA. The correlation coefficient is -0.71.\nB. The correlation coefficient is 0.71.\nC. The correlation coefficient is -0.84.\nD. The correlation coefficient is 0.84.\n"

It ranges from -1 to +1. A positive value indicates a positive relationship (meaning that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase too. A negative value indicates a negative relationship, where an increase in one variable corresponds to a decrease in the other. \n\nIn this case, since the number of calls increases with the abundance of nests, we're looking at a positive relationship. The percentage of variation explained (71% in this context, relates to the coefficient of determination (R^2, not the correlation coefficient itself. The correlation coefficient (r, which is the square root of R^2 but taking into account the sign of the relationship, would be the square root of 0.71. However, without knowing whether the relationship is positive or negative (and given that increasing calls correspond to increasing nests, it's implied the relationship is positive), the correlation coefficient would be approximately the positive square root of 0.71. \n\nCalculating the exact square root of 0.71 gives a value close to 0.84, but since we know the relationship is positive, the correct answer based on the provided options and context is:\n\nB. The correlation coefficient is 0.71."
