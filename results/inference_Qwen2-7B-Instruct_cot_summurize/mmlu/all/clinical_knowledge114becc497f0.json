It is influenced by the volume of blood in the veins ( which can be affected by dehydration or overhydration.\n\n**Contractility** is the heart's ability to contract forcefully. This can be influenced by various factors including hormones, nervous system activity, and the state of the muscle fibers themselves.\n\n**Afterload** refers to the resistance the heart must overcome to pump blood out of the heart. In arteries, this is primarily determined by the peripheral resistance, which is influenced by factors like blood viscosity and the tone of the arterioles.\n\nThese three factors\u2014preload, contractility, and afterload\u2014work together to determine how much blood the heart pumps with each beat, known as stroke volume."
