Option B contradicts the idea of stratification if those with exotic grave goods were also engaging in less strenuous labor, suggesting perhaps a merit-based system rather than one of inequality. Option D indicates physical segregation based on characteristics like gender, stature, and capabilities, but it does not directly address the distribution of wealth or status, which is a key component of social stratification."
