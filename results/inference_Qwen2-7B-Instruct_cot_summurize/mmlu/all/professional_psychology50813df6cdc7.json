                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Low-context communication is a less unifying form of communication. In low-context cultures or situations, communication relies more on explicit verbal content and less on shared background, context, or implicit meaning. This means that messages are typically clear and direct, and rely less on nonverbal cues or cultural understanding for their interpretation. \n\nTo clarify the other options:\nA. While context can influence communication, low-context communication specifically refers to a style where the message is communicated directly through words.\nB. Low-context communication does not necessarily rely heavily on nonverbal cues; in fact, it often minimizes the use of such cues to ensure clarity and precision.\nD. Low-context communication is not more typical of culturally diverse groups in the United States. Instead, it is more common in cultures that value explicitness and directness in communication, which might include some regions in the U.S., but this isn't universally applicable to all diverse groups within the U.S. or globally."
