And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&\u2026\"\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568\nAs described by the author, the driving philosophy behind the conquistadores' search for gold was the economic policy known as\n\nA. protectionism\nB. laissez-faire\nC. mercantilism\nD. supply-side\n"

Mercantilism was a dominant economic theory during the time of the Spanish conquests in the Americas. It emphasized the accumulation of wealth and power by a nation through a favorable balance of trade, where exports exceeded imports. The goal was to strengthen national economies by controlling resources and trade, often involving the extraction of precious metals like gold and silver. In this context, the conquistadors sought gold not only for personal enrichment but also to bolster the Spanish crown's wealth and power, adhering to the principles of mercantilism."
