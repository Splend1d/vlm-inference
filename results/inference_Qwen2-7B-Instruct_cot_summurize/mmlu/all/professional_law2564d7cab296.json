The jury returned a verdict for the truck driver, and the court entered judgment. The motorcyclist then sued the company that employed the driver and owned the truck in federal court for personal-injury damages, and the company moved to dismiss based on the state-court judgment. If the court grants the company's motion, what is the likely explanation?\n\nA. Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\nB. Issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) establishes the company's lack of negligence.\nC. The motorcyclist violated the doctrine of election of remedies.\nD. The state-court judgment is the law of the case.\n"

Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\n\nThe likely explanation for the court granting the company's motion to dismiss is claim preclusion or res judicata. This legal principle holds that once a case has been fully litigated and resolved by a final judgment on the merits, the same parties or their privies cannot relitigate the same cause of action in a subsequent suit. In this scenario, since the motorcyclist already sued the truck driver in state court and lost, attempting to sue the employer in federal court would be barred under the principles of claim preclusion if the issues between the motorcyclist and the employer are are substantially the same as those between the motorcyclist and the driver."
