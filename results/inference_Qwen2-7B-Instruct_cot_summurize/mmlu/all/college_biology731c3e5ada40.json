Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus consists of a series of flattened, membrane-bound sacs (called cisternae. These cisternae are stacked on top of each other and are continuous with each other. They receive the modified proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and further modify them through processes like glycosylation, sulfation, or phosphorylation before packaging them into vesicles for transport to their final destinations within the cell or for secretion outside the cell.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. It is actually oriented such that its trans face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. The cis face receives material from the endoplasmic reticulum, while the trans face is where the mature vesicles leave the Golgi apparatus.\nB. Small secretory vesicles are typically formed at the trans face of the Golgi apparatus, not near its cis face. This is where the modified proteins are packaged and sent out of the cell.\nD. Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins usually occurs after they have entered the Golgi apparatus, not before they enter the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. The proteins typically enter the Golgi apparatus via vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum and then undergo modifications including glycosylation as they move through the stack of cisternae towards the trans face."
