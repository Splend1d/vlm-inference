When two objects move relative to each other at high speeds (close to the speed of light \\(c\\), measurements of their lengths in directions parallel to their motion will differ depending on the observer's frame of reference.\n\nThe formula for length contraction is:\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(L\\) is the observed length,\n- \\(L_0\\) is the proper length ( (the length measured in the object's rest frame),\n- \\(v\\) is the relative velocity between the two frames,\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the meterstick on one spaceship (as observed by an occupant of another spaceship moving in the opposite direction) is measured to be 60 cm long, and its proper length is 1 meter ( (100 cm), we can use the length contraction formula to find the relative velocity \\(v\\):\n\n\\[ 60 \\, \\text{cm} = 100 \\, \\text{cm} \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives:\n\n\\[ 3600 = 10000 \\times ( \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 10000 yields:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3600}{10000} = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{25} = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{16}{25} \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{12}{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{12}}{5} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{5} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator, \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{5}\\) is approximately 0.586, which converts to about 0.586c or 0.6c when rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.6c"
