                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the price level's impact on real income. Real income is calculated as nominal income adjusted for inflation ( (or the change in the price level). The formula to calculate real income is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Real Income} = \\frac{\\text{Nominal Income}}{(1 + \\text{Inflation Rate})} \\]\n\nGiven that nominal income rises by 4% and real income falls by 1%, we want to find out how much the price level changed. The fall in real income implies that the rise in nominal income was not enough to offset the effect of inflation.\n\nLet \\(I\\) be the initial nominal income, \\(R\\) be the initial real income, \\(I'\\) be the new nominal income, \\(R'\\) be the new real income, and \\(P\\) be the change in the price level.\n\nWe know:\n- \\(I' = I \\times 1.04\\) ( (since nominal income rises by 4%)\n- \\(R' = R \\times 0.99\\) ( (since real income falls by 1%)\n\nThe relationship between nominal income, real income, and the price level is given by:\n\\[ I' = R' \\times ( (1 + P) \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(I'\\) and \\(R'\\) into the equation:\n\\[ I \\times 1.04 = R \\times 0.99 \\times (1 + P) \\]\n\nSince we're looking for the percentage change in the price level (\\(P\\)), let's simplify:\n\\[ 1.04 = 0.99 \\times (1 + P \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 0.99 gives us:\n\\[ \\frac{1.04}{0.99} = 1 + P \\]\n\n\\[ 1.050505... = 1 + P \\]\n\nThus, \\(P \\approx 0.050505...\\), which is approximately a 5% increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 5 percent increase."
