The patient had mammography and ultrasonography of the breasts 2 months ago for evaluation of increased glandularity, palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, noted at her most recent annual examination. The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6 months. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she takes no medications. BMI is 30 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Palpation of the right breast discloses glandularity in the upper outer quadrant but no other masses. There is scant, black discharge from the right nipple. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Ductography\nB. Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue\nC. Repeat mammography\nD. Repeat ultrasonography of the right breast\n"

Ductography\n\nGiven the history of black discharge from the right nipple and the presence of a palpable mass (despite previous imaging studies suggesting benign findings, ductography can help identify abnormalities within the milk ducts, such as a blocked duct or a duct papilloma, which could be causing the discharge. This procedure involves injecting a contrast agent into the affected duct to visualize it on an X-ray, allowing for a more detailed assessment of the ductal system.\n\nThe other options may not be as informative in this case:\n\nB. An excisional biopsy would involve removing the mass surgically. While this could provide a definitive diagnosis, it is typically reserved for lesions that cannot be confidently diagnosed by imaging or when there is suspicion of malignancy, which is not clearly indicated based on the information provided.\n\nC. Repeating mammography might not add significant new information, especially since the previous mammogram did not detect any concerning features.\n\nD. Repeating ultrasonography might also not be particularly informative, given the previous study's findings were likely benign.\n\nIt's important to note that this decision should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider who has access to the patient's full medical history and examination results."
