                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Increased voltage and decreased resistance.\n\nIn electrical circuits, Ohm's Law states that the current (I) through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (R) between them. Mathematically, this is represented as \\( I = \\frac{V}{R} \\).\n\nWhen you increase the voltage (V) and decrease the resistance (R), the current (I) will increase because the numerator (V) increases while the denominator (R) decreases, leading to a larger overall value for I. \n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Increased voltage and increased resistance: As both V and R increase, the overall fraction \\(\\frac{V}{R}\\) increases, but not necessarily by the same amount as option C because the increase in resistance would have a more significant impact on decreasing the current compared to increasing the voltage.\n\nB. Decrease voltage and decreased resistance: This scenario actually leads to an increase in current because both the numerator (V) and denominator (R) are decreasing, but the decrease in the denominator has a greater effect on increasing the current than the decrease in the numerator.\n\nD. Decreased voltage and increased resistance: In this case, the numerator (V) decreases while the denominator (R) increases, leading to a smaller overall value for I, which means the current decreases."
