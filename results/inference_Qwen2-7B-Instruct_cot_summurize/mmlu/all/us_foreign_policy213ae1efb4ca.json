Local developments were viewed through a geopolitical lens\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States perceived the Third World not merely as a collection of nations but as a battleground in their ideological struggle against communism. This context shaped US foreign policy in the region by framing local developments through a geopolitical lens. The US often saw conflicts and political changes as either pro- or anti-American, with a focus on whether these developments aligned with capitalist democracy or communist ideology. This perspective influenced decisions on which countries to support or intervene in, often based on strategic rather than purely humanitarian considerations."
