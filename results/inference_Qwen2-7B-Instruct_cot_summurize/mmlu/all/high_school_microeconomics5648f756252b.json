A monopoly faces a downward sloping demand curve.\n\nIn a monopoly market structure, there is only one seller of a good or service with no close substitutes. This gives the monopolist market power and control over the price. Unlike in perfect competition, where firms are price takers, a monopolist can set prices above marginal cost because it is the sole supplier. \n\nOptions A, B, and C are not necessarily true for a monopoly:\n\nA. While a monopoly may charge a price that maximizes profit, this does not mean it charges the highest price possible on its demand curve. The price at which maximum profit occurs depends on the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, not necessarily at the peak of the demand curve.\n\nB. Monopolies do not have a horizontal marginal revenue curve. Instead, the marginal revenue curve is always below the demand curve due to the nature of price setting in a monopoly.\n\nC. The total revenue curve for a monopoly is not necessarily upward sloping. It slopes upward until the point where MR = MC, after which it starts to decline as the monopolist loses customers to higher prices."
