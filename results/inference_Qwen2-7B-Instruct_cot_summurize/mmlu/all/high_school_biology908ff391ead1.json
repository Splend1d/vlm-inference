In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype ( ( ) can be calculated using the formula p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the frequency of the recessive allele, and p^2, 2pq, and q^2 represent the frequencies of the homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous recessive genotypes, respectively.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype is 0.01 (q^2 = 0.01, we can solve for q as follows:\n\nq^2 = 0.01  \nq = sqrt(0.01  \nq = 0.1  \n\nSo, the frequency of the recessive allele (q is 0.1. The frequency of the dominant allele, p, is then 1 - q = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nTo find the frequency of carriers (heterozygous individuals), we use the formula 2pq, which represents the frequency of the heterozygous genotype:\n\n2pq = 2 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.18\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the population that are carriers but do not express the trait is 18%.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 18%."
