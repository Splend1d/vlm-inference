This means that for each prime factor, \\(n\\) can include at most half of its power in \\(1200\\) (since squaring it would double the power.\n\nGiven the prime factorization:\n\n- For \\(2^4\\), \\(n\\) could be \\(2^0\\), \\(2^1\\), \\(2^2\\), or \\(2^3\\) since \\(2^4\\) would make \\(n^2 = 2^8\\), which exceeds the available powers.\n- For \\(3^1\\), \\(n\\) could be \\(3^0\\) or \\(3^1\\) because \\(3^2\\) would exceed the available power.\n- For \\(5^2\\), \\(n\\) could be \\(5^0\\), \\(5^1\\), or \\(5^2\\).\n\nNow, let's list out all possible values of \\(n\\) considering these constraints:\n\n- From \\(2^0\\) to \\(2^3\\): \\(1, 2, 4, 8\\)\n- From \\(3^0\\) to \\(3^1\\): \\(1, 3\\)\n- From \\(5^0\\) to \\(5^2\\): \\(1, 5, 25\\)\n\nThe valid values of \\(n\\) are then: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 25\\).\n\nSumming these up gives: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 25 = 48\\).\n\nNone of the options provided match \\(48\\), indicating there might have been an oversight in interpreting the question or the options given. Based on the standard interpretation and calculation, none of the provided answer choices A. 42, B. 12, C. 32, D. 39 match the correct sum of 48. If this discrepancy is due to an error in the question's options, the correct answer based on the calculation is not listed among the choices."
