One day Howard came home early from work and caught his wife and the other man in bed together. In a violent rage, Howard picked up a large metal lamp and severely beat his wife and the other man. Both victims were seriously injured and hospitalized. Howard was charged with the attempted murder of the other man. He was acquitted of the crime. After Howard's acquittal, his wife and the other man died from injuries that were related to the beating. The state now wishes to prosecute Howard for manslaughter for the deaths of his wife and the other man. Howard should be found\n\nA. guilty of manslaughter of his wife, but not guilty of manslaughter of the other man.\nB. guilty of manslaughter of the other man, but not guilty of manslaughter of his wife.\nC. guilty of manslaughter of both his wife and the other man.\nD. not guilty of manslaughter of either his wife or the other man.\n"

Since Howard was acquitted of the attempted murder charge, he cannot be retried for the same act that led to his acquittal. Even though the deaths occurred after his acquittal, the cause of death (the injuries sustained during the beating - is what would typically be considered in a manslaughter charge. However, since the act that caused those injuries has already been ruled upon, Howard cannot be prosecuted for manslaughter in relation to those deaths under the principle of double jeopardy."
