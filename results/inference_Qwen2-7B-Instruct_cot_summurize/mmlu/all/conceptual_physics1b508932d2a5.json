This is because it takes more force to change the rotational motion of an object with mass distributed far from the axis compared to one where the mass is closer to the axis. The formula for rotational inertia (I = \u2211mr\u00b2 demonstrates this, where m is the mass of each particle and r is its distance from the axis of rotation. Thus, the further away the mass is from the axis (the higher the value of r\u00b2, and hence the higher the rotational inertia."
