The contract had a liquidated damages clause that provided for a deduction from the contract price for each day of delay in completing the bridge. The formula for the deductions from the contract price was based on how much traffic flow was turned away. The city tried to deduct the damages from the contract price. The contractor, however, pointed out that the city had not yet connected a road to the bridge so that there was no traffic flow and hence no damage to the city. Will the court uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city?\n\nA. No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.\nB. Yes, because the contract provision for liquidated damages has been breached and the city had no obligation to connect a road.\nC. Yes, because the bridge delays caused the city to delay finishing the road, thereby creating the need to enforce the provision for liquidated damages.\nD. No, because the city breached the contract by not connecting a road to the bridge.\n"

No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.\n\nExplanation: The purpose of a liquidated damages clause is to provide a predetermined amount that one party (in this case, the city) must pay to the other (the contractor) in the event of a breach of contract. This amount is typically agreed upon at the outset and is meant to compensate for the damages suffered as a result of the breach without the need for a lengthy court process to determine actual damages. In this scenario, the city argues that since there was no traffic flow due to not connecting a road to the bridge, there were no damages to the city to compensate for. Therefore, the liquidated damages clause, which was predicated on the assumption of potential traffic flow and its associated damages, may not apply or be upheld by the court if the breach of contract has frustrated the purpose of the clause."
