Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: Yanking a toddler by the arm is considered morally wrong because it involves physical harm and potential danger to a vulnerable individual, which is not justified under ordinary moral standards. On the other hand, needing to take a break to relax is generally not considered morally wrong, as it is a reasonable self-care practice for maintaining one's well-being."
