He argued that ethical disagreements could be resolved empirically by appealing to observable facts and behaviors, suggesting that ethical statements can be understood as expressions of preferences or dispositions rather than objective truths. However, Stevenson also recognized the limitations of empirical methods when dealing with deep-seated moral convictions and the role of intuition and reflective judgment in ethics.\n\nGiven this context, the most accurate answer choice would be:\n\nB. are sometimes useful in resolving ethical disagreement, but are not always sufficient.\n\nThis choice acknowledges that empirical methods can contribute to ethical discussions by providing information about human behavior, societal norms, and consequences of actions, which can be relevant to ethical considerations. However, it also recognizes that ethical disagreements often involve matters of value and principle that may transcend empirical data, requiring a more normative or philosophical analysis."
