However, there are provisions for access under certain circumstances:\n\nA. When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked states: This statement suggests a scenario where, if the coastal state decides to allow access due to its inability to fully utilize its quotas, it would prioritize developing and landlocked states. This is a potential avenue for third states to gain access based on specific conditions.\n\nB. Third States may never have access to fisheries within another State\u2019s EEZ: This statement is an oversimplification. While direct access might not be guaranteed, third states can negotiate access under certain conditions or agreements.\n\nC. The coastal State is to give access to fisheries within its EEZ only to neighboring states: This statement suggests that access is limited to neighboring states, which might not necessarily exclude all third states. Access could still be negotiated with non-neighboring states based on various criteria including but not limited to economic, environmental, or strategic considerations.\n\nD. Third States are free to fish within another EEZ, except from certain designated areas: This statement indicates that third states can fish in another EEZ, with exceptions possibly related to protected areas or conservation zones. This aligns with UNCLOS principles allowing for the designation of such areas where fishing activities are need to be restricted for conservation purposes.\n\nIn summary, while third states do not automatically enjoy fishing rights within another State's EEZ, they can negotiate and potentially gain access under specific conditions and agreements, especially when considering the principles outlined in UNCLOS."
