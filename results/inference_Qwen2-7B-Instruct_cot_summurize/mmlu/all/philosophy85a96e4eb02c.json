Deception in research, if not handled ethically and transparently, can lead to significant harm. This includes damaging the researcher's professional reputation, undermining trust within the academic community, and potentially affecting funding opportunities and future collaborations. It also risks harming the public's trust in scientific research and institutions. While the other options may present challenges, the primary ethical concern regarding deception is the potential for long-term damage to the individual researcher and the broader field they work in."
