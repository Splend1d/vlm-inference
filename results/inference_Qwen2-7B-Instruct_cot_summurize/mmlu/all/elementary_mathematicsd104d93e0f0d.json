Since we're aiming for an improper fraction, let's consider the operation implied by the question ( combining them rather than adding or subtracting directly.\n\nSince \\(8\\) is essentially \\(\\frac{8}{1}\\), and we want to keep it as part of our combined fraction without changing its value, we'll multiply both the numerator and denominator by \\(4\\) ( (the denominator of the second fraction when simplified) to get a common denominator:\n\n\\[8 = \\frac{8}{1} = \\frac{8 \\times 4}{1 \\times 4} = \\frac{32}{4}\\]\n\nNow, we have both fractions with a common denominator:\n\n\\[8 = \\frac{32}{4}, \\quad \\frac{2}{4}\\]\n\nCombining these into a single improper fraction means we add them together:\n\n\\[\\frac{32}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{32 + 2}{4} = \\frac{34}{4}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\(34\\) over \\(4\\)."
