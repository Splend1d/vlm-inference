The headaches are moderately severe, are present when he awakens in the morning, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8 months ago, which necessitated relocating. Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA.

Refer him for consultation with a neurologist.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms (moderate headache onset in the morning that improves with over-the-counter analgesics and new-onset headache after a significant life change (promotion and relocation), the physical examination finding of bilateral optic disc blurring, and the absence of any other abnormalities during the physical examination, it is prudent to refer this patient for consultation with a neurologist. \n\nThis referral allows for further evaluation, including neurological assessment, potential imaging studies, and detailed medical history review, which can help diagnose the cause of the headaches and rule out more serious conditions such as raised intracranial pressure or other neurological disorders. \n\nOptions A ( Begin a trial of a \u03b2-blocking medication, B: Order CT scan of the head, and C: Order EEG might be steps taken if a neurologist determines they are necessary based on the initial consultation, but without additional information or examination, these cannot be determined as the first course of action."
