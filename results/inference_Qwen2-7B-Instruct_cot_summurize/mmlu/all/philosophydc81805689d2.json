This alignss with option B: \"we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility.\"\n\nOption A, \"we should always calculate the expected consequences of our action,\" is also related to utilitarian principles, but it's not specifically to Bentham's stance. Utilitarians believe that the consequences of one's actions should be considered when making moral decisions.\n\nOptions C and D, \"we should consult tradition\" and \"we should consult scripture,\" respectively, refer to ethical decision-making based on cultural norms or religious doctrines. These approaches do not align with Bentham's utilitarian philosophy, which emphasizes empirical evidence and the consequences of actions on overall well-being rather than adherence to tradition or religious texts.\n\nIn summary, Bentham would likely endorse option B, suggesting that decisions about how to act should be based on maximizing utility or happiness for the greatest number of people."
