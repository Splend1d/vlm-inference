This involves tightening the money supply, which can be achieved by raising the discount rate\u2014the interest rate at which banks can borrow from the Fed. When the discount rate is raised, it becomes more costly for banks to borrow from the central bank, which in turn leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses. This reduction in borrowing and spending helps to decrease the demand for goods and services, thereby alleviating the \"crowding out\" effect."
