While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that \"she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up, because there are problems with the floor.\" After falling and breaking a leg due to a loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that: \"The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.' \". Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?\n\nA. Yes, because it is as an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.\nB. Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.\nC. No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.\nD. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n"

No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n\nIn this situation, the building owner's statement to the effect that the janitor said, \"I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt,\" would be considered hearsay because it involves the out-of-court statement made by the janitor (that the dancer was bound to get hurt. Since the janitor is not available to testify, the building owner's recounting of the janitor's statement is itself another layer of hearsay. There are no specific exceptions to the hearsay rule that would allow this type of testimony to be admitted into evidence."
