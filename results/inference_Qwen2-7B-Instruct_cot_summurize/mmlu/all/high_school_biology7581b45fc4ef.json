Selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young\n\nExplanation: The scenario described involves pike-cichlids as visual predators of algae-eaters. In such an environment, the most beneficial traits would likely be those that help the algae-eaters avoid detection by the predators. This would include traits like:\n\nA. Selection for drab coloration of the algae-eaters - This could help them blend into their environment, making them harder to spot by predators.\n\nB. Selection for nocturnal algae-eaters - Being active at night might reduce the chances of being seen by diurnal (day-active) predators like the pike-cichlids.\n\nD. Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes - Smaller individuals may be less conspicuous to predators, thus having a survival advantage.\n\nHowever, selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young, does not directly aid in avoiding predation. Instead, this trait would potentially increase the competition within the population for resources, potentially leading to higher mortality rates due to increased predation or competition for food, especially if the larger offspring require more resources to survive and grow. Therefore, this trait is least likely to be observed under predation pressure from visual predators like pike-cichlids."
