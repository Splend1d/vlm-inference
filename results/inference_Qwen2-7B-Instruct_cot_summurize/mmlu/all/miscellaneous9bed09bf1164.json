                    "text": "The human body is about 60% water by weight, and an average adult weighs around 70 kg. So, the total volume of water in the body can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of water} = \\frac{\\text{Body weight} \\times \\text{Water percentage}}{\\text{Density of water}} \\]\n\nAssuming the density of water is 1 g/cm\u00b3 (or 1000 kg/m\u00b3), the volume of water in the body would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of water} = \\frac{70\\,kg \\times 0.6}{1\\,g/cm^3} = 42\\,L \\]\n\nSince 1 L = 1 dm\u00b3 = 1000 cm\u00b3, the volume of water in the body is 42,000 cm\u00b3.\n\nNow, let's estimate the number of water molecules in this volume. A water molecule has a volume of approximately \\(3 \\times 10^{-29}\\) m\u00b3 or \\(3 \\times 10^{-26}\\) cm\u00b3.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of water molecules} = \\frac{\\text{Volume of water}}{\\text{Volume per molecule}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of water molecules} = \\frac{42,000\\,cm\u00b3}{3 \\times 10^{-21}\\,cm\u00b3/\\text{molecule}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of water molecules} = 1.4 \\times 10^{25} \\]\n\nSo, the closest answer to the number of water molecules in a human body would be C. 8*10^25, though technically it should be closer to 1.4*10^25. The exact answer might vary based on the precise assumptions made about the density and purity of water in the body."
