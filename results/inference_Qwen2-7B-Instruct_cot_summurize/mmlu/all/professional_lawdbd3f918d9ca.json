The squatters did not ask permission, and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\n\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\n"

No, because the owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\n\nIn general, landowners owe a duty of care to those who have been invited onto their property (such as guests or customers. They also owe a duty to those who have entered their property without explicit invitation, such as licensees, but this duty is less stringent than that owed to invitees. However, when someone enters the property without permission, they become a trespasser. In most jurisdictions, landowners do not have a duty to protect trespassers from risks that are inherent to the property, unless the landowner has acted with willful or wanton disregard for the safety of the trespassers.\n\nIn the scenario presented, while the squatters may have been trespassing, the company had knowledge of its waste discharge problems which posed a risk to anyone using the lake. This might be considered an act of willful or wanton disregard, potentially creating a duty of care towards the squatters. However, determining whether the company willfully or wantonly disregarded the safety of the squatters would depend on specific facts not provided in the question, including how the company responded to the situation after becoming aware of the risks.\n\nThus, while the company's defense might be strong based on the general rule that landowners have no duty to protect trespassers, there could be exceptions if the company's actions meet the legal definition of willful or wanton disregard."
