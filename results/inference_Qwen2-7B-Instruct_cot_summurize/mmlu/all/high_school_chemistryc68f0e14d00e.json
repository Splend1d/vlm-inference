The atom that tends to attract the shared pair of electrons more strongly ( due to its higher electronegativity will be shown with the negative end (-) towards it. \n\nElectronegativities:\n- Nitrogen ( (N) is more electronegative than carbon (C). This means nitrogen attracts the shared pair of electrons more strongly than carbon does.\n- Oxygen ( (O) is more electronegative than sulfur (S), but since we're comparing options and only one of them involves oxygen, we don't need to consider oxygen here.\n- Fluorine ( (F) is the most electronegative element, followed by oxygen, then nitrogen. Since none of the options involve fluorine, we won't consider this comparison.\n\nTherefore, in N\u2014C, nitrogen is more electronegative and thus attracts the shared electrons more, making it the negative end, which is written last in the bond notation."
