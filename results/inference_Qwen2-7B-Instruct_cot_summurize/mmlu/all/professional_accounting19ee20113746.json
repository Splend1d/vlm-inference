Negligence.\n\nWhen a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) fails to adhere to the required standards of due care during an audit, they can potentially be held liable for negligence. This means that if their actions or omissions result in harm to third parties who were not directly involved in the audit process, the CPA could be found negligent and thus liable under the law. \n\nNegligence typically involves a duty of care owed by one party to another, a breach of that duty, and damages resulting from the breach. In this context, the duty of care would be the responsibility of the CPA to perform the audit according to professional standards. If they fail to do so and it causes harm to third parties, they may be found liable for negligence.\n\nStrict liability, on the other hand, applies when there is no need to prove fault; instead, liability is imposed simply because the harm occurred within a certain context. Breach of contract involves a failure to fulfill the terms of an agreement between two or more parties. Gross negligence refers to a particularly high level of negligence, often involving reckless disregard for the safety of others. Neither of these concepts align perfectly with the scenario described, where the CPA's actions affect third parties through negligence."
