Hearsay is generally inadmissible under the rules of evidence. However, there might be exceptions depending on the legal system and jurisdiction, such as the business records exception or the public records exception, but these are do not directly apply to news articles in the same way they would to official records or continuous records kept by a business.\n\nWithout specific rules or exceptions that would allow the introduction of news articles as evidence in this context, the evidence would typically be excluded. It's important to note that the specifics can vary widely based on the jurisdiction and the nuances of the legal system in play."
