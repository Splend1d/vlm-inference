HIV/AIDS is a newly emergent disease that did not exist until relatively late in the 20th century.\nB. Ill health can threaten the state indirectly, but can also be a threat to other referent objects such as the economy.\nC. The overwhelming scale of HIV/AIDS requires a new approach in order to theorize its impact on security.\nD. None of the above - HIV/AIDS is better defined as a traditional security issue.\n"

Ill health can threaten the state indirectly, but can also be a threat to other referent objects such as the economy.\n\nHIV/AIDS is considered a non-traditional security issue because it impacts not just individual health and well-being, but also has broader societal implications. It can strain healthcare systems, lead to economic downturns due to reduced productivity and increased healthcare costs, and exacerbate social inequalities. This indirect impact on states and their ability to maintain stability and function is what categorizes HIV/AIDS as a non-traditional security issue."
