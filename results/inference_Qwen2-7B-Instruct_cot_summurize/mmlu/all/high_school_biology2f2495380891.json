It is an inactivated X chromosome and results in females with half their cells having one X inactivated and the other half of their cells having the other X inactivated.\n\nBarr bodies are a phenomenon observed in female mammals where one of the two X chromosomes in each cell becomes inactivated (or \"turned off\") during early embryonic development. This process ensures that females, who have two X chromosomes (X and X, do not overexpress the genes on the X chromosome. The inactive X chromosome forms a tightly condensed structure within the nucleus and is often seen as a darkly stained body when viewed under a microscope. Not all cells in a female organism will have a Barr body; about half of them will have an active X and the other half an inactivated X, which contributes to the mosaicism of X-inactivation patterns among individual female cells."
