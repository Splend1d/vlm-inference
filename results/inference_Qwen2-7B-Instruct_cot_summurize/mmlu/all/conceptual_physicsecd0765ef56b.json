Both of these.\n\nThe equations of special relativity, which include the time dilation equation, the length contraction equation, and the relativistic momentum equation, are valid for both everyday low speeds and relativistic speeds. However, their effects become more noticeable as the speed approaches the speed of light. At everyday speeds, the differences they predict from classical mechanics are negligible, but at relativistic speeds, these effects become significant."
