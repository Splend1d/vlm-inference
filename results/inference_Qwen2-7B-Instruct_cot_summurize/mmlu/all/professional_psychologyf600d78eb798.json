Under no circumstance.\n\nPsychologists adhering to ethical guidelines typically maintain confidentiality with their clients, unless there are specific exceptions such as when the client poses a danger to themselves or others. In the context of an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), the psychologist would not typically disclose details about an individual's treatment to their supervisor without consent from the employee and potentially following specific legal or organizational requirements. Therefore, in most cases, the psychologist should not inform the employee's supervisor about the treatment received, regardless of whether the referral was made by the supervisor or not, or whether a waiver has been signed."
