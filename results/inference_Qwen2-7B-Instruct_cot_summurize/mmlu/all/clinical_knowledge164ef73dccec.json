A left basal pneumonia\n\nA left basal pneumonia can cause pressure and inflammation on the left side of the lung, which may push the trachea (or windpipe) towards the opposite side to maintain airway clearance. This is because the body tries to keep air flowing into the affected lung. The other options typically do not have a direct effect on the position of the trachea in this manner."
