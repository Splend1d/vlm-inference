However, considering that air conditioning is nearly universal in new cars and has been standard in many used vehicles, we can estimate that nearly all vehicles would have air conditioning.\n\n3. **Cost of Air Conditioning**: The cost to cool an automobile varies based on the type of vehicle, its size, and efficiency. For simplicity, let's assume a mid-range cost per vehicle for air conditioning operation over a year. This could include the cost of electricity and maintenance. A rough estimate might be around $500 per vehicle per year, which includes the cost of electricity to run the air conditioning system and basic maintenance costs.\n\n4. **Total Cost Calculation**: Multiplying the number of vehicles by the estimated cost per vehicle gives us the total cost.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 275,000,000 \\times \\$500 = \\$137,500,000,000 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest billion, the total cost would be approximately $137.5 billion. \n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. $10m - Incorrect\nB. $100m - Incorrect\nC. $1 billion - Incorrect\nD. $10 billion - Incorrect\n\nNone of the provided options exactly match our calculation. However, had option E been available, it would have been the closest correct answer given the information and assumptions used. The precise answer, based on the calculations, would be closer to $137.5 billion, which is not listed among the provided choices."
