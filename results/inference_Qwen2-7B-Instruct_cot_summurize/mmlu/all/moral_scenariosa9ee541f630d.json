Wrong, Not wrong\n\nKissing one's niece could be considered inappropriate and potentially problematic, especially if there is an age difference or it creates an uncomfortable or awkward situation for either party. This is often related to cultural norms and personal boundaries.\n\nPutting matches up high where a child cannot reach them is generally considered responsible behavior. It helps prevent accidents and ensures that children do not have access to potentially dangerous items without supervision."
