This trait freed the hands for carrying tools and resources, facilitating survival in new environments. While intelligence (B also played a role in tool use and problem-solving, it was the combination of bipedalism with other traits like larger brain size that made Homo erectus capable of such migrations. Neoteny (A refers to the retention of juvenile characteristics into adulthood, which does not directly correlate with migration capabilities. Microcephaly (D is a condition characterized by an abnormally small head and brain, which is the opposite of what would be expected for a species capable of long-distance travel."
