The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the landowner and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the landowner and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the landowner's death, his estate is required to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The deed for the remaining 250-acre parcel contained the identical restrictions as the deeds to the other three parcels. The investor, ignoring these restrictions, was able to use his political influence to persuade the county zoning board to rezone the said parcel for commercial use. The residents of phase I seek to enjoin the construction of the shopping center. The residents will have\n\nA. little chance of preventing the projected commercial development.\nB. no standing to enjoin the construction of the shopping center.\nC. no chance of succeeding, because the zoning ordinance takes precedence over the covenant running with the land.\nD. success in their cause of action in accordance with the common development scheme.\n"

                    "text": "The situation described involves a complex interplay between property law principles, including covenants running with the land, zoning regulations, and potential causes of action for injunctive relief. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Little chance of preventing the projected commercial development: This might seem plausible at first glance, but it depends on the specifics of the legal agreements and applicable laws. If the covenants running with the land (restricting development to minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwellings are enforceable and if the residents can prove that the rezoning violates those covenants, they might still have a chance.\n\nB. No standing to enjoin the construction of the shopping center: Generally, property owners or individuals directly affected by a zoning decision may have standing to challenge it in court. If the residents of phase 1 can demonstrate that the rezoning and proposed commercial development would affect them negatively, they likely do have standing. However, this depends on the jurisdiction's specific standing rules.\n\nC. No chance of succeeding, because the zoning ordinance takes precedence over the covenant running with the land: This statement oversimplifies the situation. In many jurisdictions, covenants running with the land (can override conflicting local zoning ordinances if they are enforceable and the landowners have successfully conveyed the rights under those covenants. However, the enforceability of such covenants depends on various factors, including the terms of the covenants, the intent of the parties, and the nature of the restriction.\n\nD. Success in their cause of action in accordance with the common development scheme: This option suggests that the residents might succeed in preventing the construction based on the covenants running with the land. If the covenants are valid and enforceable, and the rezoning violates those covenants, the residents could potentially argue that the rezoning is illegal and should not proceed. This argument would depend on the strength of the evidence supporting the enforceability of the covenants and the extent to which the rezoning contravenes them.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer would likely be a nuanced combination of these options, depending on the specific circumstances. The residents of phase 1 might have a case if they can show that the rezoning violates the covenants running with the land that restrict development to minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwellings. Their success would depend on proving the enforceability of these covenants, demonstrating that the rezoning is in violation of them, and establishing their standing to bring the lawsuit. Therefore, without more detailed information about the enforceability of the covenants and the legal context, it's difficult to definitively choose one of these options. However, D. success in their cause of action in accordance with the common development scheme, is the most plausible based on the information provided, assuming that the covenants are enforceable and the rezoning clearly violates them."
