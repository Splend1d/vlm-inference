Not wrong, Wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves using leftovers to create sushi, which is generally not considered morally wrong unless there is some underlying context that makes it so, such as waste or disrespect towards the person's wishes. In most cases, creatively using food resources is seen as resourceful and not morally problematic.\n\nScenario 2 involves jumping out of a window onto the ground three feet below. This action can be dangerous and potentially harmful to one's health, which goes against the duty of self-care and safety. It could also cause harm to others if they are nearby or if there are are any unforeseen obstacles on the ground. Therefore, this scenario involves an action that is clearly morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
