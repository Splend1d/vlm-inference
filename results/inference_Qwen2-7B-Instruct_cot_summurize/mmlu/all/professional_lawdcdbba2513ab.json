The next door neighbor, Tony, shared a concrete driveway that ran between the two houses but was entirely on Mort's side of the property line. Tony had been using the driveway for the past 25 years, during which time three different owners bought and sold Mort's house. When Mort applied to refinance his loan, his appraiser found an old survey showing the accurate property boundaries. Upset, Mort filed a suit against Tony for trespass. What is the likely result?\n\nA. Mort will prevail in an action for trespass, because Tony's use wasn't \"hostile.\"\nB. Mort will prevail because Tony's use wasn't \"open and notorious,\" since it was not widely known that he was on Mort's property.\nC. Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period.\nD. Tony will prevail because the easement was due to necessity.\n"

Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period.\n\nThe doctrine of adverse possession allows someone to gain legal ownership of a piece of property by meeting certain requirements over a period of time, typically ranging from 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction. These requirements usually include open, notorious, continuous, exclusive, and hostile use of the property without permission from the owner.\n\nIn this case, Tony has been using the driveway for 25 years, which exceeds the typical requirement for adverse possession in many jurisdictions. Assuming that Tony's use of the driveway met the other criteria ( such as being open, notorious, continuous, exclusive, and hostile \u2014 meaning he used it openly, people knew about his use of the driveway, he used it consistently, he did not share its use with Mort or others, and he used it without permission \u2014 Tony would likely be able to claim the driveway as part of his property under the principle of adverse possession.\n\nTherefore, Tony would have a strong argument for prevailing in this lawsuit based on adverse possession, assuming all the necessary elements were met."
