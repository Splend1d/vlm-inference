In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security.\nB. In order to transcend the intervention-vs.-sovereignty debate, R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty.\nC. In order to facilitate the deployment of effective humanitarian intervention, the R2P approach redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty.\nD. The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens.\n"

While it's true that Westphalian notions of sovereignty are often invoked in discussions of R2P, particularly in justifying interventions for the sake of international security, the primary focus of R2P is not on security but on the protection of civilians from mass atrocities. The invocation of sovereignty in this context is more about balancing the rights of states with the responsibilities they have towards their populations.\n\nB. This statement is accurate. R2P does seek to redefine the concept of sovereignty in a way that acknowledges the inherent responsibility of states to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, thus transcending the traditional dichotomy between state sovereignty and humanitarian intervention.\n\nC. This statement is accurate as well. The R2P framework does indeed aim to facilitate the deployment of effective humanitarian intervention by redefining sovereignty in terms that allow for intervention when a state fails to protect its population.\n\nD. This statement is also accurate. According to the R2P approach, sovereignty is indeed conceptualized as a responsibility, entailing duties towards the population, including the obligation to protect them from certain forms of harm.\n\nTherefore, if we consider these statements in light of their accuracy regarding the tension between R2P and notions of sovereignty, statement A is not an accurate representation of the core principles of R2P, especially in how it positions the justification for intervention."
