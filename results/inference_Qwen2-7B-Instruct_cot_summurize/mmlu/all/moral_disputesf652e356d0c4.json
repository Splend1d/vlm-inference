Aquinas' examples of self-evident propositions would typically be statements that are logically true and universally accepted without requiring proof. The other options ( \"Every whole is greater than its part,\" \"Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another,\" and \"Man is a rational being\" are all considered self-evident truths in his philosophy."
