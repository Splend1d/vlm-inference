Of the following approaches to diagnostic assessment, the most appropriate is one that\n\nA. uses an interpreter who is fluent in the language of the country in which the student was born\nB. uses the results of at least two Englishlanguage intelligence tests\nC. accounts for sociocultural and adaptive behavior in the process of identifying skills and abilities\nD. includes parent interviews and classroom observations as well as the results of an intelligence test\n"

However, it still does not explicitly address the importance of considering the student's sociocultural background and adaptive behaviors.\n\nBy incorporating a multidimensional approach like option C ensures that the assessment considers the student's unique circumstances, potentially leading to a more accurate identification of their needs for special education services."
