The end of the last Ice Age allowed for the expansion of various plant and animal species, leading to a more diverse range of resources for human populations. This diversity included a wide array of plants, smaller game animals, fish, and other aquatic resources, which replaced the reliance on large megafauna that had become extinct due to various factors including overhuntinging and climate change. Therefore, the correct answer is D. diversity."
