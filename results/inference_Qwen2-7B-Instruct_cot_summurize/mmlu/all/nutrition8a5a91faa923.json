The mechanism by which non-esterified fatty acids (are taken up by cells is by a combination of diffusion and carrier-mediated transport involving fatty acid binding, translocase, and transport proteins.\n\nNon-esterified fatty acids can indeed enter cells through a process that involves both passive diffusion and active transport mechanisms. Passive diffusion allows small molecules to move down their concentration gradient, while carrier-mediated transport requires specific proteins to facilitate the movement of substances across the cell membrane against their concentration gradient. Fatty acid binding proteins help in the uptake and release of fatty acids, and translocase and transport proteins are involved in the active transport of fatty acids into cells, especially in specialized cells like adipocytes where fatty acid uptake is crucial for energy storage or utilization."
