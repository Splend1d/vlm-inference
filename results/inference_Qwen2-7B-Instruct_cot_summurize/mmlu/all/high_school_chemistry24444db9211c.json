The reason for this is that the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) in ethanol allows it to form hydrogen bonds with other ethanol molecules. Hydrogen bonding is a type of intermolecular force that is stronger than London dispersion forces (which are present in the other molecules listed) but weaker than covalent bonds. These hydrogen bonds require more energy to break, resulting in a higher boiling point for ethanol compared to the other hydrocarbons listed. \n\nTo summarize:\n- A. CH3CH2CH2CH3 ( (Butane) - No functional groups, so only London dispersion forces.\n- B. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH ( (Ethanol) - Hydroxyl group allows for hydrogen bonding.\n- C. CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl  ( (Chlorobutane) - Chlorine atom introduces additional London dispersion forces, but no hydrogen bonding.\n- D. CH3CH2CH2CH2Br  ( (Bromobutane) - Bromine atom also introduces additional London dispersion forces, but no hydrogen bonding.\n\nTherefore, the molecule with the highest boiling point is B, Ethanol, due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds."
