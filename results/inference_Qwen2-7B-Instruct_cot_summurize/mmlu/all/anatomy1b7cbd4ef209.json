The infraorbital nerve is a terminal branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. \n\nThis nerve carries sensory information from the lower eyelid, nose, cheek, and upper lip to the brain. It also supplies some motor innervation to muscles in this region.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The infraorbital nerve is not a terminal branch of the facial nerve but rather of the trigeminal nerve ( specifically the maxillary division.\n\nC. Parasympathetic secretomotor neurons do not carry through the infraorbital nerve. These neurons typically innervate glands such as the lacrimal gland via the ophthalmic division of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nD. The infraorbital nerve does innervate the inferior part of the orbicularis oculi muscle, but it's also important to note that it also innervates other muscles like the skin of the cheek and nose, and the mucous membranes of the nose."
