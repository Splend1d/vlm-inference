They created distinctive art forms, including colossal heads, which are often associated with their leadership or deities. Their religious iconography played a central role in unifying various aspects of their society, including rituals, ceremonies, and possibly political structures. Agricultural surpluses ( could have provided the economic stability to support such cultural developments, but it's not specifically an \"unifying element\" as much as a contributing factor. Large armies are were not a characteristic of Olmec civilization as they are known for peaceful trade and ceremonial activities rather than warfare."
