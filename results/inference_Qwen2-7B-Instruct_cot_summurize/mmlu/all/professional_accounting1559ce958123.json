Then we subtract the beginning inventory for the quarter.\n\nHere's how you calculate it:\n\n1. **First Quarter Sales**: 30,000 units.\n2. **Desired Ending Inventory**: 30% of the second quarter's sales. Since the second quarter's sales are 40,000 units, the desired ending inventory for the first quarter is \\(40,000 \\times 0.3 = 12,000\\) units.\n3. **Beginning Inventory**: Given as 9,000 units.\n\nThe formula for calculating the production is:\n\\[ \\text{Production} = \\text{Sales} + \\text{Desired Ending Inventory} - \\text{Beginning Inventory} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\\[ \\text{Production} = 30,000 + 12,000 - 9,000 = 33,000 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. 33000**."
