However, such statements can sometimes be admitted under the hearsay exception for \"admissions.\" This exception allows for the use of statements made by a party-opponent to prove the truth of the matter asserted if the declarant is available to testify and subject to cross-examination at the hearing, and the statement is one of which a reasonable fact finder could conclude was against the declarant\u2019s interest at the time it was made. \n\nThe specific rules can vary significantly between different legal systems, so it's important to consider the particular laws and rules of evidence in effect in the jurisdiction where the case is being tried."
