No significant difference; low-income urban and rural people face similar constraints in accessing food and consume similar diets in developing countries.\nB. It will reduce poverty and hunger because these are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas.\nC. Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\nD. Poor city folk eat mainly sorghum, millet, maize and root crops, so a lot more of those foods will need to be produced as the world urbanises.\n"

Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\n\nUrbanization can significantly impact hunger and malnutrition in several ways:\n\n1. **Increased Vulnerability to Food Price Increases**: In urban areas, people often rely more on purchasing food rather than growing it themselves, which makes them more susceptible to changes in food prices. If food prices rise, urban residents may struggle to afford nutritious meals, leading to higher rates of malnutrition.\n\n2. **Access to Diverse and Nutritious Foods**: Urban areas typically offer greater access to a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and animal products, compared to rural areas. However, this access can be unequal, with wealthier urbanites having better access to diverse and nutritious diets while poorer urbanites might struggle with food insecurity.\n\n3. **Changes in Diet Patterns**: Urbanization can lead to shifts in diet patterns towards higher consumption of processed foods, which might not provide adequate nutrition. This dietary change can exacerbate issues related to malnutrition, especially among children and the elderly.\n\n4. **Improvement in Infrastructure and Services**: Urban areas often have better infrastructure and services, such as improved sanitation, healthcare, and education, which can help mitigate malnutrition by ensuring better health and nutrition practices.\n\n5. **Economic Opportunities and Poverty Reduction**: Urbanization can provide economic opportunities that can lift people out of poverty, potentially reducing hunger and malnutrition. However, the benefits are not always evenly distributed, and informal sectors in cities can also contribute to instability in food security.\n\n6. **Food Security Challenges**: Urbanization can strain local food systems, particularly if there is not enough investment in urban agriculture or if food supply chains are not robust enough to handle increased demand.\n\nOverall, while urbanization can bring some improvements in terms of access to better healthcare and education, which are are crucial for addressing malnutrition, it also introduces new challenges, particularly in terms of food affordability and access to nutritious foods."
