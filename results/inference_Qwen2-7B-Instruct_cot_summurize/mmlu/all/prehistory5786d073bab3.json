The Maya civilization faced severe droughts during the Terminal Classic period, which is believed to have contributed to the collapse of their cities and the abandonment of many of their ceremonial centers. The Moche culture also suffered from prolonged periods of drought, which affected their agricultural productivity and may have played a role in the shift of power dynamics within their society.\n\nWhile these civilizations could have been affected by other factors such as invasions or earthquakes, droughts were particularly devastating due to their impact on agriculture, which was central to the sustenance of these societies. Civil war could also be a factor, but it is not specifically mentioned as a widespread cause for the decline of these ancient cultures."
