An approach to security that applies critical knowledge to established orthodoxies of security studies.\n\nCritical Security Studies (CSS) is an interdisciplinary academic field that challenges the traditional focus on state-centric and military aspects of security. It applies critical theories from sociology, political science, feminism, and other disciplines to analyze security issues. CSS emphasizes the social construction of security and the ways in which power dynamics, identity politics, and global inequalities shape security policies and practices. This approach often critiques the dominance of Western perspectives and aims to include voices from the Global South and marginalized groups in security discourse."
