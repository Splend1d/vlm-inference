Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1996, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2002, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. By 2007, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2008, a man who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder placed a mobile home on his property. A woman who owns a lot in the subdivision initiates suit against the man to force him to remove the mobile home. Which of the following would be the most accurate statement of law?\n\nA. There is no enforceable restriction because the mobile-home provision did not \"run with the land. \"\nB. There is no enforceable restriction because the man's deed did not include the mobile-home provision.\nC. The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\nD. The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision.\n"

The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\n\nThe principle of \"running with the land\" refers to covenants, conditions, and restrictions that bind successive owners of the property. In this case, the original developer set up a common development scheme when creating the subdivision plan and including the restriction in the initial deeds. Even though the builder did not include the mobile-home provision in the later deeds, the restriction is still enforceable against subsequent buyers because it is a part of the overall development plan for the entire subdivision. This means that the restriction applies to all properties within the subdivision, regardless of the specific terms in their individual deeds."
