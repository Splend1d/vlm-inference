Lifetime expectancy is not related to disease incidence but rather to the average number of years a person is expected to live based on their age and other factors. Lifetime prevalence is the proportion of a population found to have a condition at a specific point in time or during a specified interval of time. Period prevalence is similar to lifetime prevalence but refers specifically to the proportion of a population that has a condition during a defined time period. Since the statement describes a period ( from January 1, 1997 through January 1, 1998) during which there were no new cases of Ebola virus, it fits the definition of period prevalence."
