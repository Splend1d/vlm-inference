This is because the absolute value of the correlation coefficient measures the strength of the relationship between two variables, and the closer the absolute value is to 1, the stronger the correlation. A value of -1 signifies a perfect negative correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other decreases in a perfectly predictable manner."
