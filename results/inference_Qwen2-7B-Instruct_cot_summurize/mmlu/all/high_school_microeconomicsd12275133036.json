                    "text": "When the annual price of capital increases, it leads to an increase in the cost of using capital as a production input. This directly affects the short-run cost curves for several reasons:\n\n1. **Marginal Cost (** Increases: As the cost of capital rises, the marginal cost of producing one more unit increases because each additional unit produced requires more capital, which is now more expensive.\n\n2. **Average Variable Cost (** Increases: The average variable cost includes the variable costs per unit of output, which now include a higher cost for capital. Since capital is a variable input, its increased cost raises the average variable cost per unit.\n\n3. **Average Fixed Cost (** Decreases: Although the total fixed cost does not change with the quantity of output, the average fixed cost (which is the total fixed cost divided by the quantity of output, decreases when output increases. However, in the context of shifting curves, the focus is on how the cost changes with output, not just the average cost calculation. The direct impact of increasing capital costs on the average fixed cost curve is less straightforward and depends on the specific scenario, but generally, if total output remains constant while the cost of capital increases, the average fixed cost per unit would decrease in terms of its effect on total costs, not necessarily on the curve itself.\n\n4. **Average Total Cost and Marginal Cost Curves Shift Upward:** Both the average total cost ( (which combines both variable and fixed costs) and the marginal cost curves shift upward due to the increased cost of capital.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. The marginal cost, average fixed cost, average variable cost, and average total cost curves will all shift upward.**\n\nIt's important to note that the direct effect on the average fixed cost curve might not be immediately apparent from the options given, as the question focuses on shifts rather than the intrinsic nature of average cost calculations. In reality, an increase in capital costs could lead to a decrease in the average fixed cost per unit as production scales up, but this nuanced detail isn't captured in the provided choices."
