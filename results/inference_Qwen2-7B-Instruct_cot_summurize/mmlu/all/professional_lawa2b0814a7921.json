The letter stated, \"I want to sell my antique Ford Roadster for a price above $20,000. If you are interested please contact me.\" Three days later Bobby sent a letter to Susan stating \"I agree to pay your asking price of $20,000 for the 1932 Ford Roadster.\" The next day Susan sold the car to Harriet Higherprice for $25,000. If Bobby brings suit against Susan for breach of contract, the likely outcome is\n\nA. For Bobby, since her acceptance was timely under the mail box rule.\nB. For Susan, because her letter to Bobby was not an offer.\nC. For Susan, because the sale to Harriett was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted.\nD. For Bobby, because her communication met the full price which Susan was asking for the automobile.\n"

For Susan, because the sale to Harriett was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted.\n\nIn this scenario, Susan's initial letter to Bobby was not an offer but rather an indication of her willingness to negotiate at a price above $20,000. Therefore, it did not constitute a legally binding offer. When Bobby wrote back agreeing to pay the specified price, he was responding to an open invitation to negotiate (not an offer. Since Susan had already sold the car to Harriet Higherprice before she knew about Bobby's acceptance, she would not be liable for breach of contract to Bobby. The contract with Bobby never came into existence because an offer and acceptance did not occur as described."
