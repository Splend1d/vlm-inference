This leads to a high frequency of genetic exchange when mating occurs, making it easier to transfer specific genes from the donor to the recipient cell. The F-plasmid itself contains the F factor, which includes the genes necessary for conjugation. \n\nThe other options either describe incorrect scenarios ( (A and D) or refer to something that does not match the definition of an Hfr strain ( (B)."
