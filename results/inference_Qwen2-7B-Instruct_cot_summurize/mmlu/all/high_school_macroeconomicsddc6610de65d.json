Increase    Decrease   Decrease   Increase\n\nLet's break down why this is the case:\n\n1. **Nominal Interest Rate**: A contractionary monetary policy typically involves the central bank selling government securities in the open market. This reduces the money supply, which leads to higher demand for existing money. As a result, the nominal interest rate increases.\n\n2. **Aggregate Demand ( (AD)**: Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can discourage investment and consumer spending. This leads to a decrease in overall demand for goods and services, causing aggregate demand to fall.\n\n3. **Output**: With lower aggregate demand, businesses may produce less to meet the reduced demand. This results in a decrease in total output or GDP.\n\n4. **Price Level**: As output decreases and demand falls, the pressure on prices also decreases. This leads to a decline in the general price level, which is reflected in a decrease in the inflation rate.\n\nTherefore, a contractionary monetary policy typically results in an increase in the nominal interest rate, a decrease in aggregate demand, a decrease in output, and an increase in the price level."
