This period of decline is often associated with environmental factors such as droughts, which could have impacted agriculture and led to societal stress and collapse. After the initial decline, some Mayan groups migrated north and contributed to the development of other Mesoamerican civilizations, including the formation of the Aztec civilization centuries later. However, it's important to note that the decline was not uniform across all regions of the Maya world, and some areas continued to thrive for some time after others had begun to fade."
