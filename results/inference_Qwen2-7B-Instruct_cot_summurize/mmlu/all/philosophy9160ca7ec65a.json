When one's epistemological theories are unclear or flawed, it might lead them to doubt the possibility of moral knowledge, contributing to ethical skepticism. For instance, if someone believes that all beliefs must be derived from sensory experience and introspection (a view akin to empiricism or rationalism, respectively), they might struggle to find a basis for moral knowledge, which often involves considerations beyond direct personal experience. \n\nThe other options, while potentially influencing one's philosophical stance on ethics, do not directly explain ethical skepticism as a result of confusion. Confused metaphysical theories (A could affect one's understanding of the nature of reality, which might indirectly impact their ethics, but this is less specific to the cause of ethical skepticism than epistemological confusion. Confused religious views (C might influence ethical beliefs, but do not directly cause skepticism about the possibility of moral knowledge. Lastly, confused scientific theories, D, might affect how one understands the world, but they are not typically the source of ethical skepticism."
