Among the options provided, option C, \"tend to overestimate the chance that they will be the perpetrators of violence,\" is one of the more common findings. This is because exposure to violent media has been linked with desensitization to violence, increased aggression, and sometimes an increase in aggressive thoughts or behaviors. In some cases, this might include an overestimation of the likelihood of engaging in violent acts themselves.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the relationship between watching violent TV shows and violent behavior/perception can be complex and may depend on various factors such as the individual's pre-existing attitudes, their interpretation of the media, and other environmental influences. Therefore, while option C is a recognized possibility based on some studies, it's also crucial to consider that the impact of violent media on individuals can vary widely."
