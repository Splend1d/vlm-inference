He had to go to court to ask the court to compel the adjacent landowner to give him an easement of necessity for ingress and egress to the highway. The court granted the easement of necessity to Landowner. Over a decade later, another access route to the highway opened up through public improvements. The adjacent landowner sued to stop Landowner from continuing to use his land for ingress and egress. What will the court most likely rule in this case?\n\nA. The holder of the easement has a right to insist on its uninterrupted continuance.\nB. The easement continues because its purpose of access to the property still exists.\nC. The easement is terminated because it cannot exceed five years in length, without being formally renewed by both parties.\nD. The equities favor the termination of the easement where another route is available.\n"

The equities favor the termination of the easement where another route is available.\n\nAn easement of necessity is a legal right granted to a property owner to use another person's land for access when there is no other practical means to reach a public road or property. The duration of an easement of necessity generally depends on the circumstances of the case, but it can last indefinitely if the need for access remains.\n\nIn the scenario presented, over a decade has passed since the original easement was granted, and a new access route to the highway has been made available through public improvements. This development may indicate that the original purpose for which the easement was created\u2014the lack of alternative access routes\u2014has changed. In such a situation, courts typically consider whether the continuation of the easement would be equitable, balancing the interests of both parties.\n\nGiven that the easement was granted specifically for access to the property, once a new access route becomes available, the court might determine that the continuation of the easement would not serve its purpose anymore. Moreover, allowing the easement to remain in place could potentially restrict the rights of the adjacent landowner or lead to inefficient use of land resources. Therefore, the court is likely to rule in favor of terminating the easement based on the availability of the new access route and the principles of equity, ensuring fair treatment of all parties involved."
