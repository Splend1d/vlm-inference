The driver allegedly hit another car in a parking lot and drove away without leaving proper insurance and contact information. A bystander wrote down her license plate number and called the police. At trial, the driver proposes to testify that the day after the accident, she met with the police officer investigating the accident, and told him that she did not leave until after she had inspected both cars and determined there was no damage. The bystander is not available to testify at trial. The driver's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because it is the statement of the witness herself, who is subject to cross-examination.\nB. admissible, because it is a statement based on firsthand knowledge.\nC. inadmissible, because the bystander is unavailable and, therefore, cannot contradict the driver.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

She can be cross-examined by the opposing party to test the credibility of her account. However, the lack of the bystander's testimony means that the other side cannot directly challenge the driver's version of events through that witness."
