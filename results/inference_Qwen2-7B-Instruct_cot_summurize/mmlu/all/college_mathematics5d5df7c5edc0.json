Closedness\nA set \\(S\\) is closed if it contains all its limit points. Consider any sequence of points \\((x_n, y_n)\\) in \\(S\\) that converges to a point \\((x, y)\\). If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) were both rational, then since the rationals are dense in the reals, there would exist a subsequence of \\((x_n, y_n)\\) that converges to a point with both irrational coordinates, contradicting our assumption that all points in the sequence have at least one irrational coordinate. Therefore, either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\), or both, must be irrational, meaning \\((x, y) \\in S\\). Hence, \\(S\\) contains all its limit points and is closed.\n\n### B. Openness\nFor \\(S\\) to be open, every point in \\(S\\) must have an open neighborhood contained entirely within \\(S\\). However, consider a point \\((x, y) \\in S\\) where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are irrational. Any open ball around \\((x, y)\\) will contain points with rational coordinates because between any two real numbers, there exists a rational number. Thus, not every point in \\(S\\) has an open neighborhood contained in \\(S\\), so \\(S\\) is not open.\n\n### C. Connectedness\nA set is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two nonempty separated sets (sets that are disjoint and whose closures do not intersect. Assume for contradiction that \\(S\\) can be split into two nonempty open sets \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) such that \\(S = U \\cup V\\). Since \\(s\\) contains all points in the unit square with at least one irrational coordinate, any partition would require \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) to separate the irrational coordinates from the rational ones. However, this separation would imply that there exists a rational point in the closure of \\(U\\) and an irrational point in the closure of \\(V\\) ( or vice versa, contradicting the fact that the boundary of \\(s\\) is itself, as it includes all points with at least one irrational coordinate. Hence, \\(s\\) is connected.\n\n### D. Total Disconnectedness\nA set is totally disconnected if its only connected subsets are the singleton sets. As we've established \\(s\\) is connected, it cannot be totally disconnected.\n\nIn summary:\n- **A. Closed** - Correct\n- **B. Open** - Incorrect\n- **C. Connected** - Correct\n- **D. Totally Disconnected** - Incorrect\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. Closed** and **C. Connected**."
