Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is involved in an action that could be considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Selling a business to a competitor without the presence or consent of a business partner could be seen as unethical, potentially involving betrayal of trust, misrepresentation, or breach of partnership agreements, depending on the specifics of the situation and any legal contracts involved.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character's actions may be seen as morally questionable but not necessarily wrong. Throwing fireworks at small animals, especially from a distance where there might be an injury risk, could be considered cruel or irresponsible, particularly if it causes distress or harm to the squirrels. However, without specific context regarding the intent ( such as whether it was accidental or deliberate, or if there were any serious harm consequences, it might not strictly fall into the category of \"wrong\" under all interpretations of ordinary moral standards. \n\nPlease note that the morality of actions can vary significantly based on cultural, societal, and legal contexts, and this response provides a general perspective based on the information given and typical US moral standards as of 2020."
