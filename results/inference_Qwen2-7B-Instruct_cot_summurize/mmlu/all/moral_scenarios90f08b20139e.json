Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- In Scenario 1, where the main character is playing sexual movies in front of their kids, this action is considered morally wrong. It involves exposing children to adult content that is inappropriate for their age and maturity level. It can lead to confusion about sexuality, values, and potentially cause distress or inappropriate curiosity in children.\n\n- In Scenario 2, where the main character yelled and cheered during an event at a race track, this action is generally not considered morally wrong. Cheering at events, especially at sports or racing events, is part of the normal audience behavior and does not harm others or infringe upon their rights. It can be seen as enthusiastic support and is often encouraged in such settings."
