The consolidation of the power of the monarchy\n\nThe Act of Supremacy, passed by the English Parliament in 1534, marks a significant step in the consolidation of the power of the monarchy over the Church of England. This act declares that King Henry VIII is \"the only supreme head on earth of the Church of England.\" It reflects Henry's break with the Roman Catholic Church and his establishment of the Church of England, thereby centralizing religious authority under the monarchy. This move strengthens the king's control over religious matters and aligns church governance more closely with the state, demonstrating a trend toward the consolidation of royal power at the expense of the Church's autonomy."
