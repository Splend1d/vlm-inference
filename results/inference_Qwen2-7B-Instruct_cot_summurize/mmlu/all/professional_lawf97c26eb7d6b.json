The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?\n\nA. No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.\nB. Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\nC. No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.\nD. Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.\n"

Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 803(6), business records are generally admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule if they are (1) made in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business; (2) as a regular practice of that activity; and (3) by a person with knowledge of the event or by someone authorized by the business. However, this rule also states that the declarant must be available for cross-examination unless unavailable through no fault of the proponent. \n\nIn the scenario provided, the prosecution attempted to offer the bank's daily deposit and tally records into evidence without any testimony from a certified bank custodian or officer who would have been able to authenticate these records under oath. This action directly contradicts the requirements set forth in Rule 803(6). Therefore, the court is likely to rule the evidence inadmissible until such a witness can authenticate the records, as defense counsel correctly objected on the basis of hearsay."
