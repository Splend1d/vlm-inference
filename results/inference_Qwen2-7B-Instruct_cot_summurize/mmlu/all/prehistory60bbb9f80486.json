The Altamira cave context might refer to prehistoric art, not necessarily the use of plants.\n\nOption B mentions the presence of plant materials like flowers in Aurignacian burials, which could suggest symbolic or ritual uses of plants rather than practical applications.\n\nOption C describes plant material lining the floor of Sibudu Cave, which could imply uses such as bedding or insulation, but again, it does not necessarily denote \"new uses\" in the context of human development and innovation with plant resources.\n\nTherefore, option D best represents an example of new uses for plants during the Middle Stone Age, showcasing their utilization in tool-making and potentially other practical applications."
