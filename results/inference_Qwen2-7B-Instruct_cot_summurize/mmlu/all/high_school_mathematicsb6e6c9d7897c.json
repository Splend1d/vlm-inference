This means that for any value of \\( x \\), you can compute \\( \\sin(x) \\) or \\( 3\\sin(2x) \\). Therefore, changing the function from \\( \\sin(x) \\) to \\( 3\\sin(2x) \\) does **not** change the domain.\n\n**Range:**\n- For \\( \\sin(x) \\), the range is \\([-1, 1]\\).\n- When you have \\( 3\\sin(2x) \\), you're scaling the original sine function by 3, which triples the range. This means the new range is \\([-3, 3]\\).\n\n**Frequency and Period:**\n- The \\( 3\\sin(2x) \\) introduces a factor of 2 inside the sine function, which effectively doubles the frequency of the sine wave. However, this doubling of frequency does not affect the domain, only how often the function repeats within a given interval.\n\n**Summary:**\nThus, the correct answer is **B. Domain is double; range remains the same**. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in interpreting \"domain is double\" as it relates to the period rather than the domain itself. The correct interpretation considering the context should focus on the fact that the period is halved ( not the domain being doubled. The domain remains unchanged, and the range is tripled due to the coefficient outside the sine function. There might have been an error in the options provided or in the interpretation of the question's intent regarding the domain's description."
