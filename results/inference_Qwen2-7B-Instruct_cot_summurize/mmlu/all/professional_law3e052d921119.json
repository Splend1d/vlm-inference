Sally has an adult conviction for vehicular homicide. She was charged with driving a car in a reckless manner resulting in the death of her sister, a passenger in the car. Sally pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty and received a suspended sentence although she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years. At trial, evidence of this conviction is\n\nA. admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.\nB. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.\nC. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.\nD. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.\n"

This is allowed as long as the conviction is substantially similar to the crime the witness is being testifying about. In this case, since Sally was convicted of vehicular homicide which carries a maximum penalty exceeding one year, the conviction can be used to impeach her credibility at trial. The nature of the crime, the maximum possible sentence, and the fact that she pleaded nolo contendere (essentially admitting to the crime for purposes of the plea bargain, all make this conviction relevant for impeachment purposes."
