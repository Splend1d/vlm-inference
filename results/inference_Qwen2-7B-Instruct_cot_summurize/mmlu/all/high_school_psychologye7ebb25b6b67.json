It includes areas such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. The amygdala processes emotions, particularly fear and aggression, while the hippocampus is involved in memory formation and spatial navigation. The hypothalamus regulates various bodily functions, including emotions and stress responses."
