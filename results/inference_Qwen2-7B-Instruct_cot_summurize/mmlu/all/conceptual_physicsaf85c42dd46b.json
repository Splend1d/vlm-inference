The gravitational force acts towards the center of Earth, while the centripetal force acts perpendicular to the direction of motion, always directed towards the center of the circular path. \n\nTo maintain a stable orbit, these two forces must be equal. This balance allows the satellite to move in a continuous, repeating path around Earth without falling into it (due to gravity's pull) or flying off into space (because of its forward velocity). \n\nThis concept can be described by Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation. The gravitational force keeps the satellite close to Earth, while the satellite's velocity (which has both a tangential component that keeps it moving forward and a vertical component that counteracts Earth's gravity) ensures it doesn't crash into the planet or escape into deep space."
