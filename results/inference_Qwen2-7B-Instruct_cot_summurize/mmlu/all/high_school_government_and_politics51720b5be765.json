The court helps set the public agenda by deciding which appeals to hear.\n\nExplanation:\n- A is incorrect because not every case appealed to the Supreme Court is ruled upon; the Court only hears a select number of cases each term due to its docket constraints and the fact that it can choose which cases to review based on their significance and legal issues.\n- B is correct because the Supreme Court does indeed play a role in setting the public agenda. It decides which cases to hear, which often reflects the Court's priorities and the importance of the legal questions at hand. This decision-making process can influence public discourse and policy.\n- C is incorrect because the Supreme Court does not automatically hear all cases where two or more justices agree they have merit. Instead, the Court selects cases for review through a process called \"certiorari\" ( where petitions from lower courts are are considered, and the Court decides which ones to take up based on various factors including the importance of the legal question and the need for a ruling.\n- D is incorrect because the chief justice's vote counts as one vote like any other justice's. There is no provision in the Constitution or Court rules that grants the chief justice additional voting power."
