True, True\n\nExplanation:\n\nStatement 1: In a Bayesian network, the inference results of the junction tree algorithm are the same as the inference results of variable elimination.\nThis statement is true. Both the junction tree algorithm and variable elimination are methods used to perform inference (i.e., calculate posterior probabilities given evidence) in Bayesian networks. They both aim to compute the same result but may do so through different computational graphs or structures. However, under the right conditions and with appropriate optimizations, they should yield equivalent results.\n\nStatement 2: If two random variables X and Y are conditionally independent given another random variable Z, then in the corresponding Bayesian network, the nodes for X and Y are d-separated given Z.\nThis statement is also true. In Bayesian networks, two nodes X and Y are said to be d-separated given a set of nodes Z if there exists no active path between them when conditioning on Z. An active path is one where all directed paths have an arrow pointing into the node, and any undirected paths are split by a collider that is not conditioned upon. If X and Y are conditionally independent given Z, it means that knowing Z, additional information about X does not provide any additional information about Y beyond what is already provided by Z. This is precisely what d-separation captures in Bayesian networks, making the statement true."
