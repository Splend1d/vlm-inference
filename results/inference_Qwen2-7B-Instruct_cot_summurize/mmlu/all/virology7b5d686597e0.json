The term \"urban\" here does not refer to a specific strain or mutation of the virus, but rather to how the virus circulates in settings where there is high human population density, often with conditions that facilitate mosquito breeding.\n\nThe correct answer would be closest to option A: \"Part of a cycle of mosquitoes biting humans in cities.\" In urban areas, yellow fever can spread through the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which is also responsible for transmitting Zika virus and dengue fever. These mosquitoes breed in small containers of water such as flower pots, discarded tires, and other artificial containers found in urban settings. When these mosquitoes bite humans, they can transmit the yellow fever virus.\n\nIt's important to note that while the term \"urban yellow fever\" doesn't denote a separate entity or mutation of the virus, it emphasizes the unique challenges and dynamics of controlling yellow fever outbreaks in densely populated urban areas, compared to rural or forested areas where the disease is more traditionally prevalent."
