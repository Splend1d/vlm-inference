Hysterotomy\n\nHysterotomy, also known as a cesarean section on the uterus ( is a surgical abortion procedure that involves making an incision in the abdomen and uterus to access the uterus for the purpose of terminating a pregnancy. It is typically used when other methods of abortion are have failed or are not feasible.\n\nThis method is usually reserved for pregnancies that have passed 20 weeks and is significantly more invasive than other forms of abortion, such as medical abortions or vacuum aspiration. As it's a surgical procedure, it has a higher risk of complications compared to other abortion methods, including infection, bleeding, and organ damage.\n\nRegarding cost, hysterotomy is generally more expensive than other abortion procedures because it involves surgery and the associated costs of hospitalization, anesthesia, and recovery time. The cost can range from several thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars depending on the location, hospital, and insurance coverage. \n\nPlease note that the safety and appropriateness of any abortion procedure should be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual circumstances. It is important to seek advice from qualified medical practitioners about the risks and benefits of different procedures."
