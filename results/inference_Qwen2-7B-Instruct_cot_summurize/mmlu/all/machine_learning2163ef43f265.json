Thus,\n$$\\lVert Xw - y \\rVert_2^2 = ( (Xw - y)^\\top (Xw - y)$$\nTaking the derivative with respect to $w$ gives us:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w} \\left( (Xw - y)^\\top(Xw - y)\\right) = X^\\top(Xw - y)$$\nThis follows from the product rule and the fact that the derivative of $w^\\top A$ with respect to $w$ is $A$, where $A$ is some matrix.\n\n### Derivative of $\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\lVert w \\rVert_2^2$\n\nSimilarly, for the second term,\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma w^\\top w\\right) = \\gamma w$$\n\n### Combining both derivatives\n\nNow, combining these two derivatives to get the full gradient, we have:\n$$\\nabla_w f(w) = X^\\top(Xw - y) + \\gamma w$$\n\nNotice that in the question, the term $\\gamma$ was mistakenly referred to as $\\lambda$. Assuming this was a typographical error and the intention was to use $\\gamma$ consistently, the correct gradient is:\n\n$$\\nabla_w f(w) = X^\\top(Xw - y) + \\gamma w$$\n\nComparing this with the options provided, none of them directly match this result exactly. However, if we interpret the question correctly by understanding that $\\gamma$ should be used consistently throughout and considering the options given, option C is closest to the correct answer if we interpret the intent behind the options despite the discrepancy in the notation:\n\n**Corrected Option (C**: $\\nabla_w f(w) = X^\\top X w - X^\\top y + \\gamma w$\n\nThis matches the derived gradient when considering the correct interpretation of the terms and the intended meaning behind the options."
