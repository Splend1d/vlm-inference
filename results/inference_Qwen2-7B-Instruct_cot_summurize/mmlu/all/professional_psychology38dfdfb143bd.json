The explanation given by the psychologist alignss with psychodynamic theory's focus on unconscious motivations and conflicts, including the role of past experiences and the dynamics of power and control in human behavior. \n\nPsychodynamic theory suggests that behaviors, including misbehaviors, may stem from underlying psychological drives, conflicts, or emotional needs that individuals might not be consciously aware of. It also addresses how these internal dynamics can manifest in various forms of behavior, such as seeking attention, asserting power, or engaging in revenge-like actions.\n\nIn contrast, options A ( Rogerian, B: Transactional analysis, and C: Adlerian, do not specifically emphasize the unconscious motivations and conflicts in the way that psychodynamic theory does."
