The minimal polynomial is the monic polynomial of least degree that has \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) as a root and coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nThe polynomial \\( x^2 - 2 \\) has \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) as a root, and it is monic (with integer coefficients, hence it satisfies these requirements. Moreover, it is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), which means that it cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree with rational coefficients. This can be shown using Eisenstein's criterion with \\( p = 2 \\), or simply by noting that if it were reducible, one of its factors would have to be linear, implying that \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is rational, which is not the case.\n\nSince the degree of the minimal polynomial is 2, the degree of the field extension \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is also 2."
