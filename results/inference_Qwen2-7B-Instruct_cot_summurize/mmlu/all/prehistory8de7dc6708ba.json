Some resource-rich environments allow for the creation of surpluses that can lead to economic inequalities and social complexity.\n\nThis option correctly identifies that certain environments, whether resource-rich or not, can lead to the accumulation of surplus food, which has historically been a key factor in fostering economic inequalities and contributing to social complexity. This can occur through various means, such as agriculture, hunting, gathering, or trade, and does not necessarily depend solely on agriculture or be exclusive to agricultural societies. The surplus food allowed for some individuals or groups to accumulate wealth or power, which in turn influenced social structures and hierarchies."
