All of the above were among the causes.\n\nThe food-price spike of 2007-2008 was influenced by a combination of factors, including:\n\nA. **Long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development**: Over time, investments in agriculture and rural areas declined, leading to reduced productivity, poor infrastructure, and an inability to meet increasing demand for food. This neglect exacerbated the situation when global demand for food increased due to population growth and rising incomes in developing countries.\n\nB. **Use of food crops to produce biofuel**: The growing global demand for biofuels, particularly from corn and soybeans, diverted significant amounts of these crops away from food production to fuel production. This led to higher prices for these commodities, which in turn affected the prices of other food products that share similar supply chains or compete for resources like land and water.\n\nC. **Commodity price speculation**: Speculation in financial markets, driven by investors looking for high returns, also played a role in the spike. Commodities such as grains, oilseeds, and sugar became attractive assets, leading to speculative buying that drove up prices beyond their fundamental value based on supply and demand.\n\nThese factors combined to create a perfect storm that led to significant increases in global food prices, affecting millions of people worldwide who rely on affordable food for survival."
