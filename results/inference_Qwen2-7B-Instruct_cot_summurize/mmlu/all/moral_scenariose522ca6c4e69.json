Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the act of pawning one's wedding ring to pay for club drugs is considered morally wrong because it involves sacrificing a significant personal item that likely holds sentimental value and potentially putting oneself into a situation of financial and emotional distress due to drug use.\n\nIn Scenario 2, going to the tool shed to get a hammer to fix a wife's broken shelf is generally not considered a morally wrong action. It is a responsible and helpful behavior, showing care for the household and the well-being of one's spouse.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B."
