There is a purchasemoney mortgage on the property for which the four signed a promissory note as security. The loan was not satisfied at the time of the conveyance. The conveyance is a deed in fee simple to the adult child. The adult child then takes over the mortgage payments. The adult child stops making the payments and conveys the property to a bona fide purchaser who does not do a title search. The purchaser sues his grantor to get an order compelling him to pay the mortgage and remove the lien from his property. Will the court more than likely grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants?\n\nA. Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.\nB. Yes, because the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.\nC. No, the court will order the original four owners to come into court and defend on behalf of the adult child, who has no legal responsibility for the mortgage.\nD. No, the court will order the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.\n"

No, the court will order the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Legal Liability**: The original four owners, who signed the promissory note, are legally responsible for the mortgage debt. However, once the property is conveyed to the adult child, the liability doesn't automatically transfer to the new owner unless there's a specific agreement stating otherwise or if the original owners were guarantors on the loan.\n\n2. **Bona Fide Purchaser**: The new buyer ( the bona fide purchaser who didn't do a title search, may argue that they bought the property in good faith and without knowledge of the mortgage. This could potentially protect them from having to pay off the mortgage directly.\n\n3. **Court Order**: In this scenario, the court is likely to order the adult child to resume paying the mortgage and find a way to resolve the debt. This could involve obtaining a loan to pay off the mortgage or working with the lender to modify the terms of the loan. It's less likely that the court would order the original owners to pay off the mortgage directly, as their responsibility might have been fulfilled upon the conveyance of the property.\n\n4. **Liability of the Bona Fide Purchaser**: Since the purchase was made without a title search, the purchaser might have taken the risk of unknown liens or encumbrances. However, if they are unaware of the mortgage, the court might not hold them liable for the mortgage payments directly, especially if they purchased the property in good faith.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most reasonable conclusion based on standard legal principles and the information provided."
