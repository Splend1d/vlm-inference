The mass number (the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus of this atom is 20 (since Neon-20 had 20 nucleons (10 protons + 10 neutrons). So removing 2 protons also removes 2 neutrons (leaving 8 neutrons), leaving us with Oxygen-20. However, since there is no Oxygen-20, the closest option given is Oxygen-20, which is more accurately represented as Magnesium-20 given the options provided and the nature of the question. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the provided choices is B. Magnesium-20."
