Among the options provided, one less obvious reason for the Inca to fight so many wars could be related to option C: to kill off a certain percentage of the young male population, thus preventing revolution.\n\nIn pre-Columbian societies, including those of the Andean region, it was common for rulers to engage in rituals or practices that involved the sacrifice of individuals, often young males, to appease deities or ensure the continuation of prosperity and fertility. This practice was not unique to the Inca but was part of a broader set of beliefs held by many indigenous cultures in the Americas. The sacrifice of young men might have been seen as a way to prevent potential uprisings or rebellions, as it would remove potential leaders and warriors from the population, thereby stabilizing the society under the rule of the existing leadership. However, this is a complex topic, and the motivations behind such practices were likely multifaceted and deeply intertwined with religious, social, and political factors."
