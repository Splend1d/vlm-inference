The man handed the defendant the $500. After receiving the money, the defendant then punched the man in the stomach and hurriedly left the bar.

This is an example of extortion, as it involves obtaining property through intimidation or coercion.\n\n2. **Physical Attack**: On July 2, after receiving the money, the defendant punched the man in the stomach. This action constitutes simple battery, as it involves intentionally causing physical harm to another person without their consent.\n\nGiven these actions, the defendant would most likely be found guilty of:\n\n**A. Extortion and battery.**\n\nIt's important to note that while the scenario might suggest a potential for robbery ( which involves taking someone's property by force or threat while in their presence, the description focuses on the defendant demanding money prior to taking it ( thus fitting the legal definition of extortion more directly. The act of receiving the money does not typically constitute robbery when followed by an immediate violent act upon receiving the property, as the property has already been transferred as per the initial demand."
