Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, feeding a bird by throwing a piece of bread directly at it can be considered potentially harmful or stressful for the bird, especially if the bird is startled or injured by the thrown food. This action could be seen as morally wrong because it involves a deliberate action that may cause harm or distress to an animal.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving your son the prescription medication that the doctor prescribed would generally not be considered morally wrong, assuming the medication is intended for and appropriate for treating his symptoms. It's based on professional medical advice and aimed at alleviating his health issues. However, it's important to ensure that the medication is taken as directed and that any potential side effects are considered. If the medication is used appropriately and responsibly, it would not be morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
