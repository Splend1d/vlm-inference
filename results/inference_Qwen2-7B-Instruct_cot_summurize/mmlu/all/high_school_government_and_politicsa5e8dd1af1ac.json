The president is in the final two years of their second term: Presidents often see a decline in their ability to push through legislation and executive actions as they near the end of their term. This is partly due to the anticipation of a new administration taking over and the desire for the new president to establish their own policies priorities.\n\nIII. Different parties control Congress and the White House: When the president's party does not have majorities in both chambers of Congress, it can significantly limit the president's ability to enact legislative proposals and can lead to gridlock. This situation can make it difficult for the president to implement policy changes or pass laws that require congressional approval."
