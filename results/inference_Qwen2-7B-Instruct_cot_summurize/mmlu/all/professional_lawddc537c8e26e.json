His neighbor wants to buy it so he can make his yard bigger and use the structure as a storage space, so he agrees to buy the bungalow in a written agreement. The sale is to be complete on October 14. On October 10, the neighbor realizes he cannot pay $10,000, and offers to pay $8,000 instead. The man agrees, and the exchange takes place on October 14. The man then sues for the remaining $2000. Would he likely prevail in getting the additional $2,000 that is part of the signed contract?\n\nA. No, the modification of the sales price was accepted and therefore both parties are bound to the $8000 price.\nB. Yes, there was a lack of additional consideration under the pre-existing duty rule so that the modification was invalid and the original price was still valid.\nC. No the original contract was a unilateral contract that could not be modified and had to be performed at the original price.\nD. No, there was full performance of the contract.\n"

No, the modification of the sales price was accepted and therefore both parties are bound to the $8000 price.\n\nIn this scenario, the sale agreement was initially made at a price of $10,000. After the agreement was reached, but before the actual transaction took place, the buyer decided to change their mind and offer only $8,000. The seller agreed to this new offer and completed the sale at the reduced price on October 14. Since both parties agreed to the new price, the contract was effectively modified, and they were bound by the terms of this new agreement. The seller's subsequent lawsuit to enforce the original price would not likely prevail in court because the modification was accepted by both parties."
