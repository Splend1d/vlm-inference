Instead, they generally receive rational basis review, which requires the government to show only that the regulation is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. In contrast, strict scrutiny applies when a law discriminates on the basis of race, national origin, alienage, or gender, and privacy cases can also sometimes trigger strict scrutiny depending on the nature of the privacy interest involved."
