This perspective sees virtues as being dependent on cultural norms and individual perspectives, rather than having objective universal standards. However, it's important to note that Nussbaum herself advocates for a robust form of virtue ethics that she believes can transcend cultural relativism and offer a universal framework for moral reasoning."
