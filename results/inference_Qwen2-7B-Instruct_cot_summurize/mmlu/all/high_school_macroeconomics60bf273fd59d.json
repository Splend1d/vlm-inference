Both the price level and real GDP rise.\n\nWhen both the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) and aggregate demand (AD) increase, it typically leads to an expansion in the economy's output capacity and a higher level of spending. This scenario results in an outward shift of both the SRAS curve and the AD curve, leading to a new equilibrium point at a higher price level and higher real GDP. \n\nTo clarify why other options are incorrect:\n- Option A suggests that real GDP falls, which contradicts the premise that aggregate demand has increased, implying more production.\n- Option C indicates uncertainty regarding the change in real GDP, but given the simultaneous increase in demand and supply, the real GDP is expected to rise.\n- Option D suggests that real GDP rises with uncertainty about the price level, which is not consistent with the typical outcome when both demand and supply increase; the price level would also rise due to the higher aggregate demand pushing up prices."
