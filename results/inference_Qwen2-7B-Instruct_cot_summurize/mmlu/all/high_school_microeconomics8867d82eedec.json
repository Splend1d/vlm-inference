Economic Costs = Explicit Costs plus Implicit Costs.\n\nIn economics, accounting profit is calculated by subtracting explicit costs ( (costs with a cash outlay) from total revenue, while economic profit takes into account both explicit and implicit costs. Explicit costs are direct payments to external parties for resources used in production, while implicit costs represent the opportunity cost of using resources owned by the firm, such as the owner's time or property.\n\nEconomic profit = Revenue - Explicit Costs - Implicit Costs\n\nOpportunity costs are not equal to economic profits; they refer to the value of the next best alternative that was not taken. \n\nA. Economic Profits \u2260 Accounting Profits. Economic profit includes opportunity costs, whereas accounting profit does not.\n\nD. Opportunity Costs \u2260 Economic Profits. Opportunity costs are part of the calculation for economic profit but are not equivalent to it."
