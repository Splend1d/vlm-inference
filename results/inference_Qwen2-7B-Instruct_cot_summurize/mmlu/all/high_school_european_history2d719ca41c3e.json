Instead, it focuses on issues related to the legal system and social inequality. Therefore, options A (Financial problems caused by debts and low revenues. and C. The proliferation of Enlightenment ideals. are not problems explicitly mentioned in the context provided.\n\nGiven the nature of the document, which seems to outline proposed reforms related to the legal system and governance in France during the late 18th century, the focus is on addressing perceived injustices in the legal system and the need for a more equitable society, rather than directly referencing financial crises or the spread of Enlightenment ideas as causes of the French Revolution.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the French Revolution was influenced by a complex mix of factors including economic instability, social inequality, and the impact of Enlightenment ideas. The document itself might not have been written with the intention to list all contributing causes of the revolution, but rather to propose solutions to specific issues within the French legal and governmental structures at the time. Thus, while the document does not explicitly call out financial problems or the proliferation of Enlightenment ideals as problems, these were indeed significant factors in the broader context leading up to the revolution."
