She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her \"drop attacks?\"\n\nA. Adrenal insufficiency\nB. Anxiety\nC. Atlanto-axial instability\nD. Cardiac arrhythmia\n"

These characteristics are more indicative of a peripheral or central nervous system issue rather than a cardiac or adrenal problem. \n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Adrenal insufficiency would typically present with symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, low blood pressure, and low sodium levels, but not specifically with episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in the legs.\n\nB. Anxiety can cause symptoms like dizziness and fainting, but it does not typically involve physical symptoms like loss of feeling or incontinence.\n\nC. Atlanto-axial instability refers to a condition where there's a lack of stability between the first cervical vertebra (atlas) and the second cervical vertebra (axis), which could potentially lead to neurological symptoms due to compression of the spinal cord or nerves. However, this condition would typically manifest with neck pain, stiffness, and possible neurological deficits, not specifically as described.\n\nD. Cardiac arrhythmia can indeed cause symptoms such as fainting or syncope, but these episodes usually have a rapid onset and offset and are are not typically associated with loss of sensation or incontinence.\n\nGiven the context, the most likely cause of her \"drop attacks\" is **C. Atlanto-axial instability**, considering the description of weakness, loss of feeling, and incontinence, which are could be related to compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots at the neck level. However, without further clinical examination or imaging, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made."
