If the nonaudit services have revenues in aggregate of less than 5% of the total revenues paid by the issuer to the auditor during the fiscal year in which the nonaudit services are provided, this is generally acceptable.\nB.

If the issuer did not recognize the service as a nonaudit service at the time of the engagement, it might still be acceptable depending on other factors and the circumstances.\n\nHowever, providing financial information systems design and implementation services would typically require more scrutiny and may not be allowed without impairing independence or obtaining proper preapproval from the audit committee. This is because such services could potentially influence the auditor's objectivity and independence when auditing the same entity."
