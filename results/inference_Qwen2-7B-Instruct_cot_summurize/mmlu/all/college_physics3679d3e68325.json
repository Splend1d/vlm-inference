For a neutral nitrogen atom, which has 7 electrons, there are are two possibilities for the spin configurations:\n\n1. **All electrons with spin up (\u2191** ( or all electrons with spin down **\u2193**.\n   \n   This would result in a total spin quantum number \\(S\\) of:\n   \\[ S = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\] \n   or\n   \\[ S = -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = -1 \\]\n   \n   Since we're considering the ground state, the total spin quantum number is typically \\(S = 0\\) to minimize the spin-orbit interaction energy. Therefore, the electrons would be arranged so that half have spin up and half have spin down.\n\n2. **Alternating spins** : one electron with spin up **\u2191** and another with spin down **\u2193**.\n\n   This results in a net total spin quantum number \\(S = 0\\).\n\nGiven these possibilities, the correct answer would be **B. 1**, if assuming all electrons have the same spin configuration (either all up or all down, which is not the case in the ground state. However, based on the typical ground state electron configuration, where the spins are arranged to minimize the system's energy, the correct answer is actually **S = 0**. None of the provided options directly matches this explanation. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question's options or the interpretation thereof. The most accurate choice given the options and context of the question as presented would be **B. 1**, assuming a misinterpretation of the possible total spin states and focusing on the highest possible value among the choices, though it does not fully align with standard atomic physics principles regarding ground state electron configurations."
