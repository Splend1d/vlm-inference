In addition to leaves, he also blew large amounts of pest-infested plant debris onto the neighbor's property. The material has accumulated into large, unsightly piles and caused damage to the neighbor's healthy plants. He has to pay workers to haul the material away and he incurs expenses to replace infected perennials. The neighbor sues for the tort of trespass. The homeowner files a motion to dismiss because the neighbor cannot prove that homeowner acted with an intent to trespass or to do harm. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. No, because the infected debris constituted an abnormally dangerous condition and homeowner could be held strictly liable for the trespass.\nB. No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.\nC. Yes, because the homeowner had no practical way of controlling where the material went and he acted without malice or ill will.\nD. Yes, because the homeowner expected the wind to carry the debris away and did not think that it would accumulate on the neighbor's property.\n"

No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.\n\nIn this scenario, the homeowner's actions of blowing leaves and plant debris onto the neighbor's property can indeed be considered an act of trespass. Trespass can occur even if the intention was not to cause harm specifically but simply to utilize the leaf blower in an uncontrolled manner. The fact that the debris included pest-infested plant material that caused damage to the neighbor's property indicates that the act resulted in harm. Therefore, the homeowner may be liable for trespass regardless of whether they intended to cause harm or not."
