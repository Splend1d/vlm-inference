She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She has not had chest pain. Her pulse is 96/min and regular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 15 cm H2O. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. Measurement of serum troponin I concentration\nB. ECG\nC. Exercise stress test\nD. Echocardiography\n"

Echocardiography\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings (painless swelling of both ankles, shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down, crackles at both lung bases, a soft S3, a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles, are highly suggestive of heart failure. The presence of pulmonary congestion and ankle edema typically indicate left-sided heart failure, which can be further evaluated with echocardiography. This non-invasive imaging modality can assess cardiac function, measure ejection fraction, evaluate the structure of the heart chambers, and look for signs of valve disease or other cardiac abnormalities that might contribute to heart failure. \n\nMeasurement of serum troponin I concentration (A) would be more indicative of acute myocardial injury rather than chronic heart failure.\n\nAn ECG (B) can show changes indicative of heart disease but is less specific for diagnosing heart failure compared to echocardiography.\n\nAn exercise stress test C) might help in evaluating the patient's capacity for physical activity and could indirectly suggest heart function, but it is not as definitive as echocardiography for assessing cardiac structure and function.\n\nTherefore, echocardiography is the most appropriate choice for confirming the diagnosis of heart failure in this case."
