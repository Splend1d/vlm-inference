One week ago, she was treated in the emergency department after she accidentally spilled hot grease on her left leg while working at a fast-food restaurant. Examination of the left lower extremity shows a 7-cm, pink, soft, granular, edematous wound. The formation of this tissue was most likely caused by increased activity of which of the following?\n\nA. Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1\nB. P-selectin\nC. Stromelysin\nD. Vascular endothelial growth factor\n"

                    "text": "The tissue formation described in the patient's wound is most likely caused by increased activity of C. stromelysin.\n\nStromelysins are are a group of matrix metalloproteinases ( (MMPs), specifically MMP-2 and MMP-3. These enzymes play a significant role in wound healing by degrading the extracellular matrix and promoting the migration of cells into the wound area. They help in the process of angiogenesis, inflammation resolution, and tissue remodeling during the healing process.\n\nGlycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 ( (CD151) is involved in cell-cell interactions and may contribute to wound healing indirectly by facilitating cell migration.\n\nP-selectin is a cell surface glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the initial stages of inflammation by allowing the adhesion of leukocytes to the vessel wall. It does not directly participate in the wound healing process but is involved in the inflammatory response following injury.\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor ( (VEGF) stimulates the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), which is an essential part of the wound healing process. However, it does not directly promote the formation of granulation tissue as stromelysins do.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, stromelysin is the most likely answer based on its role in the wound healing process."
