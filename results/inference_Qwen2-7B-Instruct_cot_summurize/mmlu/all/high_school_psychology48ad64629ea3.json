These responses are part of the body's fight or flight response to perceived threats or stressors.\n\nHowever, if you're asking for an option that does not typically characterize physiological arousal, there might be some confusion in the question because all the options provided do describe typical responses during arousal. However, in a broader context, things like a decrease in heart rate or blood pressure could not be considered characteristic of physiological arousal, as these would actually indicate a state of relaxation or calmness rather than arousal."
