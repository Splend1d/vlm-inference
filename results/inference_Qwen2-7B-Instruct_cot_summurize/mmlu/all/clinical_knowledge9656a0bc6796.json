                    "text": "C. Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice.\n\nJaundice is a condition that occurs when bilirubin, a yellowish pigment produced during the breakdown of old red blood cells, accumulates in the body because it cannot be processed normally by the liver. There are several types of jaundice, each with different causes:\n\n1. **Hemolytic Jaundice**: This type of jaundice occurs when there is excessive breakdown (hemolysis) of red blood cells. Symptoms can include pale stools (since bile flow is reduced due to the liver's workload, leading to less pigmentation in the stool), but dark urine is not typically associated with hemolytic jaundice alone. The presence of pale stools might suggest other conditions rather than hemolytic jaundice specifically.\n\n2. **Hepatocellular Jaundice**: This type results from direct liver damage or disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis. The liver has difficulty processing bilirubin, leading to accumulation in the bloodstream. In this case, both pale stools and dark urine might be seen, depending on the extent of liver dysfunction.\n\n3. **Obstructive Jaundice**: This occurs when there is a blockage (obstruction) in the bile ducts, preventing the normal flow of bile out of the liver. This can lead to symptoms including itching, as the body tries to compensate for the lack of bile in the intestines by producing more bile salts, which can irritate the skin and cause pruritus.\n\n4. **Infectious Causes**: Certain infections can lead to jaundice, including viral hepatitis, and these can present with various symptoms depending on the specific cause.\n\nRegarding the options provided:\n\n- **A** is partially correct but misleading. Pale stools can indeed be a sign of hemolytic jaundice, but dark urine is not typically associated with it alone.\n  \n- **B** is incorrect. Bilirubin is not used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells. Instead, it is involved in the metabolism of heme (the protein structure found in red blood cells, among other functions.\n\n- **C** is correct. Itching is indeed a common symptom of obstructive jaundice, occurring when bile is backed up in the liver and cannot flow freely into the intestines, leading to its reabsorption into the bloodstream and causing irritation.\n\n- **D** is incorrect. Placing a \"danger of infection\" sticker on blood samples from an individual with jaundice is not optional; it is crucial for infection control practices in healthcare settings, especially if the patient is an intravenous drug user, as they may have a higher risk of bloodborne pathogens."
