It is not merely descriptive of an object's properties, but rather evaluative, expressing a speaker's attitude or evaluation towards something. Therefore, when we say something is \"good,\" we are making a statement that carries a certain value judgment or approval.\n\nOption A ( descriptive use refers to describing the nature or characteristics of something without any judgment.\nOption B, constructive use, typically refers to building or creating something, which doesn't directly relate to the emotive or evaluative meaning of \"good.\"\nOption C, dynamic use, generally implies actions or processes, again not fitting the emotive or evaluative context of \"good.\"\n\nSo, Stevenson would argue that \"good\" is primarily used in a propositional sense to express judgments or evaluations."
