The key reason why he had the planets orbit Earth on 'circles upon circles' ( or epicycles on deferents, is primarily to address **B. To explain the fact that planets sometimes appear to move westward rather than eastward relative to the stars in our sky**.\n\nThis phenomenon, known as retrograde motion, occurs when a planet appears to slow down, stop, and then move backward against the background of stars for a period of time before resuming its eastward motion. Ptolemy's model incorporated complex geometries to account for this effect, which could not be explained by the simpler circular orbits around the Earth alone. The system of epicycles and deferents allowed for the prediction of planetary positions and movements, including their retrograde motions, based on the assumption that planets moved in small circles (epicycles\u2014while these small circles themselves moved along larger circles (deferents\u2014around the Earth.\n\nThis elaborate system was developed to maintain the belief in a static Earth at the center of the universe, which was a cornerstone of Aristotelian philosophy. Despite its complexity, Ptolemy's model provided a satisfactory explanation for the observed phenomena until the heliocentric model gained acceptance during the Renaissance."
