Earth is a few thousand years old, and populations are unchanging.\n\nIt's important to note that this belief began to shift with the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection, as proposed by Darwin, and the principles of uniformitarianism, as developed by Lyell. These theories introduced the concepts of gradual change over long periods of time and the idea that species could evolve through natural processes."
