                    "text": "The correct answer is D: contractionary, 4, -3.\n\nWhen the government increases spending and taxes by the same amount, it aims to maintain a balanced budget. This policy direction is considered contractionary because it reduces the net demand pull on the economy. The government's spending and tax actions work against each other, potentially dampening aggregate demand.\n\nThe expenditure multiplier ( (1/(1-MPC)) can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpenditure Multiplier = 1 / ( (1 - MPC) \n\nGiven that the MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume) is 0.75,\n\nExpenditure Multiplier = 1 / ( (1 - 0.75) = 1 / 0.25 = 4\n\nThis means that an initial change in government spending or tax will have a multiplied effect on the total GDP, with a multiplier value of 4.\n\nThe tax multiplier is the negative of the expenditure multiplier because when taxes increase, it reduces disposable income and consumption, which leads to a decrease in aggregate demand. The formula for the tax multiplier is:\n\nTax Multiplier = -MPC / ( (1 - MPC)\n\nGiven that the MPC is 0.75,\n\nTax Multiplier = -(0.75) / ( (1 - 0.75) = -0.75 / 0.25 = -3\n\nSo, the tax multiplier here is -3, indicating that an increase in taxes will reduce the GDP by three times the amount of the tax increase, all else being equal.\n\nTherefore, the policy is contractionary, with an expenditure multiplier of 4 and a tax multiplier of -3."
