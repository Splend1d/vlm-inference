Many high school and college students have been purchasing fraudulent driver's licenses with phony birthdates showing \"proof' of being 21 years of age or older. As a consequence, many teenagers are able to purchase alcoholic beverages at liquor stores, restaurants, and bars. The situation is becoming especially alarming on many college campuses. A magazine article reported that the majority of freshmen between the ages of 18 and 19 at many colleges had illegally purchased evidence of phony \"proof. \"With underage drinking reaching epidemic proportions, Congress enacted a statute establishing a federal commission to monitor and curtail alcoholic beverage sales to underage drinkers. To implement the program on a national scale, the bill required each state to pass legislation establishing a local \"watchdog\" agency to facilitate compliance with congressional intent. A state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the federal statute. The law is likely to be held\n\nA. valid, because the sale of alcoholic beverages has a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\nB. valid, because the establishment of a state watchdog agency under the auspices of a federal regulatory scheme is consistent with the provisions of the Twenty First Amendment.\nC. invalid, because it violates the fundamental principles of state sovereignty embodied by the Eleventh Amendment.\nD. invalid, because the federal government may not compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.\n"

However, based on the information provided and considering the context of federal-state relations and constitutional law, option D seems the most plausible.\n\nD. invalid, because the federal government may not compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.\n\nThis option align with the principles of federalism, which balance the power between the federal government and the states. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that powers not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution nor prohibited to the states are reserved for the states or the people. This implies that states have certain inherent powers that the federal government cannot compel them to relinquish or execute on their behalf.\n\nIn this scenario, the federal statute requires each state to pass legislation establishing a local \"watchdog\" agency to facilitate compliance with congressional intent regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages to underage individuals. Such an imposition might be seen as overstepping the bounds of federal authority, potentially infringing upon the states' rights under the Tenth Amendment. The argument could be made that this federal mandate forces states to act against their own discretion, which is not justified by the Constitution unless explicitly granted through the delegation of powers outlined within the Constitution itself.\n\nIt's important to note that this analysis is speculative and simplified. In reality, the constitutionality of such a federal statute would be determined by a court after a thorough examination of the specific language of the statute, the Constitution, and any relevant precedents established by previous Supreme Court decisions."
