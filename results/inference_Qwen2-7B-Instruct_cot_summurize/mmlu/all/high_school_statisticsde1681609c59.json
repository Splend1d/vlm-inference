This method helps to minimize bias and increases the likelihood that the sample will be representative of the population. However, it's important to note that while the method of selection is crucial, assessing how representative the sample is of the population ( which could involve comparing characteristics of the sample to those of the population, is also a key aspect of evaluating the quality of a random sample. But in terms of defining what constitutes a simple random sample, the emphasis is on the selection process itself."
