This surplus does not exist in isolation but is part of the broader current-account balance. The current account includes trade in goods and services, as well as income and current transfers (such as foreign aid or remittances.\n\nHowever, if a country has a trade surplus, it implies that it is receiving more foreign currency than it is sending out for imports. This excess foreign currency needs to be accounted for somewhere within the balance of payments. In most cases, this surplus will find its way into the financial account, where it can take the form of foreign direct investment, portfolio investments, or other capital inflows.\n\nTherefore, a trade surplus must be offset either through adjustments in the current-account balance (by having more income from abroad than payments to foreigners, or through changes in the financial-account balance. It is not restricted to one of these accounts alone, as they are interconnected parts of the balance of payments."
