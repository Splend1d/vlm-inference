Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E.?\n\nA. The invention of the machine gun\nB. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases\nC. The development of the joint-stock company\nD. The invention of steam-powered ships\n"

                    "text": "To answer this question, let's examine each option in relation to its contribution to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during the specified period (1750 to 1900 C.E.\n\nA. The invention of the machine gun: While not directly related to colonial expansion, the invention of the machine gun did contribute to European military dominance. It improved the efficiency and effectiveness of European armies, enabling them to conquer territories more easily and maintain control over them. However, its direct impact on Africa's colonization might not have been as significant as the other options listed.\n\nB. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases: Vaccines played a crucial role in reducing the death toll from diseases such as yellow fever, malaria, and smallpox among Europeans living in colonies. This allowed Europeans to establish longer-term settlements and administrations in Africa, reducing the risk of disease outbreaks disrupting colonial efforts. Thus, while not directly promoting colonization, these medical advancements supported the long-term presence and exploitation of African territories.\n\nC. The development of the joint-stock company: Joint-stock companies, like the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company, were instrumental in the colonization and exploitation of Africa. They provided a way for investors to participate in the profits of colonial ventures without needing to be physically present. These companies often acted as de facto governments in their colonies, controlling trade, extracting resources, and establishing administrative structures. Their development significantly facilitated European penetration and control over Africa.\n\nD. The invention of steam-powered ships: Steam-powered ships revolutionized maritime travel, allowing for faster and more reliable transportation of goods, troops, and people across oceans. This made it easier for Europeans to explore new territories, establish colonies, and maintain control over distant colonies like those in Africa. The ability to transport large numbers of people and goods quickly was essential for the rapid colonization and exploitation of Africa during the Age of Exploration and the later colonization era.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A, the invention of the machine gun, contributed the LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during the period 1750 to 1900 C.E., although it did indirectly support European military dominance and control over territories."
