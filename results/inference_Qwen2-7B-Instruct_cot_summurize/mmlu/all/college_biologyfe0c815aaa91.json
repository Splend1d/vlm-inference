High parental investment\n\nThis species of small rodent has a low reproductive output (small litter sizes), which suggests that they would be investing heavily in the care of their offspring. This is indicative of high parental investment. The other options do not necessarily follow from the information given:\n\nA. Moderate sexual size dimorphism - This refers to differences in size between males and females within a species, and does not directly relate to the reproductive strategy.\n\nC. Precocial young - Precocial young are leave the nest soon after birth, generally well developed. While this could be true for this species, it doesn't necessarily correlate with having small litters. Some precocial species still have relatively large litters because they can care for more young at once.\n\nD. Frequent extrapair matings - This refers to mating outside of a monogamous or long-term relationship, which isn't necessarily related to litter size. Some species with smaller litter sizes may engage in frequent extrapair matings as a way to increase genetic diversity among offspring."
