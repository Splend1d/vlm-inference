One afternoon, the woman was in the kitchen of her home preparing a snack when she glanced out the window and saw a horrible crime being committed. The woman watched in horror as a local gang member pulled out a handgun and used it to shoot the victim, a member of a rival gang. The gang member did not know anyone was witnessing his act of shooting the victim. The woman watched as the victim collapsed and fell dead on her neighbor's front lawn. As a result of her shock from viewing this horrible incident, the woman suffered a miscarriage. If the woman asserts a claim against the local gang member who shot the victim, the woman will\n\nA. recover, because she suffered a physical injury, rather than just emotional harm.\nB. recover, because the gang member acted intentionally in shooting the victim.\nC. not recover, because the woman was not within the zone of danger.\nD. not recover, because the gang member was unaware that the woman was watching.\n"

In this scenario, the woman witnessed a violent crime, which led to her sufferinging a miscarriage. This physical outcome constitutes a direct injury for which the gang member may be held liable. While emotional distress is often compensable, the woman's case hinges on the physical harm caused by the traumatic event, which is more likely to lead to recovery in court."
