Saturn has a larger proportion of hydrogen and helium than Jupiter and is therefore less dense.\n\nSaturn and Jupiter are both gas giants, and their sizes are largely determined by their compositions and the physics governing their formation. The key factor here is density. Jupiter, being composed primarily of heavier elements like iron and rock, has a higher density than Saturn, which is mostly made up of lighter elements such as hydrogen and helium. Despite having a smaller mass, Saturn can be almost as large as Jupiter because its lower density allows it to occupy a much larger volume."
