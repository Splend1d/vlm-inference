Leucine, Methionine, and Threonine\n\nThese are three of the nine essential amino acids required in the human diet. They play crucial roles in protein synthesis, muscle growth and repair, and other biological processes.\n\nB. Proline, Tyrosine, and Serine are not essential amino acids. Proline is semi-essential, meaning it is conditionally essential for some individuals ( like premature infants, while tyrosine and serine can usually be synthesized by the body.\n\nC. Valine, Glycine, and Arginine are also incorrect. Glycine is not considered an essential amino acid; it's one of the simplest amino acids. Valine is essential but arginine is not considered essential for adults, though it might be necessary in certain medical conditions.\n\nD. Leucine, Cysteine, and Glycine: Cysteine is a semi-essential amino acid for children under 1 year old and is conditionally essential for others under specific circumstances. Again, glycine is not considered an essential amino acid.\n\nSo, the only group that correctly lists all essential amino acids is A. Leucine, Methionine, and Threonine."
