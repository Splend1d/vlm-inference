Governments did little to address problems of industrialization before 1850.\n\nThe documents provided give insights into the economic and social impacts of industrialization during the early 19th century, particularly focusing on the textile industry and the Luddite movement in Britain. The first source discusses the benefits of using machines in cotton manufacturing, suggesting that these innovations could also be applied to wool production. It highlights how mechanization initially caused alarm among workers due to fears of job loss, but ultimately increased productivity and wages. This implies that governments might have been aware of the impact of industrialization on labor conditions but did little to actively regulate or mitigate these effects.\n\nThe second source presents a song from the Luddite movement, which was a protest against technological advancements and their perceived negative impacts on workers, especially in the textile industry. The Luddites destroyed machinery they believed threatened their livelihoods. The song reflects the anger and resistance felt by some workers towards industrialization and the lack of government intervention to protect their interests.\n\nGiven the context of the time, it seems that governments prior to 1850 generally did not proactively address the social and economic issues arising from industrialization, such as worker rights, safety, and living conditions. Instead, they might have responded more reactively to such issues as they emerged, often through law enforcement rather than proactive legislation aimed at protecting workers. Therefore, option A best describes the governmental reactions to complaints related to industrialization before 1850 based on the information provided."
