This could mean that those who were already performing well continued to do so at a higher rate than those who started behind, but overall improvement was widespread.\n\nOptions B and C suggest a skewed improvement towards either lower or higher ability trainees, respectively, which might not be the typical outcome of a comprehensive training program designed for all employees. Option D assumes that after the training, all trainees would be at the exact same performance level, which is unlikely given individual differences in starting points, learning styles, and motivation."
