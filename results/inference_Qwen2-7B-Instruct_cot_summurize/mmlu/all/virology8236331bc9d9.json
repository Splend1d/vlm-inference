Self-assemble of virus L1 protein into VLP\n\nThe HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccine that is considered successful in preventing certain types of HPV infection, and therefore certain cancers associated with HPV, is based on the technology of Virus-Like Particles ( (VLPs). These are essentially the capsid proteins of the virus, specifically the L1 protein, self-assembling into structures that resemble the virus without containing any viral genetic material or being able to replicate.\n\nThis type of vaccine does not contain live virus, whole virus, or subunit vaccines that have been chemically inactivated. It's designed to elicit an immune response without the risk of causing the diseases the vaccine is meant to prevent."
