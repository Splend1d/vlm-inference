The witness worked with the police a few days later to try and create a composite sketch of the purse snatcher. This was used by the police to capture the purported purse snatcher. The witness died several days before the trial. When the witness's drawing was offered by the prosecution as evidence at trial, is the trial judge likely to accept it as admissible evidence?\n\nA. Yes, because the police took it and used it to find someone, therefore it must be an accurate representation of the perpetrator; the exhibit must be admitted.\nB. Yes, because it is in the nature of the written recollection of the decedent at a time close to the crime and it therefore has testimonial reliability.\nC. No, because the defense had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness under oath about the drawing prior to her death and such sketches are inherently unreliable in any event.\nD. No, because it was drawn up days after the event and is in violation of the best evidence rule.\n"

No, because the defense had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness under oath about the draw prior to her death and such sketches are inherently unreliable in any event.\n\nThe primary consideration for the admissibility of the witness's composite sketch would be the opportunity for the defense to cross-examine the witness regarding the creation and accuracy of the sketch. Without this opportunity, the defense might not have been able to challenge the reliability or accuracy of the sketch effectively. Additionally, composite sketches created days after an event may not be as reliable as those made closer to the incident due to potential fading of memory or changes in the perpetrator's appearance. However, the court's decision would depend on local laws, precedent, and specific legal considerations."
