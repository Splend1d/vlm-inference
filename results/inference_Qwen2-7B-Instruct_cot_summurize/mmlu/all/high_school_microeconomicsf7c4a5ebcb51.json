MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points.\n\nIn the context of cost curves in microeconomics, Marginal Cost (MC, Average Variable Cost (AVC, and Average Total Cost (ATC have specific relationships that help firms determine optimal production levels. The key points are:\n\n- **Marginal Cost (MC** measures the cost of producing one additional unit of output.\n- **Average Variable Cost AVC** measures the cost per unit of all variable inputs.\n- **Average Total Cost ATC** includes both fixed and variable costs per unit of output.\n\n**Optimal Production Level**: Firms aim to produce up to the point where Marginal Revenue (MR equals Marginal Cost (MC), which maximizes profit. However, concerning the intersection with AVC and ATC, the following holds true:\n\n- **MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points**: This is because as long as MC is below AVC and ATC, it pulls down the average costs. When MC crosses AVC or ATC from below, it means that the cost of producing one more unit has risen to a level where it increases the average cost of all units produced so far. Therefore, firms operate efficiently when MC is increasing but still below AVC and ATC, aiming to minimize these average costs by producing up to the point where MC starts to rise above AVC and ATC, signaling a potential increase in average costs.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C: MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points."
