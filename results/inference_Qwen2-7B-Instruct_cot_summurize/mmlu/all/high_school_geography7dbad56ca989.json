Its founding members were the United States, Canada, and 12 European nations. The initial purpose of NATO was to provide collective defense against the possibility of aggression from the Soviet Union and its satellite states, which were part of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. This includes Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all members.\n\nWhile the specific threats and geopolitical landscape have evolved since the Cold War era, NATO's core mission remains focused on collective defense and ensuring security in the Euro-Atlantic area."
