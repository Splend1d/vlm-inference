Momentum itself is defined as mass (M multiplied by velocity, where velocity is a measure of length (L divided by time T.\n\nSo, the formula for momentum (p is:\n\np = M * (L / T\n\nImpulse (J) is the change in momentum over time, which can be calculated using Newton's second law of motion:\n\nF = d(p)/dt = dp/dt = d(M*v)/dt = M*dv/dt + v*dM/dt\n\nSince force F is also equal to mass times acceleration, and acceleration is change in velocity over time, we can rewrite the above equation as:\n\nF = d(p)/dt = M*a = M*(dv/dt)\n\nNow, looking at the options given:\n\nA. LM/T^3\nB. LM/T^2\nC. LM/T\nD. L^2M/T^2\n\nThe correct dimension of impulse would be the same as that of force multiplied by time, since impulse is the change in momentum, which is equivalent to force (times change in time.\n\nForce is defined as mass times acceleration, and acceleration is change in velocity over time, so:\n\nF = M*(dv/dt) = M*L/T^2 * L/T = ML^2/T^3\n\nBut this option is not available, so let's check the other options:\n\nOption C: LM/T is essentially force (times time, which aligns with the definition of impulse. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
