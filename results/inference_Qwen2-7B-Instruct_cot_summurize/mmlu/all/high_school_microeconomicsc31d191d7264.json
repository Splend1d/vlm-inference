Wage elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity of labor demanded changes in response to a change in the wage rate. The higher it is, the more sensitive the demand for labor is to wage changes. This does not necessarily mean that the proportion of capital costs to labor costs in the production of goods is greater (higher. It also does not relate directly to the price elasticity for the product produced by labor or the number of substitutes for labor. However, it can be related to the time period - if there are is a short time period, firms may not have enough time to adjust their capital-labor ratio in response to wage changes, leading to a higher wage elasticity of demand.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D."
