                    "text": "To understand the relationship between the height \\(h\\) of a strictly binary tree and its number of nodes \\(N\\), let's consider the properties of such a tree given in the problem statement:\n\n1. **Strictly Binary Tree**: Every non-leaf node has exactly two children.\n2. **Root to Leaf Path Ratio Bound**: There exists a constant \\(c > 0\\) such that the ratio of the lengths of any two root-to-leaf paths is bounded above by \\(c\\).\n\nGiven these conditions, we want to determine how the height \\(h\\) of the tree relates to the number of nodes \\(N\\). Let's analyze the options:\n\n### Option A: \\(h \\leq \\log_2(N)\\)\n\nThis option suggests that the height of the tree grows logarithmically with the number of nodes, but at most as fast as \\(\\log_2(N)\\). This is plausible because in a perfectly balanced binary tree (like a complete binary tree), the height \\(h\\) grows logarithmically with \\(N\\). However, it does not directly incorporate the constraint on the root-to-leaf path ratios.\n\n### Option B: \\(h = \\frac{1}{c} \\log_2(N)\\)\n\nThis option scales the logarithmic growth rate of the height by the inverse of the constant \\(c\\). It implies that the height is directly proportional to the logarithm of \\(N\\), scaled by \\(1/c\\). Given that \\(c > 0\\) and represents an upper bound on the ratio of any two root-to-leaf paths, this option could potentially capture the relationship between height and the logarithm of the number of nodes under the given constraints. However, it doesn't necessarily account for the strict bound on the ratio of root-to-leaf paths.\n\n### Option C: \\(h < c \\log_2(N)\\)\n\nThis option suggests that the height grows more slowly than \\(c\\) times the logarithm of the number of nodes. It seems to imply that the height might be influenced by the logarithmic growth of \\(N\\) but is limited by the factor \\(c\\). This could be a reasonable characterization given that the tree's structure is constrained by the requirement on the root-to-leaf path ratios.\n\n### Option D: \\(h > c \\log_2(N)\\)\n\nThis option contradicts the premise of the problem, which suggests a bound on the ratio of root-to-leaf paths, implying that the height cannot grow faster than a certain rate determined by \\(c\\).\n\n### Correct Answer\n\n**Option C** (\\(h < c \\log_2(N)\\)) best characterizes the height \\(h\\) of any tree in this class, where \\(N\\) is the number of nodes in the tree and \\(N > 1\\). This is because it captures the idea that the height grows logarithmically with \\(N\\), but is further limited by the constant \\(c\\) that bounds the ratio of root-to-leaf paths, suggesting a tighter constraint on the tree's growth compared to a simple logarithmic relationship."
