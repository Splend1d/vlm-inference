However, its role is more prominent in the sympathetic system.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. sympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic neurons\n\nIn the sympathetic nervous system, noradrenaline is released by postganglionic neurons at their synapses with target organs. This neurotransmitter helps to prepare the body for the \"fight or flight\" response, leading to various physiological changes such as increased heart rate, blood pressure, and energy mobilization."
