This principle states that as the speed of a fluid (like air) increases, the pressure within the fluid decreases. \n\nIn the case of a blimp, the shape of the blimp causes the air above it to move faster than the air below it, according to Bernoulli's principle. Since the air above moves faster, it creates lower pressure compared to the slower-moving and higher-pressure air below. This pressure difference causes an upward force, allowing the blimp to rise and fly through the air.\n\nArchimedes' principle relates to buoyancy, Pascal's principle deals with fluids and pressure, and Boyle's law concerns the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas. None of these principles directly explain how a blimp flies."
