Primary context refers to the original setting of an artifact or ecofact ( in which it was deposited, used, and removed from the ground. \n\nA. A landfill where refuse from an entire community has accumulated - This is a primary context because it represents the original disposal site where waste materials were placed.\n\nB. Artifacts, ecofacts, and bone exposed on the ground surface by erosion - These items have not been moved from their original place of deposition, thus indicating a primary context.\n\nC. The existence of a cache or collection of artifacts found where they were left - This scenario also represents a primary context, as the artifacts were originally placed in that location before being discovered.\n\nTherefore, all three options can be considered primary contexts in archaeological terms."
