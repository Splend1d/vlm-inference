The emergence of elite power among these people was likely influenced by various factors, but storing food surpluses in good years for distribution in bad years is a significant aspect of their societal development.\n\nWhen there were good harvests, the Ancestral Puebloans could store the excess food, creating a food reserve. This surplus allowed some members of the community to have more resources than others, leading to the accumulation of wealth and power. These individuals or groups who controlled the food supply became influential within the society, and this control over resources helped to establish the power of elites. This mechanism facilitated the development of complex social structures and institutions building, including the construction of monumental architecture, organization of labor, and the creation of specialized roles beyond basic survival needs.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D are also related to aspects of Ancestral Puebloan society, they do not directly explain the emergence of elite power in the same way that food surplus storage does. Predicting astronomical events might have been part of their religious practices or calendrical systems, monument and cliff dwelling construction was an architectural response to environmental conditions and cultural values, and incorporating other societies through conquest warfare would be a separate aspect of their history involving conflict and territorial expansion."
