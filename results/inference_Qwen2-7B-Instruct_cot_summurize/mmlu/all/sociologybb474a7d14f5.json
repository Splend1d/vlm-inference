This concept was notably discussed by Karl Popper in his book \"The Open Society and Its Enemies.\" Popper argued that an open society is characterized by its commitment to freedom, tolerance, and rational inquiry, where individuals can express their ideas without fear of censorship or persecution, and there is a general openness to change and progress.\n\nIt's important to note that while the other options ( A. grants every member equal status, B. does not have any official secrets in its government, and C. has permissive attitudes towards sexual behavior, can be aspects of an open society, they are not the defining characteristic as described by Popper. An open society is broader than these specific traits, encompassing a more fundamental commitment to freedom and rational debate."
