This typically leads to a decrease in exports from the United States (Option B is incorrect.\n\nThe higher cost of imports due to the stronger dollar makes foreign products relatively more expensive for U.S. consumers, thus potentially leading to a decrease in imports into the United States. However, this is not always the case since some consumers might still prefer foreign goods regardless of price changes. \n\nOption C, \"U.S. residents will take more vacations in foreign countries,\" may actually be less likely because a stronger dollar means that U.S. tourists have more purchasing power abroad, which could lead to higher spending but also higher costs for travel and accommodations. Thus, while it's possible, it's not necessarily the most direct or likely outcome of currency appreciation for U.S. residents' vacationing habits.\n\nOption D, \"More foreign visitors will travel to the United States,\" is the most likely to occur when the U.S. dollar appreciates. A stronger dollar means that foreign travelers can buy more with their home currency when they exchange it for U.S. dollars. This increased purchasing power can make travel to the United States more affordable, potentially leading to an increase in tourism from abroad.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. More foreign visitors will travel to the United States**."
