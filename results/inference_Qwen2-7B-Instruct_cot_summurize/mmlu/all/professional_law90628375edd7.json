Rent was payable on the first day of each month, and the landlord retained the right to terminate the lease if the tenant defaulted. The lease term ended 18 months ago. However, the tenant has stayed in possession of the building and has continued to pay the rent on time. The landlord has continued to accept the rent. The fair rental value of the building is now substantially more than what the tenant has been paying, and the landlord recently found a third party who will pay the higher rent. When the tenant paid the rent six weeks ago, the landlord accepted paid the rent six weeks ago, the landlord accepted the rent but told the tenant in writing that she had to vacate at the end of the month. The tenant, who is still in possession of the building, has informed the landlord that she does not want to move and is willing to pay the current fair rental value. The landlord has asked his lawyer for advice regarding the right to possession. Who should the lawyer say is entitled to possession?\n\nA. The landlord, because he gave proper notice to terminate the tenancy.\nB. The landlord, because he retained the right to reenter.\nC. The tenant, because she has stated that she is willing to pay the current fair rental value.\nD. The tenant, because the landlord has not shown good cause to terminate the tenancy.\n"

The tenant, because the landlord has not shown good cause to terminate the tenancy.\n\nIn this scenario, the landlord and tenant have an existing lease agreement which expired 18 months ago. Despite the lease's expiration, the tenant has continued to occupy the premises and pay rent. The landlord's acceptance of the rent after providing notice to vacate indicates that the landlord considers the tenancy to continue unless there is a valid reason to terminate it.\n\nThe fact that the tenant is willing to pay the current fair rental value further supports the notion that the tenancy should continue, as the landlord cannot arbitrarily demand the tenant to leave without a legal basis or cause for termination. If the landlord wishes to terminate the tenancy, they must provide a valid reason based on the terms of the lease agreement or applicable laws, such as non-payment of rent, violation of lease conditions, or the need to retake possession for personal use or sale of the property.\n\nTherefore, until the landlord can provide a valid cause for termination or the tenant defaults on their obligations, the tenant is entitled to remain in possession of the building under the terms of the existing lease."
