The woman purchased an owner's policy of title insurance before the an owner's policy of title insurance before the closing. Because of an error by the title insurance company, the title commitment and title policy failed to list a county tax lien encumbering the lot as an exception to coverage. Last year, the woman conveyed the lot for a bargain price by a quitclaim deed to a friend, who paid cash, did not conduct a title search, and did not purchase title insurance. Subsequently, the county began proceedings to foreclose the tax lien, and the friend filed a claim with the woman's title insurance company, demanding that the company reimburse her for the tax lien amount. Is the title insurance company obligated to pay the friend's claim?\n\nA. No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.\nB. No, because the title insurance policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend.\nC. Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.\nD. Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.\n"

Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.\n\nIn this scenario, the title insurance policy provided by the title insurance company to the woman did not list the county tax lien as an exception to coverage. As such, the property was covered under the terms of the policy up until the conveyance to the friend. Since the friend was the subsequent owner of the property and the tax lien was not disclosed or excluded from coverage in the policy, the title insurance company would be obligated to pay the friend's claim based on the terms of the policy. \n\nIt's important to note that the specifics of title insurance policies coverage can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction and the terms of the policy itself. However, in general, if a title issue that was not disclosed or excluded in the policy occurs after the policy has been issued, the insurer may be responsible for covering the losses resulting from that issue, assuming the policy remains in effect and there are no other exclusions or exceptions that apply."
