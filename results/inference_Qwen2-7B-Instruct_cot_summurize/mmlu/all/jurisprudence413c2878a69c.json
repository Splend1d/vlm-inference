Because any definition of punishment should be value-neutral.\n\nIt is important to separate the concept of punishment from its justification to ensure that discussions and policies-making around punishment are not clouded by personal or societal values, beliefs, or biases. Punishment, as a concept, can be defined in various ways, such as the imposition of penalties or sanctions for breaking rules or laws. However, the justification for why punishment should exist, how severe it should be, and under what circumstances it should be applied, often involves ethical, moral, and philosophical considerations. Keeping these two aspects separate allows for more objective analysis and debate, ensuring that the application of punishment is grounded in reason rather than subjective preferences or prejudices."
