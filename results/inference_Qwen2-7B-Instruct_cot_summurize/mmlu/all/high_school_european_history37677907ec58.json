In demanding from a citizen contributions for the mitigation of distress \u2026 the state is \u2026 reversing its function. \u2026 To enforce the fundamental law\u2014to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man. \u2026 [But that] is quite a separate thing from insuring him satisfaction. \u2026\nThe poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong \u2026 are the decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence. \u2026 When regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence.\nHerbert Spencer, Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Spencer advocated which social philosophy?\n\nA.

Social Darwinism\n\nSpencer's views align closely with Social Darwinism, a philosophical doctrine that applied the principles of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution to society and economics. He believed in the survival of the fittest and argued that societal structures should reflect this natural order, where the strongest and most capable individuals or groups would thrive. This perspective supports laissez-faire economic policies and limited intervention by the state in individual affairs, as seen in his statement about governments' role being primarily to protect individual freedoms rather than provide social welfare."
