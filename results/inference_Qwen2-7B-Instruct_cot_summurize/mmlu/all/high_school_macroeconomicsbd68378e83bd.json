If the MPC is 0.8, this means that for every additional dollar of income, 80 cents is spent and 20 cents is saved.\n\nTo find the total increase in GDP resulting from an initial injection of spending, you use the concept of the multiplier effect. The multiplier (k) is calculated as:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{1}{1 - MPC} \\]\n\nGiven an MPC of 0.8, we have:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5 \\]\n\nThis means that for every dollar of initial spending, there will be a $5 increase in total spending due to the multiplier effect.\n\nIf the initial spending is $500, then the total increase in GDP would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in GDP} = \\text{Initial Spending} \\times \\text{Multiplier} = \\$500 \\times 5 = \\$2,500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $2,500."
