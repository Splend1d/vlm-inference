This means that the defendant must first produce sufficient evidence to meet the legal standard for insanity ( usually the M'Naghten rule or the Durham rule, depending on the jurisdiction. Once this burden is met, the prosecution then bears the burden of persuasion to disprove the defense of insanity beyond a reasonable doubt."
