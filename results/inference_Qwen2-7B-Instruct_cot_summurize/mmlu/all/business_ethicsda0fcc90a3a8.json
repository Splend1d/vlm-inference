Caveat emptor, Buyer beware, Regulation, National.\n\nConsumer rights traditionally were based on the notions of \"caveat emptor\" (let the buyer beware or \"buyer beware\", implying that the responsibility lay with the consumer to avoid subpar products. However, this has gradually eroded due to increased regulation at a national level. The shift towards stronger consumer protection laws can be seen at various levels, including within individual countries, as well as internationally through organizations like the European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN). \n\nThe other options either contain typographical errors or incorrect terminology, such as using \"Cemptor Eaveat\" instead of \"Caveat emptor\" or incorrectly placing \"Company Responsibility\" in the context of traditional consumer rights."
