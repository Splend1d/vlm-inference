As a result, a car that was next to the truck was forced off the highway and crashed into a concrete barrier along the roadway. The driver of the car suffered a broken leg. An ambulance arrived and rushed her to the hospital. A doctor there examined the broken leg and ordered X-rays to be taken. The doctor carelessly misread the X-rays and set the broken bone improperly. As a result of the doctor's negligence, the driver's leg never healed completely, and the driver was left with a significant impairment of the use of her leg. If the driver of the car brings a negligence action against the driver of the truck, the most likely result is\n\nA. the truck driver will not be liable for any damages, because the doctor's negligence constituted a superseding cause that relieved the truck driver of liability.\nB. the truck driver will be liable for the harm suffered by the plaintiff when her car crashed, but not the additional or enhanced harm resulting from the doctor's careless mistake.\nC. the truck driver will be liable only if his negligence is regarded by the jury as being more severe than the doctor's negligence.\nD. the truck driver will be liable for all the harm suffered by the plaintiff, although the doctor may be liable to some extent, as well.\n"

In this case, the truck driver's negligent lane change caused the initial accident. Therefore, the truck driver could potentially be held liable for the damages resulting from that accident. \n\nHowever, the doctor's negligence in misreading the X-rays and setting the broken bone improperly also contributed to the plaintiff's harm. This could lead to the doctor being held liable for the additional or enhanced harm resulting from his negligence, even though it occurred after the initial accident caused by the truck driver.\n\nIt's important to note that specific legal outcomes can vary based on the jurisdiction, the facts of the case, and how the law is interpreted by the court. For instance, the doctrine of \"superseding cause\" might apply in some jurisdictions, potentially relieving the truck driver from liability if the doctor's actions were considered an unforeseeable intervening cause that was sufficiently independent of the original harm to relieve the initial wrongdoer of responsibility. However, given the information provided, the most common legal approach would likely assign liability to both parties."
