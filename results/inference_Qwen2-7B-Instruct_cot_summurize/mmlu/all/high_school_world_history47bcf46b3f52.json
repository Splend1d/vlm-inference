But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nThe reference to the \"continual beatings\" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?\n\nA. The invasion of Afghanistan\nB. The creation of the Warsaw Pact\nC. The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe\nD. The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II\n"

                    "text": "The reference to the \"continual beatings\" most directly supports the decision that best aligns with Stalin's assertion that Russia needed to avoid being seen as backward, weak, or vulnerable to exploitation. This sentiment is echoed in later Soviet foreign policy decisions aimed at asserting strength, protecting the socialist bloc, and responding to perceived threats or provocations.\n\nGiven the context:\n\nA. The invasion of Afghanistan ( - This occurred much later under Brezhnev's leadership, but it was part of the broader Soviet strategy to protect its sphere of influence and respond to what was seen as a threat to Soviet interests in Central Asia and the Middle East. This alignes with the idea of not wanting to be seen as weak or backward.\n\nB. The creation of the Warsaw Pact - This was a direct response to the perceived threat from NATO, which was seen as an aggressive move by the West against the Eastern Bloc. The creation of the Warsaw Pact was a defensive measure aimed at maintaining balance of power and preventing any Western encroachment on Eastern European countries, thus supporting the notion of not falling behind and being vulnerable.\n\nC. The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe - This doctrine was used to justify Soviet intervention in the affairs of Eastern European countries to suppress perceived capitalist or anti-communist elements. It was another instance where the Soviet Union sought to maintain control over its satellite states and prevent them from veering away from socialist policies, reinforcing the idea of not wanting to be beaten or fall behind.\n\nD. The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II - This decision was made based on the strategic interests of the Soviet Union, particularly after the Yalta Agreement, where the Soviets were promised territories from Japan as compensation for their participation in the war against Germany. It was not necessarily driven by the fear of being beaten or backwardness but rather by post-war territorial gains and geopolitical positioning.\n\nAmong these options, both A ( The invasion of Afghanistan, and C: The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe, seem to align more closely with the historical context of the \"continual beatings\" mentioned by Stalin. However, considering the timeframe and the specific focus of the quote, option B: The creation of the Warsaw Pact, seems to be the most direct response to maintaining Soviet strength and influence, which is consistent with the theme of not wanting to be seen as weak or backward. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the information provided and the historical context would likely be **B. The creation of the Warsaw Pact**."
