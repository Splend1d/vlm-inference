This refers to the desire for social connections and relationships, which is a fundamental aspect of human nature. It's important for personal development and well-being. \n\nThe other options can be explained as follows:\n\nA. Fraternization need: This term is often used in a more specific context, such as within military or organizational settings, referring to the social interaction between individuals of different ranks or groups. In the context of college freshmen, it might not be the most appropriate term.\n\nB. Assimilation need: This typically refers to the process of adopting the norms, behaviors, and values of a new cultural group. While it might apply to some extent if Xavier is joining a new environment with diverse students, it does not specifically capture his desire for forming friendships.\n\nC. Attachment need: This pertains to the psychological bonds and emotional connections between individuals. While it certainly plays a role in how people form friendships and relationships, it is a broader concept that doesn't precisely describe the specific motivation for seeking out others to socialize with."
