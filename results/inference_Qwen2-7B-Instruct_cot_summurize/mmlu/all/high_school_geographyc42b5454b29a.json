It targeted crops Africans don't grow and eat.\n\nThe Green Revolution focused on increasing the productivity of staple crops such as wheat, rice, and corn in Asia and Latin America, which were already grown in those regions but not necessarily in the same scale or intensity as in Africa. In Africa, the main staple crops are maize, sorghum, millet, and cassava, which were not the focus of the Green Revolution's technological advancements. Therefore, the new technologies, seeds, and practices developed during the Green Revolution often did not directly benefit African farmers who relied on different crops for their livelihoods and food security."
