This fallacy occurs when someone claims that a particular action will inevitably lead to a series of negative outcomes without providing any evidence to support the inevitability or strength of the causal connections between the action and the outcomes. They might not deny the existence of evidence, but they choose not to present or discuss it, potentially because it contradicts their argument."
