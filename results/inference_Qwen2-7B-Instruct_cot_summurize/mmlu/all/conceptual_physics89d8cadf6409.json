                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Thorium-242.\n\nWhen a nucleus of uranium-238 emits an alpha particle, it undergoes radioactive decay in a process called alpha decay. An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, essentially equivalent to the nucleus of a helium atom. \n\nDuring this process, the uranium-238 nucleus loses this alpha particle, resulting in a new nucleus with 2 fewer protons and 2 fewer neutrons. Uranium has 92 protons, so losing 2 leaves 90, which corresponds to thorium (Th). The atomic mass decreases by 4 units because each alpha particle has an atomic mass number of 4 ( (mass number of 238 - 4 = 234).\n\nTherefore, the resulting nucleus is thorium-234 (Th-234), not thorium-242 as stated in the option. However, there seems to be a typo in the options provided. Assuming the intention was to describe the result of multiple alpha decays or a different process, the closest correct answer based on the information given would be thorium-234 (Th-234) if considering only one alpha decay event. \n\nIn reality, the decay series of uranium-238 involves multiple steps including alpha and beta decays, eventually leading to stable lead-206 after about 4.5 billion years, but that's a more complex explanation involving several intermediate stages not covered in the original question."
