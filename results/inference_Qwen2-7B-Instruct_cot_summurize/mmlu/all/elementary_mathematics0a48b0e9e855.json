                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The mean will increase.\n\nTo understand why, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The mode will increase. - This is not necessarily true. The mode refers to the most frequently occurring score. If Marguerite had scores that were repeated multiple times within the range of 75-89, her mode might change or might not change at all depending on whether she scored a 100 before this test. However, since we don't have information about the frequency of her previous scores, we cannot conclude that the mode increases just because she scored 100 on her next test.\n\nB. The mean will increase. - This is true. The mean (or average score) is calculated by summing all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Since Marguerite received a perfect score of 100 on her next test, which is higher than any score she could have received in the 75-89 range, adding this score to the total sum will increase the overall average, assuming there are were some scores in the range of 75-89 previously.\n\nC. The mean will decrease. - This statement is incorrect for the same reason as A; it depends on the previous scores' distribution. If the previous scores were high enough, adding a 100 could still increase the mean.\n\nD. The median will decrease. - This statement is also incorrect. The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest. If Marguerite had an even number of scores before receiving the 100, adding another score (which is the highest possible score in the dataset, thus increasing the range of values, would not decrease the median. If she had an odd number of scores, the addition of the 100 would shift the median upward if the 100 was was higher than the current median, or it would not change if the 100 was already higher than the median.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: The mean will increase."
