This is done by connecting a known resistance in series with the galvanometer. When the circuit is closed, the voltage across this resistance (and thus the galvanometer as well, due to Ohm's Law (V = IR where V is voltage, i is current, and r is resistance) can be measured. Therefore, a galvanometer can indeed be calibrated to read either electric current or voltage, depending on how it is connected and what is being measured."
