Therefore, the number of neutrons can be calculated by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number:\n\nNumber of neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number\nNumber of neutrons = 40 - 19 = 21\n\nThe number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, so there would also be 19 electrons.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons"
