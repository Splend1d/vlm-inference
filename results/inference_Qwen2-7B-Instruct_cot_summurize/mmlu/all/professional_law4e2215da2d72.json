The patient's doctor prescribed a mild anesthetic drug, to be given to the patient intravenously, to reduce the pain being experienced by the patient. The patient was supposed to receive a saline solution containing 18. 5 milligrams of the drug. A nurse arranged to have a pharmacy technician prepare the solution and drug, and then the nurse administered the solution and drug to the patient. The solution that was administered to the patient contained 185 milligrams of the drug, rather than just 18. 5. Shortly after receiving the drug, the patient had a heart attack and died. The doctor, nurse, and pharmacy technician were all employed by the hospital.

However, the specific elements required can vary based on the legal standards of the jurisdiction and the nuances of the case. Generally, to establish liability, the family would need to prove:\n\nB. The family must prove the specific negligent act that resulted in the wrong dose of the drug being administered.\n\nThis involves showing that the doctor, nurse, or pharmacy technician (or any combination of them, depending on the circumstances and the distribution of responsibilities within the hospital, failed to exercise the level of care, skill, and diligence that a reasonably competent healthcare professional would have under similar circumstances. This could include errors in prescription, administration, or dosing, as well as failures to follow standard procedures or protocols.\n\nAdditionally, it might be necessary to demonstrate that:\n\nD. The family must prove that the patient would not have died if given 18.5 milligrams of the drug.\n\nThis element is often referred to as \"but-for\" causation or \"proximate cause,\" meaning that but for the hospital's negligence ( i.e., the administration of the incorrect dosage, the patient would not have suffered the fatal heart attack. Establishing this requires proving that the patient's death was directly attributable to the error in dosage.\n\nIt's also important to consider whether the hospital administrators were negligent in hiring or supervising the employees involved, which might be relevant in cases where there is evidence of systemic issues within the hospital's management or oversight processes. However, proving this typically requires a different set of evidence and might not be a mandatory requirement to recover damages in every wrongful death claim, depending on the specifics of the case and applicable law.\n\nUltimately, the family should consult with a legal professional who specializes in medical malpractice law to understand the specific requirements for their case and how best to proceed."
