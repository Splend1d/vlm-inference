The aid is in the form of annual subsidies to qualified institutions. The grants are non-categorical but may not, under an added provision, be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes. A state agency determines the eligibility of applicant institutions. Eight state taxpayers, all avowed atheists, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the payments of subsidies under the statute to all church-affiliated institutions in the state. The federal district court will most likely\n\nA. dismiss the action for lack of standing.\nB. uphold the validity of the statute as nonviolative of the establishment clause.\nC. invalidate the statute as violative of the establishment clause.\nD. uphold the validity of the statute as a valid exercise of the state's power to subsidize education.\n"

Kurtzman (403 U.S. 664 ( (1971), a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States evaluated the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania program providing financial assistance to parochial schools. In Lemon v. Kurtzman, the Court established a three-pronged test to determine whether a law violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from establishing an official religion. The test includes:\n\n1. The statute must have a secular legislative purpose.\n2. The statute must neither advance nor inhibit religion.\n3. The statute must avoid excessive entanglement with religion.\n\nGiven the description provided, the statute appears to fulfill these criteria:\n- It has a secular purpose: To provide financial assistance to institutions of higher learning within the state that meet minimum criteria.\n- It neither advances nor inhibits religion: By requiring institutions to refrain from awarding only seminarian or theological degrees, it does not favor religious instruction over secular education, nor does it promote religious beliefs over secular ones.\n- It avoids excessive entanglement with religion: By prohibiting the use of funds for sectarian purposes and having a state agency determine eligibility, it limits direct involvement between the state and religious organizations.\n\nTherefore, the federal district court would most likely uphold the validity of the statute as non-violative of the establishment clause, assuming that the court finds the statute meets the Lemon test."
