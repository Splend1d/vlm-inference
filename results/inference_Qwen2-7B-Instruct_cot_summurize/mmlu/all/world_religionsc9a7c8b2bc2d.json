He is the last of the ascetic prophets.\n\nMahavira is considered the 24th Tirthankara (or savior) in Jainism, and he is revered as the last great spiritual teacher and reformer of the religion before it reached its final form. Born around 599 BCE, Mahavira was a prince who renounced his royal life to become an ascetic. His teachings and reforms helped to consolidate the existing Jain tradition and bring about a period of renewed spiritual and philosophical development within the faith. His life and teachings are central to the religious practice and philosophy of Jainism."
