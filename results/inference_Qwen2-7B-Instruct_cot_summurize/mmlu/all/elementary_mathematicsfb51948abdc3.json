This expression represents four times the quantity of \\(x\\) minus 22. It correctly captures the phrase \"four times the quantity 22 less than \\(x\\)\".\n\n- **Option B**: \\((4 \\cdot 22) - x\\). This expression calculates four times 22 and then subtracts \\(x\\). It does not represent \"four times the quantity 22 less than \\(x\\)\" because it does not multiply \\(x\\) by 4 after subtracting 22.\n\n- **Option C**: \\(4(22 - x)\\). This expression represents four times the difference between 22 and \\(x\\), which is different from \"four times the quantity 22 less than \\(x\\)\" because it subtracts \\(x\\) from 22 before multiplying by 4, rather than subtracting 22 from \\(x\\).\n\n- **Option D**: \\((x \\cdot 4) - 22\\). This expression calculates \\(x\\) times 4 and then subtracts 22. It does not match the given phrase because it subtracts 22 from the product of \\(x\\) and 4, rather than taking the quantity 22 less than \\(x\\) and multiplying that by 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct algebraic expression that represents \"four times the quantity 22 less than \\(x\\)\" is **Option A**: \\(4(x - 22)\\)."
