It can indeed be palpated by a skilled examiner.\n\nB. The infraorbital foramen is located on the lateral wall of the maxilla, just below the orbit. It serves as the passage for the infraorbital nerve and artery. This structure can also be palpated in a live patient.\n\nC. The mental foramen is found in the mandible, specifically at the angle of the jaw, where it allows the passage of the mental nerve and vessels. It can be palpated during examination.\n\nTherefore, all of these structures can potentially be palpated in a live patient under appropriate conditions and with the necessary skill and knowledge."
