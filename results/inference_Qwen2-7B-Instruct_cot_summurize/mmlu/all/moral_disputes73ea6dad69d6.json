This means that any legitimate reason for using force would be to protect oneself or one's interests against an unjust attack or threat. It's important to note that while this perspective aligns with international law, the use of political violence is typically considered illegal under international law unless it falls under specific exceptions such as self-defense under the United Nations Charter."
