Six months later, when the man was still in possession, he conveyed the land by quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend, who knew nothing of the deed to the cousin. The friend did not record his deed. The man then vacated the land, and the friend took possession. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides as follows: \"No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\" Recently, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed, and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all available defenses. For whom is the court likely to decide?\n\nA. For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.\nB. For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.\nC. For the friend, because a subsequent good- faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.\nD. For the friend, because he was first in possession.\n"

For the friend, because a subsequent good-faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.\n\nUnder the recording statutes you've provided, if the friend is a subsequent purchaser for value without notice and has recorded his deed before the cousin took action, he would have priority over the cousin. This is due to the principle that subsequent purchasers who record their deeds have priority over prior unrecorded interests, especially when they were unaware of any prior claims and acted in good faith. \n\nThe fact that the friend took possession of the land after the cousin's deed but before recording hers, along with the friend's lack of knowledge about the cousin's deed, likely qualifies him under the \"good faith\" requirement. Thus, unless the cousin can prove that the friend had actual knowledge of the prior deed, the court would likely side with the friend based on the recording act and principles of priority in property law."
