By writing the blog under your own name, you maintain integrity and accountability. Additionally, providing citations from reputable sources adds weight to the arguments being presented, making them more persuasive and trustworthy to readers. This method also allows you to control the narrative and directly address the concerns raised by the activists in a factual and professional manner."
