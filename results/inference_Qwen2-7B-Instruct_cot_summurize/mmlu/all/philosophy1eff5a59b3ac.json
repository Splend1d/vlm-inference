This view, often referred to as moral relativism or cultural relativism, suggests that moral principles are not universal truths but are instead based on the customs, beliefs, and norms of a particular society or culture. Different cultures might have different moral standards and practices, leading to varying perceptions of what is right or wrong.\n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because they either suggest that morality has no relevance to our lives (which contradicts the fact that most people do consider morality relevant in guiding their actions and decisions, or that it provides a comprehensive guide to conduct, which might be true for some systems of ethics but is not universally applicable due to the diversity of moral perspectives across cultures and individuals.\n\nOption D, \"none of the above,\" would be incorrect if one of the options accurately represents Wolf's claim about morality. Given the context provided, option A is the closest match to the claim that morality is merely a cultural artifact."
