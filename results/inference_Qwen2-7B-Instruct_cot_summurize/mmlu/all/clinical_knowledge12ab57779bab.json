                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic. \n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism occurs when one or more of the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). This condition often does not cause symptoms until the blood calcium levels become significantly elevated, sometimes leading to serious complications such as kidney stones, bone loss, and nerve damage.\n\nA. Calcitonin actually causes a decrease in plasma calcium levels by promoting the deposition of calcium into bones and inhibiting its release from the skeleton into the bloodstream.\n\nC. Vitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands. Instead, it is produced in the skin in response to sunlight and then converted to its active form in the liver and kidneys. The parathyroid glands regulate calcium levels through the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH).\n\nD. Oliguria (the production of small amounts of urine - is not a symptom of hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels). In fact, high blood calcium levels can lead to polyuria (increased urination) due to the body's attempt to eliminate excess calcium by increasing urine output."
