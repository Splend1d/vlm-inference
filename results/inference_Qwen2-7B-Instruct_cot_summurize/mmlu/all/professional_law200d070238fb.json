To help administer the new statute Congress created a seven-member agency, four members of which were appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. The agency was authorized to issue rules interpreting regulations prescribed under existing federal law. It was also authorized to issue \"cease and desist\" orders after hearings against private retail sellers of gasoline who \"intentionally engaged in price gouging. \" In this regard, violations of the cease and desist orders were made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency?\n\nA. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.\nB. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.\nC. Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U. S. Attorney General or the courts.\nD. Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.\n"

Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.\n\nThis argument relies on the principle of separation of powers and the concept of non-delegation doctrine as outlined in the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution grants Congress the power to make laws, but it does not grant Congress the power to delegate its legislative authority to administrative agencies without clear guidelines. When Congress enacts legislation that allows agencies to issue \"cease and desist\" orders with criminal penalties for violations, it may be seen as improperly delegating its legislative authority, especially when the enforcement power includes criminal sanctions. Such delegation could potentially lead to arbitrary actions and undermine judicial review, as the orders and their enforcement would lack the oversight provided by the judiciary in cases involving civil or criminal penalties.\n\nArguments A, C, and D also have some merit but are not as directly related to the constitutional principle at stake here. Argument A concerns the interpretation of federal laws, which can generally be delegated to administrative agencies within reasonable bounds. Argument C pertains to the enforcement of federal laws, which is typically done by the executive branch (headed by the President) or the judicial branch. While the appointment of agency members is important, it is less directly related to the specific issue of delegating law-making authority through \"cease and desist\" orders with criminal penalties."
