They believe this approach:\n\nA. encourages students to think pathologically: By avoiding confrontation or challenging ideas, students might not develop critical thinking skills or learn how to handle discomfort or adversity in a healthy way. This can lead to an over-reliance on protection mechanisms rather than developing resilience.\n\nB. ill-prepares them for the workforce: The real world often involves challenges and situations that may be uncomfortable or even offensive. If students are not accustomed to dealing with these situations through thoughtful discussion and problem-solving rather than avoidance, they may struggle to adapt in the professional environment.\n\nC. harms their ability to learn: Learning often involves grappling with difficult concepts, differing viewpoints, and sometimes uncomfortable truths. When institutionsally focused on protecting students from all forms of discomfort, they miss out on opportunities to learn important lessons about empathy, communication, and the value of engaging with challenging ideas.\n\nTherefore, institutionalizing vindictive protectiveness can negatively impact students' development in various aspects, including their cognitive abilities, emotional resilience, and preparation for future challenges."
