This reduces the total amount of pineapples available for sale at any given price, shifting the supply curve to the left. When the supply curve shifts to the left, it means there are fewer pineapples available at each price point, which leads to an increase in the equilibrium price and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity. \n\nSimultaneously, the discovery that may assist in avoiding cancer can lead to an increase in demand for pineapples if people perceive them as healthier or more beneficial due to this new information. However, since the impact of the drought on the supply is more immediate and directly impacts the quantity of pineapples available, the effect on equilibrium quantity is driven by the reduction in supply, hence the quantity decreases.\n\nTherefore, when considering these two events, the equilibrium price will likely increase ( but the equilibrium quantity will decrease."
