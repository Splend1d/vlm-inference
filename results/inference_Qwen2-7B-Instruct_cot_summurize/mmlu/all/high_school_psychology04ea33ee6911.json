Providing school-based group counseling to address issues such as study skills, attendance, decision making, problem solving, and goal setting.\n\nThis option addresses the broader issue of disruptive behaviors by focusing on developing skills and strategies that can benefit all students in the classroom, not just those who have already received discipline referrals. Group counseling sessions can help create a supportive environment where students can learn from each other and improve their behaviors collectively. It also allows for addressing underlying issues that might contribute to the disciplinary problems in a more holistic manner."
