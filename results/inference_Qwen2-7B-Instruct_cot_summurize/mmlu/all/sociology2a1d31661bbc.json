Industrial capitalism did indeed separate the middle-class home from the workplace, which reinforced traditional gender roles where women were expected to remain in the domestic sphere and focus on child-rearing and household management.\n\nB. Women have often been \"sidelined\" into particular fields, particularly those deemed \"feminine\" such as education, healthcare, and social work, which can limit opportunities for advancement and influence in other sectors.\n\nC. The difficulty in succeeding in \"malestream\" politics while maintaining one's femininity reflects broader societal expectations and biases that can discourage women from participating fully in political life. This includes both overt discrimination and more subtle forms of sexism that can undermine confidence and limit access to power.\n\nThus, all these points contribute to the systemic barriers that have historically kept women out of the public sphere."
