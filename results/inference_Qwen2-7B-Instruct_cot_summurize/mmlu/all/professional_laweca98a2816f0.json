Annoyed by the taunts, the player started an argument with the umpire. When the umpire told the player to be quiet and go back to his team's bench, the player became enraged and savagely attacked the umpire, hitting him in the head with a bat. The spectator who had taunted the player was overcome by humiliation and horror at what occurred, because he was a good friend of the umpire. The spectator suffered no physical injury, but experienced severe nervous shock and brooded over the incident for months. If the spectator asserts an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against the baseball player, the spectator will\n\nA. win, because the player's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nB. win, because he was present and witnessed the attack.\nC. lose, because he was partly responsible for causing the attack to occur.\nD. lose, because the umpire was not an immediate family member of the spectator.\n"

This tort is established when a person intentionally or recklessly engages in extreme and outrageous conduct which causes severe emotional distress to another person. The conduct must be so outrageous that it surpasses all bounds of decency and is utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\n\nHere, the baseball player's actions - starting an argument with the umpire, becoming enraged, and physically attacking the umpire with a bat - could certainly be considered extreme and outrageous. The fact that the spectator was a friend of the umpire and was present during the incident could also support the claim, as they were subjected to the traumatic event and suffered emotional distress as a result. However, the key factor would be the severity and outrageousness of the player's conduct.\n\nIt's important to note that laws regarding IIED can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another, and there might be additional factors or defenses that could impact the outcome of the case. But based on the information provided, option A seems like the most likely outcome."
