The primary goal of the Chartist movement, as implied in this context, was to advocate for universal male suffrage. This means that the movement sought to extend the right to vote to all adult males, without regard to property ownership or other restrictions that limited voting rights at the time. The reference to \"Household Suffrage\" in the passage indicates that there was a misunderstanding or misapplication of the term, which was meant to imply that voting rights should be extended to all householders, but it was perceived by some as excluding a significant portion of the population. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Universal male suffrage."
