Here's how their arguments might align with your options:\n\nA. **Is an example of mental filtering** - This could be seen as a fair characterization of their viewpoint. They might argue that when individuals or institutions selectively focus on negative or potentially offensive elements of a speaker's background or message, while ignoring or downplaying positive contributions or constructive dialogue, it exemplifies mental filtering. They likely view this as detrimental to open discourse.\n\nB. **Will only serve to promote intellectual homogeneity on college and universities** - This argument directly aligns with Lukianoff and Haidt\u2019s concern. By avoiding or censoring speakers who might provoke debate or challenge prevailing views, they argue, universities risk becoming echo chambers where diverse perspectives are not heard, leading to a homogenization of thought and a stifling of intellectual growth.\n\nC. **Will encourage students to disregard positive aspects of a person's history** - This point touches on a broader criticism they might make about the culture of sensitivity and trigger warnings. If students or institutions leaders are overly focused on avoiding discomfort or offense, they might fail to appreciate the full context of a speaker's work or life, potentially overlooking the positive impacts or contributions of someone's career despite past controversies or unpopular opinions.\n\nD. **All of the above** - Given the alignment of their critiques with each option, this choice would also be accurate. Lukianoff and Haidt would likely agree that disinviting speakers based on fear of offense can lead to mental filtering, promotes intellectual homogeneity, and encourages students to overlook the positive aspects of a person's history in the name of avoiding controversy or discomfort."
