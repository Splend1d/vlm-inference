You buy a 1957 Chevy from a friend.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period. Buying an existing asset, like a used car, does not contribute to the production of new goods or services, so it does not affect GDP.\n\nB. The Department of Transportation repaving a road: This would increase GDP as it represents an investment in infrastructure.\n\nC. Your friends make a music CD that doesn't sell any copies: If the music CD is produced but not sold, it could potentially be considered part of inventory, which might lead to a change in GDP depending on accounting rules ( under the accrual basis of accounting, the production of the CD would increase inventory and thus GDP.\n\nD. A college buys computers: This purchase would increase GDP as it represents an expenditure on capital goods, which contributes to the economy's productive capacity."
