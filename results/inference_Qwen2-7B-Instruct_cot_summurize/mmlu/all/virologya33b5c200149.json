Enveloped spherical particles with an icosahedral structure\n\nTogaviruses are belong to the Togaviridae family, which are enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes. The viral particles have a spherical shape and exhibit an icosahedral symmetry. This means that they have a 20-sided geometric shape, which is typical for many viruses. The outer envelope of togaviruses comes from the host cell membrane, making them distinct from non-enveloped viruses like those in families such as the Retroviridae or Caliciviridae. The icosahedral capsid encases the viral genome and is made up of protein subunits. The viral envelope is typically composed of glycoproteins that help the virus bind to and enter host cells."
