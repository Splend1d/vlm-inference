However, in general terms, a sedan is likely to flip over when it slides sideways into a curb at speeds higher than what an average driver could control safely. \n\nConsidering typical driving conditions and the ability for a driver to regain control, a reasonable estimate would be:\n\nB. 20 mph\n\nThis is a speculative answer since the exact speed can vary widely based on specific circumstances. At such speeds, a car might start to lose control and potentially flip if it hits a curb or uneven surface. Higher speeds (like option C (40 mph or D 80 mph) would increase the likelihood of flipping due to greater forces involved. Option D, 80 mpg, is not a realistic speed as it represents miles per gallon, not miles per hour."
