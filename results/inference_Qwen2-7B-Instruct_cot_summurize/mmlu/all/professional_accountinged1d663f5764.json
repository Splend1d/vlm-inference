In this scenario, Rigg owns 85% of Steele and 40% of Urco, and Steele owns 50% of Urco. This indicates that there is a chain of ownership between the three corporations, allowing them to form an affiliated group. Therefore, the group consisting of Rigg, Steele, and Urco qualifies as an affiliated group and may join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return."
