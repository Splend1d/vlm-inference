I and II.\n\nExplanation:\n\nI. \u03a3_{v\u2208V} degree(v) is even.\n\nThis statement is true due to the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in an undirected graph is equal to twice the number of edges. Since each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices, the total sum of degrees must be even.\n\nII. |E| \u2265 |V| \u2212 1\n\nThis statement is true for a connected graph, which is defined as a graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices. This is known as the inequality for trees or the minimum number of edges required for a graph to be connected. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles and has exactly |V| - 1 edges. Any additional edge added to a tree would create a cycle, but it would still maintain connectivity. Therefore, for any connected graph, the number of edges must be at least |V| - 1.\n\nIII. G has at least one vertex with degree 1.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. It depends on the specific structure of the graph. For example, a cycle graph (which is a connected graph where every vertex has degree 2, except for the start/end vertex which has degree 1, but this does not apply to all graphs. There can be graphs that are connected without having any vertex with degree 1. Consider a simple path graph like V = {a, b, c}, E = {(a,b), (b,c)}. Here, both vertices b and c have degree 1, but this is not a requirement for all connected graphs.\n\nTherefore, only statements I and II must be true for a connected, undirected graph."
