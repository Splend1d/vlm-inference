The symptoms can range from mild skin irritation to severe allergic reactions like anaphylaxis.\n\nThe foods that are most commonly associated with latex-fruit syndrome are:\n\nA. Avocado - Yes, some individuals with latex allergy might react to avocado as it shares a similar protein structure with latex.\n\nB. Mango - Similarly, mango is another fruit that might trigger an allergic reaction in people with latex allergy because of the shared protein structure.\n\nC. Peach - Peach is another fruit that could potentially cause an allergic reaction in someone with a latex allergy due to cross-reacting proteins.\n\nD. Figs - Figs are are also known to be a part of the group of foods that can trigger allergic reactions in individuals with latex allergy.\n\nSo, based on the options given, the correct answer would be D. Figs, because while they do share some similar proteins with latex, there is less documented evidence of cross-reaction compared to the other options mentioned ( avocado, mango, and peach. However, it's important to note that everyone's immune system reacts differently, so even if there's less commonality, it doesn't entirely rule out the possibility of an individual experiencing an allergic reaction to any of these foods. Always consult with a healthcare professional or allergist for personalized advice and guidance."
