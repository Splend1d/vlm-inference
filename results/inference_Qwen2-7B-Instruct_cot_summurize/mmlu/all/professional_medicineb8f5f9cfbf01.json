Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no routine medications. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland confirms a solid, 1-cm nodule. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?\n\nA. CT scan of the neck\nB. Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule\nC. Radionuclide thyroid scan\nD. Thyroidectomy\n"

Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule\n\nIn this scenario, the most appropriate next step in evaluating the thyroid nodule would be a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). This procedure allows for the collection of cells from the nodule, which can then be analyzed under a microscope or through other laboratory techniques to determine if the nodule is benign or malignant. \n\nThe other options listed are either too invasive (CT scan) or not diagnostic enough (radionuclide thyroid scan), or unnecessary at this stage (thyroidectomy). A CT scan of the neck might be considered later if there's suspicion of metastasis or if the FNAB results are inconclusive, but it's not typically the first step after an ultrasound confirmation of a solid nodule. A radionuclide thyroid scan could help identify areas of increased thyroid activity, but it does not provide information about the nature of a specific nodule. Thyroidectomy is typically reserved for cases where the nodule is suspicious for malignancy and FNAB results are not definitive, or when there are are other indications for surgery."
