A state statute provides that: \"state universities can permit the use of their lecture halls to the public for worthwhile programs of public benefit, upon approval of the school board. \"The appropriate school board refused to make a university lecture hall available to the man on the grounds that the proposed lecture was not of worthwhile benefit to the public. As a result, the man brought suit in a state court against the school board and requested injunctive relief requiring the board to allow him the use of the lecture hall. The trial court denied relief and dismissed the suit. The judgment was affirmed by the state appellate court, and is now before the U. S. Supreme Court. In analyzing the state statute, which of the following statements is least accurate?\n\nA. The statute is unconstitutionally overbroad, because it may result in the exclusion of protected speech as well as unprotected speech.\nB. The statute, as applied to the man, does not violate his First Amendment rights because his proposed speech is not political and, therefore, not among the classes of speech that are protected.\nC. Indirect speech, regulations are only permissible if necessary to serve compelling state interests.\nD. The statute is a prior restraint on speech, which unconstitutionally vests unfettered discretion in the school board to decide who may use university lecture halls.\n"

The statute, as applied to the man, does not violate his First Amendment rights because his proposed speech is not political and, therefore, not among the classes of speech that are protected.\n\nThis statement is least accurate because it incorrectly assumes that the content of the proposed speech ( whether it is political or not - is the determining factor for its protection under the First Amendment. The First Amendment's protection of free speech applies broadly, regardless of the subject matter of the speech. The more relevant considerations in this context would be whether the speech involves an important public debate (like religious freedom or philosophical discourse), whether it is aimed at educating the public, and whether there is any evidence of the intent to cause harm. The fact that the speech might not be considered 'political' does not necessarily exempt it from First Amendment protections."
