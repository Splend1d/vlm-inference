The amount of energy released depends on the type and molecular weight of the substance. \n\nPalmitic acid is a long-chain fatty acid, and when oxidized, it releases more energy per gram than glucose or proteins (like leucine, which is an amino acid. Alcohol, on the other hand, is not typically used as an energy source in the body's metabolism and thus does not release as much energy per gram compared to fats or carbohydrates."
