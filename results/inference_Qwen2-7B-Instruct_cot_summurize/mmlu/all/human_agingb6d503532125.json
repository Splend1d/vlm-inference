Perceived as support\n\nPerceived social support refers to an individual's belief that they have the resources, assistance, and understanding from their social network when needed. This perception of having a supportive social network can lead to feelings of comfort, reduced stress, and improved overall health and well-being. It doesn't necessarily need to be very emotional or unexpected, nor does it need to be external over internal, for it to have a positive influence. The key aspect is the individual's perception of having support available to them."
