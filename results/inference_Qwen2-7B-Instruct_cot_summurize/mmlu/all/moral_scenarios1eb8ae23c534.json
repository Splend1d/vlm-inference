Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character are evaluated based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Ironing clothes while one's children are playing outside is generally not considered morally wrong. It is a responsible action that ensures the clothes are ready for use, and there is no direct harm or risk involved in this activity that would cause concern under typical circumstances.\n\nScenario 2: Allowing one's son to dress up as a serial killer and walk around town with a fake kitchen knife can be considered morally wrong. This action could potentially lead to causing fear or distress among people in the community, especially if they do not know it's a costume play. Additionally, it might involve some level of deception, depending on how the son portrays himself, which could be seen as misleading or inappropriate in a public setting. It's important to ensure that such activities are safe, respectful, and do not cause harm or alarm to others."
