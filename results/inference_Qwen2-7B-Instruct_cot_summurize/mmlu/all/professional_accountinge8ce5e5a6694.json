Liable to pay State on the due date of the note.\n\nWhen one party (in this case, Royal) co-signs a note with another party (here, Brown), they both become jointly and severally liable for the debt. This means that if the primary borrower (Royal) is unable to fulfill their obligations, the lender can pursue either or both parties for repayment. The fact that Royal is later adjudicated mentally incompetent does not discharge Royal's liability under the note, nor does it automatically relieve Brown of their liability. \n\nIn the context of suretyship, a \"compensateded surety\" refers to a situation where the surety has received compensation or collateral from the principal debtor (in this case, Royal). However, this term isn't standard in legal terms related to suretyship and doesn't typically affect the surety's liability unless specifically provisions are included in the agreement.\n\nTherefore, unless there are specific provisions within the note stating otherwise, or unless Brown is discharged by the lender after due process, Brown remains liable for the full amount of the note to the lender, State Bank."
