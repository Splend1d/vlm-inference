At the first stage of ethical inquiry, she would likely advocate for using terms that are:\n\nA. as descriptive as possible.\n\nThis means that the language used should capture the essence and characteristics of virtues without imposing any particular moral evaluation or bias. The goal is to understand what the virtue entails in its most fundamental sense before engaging with more normative questions about its value or application. This descriptive approach helps lay a solid foundation for further ethical deliberation by ensuring that all participants in the discussion are referring to the same core aspects of the virtue under consideration."
