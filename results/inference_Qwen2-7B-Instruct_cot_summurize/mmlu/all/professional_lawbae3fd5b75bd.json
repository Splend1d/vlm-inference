                    "text": "A state recently enacted a statute requiring the following of all firms that do business with and for the state (defined generally as selling goods or providing services to the state, its agencies, or subdivisions): \u0080\u0094 Such businesses must purchase insurance only from insurance companies chartered in the state and thus be subject to regulation by the state insurance commissioner; \u0080\u0094 In hiring any unskilled laborers for employment in connection with state business, preference must be given to citizens of the state; \u0080\u0094 Nonresident aliens shall be prohibited from engaging in any state related business activities; \u0080\u0094 All buildings constructed for the state must have roofs composed of adobe, which is composed of yellow silt or clay deposits found only in the state. The proposed statute's preamble recites that its provisions will ensure: \u0080\u0094 responsible insurance coverage for all those who do business with the state; \u0080\u0094 an increased standard of living for the citizens who comprise the state's labor force; \u0080\u0094 the lowest possible expenditures by the state government; and \u0080\u0094 a beautiful, uniform aesthetic decor for all new state buildings. In evaluating the constitutionality of the state statute under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, which of the following would be most relevant?\n\nA. The number of aliens presently residing in the state.\nB. The necessity for the enactment of this particular statute.\nC. The treaties and immigration laws of the United States.\nD. The overall unemployment rate in the United States.\n"

The treaties and immigration laws of the United States.\n\nThe Supremacy Clause of Article VI states that the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties made under the authority of the United States are the supreme law of the land. Therefore, when evaluating the constitutionality of a state statute under the Supremacy Clause, it is crucial to consider whether the statute conflicts with federal treaties or immigration laws. In this case, the prohibition on nonresident aliens engaging in state-related business activities might potentially conflict with federal immigration policies or treaties involving the rights of foreign nationals. Thus, assessing the relationship between this state statute and federal immigration laws would be most relevant to determining its constitutionality under the Supremacy Clause."
