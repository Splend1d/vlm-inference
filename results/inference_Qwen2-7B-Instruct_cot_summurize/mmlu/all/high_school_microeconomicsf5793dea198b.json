The wage paid to all units of labor being $4.50 alone cannot be used to calculate the number of units of labor hired without additional context such as total payroll cost, the number of workers, or the hours worked by each worker. \n\nFor example, if the total payroll cost was given and it was known that each unit of labor costs $4.50, then you could divide the total payroll cost by $4.50 to find out how many units of labor were hired.\n\nTherefore, with the information provided, none of the options A, B, C, or D can be definitively chosen. More information is needed to answer this question accurately."
