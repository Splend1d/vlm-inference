As part of its case-in-chief, the prosecution called a police officer who testified that at about 11:30 a. m. one mile east of the town line, he set up a radar apparatus. The officer testified that, with the use of tuning forks, he found the radar apparatus was accurate. The officer also stated that he had five years of experience in operating such radar devices. Furthermore, the officer testified that the radar's mechanism for recording the speed of vehicles by means of an ink line drawn mechanically on a roll of paper was also functioning properly. Upon further questioning, the officer stated that at about 1:30 p. m. , the needle of the speed indicator dial of the radar apparatus showed the driver's car passing his location at 65 m. p. h. If the driver's attorney makes an objection to the introduction of the radar finding that the driver was traveling at a speed of 65 m. p. h. , the court will most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the radar results are not conclusive evidence of speeding.\nB. sustain the objection, because radar is not a technique recognized by the scientific community.\nC. overrule the objection, because the court will take judicial notice of the accuracy of such tests.\nD. overrule the objection, because the radar results would be construed as an admission against interest.\n"

The fact that the officer has five years of experience in operating such devices and confirmed the radar's accuracy using tuning forks strengthens the credibility of the evidence. In this context, the court may find that the radar reading is admissible as evidence of the vehicle's speed at the time it passed the officer's location. However, it's important to note that the court's decision can vary based on specific legal rules and precedents within the jurisdiction in question."
