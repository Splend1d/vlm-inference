The manufacturer answered, denying all liability and stating that it had never supplied its insulation to the worker's employer. The worker's attorney deposed the manufacturer's president, and the manufacturer's attorney deposed the worker. Immediately thereafter, the manufacturer moved for summary judgment on the ground that the worker had no evidence showing that the insulation had ever been used by the worker's employer. What would be the worker's best response to the motion for summary judgment?\n\nA. Argue that more time is needed for additional discovery to show the manufacturer's liability, and attach a declaration describing the desired discovery.\nB. Argue that the motion should be denied, because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.\nC. Argue that the motion should be denied, because the manufacturer failed to attach any evidence to its motion to show that the insulation was not used by the worker's employer.\nD. Make a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that the manufacturer has introduced no evidence to show that its insulation did not harm the worker.\n"

Argue that the motion should be denied, because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the worker's best response to the motion for summary judgment would be to argue that the central issue is the credibility of the manufacturer regarding their claims about not supplying insulation to the worker's employer. This is a question that should be decided by a jury, as it involves assessing the reliability of the manufacturer's testimony and the weight of the evidence presented. The worker does not need to provide additional evidence or a declaration at this stage, as the focus is on the appropriateneness of granting summary judgment based on the existing record."
