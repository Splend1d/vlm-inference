Over the past week, she has had nausea related to excess coughing. Over the past year, she has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled \u03b2-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. A biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show which of the following?\n\nA. Mesothelioma\nB. Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast\nC. Multiple endocrine neoplasia\nD. Non-small cell lung carcinoma\n"

Non-small cell lung carcinoma\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, a productive cough, and weight loss, are consistent with advanced lung cancer. The location of the mass and its relation to the chest wall suggest it is originating from the lung. Additionally, the presence of lymphadenopathy (i.e., enlarged lymph nodes, and a mass in the right adrenal gland are also indicative of malignancy, often suggesting metastasis. The history of smoking significantly increases the risk of developing lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung carcinoma.\n\nMesothelioma ( (Option A) could be considered given the mention of a nontender lymph node and the possibility of pleural involvement, but it is less common than lung cancer in this scenario, especially without direct evidence of pleural involvement or mesothelial proliferation on imaging.\n\nMetastatic adenocarcinima of the breast ( (Option B) could potentially be a cause if the patient had a history of breast cancer, but the lack of typical symptoms associated with breast cancer spread to the lungs makes this option less probable.\n\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia ( (Option C) refers to a group of genetic disorders involving multiple endocrine glands, and while it can lead to various symptoms including weight loss and hormonal imbalances, it does not typically present with the specific clinical features mentioned here, which are more indicative of lung cancer.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, non-small cell lung carcinoma is the most appropriate choice."
