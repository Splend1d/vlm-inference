However, statistically, single women might face more challenges due to lower average earnings, fewer years of work, and often relying solely on their savings and possibly Social Security benefits without the financial support that married couples or dual-income households might have. This can make budgeting, covering healthcare costs, and ensuring financial security during retirement particularly challenging.\n\nThat being, it's important to note that every person's situation is unique, and factors like personal savings, investment returns, retirement account contributions, health insurance coverage, and living costs in retirement also play significant roles in how individuals manage their finances post-retirement."
