                    "text": "To find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by \\(f(x) = \\frac{x}{1 + x^3}\\) and the x-axis about the x-axis, we can use the disk method from integral calculus. The volume \\(V\\) of the solid formed by rotating the region under a curve \\(y = f(x)\\) from \\(x = a\\) to \\(x = b\\) around the x-axis is given by the integral:\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 dx\\]\n\nFirst, we need to determine the interval over which \\(f(x) = \\frac{x}{1 + x^3}\\) intersects the x-axis. This occurs when \\(f(x) = 0\\), so:\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{1 + x^3} = 0\\]\n\nThis implies that \\(x = 0\\), but since this doesn't give us an interval for integration ( (as it's a single point), we look for where the function changes sign or behavior more generally. For this specific function, we might also consider finding its roots explicitly, but given the form, it's clear that it will intersect the x-axis only at \\(x = 0\\). \n\nHowever, to find the bounds of integration, we should actually identify where \\(f(x) = 0\\), which, as mentioned, happens at \\(x = 0\\). But, to fully answer the question, we need to identify the other boundaries of the region, which would be determined by where \\(f(x) = 0\\) in terms of real values, which is just at \\(x = 0\\). Given the nature of the function, it's not immediately obvious what the other boundary is without further analysis or context, suggesting there might have been an oversight in specifying the limits of integration in the question itself.\n\nAssuming the intention was to describe a region with finite width and height ( typically, this kind of problem would specify the interval on which \\(f(x)\\) is considered, often involving finding where the function intersects the x-axis or reaches a certain value. Without this information, we cannot directly compute the volume based solely on the given description.\n\nGiven the options provided ( A. \u03c0/3 B. \u03c0/4 C. \u03c0 D. 2\u03c0, these suggest a specific interval might have been intended, but without additional information about the bounds of integration, we cannot accurately compute the volume described.\n\nIf we were to assume a typical scenario where the function is considered from some \\(a\\) to some \\(b\\) ( where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are are points where \\(f(x)\\) intersects the x-axis or reaches significant values, we would need those specific values to proceed. However, based on the information given, the correct approach would involve identifying \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and then applying the formula for volume of revolution accordingly.\n\nSince no specific interval was provided in the question, let's consider a hypothetical case where the function intersects the x-axis at \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 1\\), which would imply the region of interest spans from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\).\n\nThus, the volume \\(V\\) would be calculated as:\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(\\frac{x}{1 + x^3}\\right)^2 dx\\]\n\nThis integral requires careful evaluation, potentially involving substitution or other techniques beyond the scope of this response. However, the key step involves squaring the function, integrating over the specified interval, and then evaluating the definite integral to find the volume.\n\nGiven the complexity and the lack of explicit calculation steps here, the focus should be on understanding the process rather than providing a numerical answer. If the intent was to solve a specific problem with the given function over a particular interval, the steps outlined provide a framework for doing so."
