This action alignses with moral standards of protecting someone from harm due to a known allergy.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is acting irresponsibly by disregarding the concerns of their neighbors and potentially causing disturbance to their living environment. This action conflicts with moral standards that encourage consideration of others' rights and comfort.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
