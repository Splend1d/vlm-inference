The formula for calculating the frequency of genotypes in a population under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is p^2 + 2pq + q^2, where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles.\n\nIn this case, the frequency of one allele is 0.6 and of the other is 0.4. \n\nThe frequency of homozygous dominant individuals (AA (which corresponds to p^2) would be 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.036.\nThe frequency of homozygous recessive individuals aa ( which corresponds to q^2) would be 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16.\nAnd the frequency of heterozygous individuals Aa ( which corresponds to 2pq) would be 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.16.\n\nSo the frequency of heterozygous individuals would be 0.16, which is not among the options provided. It seems there might have been some misunderstanding in the question or the options. If we were to choose the closest option based on the calculation, it would be D. 0.32, but please note that this is an approximation and the precise answer according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium calculations would be 0.16."
