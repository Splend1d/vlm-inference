It increases crop yields and soil fertility and minimizes pathogen infection and pest infestation. \n\nCrop rotation helps in maintaining and improving soil health by alternating the types of crops planted. Different crops have different nutrient requirements, which can help replenish the soil's nutrients over time. Also, certain pests and diseases are specific to certain plants, so rotating crops can prevent these issues by interrupting the life cycles of these pests and diseases. Additionally, crop rotation can lead to increased yields as it promotes healthier soil conditions and reduces the need for chemical inputs like fertilizers and pesticides."
