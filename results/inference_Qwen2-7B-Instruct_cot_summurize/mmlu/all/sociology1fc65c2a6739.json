This is done under controlled conditions where all other variables are held constant. The process involves formulating a hypothesis, designing an experiment to test this hypothesis, collecting data, analyzing the results, and drawing conclusions based on empirical evidence.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not accurately describe the core aspects of the experimental method in idealized scientific views:\n\nA. Testing out new research methods does happen in science, but it's not the central focus of the experimental method. The main goal is to test hypotheses about cause-and-effect relationships.\n\nC. Personal beliefs and values should not influence scientific research. Objectivity is crucial in science to ensure that findings are valid and reliable.\n\nD. Interpreting data subjectively is not appropriate in the experimental method. Scientists aim to interpret data objectively, using statistical analysis and other rigorous methods to support or refute their hypotheses."
