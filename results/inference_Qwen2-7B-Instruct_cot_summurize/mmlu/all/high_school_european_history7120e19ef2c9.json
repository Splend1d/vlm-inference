And for what it does with the memory of the past. In remembering, you will help your own people vanquish the ghosts that hover over its history. Remember: a community that does not come to terms with the dead will continue to traumatize the living.\nWe remember Auschwitz and all that it symbolizes because we believe that, in spite of the past and its horrors, the world is worthy of salvation; and salvation, like redemption, can be found only in memory.\nElie Wiesel, \"Reflections of a Survivor,\" 1987\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Wiesel asserted that remembering the Holocaust\n\nA. was necessary for the German people to become reconciled to their own history\nB. hindered the healing process for the German people\nC. would ensure that it never occurred again\nD. would allow the Jews to forgive the German people\n"

Wiesel asserted that remembering the Holocaust was necessary for the German people to come to terms with their history and facilitate reconciliation. He believed that acknowledging the past, including the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, was crucial for both the survivors and the perpetrators' descendants to heal and move forward. This perspective emphasizes the importance of historical remembrance as a means of personal and communal healing rather than as a tool for forgiveness or as a guarantee against future occurrences of such events."
