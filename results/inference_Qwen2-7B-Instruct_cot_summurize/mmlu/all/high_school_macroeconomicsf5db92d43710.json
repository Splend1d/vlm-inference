This increased consumer spending leads to higher demand for goods and services, which in turn can cause an increase in real GDP ( as businesses produce more to meet the demand.\n\nAt the same time, if the President is also increasing spending on the military, this is an additional boost to aggregate demand, further stimulating production and potentially leading to even higher GDP.\n\nHowever, this increased demand can also lead to higher prices, especially if the economy is already operating near full capacity or if there are are constraints in supply. This situation can contribute to inflation, causing the price level to increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: GDP increases and the price level increases."
