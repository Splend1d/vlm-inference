Singer is known for his utilitarian approach to ethics, which emphasizes maximizing overall happiness or utility. He argues that we have a moral duty to help others in need, even if it means sacrificing our own interests, rather than merely engaging in charitable acts out of goodwill or personal choice. This perspective can be seen as undermining the traditional view that duties are obligations one has by moral or legal rule, while charity refers to voluntary acts of kindness without the expectation of return.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Singer's views can also be interpreted as contributing to discussions on other distinctions mentioned in the options, such as egoism vs. altruism ( (as he challenges purely self-interested actions) or positive vs. negative rights ( (as he argues for the importance of positive rights, such as the right to healthcare). But, in the context of the question, the most direct answer would be A: duty and charity."
