The head of a phospholipid is hydrophobic, and the tails are hydrophilic.\n\nActually, in a phospholipid molecule, the head ( typically containing a phosphate group, is hydrophilic because it can interact with water. The tails, which are usually composed of fatty acid chains, are hydrophobic as they do not mix well with water. This property allows phospholipids to form bilayers in aqueous environments, creating a structure where the hydrophilic heads face outward and the hydrophobic tails face inward."
