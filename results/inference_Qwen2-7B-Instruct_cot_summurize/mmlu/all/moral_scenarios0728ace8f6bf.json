This action is generally not considered morally wrong unless it's cheating or dishonesty in an academic setting is explicitly prohibited and the rules are broken. However, if the context is a personal study or a situation where cheating is not an issue (like self-study for a hobby, this might not be seen as wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves drying fine china with a towel. This can be seen as potentially wrong depending on the context. Fine china is often handled with care to prevent damage. Using a towel could lead to scratches or other types of damage. While this action isn't universally considered immoral, it could be seen as neglectful or careless, especially if the fine china is valuable or has sentimental value.\n\nThus, the first scenario is not typically viewed as morally wrong, while the second one could be seen as such under certain circumstances."
