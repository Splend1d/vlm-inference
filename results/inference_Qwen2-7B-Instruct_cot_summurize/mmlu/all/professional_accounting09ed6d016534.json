Accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the registrant for services other than as a member of the board.\n\nAccording to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), members of an issuer's audit committee must maintain their independence. Accepting consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the company they serve could potentially compromise their objectivity and independence in carrying out their duties. This includes services other than being a board member, as it might create a conflict of interest that could influence their judgment when assessing financial reports and internal controls. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nA. Establish procedures for employees to anonymously report fraud: This is a positive action that aligns with the role of an audit committee, which is to ensure proper governance, oversight, and compliance within the company.\n\nB. Be responsible for the compensation of any registered public accounting firm employed by the registrant to provide an audit report: Audit committees play a crucial role in overseeing the appointment, retention, and termination of auditors, as well as reviewing their independence and performance.\n\nD. Engage independent counsel as deemed necessary to carry out their duties: This is a recommended practice as it allows the audit committee to seek additional expertise when needed to fulfill their responsibilities effectively."
