Internal-use R&D expenses, which are aimed at developing products or processes that will not be sold but will be used by the company for its own purposes, are generally capitalized and amortized over their useful lives. External-use R&D expenses, on the other hand, which are aimed at creating products or processes intended for sale or for licensing to others, are generally expensed as incurred.\n\nIn this case, the expenditures can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. **Labor and material costs incurred in producing a prototype ($100,000)**: These costs are likely part of the development phase leading up to the creation of a product ready for market, so they would typically be considered external use R&D costs.\n2. **Cost of testing the prototype ($40,000)**: Testing is often an integral part of the development process to ensure the product meets quality standards before it is released to the market, making these costs also likely to be external use R&D costs.\n3. **Legal costs to file a patent ($50,000)**: This cost is related to the protection of the product's intellectual property, which is a key aspect of bringing a new product to market. It's considered an external use R&D cost because it's directly associated with the product being developed for external use.\n\nGiven this categorization, the total amount of costs that should be expensed as research and development costs would be the sum of the labor and material costs plus the cost of testing the prototype, as these are are typically considered upfront expenses for a product being developed for external use:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total R&D expenses} = \\$100,000 + \\$40,000 = \\$140,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. $140,000**."
