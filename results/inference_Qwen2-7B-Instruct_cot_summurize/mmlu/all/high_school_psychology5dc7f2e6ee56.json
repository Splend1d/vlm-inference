This concept is closely associated with an external locus of control, which refers to the belief that outcomes are determined by factors outside one's own actions or abilities. \n\nThe other options do not directly relate to learned helplessness:\n\nA. The Barnum effect refers to the tendency for people to believe general statements about themselves because they believe them to be true and specific to them, regardless of how vague the statement is.\n\nB. Self-serving bias involves the tendency to attribute successes to internal factors ( like ability, effort, and skill, while blaming failures on external factors like luck, chance, or other people.\n\nD. Unconditional positive regard is a concept from humanistic psychology referring to the therapist's attitude of acceptance and support towards the client, regardless of their thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. It is not directly related to learned helplessness."
