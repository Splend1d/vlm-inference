Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the following background facts persuaded Europeans to engage in the actions described in the passage?\n\nA. China had recently placed an embargo on exports of silk.\nB. The price of Chinese tea had risen higher than European buyers found acceptable.\nC. China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.\nD. China's emperor had repeatedly insulted the British ambassador.\n"

The price of Chinese tea had risen higher than European buyers found acceptable. \n\nDuring the period leading up to the Opium Wars, Britain was heavily dependent on China for tea, which was a popular and essential commodity in Europe. The British East India Company, which controlled most of the tea trade between Britain and China, faced significant challenges due to the high cost of Chinese tea. This, combined with the British desire to establish a profitable trade relationship with China, led them to look for alternative means to increase their trade surplus.\n\nOne solution they found was through the introduction and trade of opium. The British had discovered that opium could be grown in their colonies, particularly in India, and that it could be smuggled into China, where it was highly sought after despite its illegal status. The opium trade provided a way for Britain to balance their trade deficit with China, as they could sell opium to Chinese consumers in exchange for tea and other goods, thus increasing their exports to China while decreasing their imports.\n\nHowever, this practice was met with resistance from Chinese officials like Lin Zexu, who were concerned about the negative health effects of opium and its potential to destabilize society. Lin's letter to Queen Victoria highlights his moral and ethical objections to the opium trade, emphasizing the destructive impact it had on individuals and society."
