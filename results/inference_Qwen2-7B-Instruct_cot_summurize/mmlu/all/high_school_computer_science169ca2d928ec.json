So, `1**4` is evaluated first, which equals 1 (because any number to the power of 4 (or any positive even number) will be 1 if the base is 1. Then, the result is multiplied by 4, resulting in 4 * 1 = 4. However, there's a misunderstanding in the explanation based on the provided options; the correct step-by-step evaluation should be:\n\n1. `1**4` equals 1.\n2. `4 * 1` equals 4.\n\nSo, the correct answer considering the operations and their precedence would actually align with the evaluation process described but not directly listed among the options provided. Given the typical precedence rules and the operations involved, the correct interpretation leading to the options should clarify that `1**4` results in 1 ( due to the nature of exponentiation with a base of 1, and then multiplying that by 4 yields 4, which seems to contradict the provided options directly. The closest correct evaluation based on the operations given, considering a potential oversight in option formulation or interpretation, would align with understanding the direct outcome of `4 * 1` which indeed is 4, not matching any provided choices exactly as stated."
