The buyer paid 10% of the purchase price and financed the rest by executing a promissory note and purchase money mortgage to the builder. A year later, the buyer missed several mortgage payments to the builder and became unable to make payments to the builder and became unable to make payments. During that year, property values in the neighborhood declined substantially. The builder suggested that the buyer deed the house back to the builder to settle all claims and avoid the costs and other disadvantages of foreclosure. The buyer deeded the house back to the builder. Does the builder now own fee simple title to the house?\n\nA. No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.\nB. No, because the owner of a personal residence cannot waive the right to foreclosure.\nC. Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.\nD. Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.\n"

Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.\n\nWhen the buyer deeded the house back to the builder, it likely constituted a legal action known as a \"deed in lieu of foreclosure.\" This is a voluntary transfer of property ownership from the borrower (the buyer in this case - to the lender (the builder in this case - as a way to avoid the lengthy and costly process of foreclosure. \n\nGiven that both parties agreed to this arrangement, and assuming there were no illegal or unfair terms involved, the builder would typically receive clear title to the property. This means that the builder now owns the house with fee simple title, which is the highest form of ownership in real estate, allowing complete control and ownership without any encumbrances or restrictions. \n\nThe other options presented do not accurately describe the situation described:\n\nA. The deed back does not necessarily constitute a disguised mortgage; it is an alternative to foreclosure.\nB. There is no inherent prohibition against waiving the right to foreclosure if both parties agree to an alternative solution.\nC. Equitable redemption is not directly applicable here, as it refers to the borrower's rights to regain ownership after a foreclosure sale, not to a deed in lieu of foreclosure scenario."
