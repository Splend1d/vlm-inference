It is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( by the states that have ratified it. \n\nB. The UN Human Rights Council is not strictly a treaty-based mechanism; it was established to promote and protect human rights around the world, but its role and functions do not directly stem from a specific treaty.\n\nC. The UN Universal Periodic Review ( is also not a treaty-based mechanism. It is a process under which all UN Member States undergo a review of their human rights situations every four years.\n\nD. The UN special mandates refer to a group of independent human rights experts who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council or the Economic and Social Council to monitor human rights situations in specific countries or to address thematic issues. These mandates are not necessarily based on a treaty, depending on the context."
