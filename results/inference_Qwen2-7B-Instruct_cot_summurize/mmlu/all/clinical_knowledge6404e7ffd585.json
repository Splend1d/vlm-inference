This is because oxygen is required to fully oxidize glucose in the Krebs cycle and electron transfer chain, which are part of the aerobic energy production process. As such, when oxygen levels are insufficient, the body switches to anaerobic pathways like glycolysis, which do not require oxygen, to produce ATP quickly. \n\nThis does not mean that the TCA cycle or electron transfer chain cease functioning completely during high-intensity exercise, but their contributions are significantly reduced compared to rest or low-intensity exercise where oxygen supply can support them more efficiently. Therefore, the correct answer would be B: anaerobic energy production."
