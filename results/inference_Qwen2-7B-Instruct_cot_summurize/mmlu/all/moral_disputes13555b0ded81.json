                    "text": "The statement provided by Pogge regarding the annual death-toll from poverty-related causes is not specified in your question. However, Tom Pogge, a political philosopher, has indeed discussed the significant impact of global poverty on mortality rates.\n\nAccording to some estimates and analyses presented by scholars like Tom Pogge, the death toll from poverty-related causes can be quite high. For instance, if we consider that a significant portion of the global population lives in conditions that exacerbate health issues and reduce life expectancy due to factors such as lack of access to healthcare, nutritious food, and safe living environments, it's plausible to suggest that poverty-related deaths could account for a substantial fraction of total human deaths each year.\n\nGiven the options you've provided:\n\nA. around one quarter of all human deaths.\nB. around one third of all human deaths.\nC. around one half of all human deaths.\n\nWithout specifying the exact percentage or source, it's difficult to definitively choose between these options based solely on general knowledge. However, if we were to make an educated guess based on the severity of poverty's impact on health outcomes globally, option B ( around one third of all human deaths, might seem plausible given the systemic challenges faced by impoverished populations.\n\nIt's important to note that the precise figure would depend on the specific data and methodology used in any given analysis, and different studies may provide varying estimates. Therefore, without a direct quote or more detailed information from Tom Pogge or other reputable sources, it's challenging to select the most accurate answer among the options provided."
