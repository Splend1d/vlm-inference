During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The appellate court should\n\nA. affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.\nB. affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.\nC. reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.\nD. reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.\n"

However, the judge correctly identified the lack of legal experience as a concern and appointed an attorney to assist the defendant. The defendant then requested a non-jury trial, which the court granted despite the prosecution's request for a jury trial. Therefore, the conviction stands since it was reached through a proper process.\n\nRegarding the reimbursement order, this is typically based on statutes that require the defendant to pay for public defender services if they were unable to afford their own counsel. The defendant's indigency status and inability to pay for legal representation were considered when an attorney was appointed. Thus, the reimbursement order is also justified under the law, even though the defendant might not agree with the necessity of paying for legal assistance.\n\nThe appellate court would likely uphold the conviction because the defendant received a fair trial, despite the self-representation. The reimbursement order would also likely stand as it follows established legal procedures for handling cases where the defendant could not afford private counsel."
