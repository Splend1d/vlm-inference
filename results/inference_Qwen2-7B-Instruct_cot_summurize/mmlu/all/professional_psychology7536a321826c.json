During the first session with Hermann, you find out that his political views are completely repugnant to you, and you feel that you would not enjoy working with him. As an ethical psychologist, you should:\n\nA. consult with another psychologist during the course of treatment to make sure your feelings don\u2019t interfere with your objectivity.\nB. discuss the difference in political views with Hermann only if they become relevant to the psychotherapy process.\nC. see Hermann in therapy until his current crisis is over and then make a referral if necessary.\nD. provide Hermann with appropriate referrals.\n"

Your feelings about Hermann's political views are not relevant to the therapeutic process and may cloud your judgment, potentially leading to poor treatment outcomes.\n\n2. **Ethical Standards**: The American Psychological Association (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct ( states that psychologists should not discriminate against clients based on personal beliefs. Your discomfort with Hermann's political views could inadvertently lead to discrimination, which is unethical.\n\n3. **Client-Centered Care**: Referringing Hermann to another psychologist ensures that he receives the appropriate care and attention without being hindered by potential biases. This approach respects the client's right to quality care and maintains the integrity of the therapeutic process.\n\n4. **Referral Process**: Providing referrals can also help establish a collaborative network within the psychological community, allowing for better continuity of care and potentially more effective treatment options tailored to Hermann's specific needs.\n\nBy discussing the situation with Hermann and explaining the reason for your decision, you can maintain transparency and respect while ensuring that his well-being remains the priority."
