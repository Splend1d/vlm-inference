An increase in the price of tubas\n\nWhen the price of tubas increases, it creates a higher demand for tubas makers to produce more instruments to meet the market demand. This increased demand can lead to higher wages for tuba makers as they are compensated for their work to satisfy the market's needs. \n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options do not lead to an increase in wages for tuba makers:\n\nA. An increase in the number of graduates at tuba maker training school: While this might increase the supply of tuba makers, if the demand for tubas does not increase proportionally or at all, there could be an oversupply of tuba makers leading to potential wage decreases due to competition.\n\nC. An increase in the price of tuba lessons: This affects the cost for individuals wanting to learn how to play the tuba but does not directly impact the wages of tuba makers.\n\nD. An increase in the tax on tubas: This would likely decrease the demand for tubas, as the price consumers pay for them would go up, leading to less production and potentially lower wages for tuba makers if the decrease in production is significant enough to affect demand for their labor."
