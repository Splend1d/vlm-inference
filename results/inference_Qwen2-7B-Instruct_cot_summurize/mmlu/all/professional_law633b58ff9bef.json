The defendant was playing the role of a serial killer in the school play and asked the victim if she could leave their apartment for a few hours while she rehearsed. The victim agreed but returned to the apartment shortly thereafter because she was curious and wanted to see the defendant rehearse. The victim quietly came back into the apartment and hid behind some curtains in the dining room in order to watch the defendant rehearse. In her role, the defendant earned a large butcher's knife, with which she stabbed the curtains at her \"victim. \" Unknown to the defendant, the victim, who was hiding behind the curtain, was stabbed in the chest and killed.

Even though the defendant did not intend to kill the victim, the act of intentionally using a deadly weapon (the butcher's knife) resulted in death. This constitutes the crime of murder under most legal systems, specifically second-degree murder or manslaughter due to the lack of premeditation but presence of intent to cause serious bodily harm that led to death. Therefore, the defendant should be found guilty of murder."
