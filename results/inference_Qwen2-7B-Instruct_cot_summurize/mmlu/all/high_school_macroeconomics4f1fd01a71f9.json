Business firms expect lower sales in the future.\n\nWhen business firms expect lower sales in the future, they will reduce their investment spending, which is part of aggregate demand. This decrease in investment leads to a leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve. \n\nHere's a brief explanation of why the other options do not shift the aggregate demand curve to the left:\n\nA. An increase in consumer confidence: Generally, higher consumer confidence leads to increased spending, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right.\n\nC. Foreigners develop a preference for our products: This could potentially lead to an increase in exports and thus boost aggregate demand, shifting the curve to the right.\n\nD. Government increases its level of spending: An increase in government spending typically shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right as it adds to overall demand in the economy."
