Option I if it needs at least $20,000 to pay off an overdue loan**\n\nThe other options do not necessarily follow from the information provided:\n- **A. Option II if it wants to maximize expected return** is incorrect because, while it does have a higher expected return, it also carries more risk.\n- **C. Option III if it needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan** is incorrect because the expected return from Option III is significantly lower than both Options I and II, and thus it would not meet the requirement of needing at least $80,000.\n- **D. All of the above answer does correct.** is incorrect based on the analysis above."
