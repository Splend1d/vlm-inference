They output 0 for any negative input and increase linearly for positive inputs, which means they are not always increasing or decreasing.\n\nStatement 2 is false. Neural networks trained with gradient descent do not necessarily converge to the global optimum. Gradient descent can often get stuck in local optima, especially when the loss surface has many such regions. While it's possible to achieve the global optimum under certain conditions, these are typically rare and require specific configurations or algorithms like simulated annealing that introduce randomness to escape local minima."
