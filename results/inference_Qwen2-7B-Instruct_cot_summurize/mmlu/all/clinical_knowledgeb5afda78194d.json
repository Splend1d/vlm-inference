This conversion factor is based on the approximate energy content of food and how the body uses oxygen in the process of metabolism.\n\nGiven the athlete's oxygen consumption rate is 2 liters per minute:\n\nEnergy expenditure = Oxygen consumption rate * Energy content per liter of oxygen\n= 2 L/min * 71.5 kJ/L\n= 143 kJ/min\n\nThis value isn't exactly listed among your options, but it's closest to option A (400 kJ/min when considering possible rounding or approximation differences in the question's context.

The correct answer, therefore, might be an estimation or there could be a slight miscalculation or misinterpretation in the question or options provided."
