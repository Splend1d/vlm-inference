Many pessimists die at a younger age\n\nThis option suggests that because pessimists might have a shorter lifespan, the sample of older adults might disproportionately include individuals who tend to be more optimistic. However, it's important to note that this is a simplistic explanation and doesn't account for the complex psychological factors that contribute to optimism in older adults.\n\nOptimism in older adults can be influenced by several factors, including life experiences, resilience, social support, and personal coping mechanisms. It's also worth considering that optimism can be beneficial for mental health and can contribute to better physical health outcomes in older age, although causality cannot be assumed."
