Genetically determined.\n\nIn DNA, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is generally consistent and not variable between different organisms or even within the same organism. This is because the structure of DNA requires that for every adenine (A), there is a thymine (T; and for every guanine G), there is a cytosine C. These pairs of bases (A-T and G-C) form hydrogen bonds which stabilize the double helix structure of DNA. Since A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C, the number of purines (A and G combined) must equal the number of pyrimidines (C and T combined). \n\nTherefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is typically 1:1, making option D incorrect. The specific ratio is determined during the replication and synthesis of DNA, which is genetically programmed, hence option C is the correct choice. The base sequence in RNA does influence the synthesis of DNA but does not determine the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA directly."
