All political activity is terroristic.\n\nMichael Walzer, in his book \"Just and Unjust Wars,\" discusses four main excuses for terrorism: terrorism as a form of freedom of speech, terrorism as a last resort, terrorism benefiting oppressed groups, and terrorism being justifiable because all political activity is inherently terroristic. The latter excuse suggests that any political action that uses violence could be considered terrorism, which Walzer argues is not a valid defense for terrorism."
