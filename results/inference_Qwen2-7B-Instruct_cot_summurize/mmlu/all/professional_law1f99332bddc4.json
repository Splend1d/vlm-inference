S. for the wholesale distribution of the guitars. A warehouse located in a city handles the distribution of guitars for several state areas. The guitars and guitar strings are shipped separately to the city warehouse. The guitar strings are mingled, stacked, and stored in the warehouse along with various other guitar strings. The guitars, on the other hand, arrive completely assembled in their shipping crates and remain on the loading docks. The city imposes an ad valorem property tax on the guitars and strings. The power of the city to impose an ad valorem tax on the foreign company's guitars and/or strings would most likely be upheld under\n\nA. the commerce clause.\nB. the reserved power of the states as granted under the Tenth Amendment.\nC. the necessary and proper clause.\nD. the import and export clause.\n"

This amendment allows states to exercise certain powers that are not specifically given to the federal government, including imposing property taxes within their jurisdiction. In this scenario, the city has the authority to impose an ad valorem property tax on the guitars and guitar strings stored in its warehouse, as long as the tax is applied uniformly to all similar properties and does not discriminate against interstate commerce."
