This law states that the intensity (I) of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (d) from the source and directly proportional to the luminous flux (\u03a6 (which is the total amount of light emitted by the source and is measured in lumens).\n\nThe formula for the inverse square law is:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{\u03a6}{4\u03c0d^2} \\]\n\nGiven that the illumination \\( I = 6 \\, \\text{lux} \\) at a distance \\( d = 5 \\, \\text{m} \\), we can rearrange the formula to solve for the luminous flux \\( \u03a6 \\):\n\n\\[ \u03a6 = I \\cdot 4\u03c0d^2 \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \u03a6 = 6 \\, \\text{lux} \\times 4\u03c0(5 \\, \\text{m})^2 \\]\n\\[ \u03a6 = 6 \\times 4\u03c0 \\times 25 \\]\n\\[ \u03a6 = 6 \\times 100\u03c0 \\]\n\\[ \u03a6 \u2248 6 \\times 314.16 \\]\n\\[ \u03a6 \u2248 1884.96 \\, \\text{lumens} \\]\n\nNow, since 1 candela (cd) is defined as the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540\u00d710^12 Hz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian, and knowing that 1 lumen (lm) is the amount of light emitted in all directions by a source with one candela in a solid angle of one steradian, we can convert lumens to candela.\n\nSince 1 candela = 683 lumens,\n\n\\[ \u03a6 \\approx 1884.96 \\, \\text{lumens} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{cd}}{683 \\, \\text{lumens}} \\]\n\\[ \u03a6 \\approx 2.76 \\, \\text{cd} \\]\n\nNone of the options provided exactly match this calculation, but it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or answer choices given. Based on the typical conversions and calculations involving the inverse square law, the closest option would be:\n\nB. 140.\n\nThis choice doesn't precisely match our calculated result, indicating potential discrepancies between the provided answer choices and the expected outcome based on the information and the inverse square law. It's crucial to ensure that all units and definitions used are consistent with standard physical science conventions."
