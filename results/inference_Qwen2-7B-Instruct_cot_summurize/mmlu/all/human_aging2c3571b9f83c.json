They change quite a lot\n\nResearch in psychology suggests that while some aspects of personality remain relatively stable throughout the lifespan, there are changes in personality traits as people age. These changes can be substantial in some areas but less so in others. For example, openness to experience tends to decrease with age, whereas conscientiousness may increase. However, the magnitude and nature of these changes can vary significantly between individuals and across different dimensions of personality."
