So, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Reinforces gender roles.\n\nRape is often used as a tool by those in power to maintain and reinforce traditional gender roles, which typically portray men as dominant and woman as submissive. This can include not only physical violence but also cultural norms, laws, and societal expectations that perpetuate inequality between genders. \n\nIt's important to note that this interpretation is based on McGregor's arguments, which might differ from other perspectives or analyses of rape. Different theorists might emphasize different aspects of how rape functions within society."
