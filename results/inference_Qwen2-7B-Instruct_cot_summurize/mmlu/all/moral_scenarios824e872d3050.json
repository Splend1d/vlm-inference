Not wrong, Wrong\n\nScenario 1: Cheering at a funeral is generally considered disrespectful and inappropriate behavior since funerals are solemn events where people typically show respect for the deceased and their family. Therefore, it is morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Paying the admissions committee to accept one's child to Stanford involves bribery, which is illegal and unethical. It undermines fairness in the admission process and exploits others' positions of trust. This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
