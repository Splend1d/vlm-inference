They change the habitat in a way that makes it more habitable for other organisms. \n\nOrganisms that are the first to colonize a habitat undergoing ecological succession are typically pioneer species, which are often small invertebrates like lichens and mosses (but not exclusively so. These species have the ability to survive and thrive in harsh or recently disturbed environments. They alter the habitat by, for example, breaking down rocks, increasing soil organic matter, and creating niches for other species to inhabit. This process facilitates the establishment of more complex ecosystems over time."
