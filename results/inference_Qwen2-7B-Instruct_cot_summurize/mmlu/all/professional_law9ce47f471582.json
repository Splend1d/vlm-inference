It has to result in an advisory opinion\n\nExplanation: While it's true that federal courts generally do not provide advisory opinions ( as established by the Supreme Court in Aetna Insurance Co. v. Haworth ( and later reaffirmed in other cases like Flast v. Cohen, it's not a limitation on jurisdiction but rather a principle of judicial restraint. \n\nThe other options are indeed limitations on federal court jurisdiction:\n\nB. The issue has to be ripe - This means that the controversy should be mature enough for a court to decide without causing unnecessary delay or harm.\n\nC. The issue can't be moot - A case becomes moot if the issues are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\n\nD. A person must have a concrete stake in the outcome - This refers to the requirement of standing, which ensures that a party seeking relief has a sufficient connection to the controversy to justify its intervention in the judicial process."
