All plant protein sources contain all essential amino acids although some may be limited by the amount of particular amino acids\n\nIt's important to note that while some plant-based protein sources might not contain all nine essential amino acids (Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, and Valine, in sufficient quantities, they can still provide a complete source of protein when combined with other complementary plant protein sources. For example, combining rice (which is low in lysine and methionine but high in tryptophan, threonine, and cysteine) with beans (which are are low in lysine but high in methionine and cysteine) can provide a more complete amino acid profile for someone consuming them together. This concept is known as protein complementation or protein synergy."
