In July 1990, the investor acquired title to a 100-acre tract located just outside the city limits in a rural area. In 1997, the investor decided to sell his vast ranching and oil interests in the Rocky Mountains. In July, the investor conveyed the tract for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, \"to my nephew, his heirs, and assigns, but if my nephew's wife dies without issue, to my chef and her heirs and assigns. \"After taking possession of the 100-acre tract, the nephew discovered considerable oil reserves on the property. He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantities of oil, which he sold. At no time did he give notice to the chef of his oil-drilling activities. Months passed before the chef learned that the nephew was selling oil from the drilling operations. The chef has now brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunction against any further oil removal. If the nephew's wife died without issue before the beginning of the nephew's oil drilling operations, would this improve the likelihood of the chef's success than if the wife were still alive?\n\nA. No, because the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\nB. No, because the nature of the nephew's estate would not be altered by the wife's death.\nC. Yes, because the wife's death without issue would convert the nephew's fee into a reversionary interest.\nD. Yes, because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.\n"

Yes, because the wife's death without issue would convert the nephew's fee into a reversionary interest.\n\nIn the scenario provided, the nephew received a fee simple determinable estate in the 100-acre tract (meaning he had full ownership rights with a condition subsequent. The condition stated that if his wife died without issue (without descendants), the estate would revert to the grantor (the investor or their heirs.\n\nWhen the nephew's wife died without issue, the condition was satisfied. Therefore, the estate reverted back to the investor or their heirs, not to the chef. Consequently, the chef's rights under the conveyance were extinguished, and he would have no legal basis to claim an accounting of the oil removed or seek an injunction against further oil removal.\n\nThus, the wife's death without issue improved the likelihood of the chef's success because it potentially terminated the nephew's estate, leaving the chef with no legal standing to pursue the nephew or the oil removed from the property."
