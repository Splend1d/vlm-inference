Both the pedestrian and the driver suffered injuries. The pedestrian filed a negligence action against the driver in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in damages. The driver believes that the pedestrian was crossing the street illegally and is therefore responsible for the accident. The driver seeks an attorney's advice on how best to respond to the action. Assume that State B is a contributory negligence state. How should the attorney advise the driver to respond?\n\nA. File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries.\nB. File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and defense of contributory negligence and move for judgment on the pleadings.\nC. Move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, because the driver is not a citizen of State B.\nD. Move to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, because the driver is not a U.S. citizen.\n"

File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries.\n\nGiven that State B follows a contributory negligence system, the driver's attorney should argue that the pedestrian's actions contributed to or caused his own injuries, thereby reducing or eliminating the driver's liability. The attorney should also consider filing a counterclaim for negligence against the pedestrian, seeking compensation for any injuries sustained by the driver during the incident.\n\nThis strategy acknowledges the potential weakness of the driver's defense ( since the pedestrian was hit while crossing the street, it might be challenging to prove that their actions were entirely negligent. However, presenting both defenses and counterclaims can still potentially mitigate the driver's liability and seek compensation for their injuries."
