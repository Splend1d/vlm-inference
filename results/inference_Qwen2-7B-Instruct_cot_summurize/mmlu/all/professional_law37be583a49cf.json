Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after the defeats in a recent election, the Party expelled all nonLatino members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Latinos could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Latinos. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in their Congressional District. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own Latino candidate for governor of New Mexico in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poil. In an action by non-Latino citizens in the relevantCongressional District to enjoin the Latino AmericanParty from conducting the mail ballot primary, thefederal court will most likely\n\nA. grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment.\nB. grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment.\nC. deny relief, because the Party's primary would be private action and not subject to restriction under the Constitution.\nD. deny relief, because a pre-primary election is not within the scope of federal election control.\n"

The Thirteenth, Fifteenth, and other amendments typically deal with issues of slavery, voting rights, and discrimination in public elections, which are would not apply to a private party's decision regarding its own membership and candidate selection process. Therefore, a court would most likely deny relief on the basis that the party's actions do not violate constitutional provisions applicable to public elections."
