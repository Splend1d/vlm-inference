One method begins by heating a solid or liquid in a flask to produce a gaseous product. The gas passes through a tube and displaces water in an inverted, water-filled bottle. The mass of the starting material is measured, along with the volume of the displaced water and the temperature of the system. The pressure in the inverted water-filled bottle is equal to the external pressure. Once the barometric pressure has been recorded, what other information is needed to finish the experiment?\n\nA. The heat of formation of the gas\nB. The density of the water\nC. The mass of the displaced water\nD. The vapor pressure of the water\n"

The mass of the starting material ( (m_start)\n2. The volume of the displaced water ( (V_water)\n3. The temperature of the system ( (T)\n4. The barometric pressure ( (P_baro)\n\nThe pressure inside the inverted water-filled bottle ( (P_bottle) can be calculated using the ideal gas law:\n\n\\[ P_bottle = \\frac{m_{gas} * R * T}{m_{water} * V_{water}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( m_gas \\) is the mass of the gas produced,\n- \\( m_{water} \\) is the mass of the displaced water,\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin,\n- \\( V_{water} \\) is the volume of the displaced water,\n- \\( R \\) is the gas constant.\n\nGiven that \\( m_{gas} \\), \\( m_{water} \\), \\( T \\), and \\( V_{water} \\) are known, and \\( P_bottle \\) can be calculated, you can find \\( m_{gas} \\) by rearranging the equation:\n\n\\[ m_{gas} = \\frac{P_bottle * m_{water} * V_{water}}{R * T} \\]\n\nFinally, the molecular mass of the gas (\\( M_{gas} \\)) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ M_{gas} = \\frac{m_{gas}}{n_{gas}} \\]\n\nWhere \\( n_{gas} \\) is the number of moles of gas, which can be determined from the volume of the displaced water and the ideal gas law:\n\n\\[ n_{gas} = \\frac{P_bottle * V_{water}}{R * T} \\]\n\nThus, the mass of the displaced water ( (C) is the required information to complete the experiment."
