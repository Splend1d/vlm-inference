The rule in Shelley's case**.\n\nThe rule in Shelley's Case, established by the English Court of Chancery in 1846, states that a person cannot hold an estate in land for their own life and also for the lives of other persons, unless it can be ascertained who those persons will be at the time the estate is granted. In other words, it prohibits estates in land from being granted for uncertain or indefinite periods of time. \n\nIn your scenario, the deed grants a life estate to Friend and then passes the property to the heirs of the owner upon Friend's death. This creates an indeterminate period because it is unclear who the heirs will be at the time of the grant. Therefore, under the rule in Shelley's Case, the remainder interest (the right to the property after the life estate ends) does not vest immediately and effectively, but instead becomes a reversionary interest in the original owner (or their successors in title). \n\nThis rule ensures that estates are not granted for indefinite periods, which could potentially lead to uncertainty and disputes over ownership, especially when the number of potential future beneficiaries is not fixed."
