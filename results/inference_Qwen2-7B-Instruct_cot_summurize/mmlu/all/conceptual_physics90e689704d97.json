The \"springs\" part comes from the idea that the electron is held in its orbit by a kind of \"spring force\" that balances the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged nucleus. This model also explains the discrete emission spectra of atoms, as electrons can only transition between certain energy levels (resulting in specific wavelengths of light being emitted or absorbed."
