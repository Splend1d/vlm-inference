Stage 2 sleep\n\nAlpha waves are typically observed in the brain during relaxed wakefulness, such as when you're awake but your eyes are closed or you're daydreaming. They are most prominent during stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which is often referred to as the \"light sleep\" stage.\n\nA. The hypnagogic state refers to the transition period between wakefulness and sleep, and it's usually characterized by a mix of alpha and theta waves.\n\nC. Stage 3 sleep is often associated with delta waves, not alpha waves. This is part of deep NREM sleep where the body repairs and grows tissue.\n\nD. Stage 4 sleep is also known as slow-wave sleep or deep sleep, and it is characterized by high-amplitude delta waves, not alpha waves."
