                    "text": "The correct answer is B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\n(i) Adjusted R-squared is not an information criterion. Information criteria like AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) are used for model selection based on their ability to balance goodness of fit with complexity of the model. Adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, is a modification of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in a regression model. It is used to assess how well the independent variables explain the variation of the dependent variable, but it doesn't penalize for the number of parameters like information criteria do.\n\n(ii) This statement is false. The addition of an additional term to a model may reduce the residual sum of squares, but the value of the information criterion does not necessarily have to decrease. Information criteria such as AIC or BIC not only consider the reduction in the residual sum of squares but also penalize models for having more parameters. Thus, adding a parameter might lead to an increase in the information criterion if the improvement in the model fit does not justify the penalty for the increased complexity.\n\n(iii) This statement is true. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) tends to favor more complex models compared to Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Schwarz's criterion has a stronger penalty for the number of parameters in the model, which makes it more conservative in selecting models. Therefore, Akaike's information criterion often selects models that are at least as large as those selected by Schwarz's information criterion.\n\n(iv) This statement is false. While both AIC and BIC are consistent under certain conditions, consistency means that as the sample size grows infinitely large, the probability that the estimator selects the true model approaches 1. Neither AIC nor BIC is guaranteed to be consistent; they can select the wrong model even with infinite data, especially if the true model is not among the candidate models or if the models are not correctly specified."
