When it rains heavily, the road surface becomes slippery and may be covered with water or mud, which can increase rolling resistance and thus decrease fuel economy. However, the exact percentage decrease in highway gas mileage due to rain can vary depending on various factors including vehicle type, tire condition, and driving style. A typical estimate suggests that fuel efficiency might drop by about 2% under heavy rain conditions. It's important to note that aggressive driving or high speeds can exacerbate this effect. Safe driving practices and maintaining appropriate speed for the weather conditions are recommended."
