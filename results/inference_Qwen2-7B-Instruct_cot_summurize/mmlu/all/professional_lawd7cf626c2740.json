Inspired by a progressive revolt against the chemical company's domination of the state government, the corporate official's opponent, won by an extremely close margin. After the new governor took office, he vowed to get back at the company that owned the local newspaper for its newspaper's endorsement of the corporate official. Using his influence, the new governor was instrumental in getting the state legislature to pass a bill that imposed a special tax on the sale of ink and paper used in the publication of newspapers and periodicals of general circulation. The tax bill was signed into law by the governor. The strongest constitutional basis upon which to challenge the validity of the tax would be the\n\nA. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. bill of attainder provision under Article I, Section 10.\nC. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. First Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

First Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis is because the First Amendment protects freedom of the press, which includes the right of newspapers to publish without undue government interference. When the government passes legislation specifically targeting a particular newspaper (in this case, imposing a special tax on ink and paper used by the newspaper that endorsed the winning candidate, it can be seen as an attempt to suppress the press. Such a law might be considered a \"bill of attainder,\" which the Constitution prohibits, but more directly, it implicates the First Amendment's protections. The incorporation of the First Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment means that states cannot infringe on these rights either, thus making this the strongest basis for a legal challenge."
