This is because, over time, if such an exchange had occurred, some Neandertal genetic material would have been passed down to subsequent generations of humans in Africa, leaving a detectable trace in their DNA.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa.\n\nThis implies that any potential interbreeding between Neandertals and modern humans happened after the latter left Africa, likely during migrations into Europe or Asia where Neanderthals were already present. This is consistent with the archaeological and genetic evidence suggesting that modern humans arrived in Europe after Neanderthals had evolved there."
