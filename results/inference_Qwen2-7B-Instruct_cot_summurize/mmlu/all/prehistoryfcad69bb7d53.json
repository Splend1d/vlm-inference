The Upper Paleolithic period saw the development of microliths (\u2014small, often intricately shaped stone tools\u2014and composite tools that combined different materials like bone, antler, and wood with stone. These changes reflect a greater specialization in tool-making, increased portability, and possibly a better adaptation to diverse environments. Additionally, this period also saw the emergence of more complex hunting strategies and the creation of art and symbolic artifacts, indicating a growing cognitive sophistication and social complexity among early humans."
