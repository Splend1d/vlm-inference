This can be attributed to various factors including hormonal differences, social roles, and stressors. On the other hand, studies also suggest that men may be more prone to alcohol use disorders than women, possibly due to societal norms that encourage masculine behaviors such as drinking.\n\nIt's important to note that these statistics can vary across different populations and studies, and individual experiences can differ from these averages. Additionally, the rates of mental health issues and substance use disorders are not binary and can exist on a spectrum for individuals."
