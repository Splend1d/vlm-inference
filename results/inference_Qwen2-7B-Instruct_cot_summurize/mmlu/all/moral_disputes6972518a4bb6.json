However, based on general knowledge and understanding, Peter Carruthers is known for his work in philosophy of mind and animal cognition. He has discussed various ethical theories, including contractualism, which suggests that moral rules should be ones that rational agents would agree to if they were fully informed and unbiased.\n\nIn terms of moral standing for non-human animals under contractualist grounds, it's possible that Carruthers might argue for:\n\n- C. quasi-: This could imply that non-human animals might not have full moral standing (like humans do, which might be considered 'direct' - but they still have some form of moral consideration, perhaps through their capacities or interests, which is more than 'indirect' standing where one is merely affected by actions involving others.\n\nIt's important to note that philosophical arguments and conclusions can vary among different philosophers, even those who share similar theoretical backgrounds. For the most accurate answer, consulting Carruthers' published works or interviews directly would be necessary."
