Reserving a hotel room by e-mailing a credit card number to a hotel\n\nThis option poses the greatest personal cybersecurity risk because it involves sending sensitive information (credit card details) over an unsecured communication channel (email). Emails can be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties, leading to identity theft or fraud.\n\nWhile all these options involve some level of risk, emailing credit card information is generally considered more risky than using secure methods such as online stores with encryption, secure electronic payments systems, or ATMs which typically have some level of security in place to protect transactions."
