                    "text": "Thomson's conclusion refers to Judith Jarvis Thomson's famous thought experiment, often called the \"Trolley Problem with a Body,\" which she used to argue in favor of the moral permissibility of abortion. In her argument, Thomson posits that if a hypothetical scenario involves connecting a pregnant woman to a machine that can provide organs to save five people who are about to die, and the continuation of the pregnancy would result in the death of the fetus, then it would be morally permissible to continue the pregnancy to save the five lives, as long as the connection to the pregnant woman does not involve harming her.\n\nGiven this context:\n\nA. The statement that the abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person alignss with Thomson's argument. Her thought experiment suggests that moral considerations extend beyond merely when the fetus becomes a person, indicating that other factors, such as the potential for saving lives, must also be considered.\n\nB. This option contradicts Thomson's argument, as her thought experiment supports the idea that under certain circumstances, abortion can be morally permissible.\n\nC. This option also contradicts Thomson's argument, as her thought experiment does not rule out the possibility of abortion being morally impermissible under all circumstances.\n\nD. This statement directly contradicts Thomson's conclusion, as she argues that determining the stage at which the fetus is a person is not enough to settle the abortion issue; other ethical considerations must be taken into account.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer based on Thomson's conclusion is **A. the abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person**."
