She has been treated with amoxicillin for the past 5 days for left otitis media. Her temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg. Examination shows the left ear displaced forward and laterally from the head. There is edema and tenderness behind the left ear. Otoscopic examination shows a red, dull, left tympanic membrane that does not move. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Acoustic neuroma\nB. Labyrinthitis\nC. Lateral sinus thrombosis\nD. Mastoiditis\n"

Mastoiditis. \n\nMastoiditis is an infection of the mastoid air cells located within the temporal bone behind the ear. Symptoms can include fever, ear pain, and swelling or displacement of the ear. The symptoms described, such as fever, ear pain, redness and swelling behind the left ear, and an immobile tympanic membrane ( (which could indicate inflammation or pus in the middle ear), align with those associated with mastoiditis. \n\nThe other options:\n- A. Acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor of the vestibulocochlear nerve, which would present differently and typically would not cause ear pain or fever.\n- B. Labyrinthitis is an inner ear inflammation, also typically presenting with different symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and hearing loss rather than ear pain and fever.\n- C. Lateral sinus thrombosis involves the veins draining blood from the brain to the neck and would present with symptoms more related to headache, neck stiffness, and potentially seizures, rather than the specific symptoms mentioned.\n\nPlease note, this information is intended to help understand potential diagnoses based on symptoms, but a definitive medical diagnosis should only be made by a healthcare professional after conducting appropriate physical examinations and tests."
