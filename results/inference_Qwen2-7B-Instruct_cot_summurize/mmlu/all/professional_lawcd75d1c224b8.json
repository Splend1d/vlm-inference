For several months sections of the building had been wobbling noticeably, particularly during inclement weather, when the river pounded more aggressively against the structure. Several employees and customers complained but the general manager did not respond. One windy night a section of the pier collapsed into the river, killing 28 customers and employees. It was revealed that officials had on several prior occasions cited the club for violating applicable safety regulations. The police arrested the general manager and charged him with involuntary manslaughter. He defended on the basis that his omissions to act were legally insufficient to establish manslaughter. What will the court decide?\n\nA. This was not manslaughter because the omission to respond to safety citations is not enough to establish the high degree of criminal negligence that is required.\nB. The failure to act is much less culpable than active recklessness, and therefore there was insufficient evidence to charge manslaughter.\nC. A corporate employee cannot be prosecuted for the crime of manslaughter with respect to the performance or nonperformance of his duties on behalf of the corporation.\nD. The charge of involuntary manslaughter is legally sufficient because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances.\n"

The charge of involuntary manslaughter is legally sufficient because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter typically involves a death resulting from actions that are reckless or negligent, rather than intentional. In this case, the manager's failure to address repeated safety violations and complaints about the stability of the building could be seen as reckless behavior, especially considering the potential dangers posed by the location and the weather conditions. The collapse of the pier and the resulting deaths would likely be considered an unlawful and reckless outcome of these inactions.\n\nThe court would consider whether the manager's actions (or lack thereof \u2014 specifically, ignoring safety warnings and failing to take necessary preventive measures \u2014 amounted to a level of criminal negligence that is required for a charge of involuntary manslaughter. The fact that the club had been cited for violating safety regulations multiple times would weigh heavily in demonstrating a pattern of disregard for safety, which can be crucial in establishing the requisite level of recklessness. \n\nTherefore, option D is the most likely answer, given the facts presented."
