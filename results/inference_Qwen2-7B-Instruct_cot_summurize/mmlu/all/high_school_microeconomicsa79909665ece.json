This results in productively inefficient output levels, as resources are not being allocated in a way that minimizes costs for a given level of output. The long-run equilibrium in monopolistic competition features zero economic profit, but firms operate with some degree of excess capacity and inefficiency due to the presence of product differentiation and the ability of firms to charge a premium for their products."
