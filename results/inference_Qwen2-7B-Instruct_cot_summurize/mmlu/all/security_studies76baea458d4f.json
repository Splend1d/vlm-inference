All of these options.\n\nMotivational realism suggests that the behavior of states (or any political entities) can be influenced by a variety of factors including human nature, economic desires for wealth and prosperity, and ideological ambitions. The term \"greedy states\" often implies that these entities are driven by an insatiable appetite for resources or power. This can stem from:\n\n- **Human Nature**: The assumption that human beings, as part of the state leadership, may exhibit traits such as greed, which can drive state policies.\n- **Desire for Wealth and Prosperity**: States might engage in behaviors like territorial expansion, resource acquisition, or economic dominance to enhance their own wealth and the well-being of their citizens.\n- **Ideological Ambitions**: States may pursue policies based on ideological goals, such as spreading a particular ideology or system of governance, which could be seen as a form of \"greed\" if it involves the acquisition or influence over territories or populations.\n\nTherefore, all of these options can contribute to the behavior of what some might perceive as \"greedy states.\""
