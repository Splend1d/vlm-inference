                    "text": "The correct statement is:\n\n**D. The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements.**\n\nExplanation:\n- **A. If the array is initially sorted in descending order, then insertion sort will be more efficient than selection sort.** This statement is incorrect because both insertion sort and selection sort have a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, regardless of whether the array is already sorted or not. However, in practice, insertion sort might perform better on nearly sorted lists due to its lower overhead and better cache performance, but this doesn't necessarily mean it's more efficient than selection sort in all cases.\n- **B. The number of comparisons for selection sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.** This statement is incorrect. Selection sort always performs the same number of comparisons (n(n-1)/2, regardless of the initial order of the elements.\n- **C. The number of comparisons for insertion sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.** This statement is also incorrect. While the number of comparisons in insertion sort is directly related to the number of swaps, the number of comparisons itself is influenced by the initial arrangement of the elements. The more out of order the array is, the more comparisons insertion sort will make.\n- **D. The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements.** This statement is correct. Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The number of data movements ( or swaps, is directly related to how many times it needs to move elements to place the smallest unsorted element at the start. In the worst case, when the array is sorted in reverse order, each pass through the array requires one swap, leading to n-1 swaps. In other cases, the number of swaps can be less, depending on the initial arrangement of the elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
