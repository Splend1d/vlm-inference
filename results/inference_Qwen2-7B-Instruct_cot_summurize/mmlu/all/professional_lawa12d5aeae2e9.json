He did, however, come across a secluded mountain cabin, in which he decided to take shelter for the night. Since the door to the cabin was locked, he broke a window and entered the structure. Once inside, he fell asleep on the sofa. When he awoke the next morning he was hungry. The defendant then found some food in the refrigerator, which he cooked and ate. Before leaving the cabin, the defendant looked around to see if there was anything worth stealing. He opened the door to the bedroom and found a gold watch on the nightstand. He placed the watch in his pocket and left the cabin. The defendant was later arrested and charged with burglary. The defendant's strongest defense would be that\n\nA. he was drunk when he broke into the cabin.\nB. the crime was not completed until the morning hours.\nC. he did not have the requisite intent at the time of the breaking and entering.\nD. the cabin was empty when he entered it.\n"

This is often referred to as \"specific intent\" burglary. If the defendant can demonstrate that they did not intend to commit any further crimes upon entering the cabin (for example, if they only intended to seek shelter from the weather and did not plan to steal anything), this could potentially weaken the prosecution's case and provide a strong defense.\n\nIt's important to note that the specifics of the defense would depend on the laws of the jurisdiction where the crime occurred, as well as the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense. Additionally, the fact that the defendant was intoxicated does not automatically negate the specific intent required for burglary; however, it might be used as part of an argument regarding the defendant's state of mind and ability to form the requisite intent at the time of the breaking and entering."
