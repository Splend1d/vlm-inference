A graph has an Euler circuit if and only if every vertex in the graph has an even degree ( (i.e., it's connected to an even number of edges).\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nI. A complete graph with 12 vertices:\nIn a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. So, each vertex in a complete graph with \\(n \\) vertices has a degree of \\( n - 1 \\). For a complete graph with 12 vertices (\\( K_{12} \\)), each vertex has a degree of \\( 12 - 1 = 11 \\), which is odd. Therefore, this graph does not have an Euler circuit.\n\nII. A complete graph with 13 vertices:\nSimilarly, in a complete graph with 13 vertices (\\( K_{13} \\)), each vertex has a degree of \\( 13 - 1 = 12 \\), which is even. Hence, this graph has an Euler circuit.\n\nIII. A tree with 13 vertices:\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and the number of edges in a tree is always one less than the number of vertices. Thus, a tree with 13 vertices has 12 edges. Since trees are acyclic by definition, they cannot have any vertices with an odd degree ( as that would imply a cycle. However, because a tree has exactly two vertices with a degree of 1 ( (the leaves) and the rest with a degree of at least 2, all vertices will indeed have an even degree. This means that trees can have an Euler circuit, but since the question specifies a tree with 13 vertices, and given our knowledge about trees, it's important to note that not all trees have an Euler circuit because for a tree to have an Euler circuit, it must be a cycle itself, which contradicts the tree's definition. In fact, only a tree consisting of a single cycle (a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) where \\( n \\geq 3 \\) ) could potentially have an Euler circuit. However, this is not the case for a general tree with 13 vertices.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is **B. II only**."
