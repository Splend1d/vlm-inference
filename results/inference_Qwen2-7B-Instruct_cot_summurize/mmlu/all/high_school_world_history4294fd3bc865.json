He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.\n\u2026\nHe looked to the West and prayed, \"I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal.\" When he had prayed he bowed again.\nFrom Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s\nIn which of the following ways does the excerpt above most complicate historians' understanding of the career of the Chinese monk and traveler Xuanzang?\n\nA. It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments.\nB. It was written long after the time period in which Xuanzang lived.\nC. It casts doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang.\nD. It is widely considered by scholars to be a forgery.\n"

It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments.\n\nThe passage you've provided is actually from the novel \"Journey to the West\" by Wu Cheng'en, which was written in the Ming Dynasty (around the 1590s. This novel is a work of fiction and is not intended as a historical account of Xuanzang's life or travels. While it draws heavily from the historical events surrounding Xuanzang's journey to India to collect Buddhist scriptures, the novel includes fantastical elements such as the character of the Monkey King, which were not part of the real-life journey. Therefore, the excerpt above significantly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments, complicating historians' understanding of his career by blending fact with fiction."
