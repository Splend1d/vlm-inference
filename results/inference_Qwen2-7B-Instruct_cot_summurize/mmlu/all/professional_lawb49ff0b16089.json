In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets would pass equally to Tommy and Julie. Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. On their Miami honeymoon they drove by the condominium and Kathy declared she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy with Kathy that after the honeymoon he signed and delivered to Kathy a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety and made plans to live in the condominium as soon as the tenant vacated. Bill died the next day. How are the foregoing assets distributed?\n\nA. Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\nB. Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\nC. Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.\nD. Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.\n"

Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium, and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.**\n\nExplanation:\n- Bill's will specifically devises the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie.\n- The prenuptial agreement Kathy executed relinquishes any rights she might have otherwise received from marrying Bill.\n- The deed Bill signed during his honeymoon, conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety, is not relevant to the distribution of the estate upon his death since it was not executed before his death.\n- Therefore, the assets are distributed according to Bill's will: the pasture land to Tommy, the condominium to Julie, and the remaining assets ( as specified in the will ( to be split between Tommy and Julie."
