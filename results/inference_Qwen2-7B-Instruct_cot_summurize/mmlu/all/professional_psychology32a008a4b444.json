In option D, the teacher is giving two opposing messages: one allowing the student freedom to choose ( (\"You can do that if you want to\") and another asking the student not to do something specific  (\"but I would appreciate it if you would not\"). This creates a situation where the student is caught between conflicting expectations and may feel unable to please both parts of the message simultaneously."
