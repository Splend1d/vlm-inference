Glycolysis\n\nGlycolysis is the first step in cellular respiration where one glucose molecule is broken down into two pyruvate molecules. During this process, a small amount of energy is captured and used to produce 2 ATP (and 4 NADH when it occurs in the presence of oxygen). \n\nThe other options are not correct for the following reasons:\n- B. Chemiosmosis: This is the process by which a proton gradient is used to generate ATP through ATP synthase.\n- C. Fermentation: While fermentation does produce ATP and NADH, it typically does not result in the net production of 2 pyruvate molecules from a single glucose molecule. Instead, depending on the type of fermentation, either lactic acid or ethanol is produced.\n- D. Calvin cycle: This is part of the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, which uses the energy from ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 into organic compounds, and does not involve the breakdown of glucose."
