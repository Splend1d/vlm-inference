The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nWhen the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, it means that at every price level, more goods and services are demanded in the market. Given a Classical aggregate supply curve, which is vertical at the potential output level (Y*, this indicates that the economy is operating at its full employment capacity, and changes in aggregate demand do not affect the quantity of output produced; instead, they only lead to changes in the price level.\n\nIn this scenario, the increase in aggregate demand shifts the AD curve from AD to AD', leading to a new equilibrium point E'. At this new equilibrium:\n\n1. **Equilibrium Price Level Increases**: The price level rises as the economy moves up along the vertical AS curve to reach the new higher price level P'.\n\n2. **Equilibrium Quantity of Output Increases**: Although the Classical model assumes no change in the quantity of output (Y, conceptually, the quantity of output would also increase because the economy is now selling more goods at the higher price level.\n\nIt's important to note that in a Keynesian model, an increase in aggregate demand could lead to both an increase in the price level and an increase in the quantity of output if the economy is not operating at full capacity. However, the question specifies a Classical aggregate supply curve, so we consider the scenario where the quantity of output is not affected by changes in aggregate demand."
