It involves subtracting the mean of each entity (usually an individual, firm, country, etc., depending on the context) away from each observation on that entity. This process is also known as demeaning the data.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Subtracting the mean of each entity away from each observation on that entity.\n\nThis transformation helps to remove any entity-specific effects or time-invariant characteristics that might bias our estimates in models such as fixed effects models. By doing this, we can isolate the effect of the variables that change over time within each entity, which is particularly useful when dealing with unobserved heterogeneity that is constant across time but varies across entities."
