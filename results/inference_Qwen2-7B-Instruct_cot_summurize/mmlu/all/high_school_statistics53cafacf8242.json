The first study was an experiment without a control group, while the second was an observational study. \n\nIn the first study, participants were assigned to different conditions ( watching 1 hour of TV or 5 hours of TV, which makes it an experiment. However, since there is no comparison or control group that was not exposed to either condition, it's technically lacking a full experimental design. \n\nThe second study involved observing students' self-reported television usage without manipulating the variables. This fits the definition of an observational study, where researchers observe subjects and measure variables of interest but do not attempt to influence the outcomes."
