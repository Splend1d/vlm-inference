However, in scenario 2, giving money to a judge in exchange for a favorable decision is considered a bribe and is generally viewed as morally wrong and illegal under US law. This is known as judicial corruption, which is a serious ethical violation. Therefore, the second scenario involves an action that is clearly morally wrong. The first scenario doesn't necessarily involve any wrongdoing unless additional context suggests otherwise."
