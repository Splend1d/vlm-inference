After a while, he got in bed and had sexual relations with the woman while she slept. At trial, he claimed that he believed that the woman had consented because he had dated her many times and had consensual sexual relations with her many times in the past. He hadn't seen her in about one week but assumed her consent. He denied specific intent to rape and claimed a desire to surprise her with a \"romantic\" variation of their usual activities. The woman admitted to prior consensual relations but denied consent on this occasion. Has he stated a viable defense to rape?\n\nA. No, his belief that she consented in advance was unreasonable and impermissible.\nB. Yes, rape is a specific intent crime and there's no evidence that he intended a criminal result.\nC. Yes, his belief that she consented was reasonable based on prior experience.\nD. No, rape of an unconscious woman is a strict liability crime that does not permit a defense.\n"

No, his belief that she consented in advance was unreasonable and impermissible.\n\nThe defense presented by the man is based on the assumption of consent due to past sexual encounters with the woman. However, this defense is not valid under the law as it pertains to rape cases. Consent must be explicit and enthusiastic for each and every act or encounter, and it cannot be assumed based on past behavior. Even if the woman has given consent in the past, it does not guarantee consent for future instances, especially when she explicitly denies consent on that particular occasion. Therefore, his belief that she consented is considered unreasonable and impermissible. \n\nRape laws generally require proof of specific intent to commit a criminal act, which in this case would involve the specific intent to engage in sexual activity without the woman's consent. The man's claim of a \"romantic\" variation of their usual activities does not negate the fact that he did not have her consent at the time of the act. \n\nThus, the correct answer is A: No, his belief that she consented in advance was unreasonable and impermissible."
