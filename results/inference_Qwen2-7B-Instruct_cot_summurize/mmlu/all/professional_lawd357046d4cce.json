He took her home and ended up forcefully raping her against her will. She escaped after the rape and went directly to the authorities. The police filed charges of rape. The student-defendant found several men willing to testify that the woman was promiscuous, that they had relations with her and that she was very prolific in her sexual life. Will the trial court likely permit the witnesses to testify to the woman's sexual predisposition under the Federal Rules of Evidence?\n\nA. Yes, because the rules permit evidence of a victim's sexual predisposition to test credibility.\nB. Yes, because the evidence will help the jury see that there may be two sides to the story and that the woman was thus the sexual predator instead of the man.\nC. No, because such \"sexual predisposition\" evidence is generally prohibited by the rules of evidence except under narrow exceptions.\nD. No, because the rules of evidence prohibit all evidence of a victim's prior sexual history.\n"

No, because such \"sexual predisposition\" evidence is generally prohibited by the rules of evidence except under narrow exceptions.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of a victim's past sexual behavior is generally not admissible to prove the victim's character for being sexually promiscuous or for suggesting consent to the conduct charged ( Rule 412. This rule aims to prevent the use of such prejudicial information that could unfairly sway the jury's decision. However, there are some narrow exceptions where such evidence might be admitted, such as when it is relevant to show a pertinent trait of character of a person other than the victim, or when it is offered to rebut a charge or implication that the victim engaged in consensual conduct of a similar nature.\n\nIn the given scenario, the testimony about the woman's sexual history would likely be excluded unless it can be shown to be relevant to something else in the case, such as proving that she engaged in consensual conduct with someone else at the time of the incident. The defense cannot simply introduce this evidence to suggest that the woman was more likely to have consented to the sexual encounter in question."
