This type of data collection involves gathering information firsthand through various methods such as surveys, interviews, observations, and experiments. Here's why each option provided does not fully define primary data:\n\nA. While it's true that primary data is collected for the first time specifically for a marketing research study, this statement alone doesn't encompass all the characteristics of primary data. It does highlight one aspect correctly but misses others.\n\nB. The statement suggests that acquiring primary data might be less time-consuming and less costly than acquiring secondary data. This is partially correct; primary data can sometimes be gathered at a lower cost and with less time if the process is well-designed. However, the cost and time involved in collecting primary data can vary widely depending on the method used, the sample size, and other factors.\n\nC. This option describes newly-published results of government investigations, which could be considered secondary data since they were not collected specifically for the current study but were published after the fact. Secondary data involves using existing data sources that have been collected for different purposes.\n\nD. Strategic planning activities and resource allocation are indeed part of the process when conducting research, including when collecting primary data. However, this option focuses on the outcome rather than the nature of the data itself. It does not define primary data but rather an application of how primary data might be utilized.\n\nTherefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D fully defines what primary data is. To accurately describe primary data, you would need to combine elements from these options and emphasize that primary data is:\n\n- Data collected directly for a specific purpose, often a research question or hypothesis.\n- Gathered through direct methods such as surveys, interviews, observations, or experiments.\n- Collected specifically for a marketing research study, which could imply aspects of options A and D.\n- Potentially more time-consuming and costly than secondary data, depending on the method and resources used, which aligns with some aspects of option B.\n- Not necessarily always newly-published government results or part of strategic planning activities, but these could be contexts where primary data is used."
