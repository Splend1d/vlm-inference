Primacy refers to the tendency to remember items at the beginning of a list better than those in the middle, while recency refers to the tendency to remember items at the end of a list better than those in the middle. Therefore, the first few and last few items on the list are more likely to be remembered.\n\nIn this case, \"license\" is the 6th item on the list, which falls in the middle of the list. Thus, it is the most likely to be forgotten compared to the other options."
