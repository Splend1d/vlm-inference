Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the land, the county leased most of it to a private company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate golf course and country club \u0080\u0094complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina \u0080\u0094and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the golf course and country club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee is empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee is $5,000 and the monthly dues $75 per month. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications for Latino Men, while disapproving and denying all applications of women, African Americans, white Americans, and other minorities. A white resident of the county, upon denial of membership, brings an action against the company seeking injunctive relief to compel his admission claiming that denial of membership to white residents violates his right to equal protection. Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. The company will prevail because its denial of membership lacks the requisite state action.\nB. The plaintiff will win because even though the company is a privately owned corporation, the state has affirmatively encouraged or facilitated its discriminating acts.\nC. The company will win, because the plaintiff lacks standing to assert the rights of discrimination against white Americans as a group.\nD. The plaintiff will win, because denial of membership to white residents cannot be justified by a rational basis.\n"

The plaintiff will win because even though the company is a privately owned corporation, the state has affirmatively encouraged or facilitated its discriminating acts.\n\nIn this scenario, the county leasing land to a private company and allowing it to operate under certain bylaws that include discriminatory practices creates a situation where the actions of the private company can be attributed to the state due to affirmative encouragement or facilitation. The state's grant of a license to sell alcoholic beverages to the company could be seen as an endorsement of the company's operations, including its discriminatory membership policies. This association between the state and the private entity's discriminatory practices might allow the plaintiff to argue successfully that the state is liable for the discrimination, as it indirectly supports the company's actions through the licensing process."
