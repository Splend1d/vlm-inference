A state official from discriminating against a person based on race.\n\nThe enabling clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, also known as Section 5, empowers Congress to enforce the provisions of the amendment through appropriate legislation. This is typically used to address issues of state action that violates the Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \n\nIn this context, \"state\" can include state officials, but not necessarily private individuals or federal officials. Therefore, the state (and by extension, state officials acting under state authority - would be most able to regulate when it comes to preventing discrimination based on race, as this directly implicates state action and the enforcement powers granted by the Fourteenth Amendment."
