Disease prevention through hygiene involves practices such as regular hand washing, maintaining cleanliness in living and working environments, proper disposal of waste, and safe food handling. These practices help to reduce the spread of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites.\n\nWhile vaccines (A, antivirals (B, and mosquito nets or bed nets  D, can also be effective in preventing specific diseases, they do not universally cover all types of diseases or provide ongoing protection against multiple pathogens. For example, vaccines prevent certain diseases but do not protect against all diseases, and antivirals are effective primarily when administered after infection has occurred, not necessarily as a preventive measure. Mosquito nets are specifically help prevent malaria, but do not protect against other vector-borne diseases."
