He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nCandide's statement that \"everything always happens for the best\" can be seen as a reflection of the Enlightenment belief that\n\nA. society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it\nB. a people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature\nC. the only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property\nD. only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness\n"

                    "text": "The statement that \"everything always happens for the best\" reflects the optimistic philosophical stance known as \"optimism,\" which was popularized by the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. This view suggests that despite the apparent hardships and evils in the world, everything ultimately serves a higher purpose and contributes to the overall good.\n\nVoltaire, in his satirical novel \"Candide,\" uses this phrase as a critique of optimism, particularly the version espoused by Leibniz. The character Pangloss embodies this optimistic worldview throughout the story, even after experiencing a series of misfortunes. Candide's skepticism towards Pangloss's assertion underscores Voltaire's own critical stance on optimism and its unrealistic portrayal of the world.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it - This aligns more closely with the broader Enlightenment belief in the power of reason and empirical evidence (the scientific method) to improve society.\n\nB. A people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature - This reflects Thomas Hobbes' view in \"Leviathan,\" emphasizing the need for a powerful sovereign to maintain order.\n\nC. The only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property - This aligns with John Locke's political philosophy, emphasizing individual rights under a government that protects them.\n\nD. Only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness - This reflects Adam Smith's economic theory of the \"invisible hand,\" suggesting that free markets lead to prosperity.\n\nWhile all these views were part of the Enlightenment discourse, none directly corresponds to Candide's statement about everything happening for the best. However, the closest option to reflecting the theme of the novel would be an interpretation that aligns with the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and progress, albeit in a critical light. Thus, option A might be considered the most relevant to the broader Enlightenment belief that society can be improved through the application of reason and science, though it should be noted that Voltaire's work critiques rather than fully embraces this idea."
