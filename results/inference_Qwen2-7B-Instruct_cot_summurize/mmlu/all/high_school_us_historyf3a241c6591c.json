They have a right publicly to remonstrate against the abuses of power in the strongest terms, to put their neighbors upon their guard against the craft or open violence of men in authority, and to assert with courage the sense they have of the blessings of liberty, the value they put upon it, and their resolution at all hazards to preserve it as one of the greatest blessings heaven can bestow.\u2026 But to conclude: The question before the Court and you, Gentlemen of the jury, is not of small or private concern. It is not the cause of one poor printer, nor of New York alone, which you are now trying. No! It may in its consequence affect every free man that lives under a British government on the main of America. It is the best cause. It is the cause of liberty. And I make no doubt but your upright conduct this day will not only entitle you to the love and esteem of your fellow citizens, but every man who prefers freedom to a life of slavery will bless and honor you as men who have baffled the attempt of tyranny, and by an impartial and uncorrupt verdict have laid a noble foundation for securing to ourselves, our posterity, and our neighbors, that to which nature and the laws of our country have given us a right to liberty of both exposing and opposing arbitrary power (in these parts of the world at least) by speaking and writing truth.\n\u2014Andrew Hamilton, concluding argument, libel trial of newspaper editor\nJohn Peter Zenger, August 4, 1735\nThe Zenger Case can best be compared to which of the following?\n\nA. Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War\nB. Government efforts to prevent the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971\nC. The trial of the accused Haymarket Square bombers in 1886\nD. The Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision of 1954\n"

Government efforts to prevent the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971.\n\nBoth cases involve situations where the government attempted to restrict or censor the press, which is a critical component of a free society. In the Zenger Case, Andrew Hamilton defended John Peter Zenger, a newspaper editor who was charged with seditious libel for publishing articles critical of the colonial governor. Hamilton argued that the right to speak freely about government actions, even if those actions are criticized, is essential to maintaining a free and democratic society. His defense was based on the idea that the public has a right to be informed about the actions of those in power and to express dissent without fear of punishment.\n\nSimilarly, in 1971, the U.S. government attempted to prevent the publication of the Pentagon Papers, a classified study detailing the U.S. government's involvement in the Vietnam War. The government argued that the release of the documents would harm national security and could lead to a loss of morale among troops. However, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the New York Times and The Washington Post, allowing them to publish the documents. This decision reinforced the First Amendment's protection of the freedom of the press and the public's right to receive information, thereby affirming the importance of a free press in a democracy.\n\nThus, both the Zenger Case and the efforts to prevent the publication of the Pentagon Papers highlight the tension between governmental authority and the need for a free and independent press to inform the public and hold those in power accountable."
