Everyone we know - This is a broad definition that encompasses all the people you are connected with, whether they are acquaintances, friends, colleagues, or even strangers you've interacted with online.\n\nHowever, depending on context, it can also refer to:\n\nB. Those who are closest to us - In this context, social network might mean your inner circle of close friends and family members.\n\nOr it could also refer to:\n\nC. Those who we have not yet met - In the digital age, social networks often include people you haven't physically met but are connected with through online platforms.\n\nAnd sometimes, when discussing online social media platforms, it might specifically refer to:\n\nD. Family members - In the context of social networking sites, this could refer to the immediate family members who are also part of your network.\n\nSo, the answer isn't clear-cut as it depends on the specific context in which \"social network\" is being used."
