The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?\n\nA. No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.\nB. No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.\nC. Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.\nD. Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.\n"

Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.\n\nIn determining whether to grant a motion to intervene, courts generally consider several factors including whether the intervenor has an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action, whether the intervenor's interest may be impaired if the intervenor is not permitted to intervene, whether the intervenor's interest is adequately represented by existing parties, and whether the relief sought by the intervenor requires resolution of issues that are are identical to those in the main action.\n\nGiven that the employer's claim for damages to the computer is directly related to the negligence claim against the building owner, there are likely to be common questions of law and fact between the employer's claim and the clerk's personal injury claim. This means that the outcome of the case could affect both parties, making the employer an interested party who should be allowed to intervene. Therefore, the court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene under these circumstances."
