In a simulation, we can use a random number generator to produce numbers between 0 and 1. If the generated number is less than 0.20, it represents a successful sale; otherwise, it represents a failure to sell a policy. This method ensures that the simulation accurately reflects the real-world probability of selling a policy to a customer."
