True, False\n\nExplanation:\n\n1) The statement \"As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction\" is generally considered TRUE. According to various studies and surveys, there is a positive correlation between economic development and subjective well-being, including life satisfaction. This relationship has been observed in many developed countries where economic prosperity often correlates with higher reported levels of happiness.\n\n2) The statement \"Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact\" is FALSE. While significant life events can cause temporary changes in happiness levels, research indicates that their impact on long-term happiness is more nuanced than this statement suggests. For instance, while a divorce might initially cause a decline in happiness, over time, people often adapt and can regain or even improve their overall life satisfaction. Similarly, marriage can provide a boost in happiness, but the long-term effects depend on factors like the quality of the relationship, personal circumstances, and individual adaptation. Longitudinal studies show that while initial reactions can be strong, the impact on long-term happiness is complex and not universally small."
