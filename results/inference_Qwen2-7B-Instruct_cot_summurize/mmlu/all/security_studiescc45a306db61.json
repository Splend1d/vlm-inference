Therefore, the statement that best defines the term 'materialism' within historical materialism is:\n\nA. Materialism refers to HM's focus on class and the productive basis of societies, as well as the ways in which social structures have the capacity to change and produce change.\n\nThis definition alignss with the core tenets of historical materialism, which was developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to this theory, the material conditions of society, particularly the economic base (which includes the mode of production, property relations, and the distribution of wealth, fundamentally shape the superstructure, including the political, legal, and ideological aspects of society. Historical materialism emphasizes the role of material factors in driving historical change and the importance of understanding the relationship between the material conditions of society and the ideas and institutions that emerge from them."
