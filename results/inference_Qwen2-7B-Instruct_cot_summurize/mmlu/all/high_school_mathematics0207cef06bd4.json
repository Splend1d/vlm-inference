This means that the function is undefined when the denominator equals zero, i.e., when \\(1-x = 0\\), which gives us \\(x = 1\\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Behavior as \\(x\\) Approaches Specific Values\n\n- **As \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the left (\\(x \\to 1^-\\)):** The denominator \\(1-x\\) approaches 0 but remains negative, causing \\(f(x)\\) to approach \\(-\\infty\\).\n- **As \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right (\\(x \\to 1^+\\)):** The denominator \\(1-x\\) approaches 0 but remains positive, causing \\(f(x)\\) to approach \\(+\\infty\\).\n\n### Step 3: Consider Asymptotic Behavior and Limits\n\n- **Vertical Asymptote at \\(x = 1\\):** This indicates that the function approaches \\(\\pm\\infty\\) as \\(x\\) approaches 1.\n- **Horizontal Asymptote:** To find the horizontal asymptote, consider the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) goes to \\(\\pm\\infty\\). Since the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is 0 and the degree of the polynomial in the denominator is 1, the horizontal asymptote is \\(y = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Range\n\nGiven the behavior of the function, we can conclude that:\n- The function takes on all values less than 0 and all values greater than 0, but never reaches 0 itself due to the horizontal asymptote at \\(y = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the range of the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x}\\) is **all real numbers except 0**, which can be expressed in interval notation as:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)} \\]\n\nThis matches choice **B. (-\\infty,0)\\cup (0,\\infty)**."
