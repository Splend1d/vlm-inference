Most rocks on the Moon\u2019s surface are older than those on the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThe Giant Impact Hypothesis suggests that the Moon was formed from the debris left over after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth. This impact would have melted the Earth's outer layers and mixed them with material from the impacting body, forming the Moon out of this debris. \n\nA) The relative size of the Moon to Earth is indeed larger compared to other planets and their moons, which supports the hypothesis that it was formed in such a way.\n\nC) The Moon having a smaller iron core than expected for its size can be explained by the hypothesis, as the impact would have melted the Earth's core less than the Moon's.\n\nD) The Moon being once entirely molten is consistent with the hypothesis, as the impact would have created a large amount of molten rock from both the Earth and the impacting body.\n\nHowever, the fact that rocks on the Moon's surface are generally older than those on Earth's surface does not support the Giant Impact Hypothesis. In fact, it could be argued against it, as one might expect a younger surface on the Moon if it were formed from more recent materials mixed in the Earth-Moon system."
