Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving classification accuracies exceeding 95%. Techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and architectural improvements can significantly boost the performance.\n\nStatement 2 is false. Contrary to the statement, ensembles of neural networks often improve classification accuracy. This is because different models in an ensemble might make different types of errors, and averaging their predictions (or selecting the majority vote) can lead to better generalization and higher accuracy. The independence or diversity among the models in the ensemble plays a crucial role in improving overall performance."
