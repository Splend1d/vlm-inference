Decreasing the temperature\n\nAccording to Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle, if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in conditions, it will adjust in such a way as to counteract that change. Since the dimerization of NO2(g) to N2O4(g) is an endothermic process, it absorbs heat. Therefore, decreasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium towards the exothermic direction to produce more heat, increasing the amount of N2O4 in the reaction vessel."
