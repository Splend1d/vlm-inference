Respiratory tract infections\n\nAdenoviruses can cause a wide range of illnesses, but respiratory tract infections (such as bronchitis and pneumonia in adults and croup or bronchiolitis in children - are among the most common and clinically significant presentations. They often result in symptoms such as coughing, runny nose, fever, and sometimes more severe complications.\n\nWhile adenovirus can also cause eye infections (such as conjunctivitis) and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, it is the respiratory tract infections that generally have the most significant clinical impact due to their frequency and potential for severe outcomes, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Haemorrhagic cystitis, which refers to bleeding in the bladder, is a less common complication typically seen in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy treatment."
