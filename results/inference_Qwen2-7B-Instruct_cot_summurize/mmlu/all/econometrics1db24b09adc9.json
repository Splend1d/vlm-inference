                    "text": "The Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model addresses several limitations that the standard GARCH model has:\n\ni) Estimated coefficient values from GARCH models may be negative: This is indeed an issue with the standard GARCH model as it can produce negative conditional variances. The EGARCH model avoids this problem by modeling the logarithm of the variance, thus ensuring that the variance remains positive.\n\nii) GARCH models cannot account for leverage effects: The leverage effect refers to the observation that negative returns (bad news) tend to increase volatility more than positive returns (good news) of the same magnitude. The EGARCH model explicitly allows for asymmetric responses to positive and negative shocks, thus accounting for the leverage effect.\n\niii) The responsiveness of future volatility to positive and negative shocks is symmetric under a GARCH formulation: As mentioned in point ii), the EGARCH model addresses this limitation by allowing for asymmetric volatility responses to positive and negative shocks.\n\niv) GARCH models cannot allow for a feedback from the volatility to the returns: While this is not inherently a limitation of the GARCH model per se, it's often criticized because it does not allow for a direct impact of past volatility on current returns. The EGARCH model, however, focuses on the volatility process itself rather than directly linking volatility to returns, which might not fully address the critique but does highlight the focus on volatility dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the criticisms that can be overcome by EGARCH models are (i), (ii), and (iii). \n\nThe correct answer is C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only."
