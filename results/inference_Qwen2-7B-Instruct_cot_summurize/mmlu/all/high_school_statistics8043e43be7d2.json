Since we're adding these components together, we'll add their variances, not their standard deviations directly.\n\nThe variance of a sum of independent random variables is the sum of their variances. \n\n- Variance of books = \\( \\sigma_{books}^2 = 2^2 = 4 \\) pounds^2\n- Variance of boxes = \\( \\sigma_{boxes}^2 = 0.15^2 = 0.0225 \\) pounds^2\n- Variance of packing materials = \\( \\sigma_{materials}^2 = 0.25^2 = 0.0656 \\) pounds^2\n\nAdding these variances gives us the total variance:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Variance} = \\sigma_{total}^2 = 4 + 0.0225 + 0.0256 = 4.0481 \\] pounds^2\n\nTo get the standard deviation from the total variance, take the square root:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{total} = \\sqrt{4.0481} \\approx 2.012 \\] pounds\n\nThe closest answer choice to 2.012 pounds is D. 2.021 pounds. However, based on the calculation, the precise value would be closer to 2.012 pounds, which is not exactly listed among the options provided. This discrepancy suggests there might have been a slight rounding difference or an error in the options given. Given the choices, the best selection would be D, assuming minor rounding differences."
