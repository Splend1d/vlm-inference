One y-intercept and three regression coefficients.\n\nIn a multiple linear regression model, each predictor variable (in this case, the effectiveness of parental commands, consistency of parental discipline, and parental warmth, gets its own regression coefficient. These coefficients indicate the change in the dependent variable (frequency of tantrums for a unit change in each predictor, assuming all other predictors are held constant. \n\nThe y-intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all predictor variables are equal to zero. It's a single value as it's associated with the baseline prediction made by the model without any influence from the predictor variables.\n\nTherefore, for a model that includes three predictor variables, you would have one y-intercept and three regression coefficients."
