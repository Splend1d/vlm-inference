The correct definition is:\n\nA. Distance at which one astronomical unit (measures one arcsecond of parallax.\n\nThis means that if you observe a star from two points in Earth's orbit six months apart (as Earth moves from one side of its orbit to the other), the star will have a slight apparent shift in position due to the change in perspective. If this parallax angle is measured to be one arcsecond, then the star is said to be at a distance of one parsec. \n\nIn other words, the parsec is defined as the distance from the Sun to an astronomical object which has a parallax angle of one arcsecond ( (1/3600 of a degree). Parallax is the apparent change in position of an object when viewed from different points. This method allows astronomers to calculate distances to stars using trigonometry, specifically the formula: \n\\[ \\text{Distance in parsecs} = \\frac{1}{\\text{parallax angle in arcseconds}} \\]\n\nThis method was first used by Vesto Slipher and Milton Humason in the early 20th century to measure the distances to nearby galaxies, revolutionizing our understanding of the scale of the universe."
