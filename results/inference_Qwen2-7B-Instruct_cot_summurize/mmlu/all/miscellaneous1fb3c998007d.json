This resolution was a response to alleged attacks on two U.S. Navy vessels by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. The resolution gave President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authority to take military action against North Vietnam without declaring a formal state of war, effectively escalating U.S. involvement in the conflict beyond the initial advisory missions and limited combat operations."
