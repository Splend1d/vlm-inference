I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nPuritan emigration from England came to a near halt between the years 1649 and 1660 because, during that period,\n\nA. most English Puritans were imprisoned for heresy\nB. most Puritans converted to Catholicism\nC. the New England settlement had become too overcrowded, and colonial legislatures strongly discouraged immigration\nD. the Puritans controlled the English government\n"

As these colonies grew in population, they faced challenges such as land shortages and the need for more resources. Additionally, the colonial legislatures likely took steps to discourage further immigration to control population growth, manage resources, and maintain order within their communities. This period also coincided with other factors like political instability in England, which might have influenced the decision-making of potential emigrants."
