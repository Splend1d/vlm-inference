The Torah discusses sexual relations within the framework of marriage, which is seen as a sacred institution. While there are certain rules and restrictions (such as laws regarding forbidden relationships or prohibitions during certain times of the month), Judaism generally does not regard sexuality as inherently evil. Instead, it encourages moderation and respect for the sanctity of the body and the relationship between partners."
