It increases the number of lymphocytes with receptors that can recognize and bind to the antigen.\n\nVaccination works by introducing a weakened or dead form of a pathogen, or parts of it ( into the body. This triggers an immune response without causing the disease. The immune system learns to recognize and fight that pathogen, creating memory cells that will quickly respond if the real pathogen enters the body in the future. \n\nThis process leads to an increase in lymphocytes ( white blood cells that play a key role in the adaptive immune response - specifically B cells ( which produce antibodies against the antigen, and T cells which help to destroy infected cells. These lymphocytes have receptors on their surface that can recognize and bind to the antigen. This recognition and binding ability is what helps the immune system fight off the pathogen effectively when encountered again."
