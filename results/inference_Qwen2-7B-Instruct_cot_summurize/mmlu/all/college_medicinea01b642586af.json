                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The percentage of CO2 in the right ventricle would be higher.\n\nIn a patient with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), blood from the left ventricle can shunt into the right ventricle, bypassing the lungs. This means that deoxygenated blood (which should have been oxygenated in the lungs) is mixed with oxygenated blood in the right ventricle before it's pumped out to the body. As a result, the right ventricle contains a mix of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) because the CO2 hasn't been removed by the lungs as it normally would be.\n\nA. The percentage of oxygen in the left atrium would not necessarily be lower; it could actually be higher due to the mixing of oxygenated blood from the left ventricle with the deoxygenated blood that bypasses the lungs through the VSD.\n\nC. The percentage of oxygen in the right atrium would not necessarily be lower either; it might actually be higher because some oxygenated blood from the left ventricle is able to enter the right atrium via the VSD, but this doesn't significantly affect the overall oxygen content of the right atrium compared to the normal situation where all blood entering the right atrium is deoxygenated.\n\nD. The percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle would not be higher due to the VSD; instead, it would be a mix of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, which could potentially lead to a decrease in the overall oxygen level if the majority of the blood is deogenated."
