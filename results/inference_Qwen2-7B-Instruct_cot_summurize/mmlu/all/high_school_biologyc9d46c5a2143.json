This process ensures that when two gametes (sperm and egg cells) fuse during fertilization, the resulting zygote has the correct number of chromosomes. \n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. The daughter cells are genetically identical to the parent cells: This statement is incorrect because meiosis involves genetic recombination, which results in genetic variation among the daughter cells.\n\nB. Homologous pairs during prophase II: This statement is also incorrect. Homologous chromosomes pair up during prophase I, not prophase II.\n\nC. DNA replication occurs before meiosis I and meiosis II: While DNA replication does occur before both meiosis I and meiosis II, it's important to note that only half of the DNA is replicated for each subsequent division. This reduction in DNA content is what leads to the halving of the chromosome number in meiosis."
