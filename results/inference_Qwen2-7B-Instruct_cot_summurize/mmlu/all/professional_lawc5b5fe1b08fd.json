They claimed receiving promises from the broker that if they bought the home immediately a $15,000 rebate would be given to them at closing by the sellers. At closing, the sellers claimed no knowledge and didn't pay. At trial against the broker, the couple subpoenaed one of the broker's agents who testified that he was in a meeting with the buyers and he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objected that the testimony was hearsay. What will the court most likely decide regarding the admissibility of the testimony?\n\nA. The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.\nB. The testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.\nC. The testimony is inadmissible because it is pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter that is in dispute.\nD. The testimony is admissible \u0080\u0094 even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.\n"

The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.\n\nIn this scenario, the agent's statement is considered an admission by the broker, as the agent was acting within the scope of his employment when he overheard the broker making the promise to the couple. This type of statement is generally admissible under the party admission exception to the hearsay rule. The fact that the agent is testifying about what the broker said does not change the admissibility of the statement itself, provided that the statement falls under an exception to the hearsay rule, such as being an admission by a party opponent.\n\nIt is important to note that the broker's objection to the hearsay nature of the testimony would typically be overcome by the exception for party admissions. However, the court may also consider whether the agent had authority to make such a promise on behalf of the broker. If the agent did not have express or implied authority to make such a promise, the testimony might still be admissible under the party admission exception. \n\nAdditionally, the availability of the broker for cross-examination addresses another concern with hearsay evidence, which is the lack of opportunity to test the truthfulness of the statement through confrontation. In this case, since the broker can be cross-examined, the concerns regarding the reliability of the out-of-court statement are mitigated."
