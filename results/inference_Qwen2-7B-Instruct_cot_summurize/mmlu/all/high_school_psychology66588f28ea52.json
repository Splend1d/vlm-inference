Conditioning experiments that involve inducing fear or distress in young children are likely to violate these guidelines, as they do not serve the necessary scientific purpose without causing potential harm or discomfort. Additionally, parental consent and understanding of the risks involved are crucial, making option A also relevant but less directly tied to the ethical standards governing such research."
