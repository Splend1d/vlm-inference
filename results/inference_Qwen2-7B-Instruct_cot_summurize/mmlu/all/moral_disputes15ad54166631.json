In this context, she might argue that the morality of an action should not solely depend on the motivation behind it, especially when the outcome benefits a significant number of people. The potential to save lives from congenital blindness could outweigh the negative motivations driving the scientist's pursuit of mastery.\n\nThis perspective counters the notion that all actions motivated by bad desires are impermissible ( (option B) and does not directly address whether the desire for mastery is inherently good or bad ( (option C). It also doesn't necessarily imply that the only way to cure a disease is through selfish desires ( (option D).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option A seems to be the most aligned with Kamm's views. However, without direct quotes or a detailed understanding of her specific argument in this scenario, it's important to note that interpretations of philosophical arguments can vary, and additional context would be needed for a more definitive conclusion."
