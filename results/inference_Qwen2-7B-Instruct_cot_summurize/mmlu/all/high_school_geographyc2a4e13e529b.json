Mercedes-Benz dealership\n\nMercedes-Benz dealerships typically provide services that are not available in every town or smaller locality, making them considered higher-order central places. These establishments usually serve a larger geographic area and offer specialized goods or services that are not as readily available in smaller towns or communities. \n\nA. Winn-Dixie grocery store: While it is a significant service for local communities, it is more likely to be found in multiple smaller towns or cities, so it would not typically be considered a higher-order central place.\n\nC. Shoe store: This is a common retail service that can be found in various sizes of towns and cities, so it would also not generally be considered a higher-order central place.\n\nD. Family doctor: Medical services, such as those provided by family doctors, are often provided in smaller towns and are not typically considered part of the higher-order central place system, which focuses on specialized services rather than basic health care."
