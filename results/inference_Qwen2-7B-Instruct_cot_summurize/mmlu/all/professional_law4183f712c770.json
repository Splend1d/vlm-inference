Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?\n\nA. No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.\nB. No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.\nC. Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.\nD. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n"

Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n\nUnder the rules of evidence, a party may impeach a witness's credibility by showing inconsistencies in their testimony. This can include showing that the witness failed to mention certain information (in this case, the defendant's claim of an alibi) when they had an opportunity to do so previously (when the police asked them about any statements the defendant made regarding an alibi). This is because the witness's failure to disclose this information could indicate a reason to doubt their reliability or honesty, which is relevant to their credibility as a witness. Therefore, the prosecutor is allowed to ask questions that highlight this discrepancy in the witness's account."
