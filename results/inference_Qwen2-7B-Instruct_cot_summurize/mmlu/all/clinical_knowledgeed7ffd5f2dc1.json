                    "text": "Spastic paraplegia is characterized by a group of symptoms that include stiffness, muscle spasms, and often coordination difficulties in the legs. This condition is typically associated with increased muscle tone, which is not normal or flaccid, but rather spastic ( meaning it is abnormally stiff and tight.\n\nLet's look at each of your options:\n\nA. Multiple Sclerosis (can cause this neurological pattern - While multiple sclerosis (MS) can present with some symptoms similar to those of spastic paraplegia, such as muscle stiffness and coordination issues, MS is more commonly associated with alternating periods of relapse and remission, visual disturbances, and other neurological symptoms. Therefore, while it's possible for MS to contribute to a spastic paraplegic pattern, it's not the defining characteristic.\n\nB. Proprioceptive loss is a common feature - Proprioception refers to the body's ability to sense its position and movement without relying on vision or touch. In spastic paraplegia, proprioceptive loss might occur because of the underlying neurological conditions that cause the stiffness and spasticity. However, it's not a defining feature of spastic paraplegia as it can be present in other neurological disorders as well.\n\nC. Coordination in the legs is affected - This statement accurately reflects one of the primary symptoms of spastic paraplegia. The stiffness and increased muscle tone can lead to difficulty in coordinating movements, which can manifest as gait abnormalities, clumsiness, or other coordination issues in the legs.\n\nD. The tone is normal or flaccid - As mentioned earlier, in spastic paraplegia, the tone is not normal or flaccid; it is typically increased, making muscles stiff and tight.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the information provided is **C. Coordination in the legs is affected**."
