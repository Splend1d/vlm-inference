                    "text": "The false statement among the options provided is:\n\nA. Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas.\n\nThis statement is false because while dietary starch can indeed stimulate motility in the small intestine through other mechanisms, such as osmotic effects or changes in gut hormones like cholecystokinin (CCK), it does not directly cause insulin release from the pancreas to stimulate intestinal motility. Insulin release primarily affects glucose metabolism and has indirect effects on the gastrointestinal tract, but it is not a direct stimulator of intestinal motility.\n\nLet's briefly summarize why the other statements are true:\n\nB. Food in the stomach does indeed cause gastrin release from the stomach lining. Gastrin is a hormone that promotes acid secretion by the parietal cells in the stomach.\n\nC. Short-chain fatty acids produced in the colon from the fermentation of dietary fibers do promote ileo-caecal motility. This helps in the propulsion of contents towards the large intestine.\n\nD. The arrival of lipids ( fats and oils in the duodenum does cause an immediate reduction in motility. This is part of the \"feeding\" response where the body conserves energy and reduces digestive activity to allow for the efficient absorption of nutrients, including fats, which require more energy to digest."
