In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags. The state attorney general now seeks review of this decision in the U. S. Supreme Court. How should the U. S. Supreme Court rule on this case?\n\nA. Refuse to review this case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below.\nB. Reverse the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding rendered below makes such a state constitutional decision unnecessary.\nC. Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.\nD. Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to both the federal and state constitutional issues because the state constitution must substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue.\n"

However, given the nature of the case, which involves both federal and state constitutional questions, the court may also consider the implications of the state supreme court's ruling on federalism principles and the balance of power between state and federal governments.\n\nIn this scenario, the state supreme court ruled that the statute violates the contracts clause of the state constitution, arguing that the law retroactively impairs the ability of companies to honor existing contracts for packaging ink cartridges in plastic bags. The U.S. Supreme Court might weigh the following factors:\n\n1. **Contracts Clause Analysis**: The court could examine whether the state law indeed retroactively impairs existing contracts and if so, whether the impairment is justified under the balancing test set forth in the United States v. Carolene Products Co. ( (1938). This would involve assessing the extent of the impairment, the nature of the contract, and the state's interest in enacting the law.\n\n2. **Federal Constitutional Issues**: The court would need to determine if the state law also violates the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution. This would involve analyzing the impact of the state law on interstate commerce and whether it constitutes an undue burden on the ability of parties to enter into and fulfill contracts across state lines.\n\n3. **State Constitutional Issues**: If the court decides to address the state constitutional issue, it would have to consider whether the state supreme court correctly applied the relevant provisions of the state constitution, particularly the contracts clause, and whether the state law is consistent with the state constitution's intent and purpose.\n\n4. **Federalism and Preemption**: The court may also consider whether the state law conflicts with federal law or preempts federal regulatory objectives, particularly if the state law aims to regulate an area traditionally left to federal regulation, such as environmental standards or commerce.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate course of action for the U.S. Supreme Court might be:\n\n**Option D: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to both the federal and state constitutional issues because the state constitution must substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue.**\n\nThis option assumes that the state constitution must not contradict the federal constitution, especially concerning fundamental rights and powers protected under the federal constitution, such as those addressed by the Contracts Clause. The court would likely affirm the state supreme court's decision on the state constitutional issue because it aligns with the principle that state constitutions must not conflict with federal constitutional protections. Additionally, if the federal constitutional analysis supports the state supreme court's conclusion, the court would affirm the decision on the federal constitutional issue as well, reflectinging a harmonious application of constitutional law across levels of government."
