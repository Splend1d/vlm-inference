The patterns of trait inheritance observed in pea plants were repeatedly demonstrated in other eukaryotes.\n\nMendel's principle of segregation, which states that alleles of a gene separate during the formation of gametes so that each gamete receives only one allele, has been considered a \"law\" because it accurately predicts the outcomes of genetic crosses across various organisms. This principle, along with others proposed by Mendel, laid the foundation for classical genetics. Over time, these principles have been tested and confirmed in numerous other species, not just pea plants, providing strong evidence for their validity and universality within the realm of genetics."
