The lender (the main character in this scenario has provided a service or loan, and the borrower has returned it with interest, which is generally expected in such transactions.\n\nIn Scenario 2, singing and cheering from one's seat at a wake is also not typically considered morally wrong. Wakes, funerals, and other mourning rituals often involve various forms of expression and remembrance of the deceased, including music and vocal tributes. Therefore, participating in such activities can be seen as a respectful way to honor the memory of the deceased."
