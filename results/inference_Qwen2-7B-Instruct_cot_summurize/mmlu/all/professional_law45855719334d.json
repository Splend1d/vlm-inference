Adjoining the farmland was a 50-acre ranch, which was owned by a rancher. In 2004, the rancher forged the farmer's signature on a deed and purported to convey the farmland to a grocer. The grocer paid the rancher $100,000 as the purchase price for the farmland. The following year, the grocer sold the property to a buyer for $125,000. The deed from the grocer to the buyer was properly executed and recorded by the buyer. This jurisdiction has the following \"pure race\" recording statute in effect:\"No conveyance or other instrument is valid as against purchasers for a valuable consideration who record first. \"After the buyer took possession of the farmland, he renovated the farmhouse that was located on the property and made improvements valued at $50,000. In 2006, the farmer returned to visit his sister. During his visit, the farmer went to the farmland to inspect his farmland. While doing so, he encountered the buyer, who informed the farmer that he was the new owner of the property. The farmer thereupon instituted suit to quiet title to the farmland. After judgment was rendered in the farmer's favor, the buyer was ejected from the property. The buyer has now filed an appropriate action against the grocer seeking restitution for the loss he incurred with respect to the purchase and improvements made on the farmland.

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. $25,000.00.\n\nIn this scenario, the buyer purchased the farmland from the grocer, who had fraudulently obtained the deed by forging the farmer's signature. The farmer subsequently won a lawsuit to establish his rightful ownership of the land, resulting in the buyer being ejected from the property.\n\nGiven that the buyer has filed an appropriate action against the grocer seeking restitution for the loss incurred due to the fraudulent sale and subsequent improvements made on the farmland, we must consider the legal principles involved.\n\nUnder the \"pure race\" recording statute mentioned, the buyer, who paid a valuable consideration and recorded the deed, would have priority over any later claims by the farmer, had the fraud not been discovered earlier. However, since the farmer was able to prove his ownership through legal means, the fraud committed by the rancher (forging the farmer's signature) and the subsequent fraudulent sale to the grocer can be considered as grounds for the buyer to seek restitution.\n\nConsidering the situation, the buyer made two significant financial investments: the initial purchase of the farmland for $100,000 and additional improvements totaling $50,000. The total loss incurred by the buyer is thus $150,000 ($100,000 + $50,000). Since the farmer is seeking to recover the full value of the property ($125,000), it implies that the grocer sold the property below its market value, leading to a discrepancy between the purchase price and the actual value of the land.\n\nGiven the circumstances, it is reasonable to infer that the court may order the grocer to compensate the buyer for the difference between what the buyer paid and the actual value of the property when they bought it, considering the improvements made. Therefore, the most likely recovery amount for the buyer would be the difference between the purchase price and the value at the time of purchase, which would be $25,000 ($100,000 - $75,000, where $75,000 represents the fair market value of the property minus the improvements).\n\nTherefore, option B ($25,000) is the most accurate choice based on the given information and the legal principles involved."
