This includes .exe files (which are Windows executables), .dll (dynamic link libraries), .bat (batch scripts), and others. These types of files are more likely to contain malicious code that can harm your system.\n\nOn the other hand, .jpg, .pdf, .wav files are images, documents, and audio files respectively, and they generally don't execute code by default. However, they can be used to carry malware, but not as easily as an executable file."
