These programs are funded by the federal government and are designed to provide financial assistance or services to people who meet certain eligibility criteria. Congress is responsible for authorizing and funding these programs, and once an individual qualifies based on those criteria, they are entitled to receive the benefits as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements."
