The money (or banking) multiplier. \n\nIn monetary economics, the money multiplier is the ratio of the total money supply to the monetary base ( (which includes currency in circulation and bank reserves). If we assume that banks lend out 100% of their deposits (i.e., they hold no reserves), then the money multiplier would be equal to 1. This means that for every dollar of reserves, banks can create $1 of new loans and thus $1 of new money.\n\nThe other options are not equal to one:\n\nA. The elasticity of the long-run aggregate supply curve measures how responsive output is to changes in price level in the long run. It is not necessarily equal to one.\n\nB. The spending (or expenditure) multiplier is a measure of how much total spending increases in response to an initial injection of spending. It depends on the marginal propensity to consume and the marginal propensity to save and is generally greater than one but can vary widely.\n\nD. The balanced budget multiplier is related to the effect of government spending or taxation on the economy when the government maintains a balanced budget ( i.e., no net change in debt. Its value depends on factors such as the marginal propensity to consume and the degree of crowding out of private investment, so it's not necessarily equal to one."
