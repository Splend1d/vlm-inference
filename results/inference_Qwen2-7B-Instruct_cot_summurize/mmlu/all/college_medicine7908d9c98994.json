This leads to a buildup of inorganic phosphate ( (Pi) as a byproduct of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) breakdown. ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell, and its rapid consumption during high-intensity activities can result in a decrease in ATP levels and an increase in Pi levels. This accumulation of Pi can contribute to muscle fatigue by disrupting the normal energy metabolism within the muscle cells."
