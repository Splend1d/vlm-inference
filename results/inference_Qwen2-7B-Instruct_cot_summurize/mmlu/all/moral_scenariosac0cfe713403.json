Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, donating rotten apples is considered morally wrong because it doesn't fulfill the intended purpose of donating food that can be consumed by those in need. The quality of the food provided is compromised, which goes against the spirit of helping others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, selling exotic berries at the farmer's market is not inherently wrong. Assuming the berries are legally obtained and are not harmful, selling them is a part of conducting a legitimate business activity. It could even be seen as contributing to local economies or providing access to unique products for consumers."
