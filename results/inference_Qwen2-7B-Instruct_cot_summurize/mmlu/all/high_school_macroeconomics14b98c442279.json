It is a key indicator of a country's economic health and size of its market. GDP measures both the level of production and income within an economy, making options I and III correct. Option II, \"stability,\" is not directly measured by GDP; while economic growth or lack thereof can affect stability, GDP itself does not measure stability as it does not account for factors such as income distribution, environmental sustainability, or social well-being."
