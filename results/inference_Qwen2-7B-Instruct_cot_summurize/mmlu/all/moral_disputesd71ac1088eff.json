Loyalty \u2014 fidelity to one's friends and society.\n3. Fairness \u2014 treating people with justice.\n4. Benevolence \u2014 kindness to others.\n\nAudi suggests adding:\n\n1. Veracity \u2014 honesty in speech and action.\n2. Enhancement and preservation of freedom \u2014 promoting and protecting individual liberties.\n3. Respectfulness \u2014 treating others with dignity and consideration.\n\nThese additions align with Ross's idea of having multiple, non-contradictory moral obligations that can sometimes conflict, requiring careful judgment to determine which duty to prioritize in any given situation."
