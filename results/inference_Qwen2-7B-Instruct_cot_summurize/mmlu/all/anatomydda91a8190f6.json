The midbrain (A) plays roles in vision, hearing, and motor control, while the pons (B) aids in sleep-wake cycles and relays sensory information. The cerebellum (D) is responsible for coordinating movement and balance, but it's not considered a vital center for basic life functions like the medulla oblongata is."
