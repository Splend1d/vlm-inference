Armed force should only ever be used in the national interest and that humanitarian intervention is therefore imprudent.\n\nThis statement aligns more with a critique from a different perspective, such as a nationalist or conservative viewpoint, rather than a core argument in realism against humanitarian interventions. Realism in international relations theory generally argues for state sovereignty and self-interest, but it doesn't necessarily oppose all forms of humanitarian intervention per se. Instead, realists might argue that humanitarian interventions can complicate international relations, potentially provoke unintended consequences, or undermine the principle of state sovereignty."
