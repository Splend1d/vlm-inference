This essentially means the test's ability to detect an effect, if there is one, and not to make a type II error (which is failing to reject a false null hypothesis.\n\nTo clarify the other options:\n\nA. The probability that the null hypothesis is true is not directly related to the power of a significance test. Power is about the test's ability to detect a false null hypothesis, not its truth.\n\nB. The probability of getting a Type I error is actually the significance level (\u03b1 of the test, not the power. A Type I error occurs when you incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis.\n\nC. The probability of getting a Type II error is 1 minus the power of the test. It refers to the chance of failing to reject a false null hypothesis."
