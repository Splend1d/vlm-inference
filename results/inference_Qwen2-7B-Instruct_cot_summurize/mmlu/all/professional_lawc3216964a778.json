The doctor examined her and determined that she was not pregnant, but decided that he would tell her she was, in order to earn his $500 fee. After receiving the $500, the doctor proceeded to have the woman admitted to a hospital by falsely informing the hospital authorities that she had a benign tumor on her uterus, which he was going to remove. He performed all the surgical procedures appropriate for an abortion under adequate hygienic conditions, but the woman began hemorrhaging and died. The doctor should be found guilty of\n\nA. murder and larceny by trick.\nB. manslaughter and false pretenses.\nC. battery and larceny by trick.\nD. murder, battery, and false pretenses.\n"

In this scenario, the doctor tricked the woman into believing she was pregnant so that he could charge her for an abortion and receive payment.\n\nManslaughter, as an intentional act resulting in death without malice aforethought, does not apply here since the doctor acted with intent to cause harm. False pretenses refers to the act of making false statements with the intent to deceive for the purpose of obtaining money or property. While the doctor did use false pretenses to get the woman admitted to the hospital, this term alone does not cover the full scope of actions taken and the resulting death.\n\nBattery involves the unlawful physical contact that results in harmful or offensive contact. While the doctor's actions during the abortion procedure could potentially be considered battery, the more serious charge of murder and the specific charge of larceny by trick encompass the full range of illegal actions in this case."
