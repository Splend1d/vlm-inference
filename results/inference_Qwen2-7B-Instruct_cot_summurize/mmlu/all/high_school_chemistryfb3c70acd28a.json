Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract electrons towards itself in a chemical bond. Fluorine (F is the most electronegative element, and phosphorus (P is less electronegative than sulfur (S, carbon C, and boron B. The larger the difference in electronegativity, the more polar the bond. \n\nTherefore, the P-F bond will have the largest bond polarity because fluorine has the highest electronegativity among the given options."
