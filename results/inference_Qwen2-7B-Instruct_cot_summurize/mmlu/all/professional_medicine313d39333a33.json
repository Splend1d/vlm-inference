She further reports that on the day her menses begins she becomes acutely depressed, anorectic, irritable, and lethargic. She has no psychiatric history. Physical examination findings are normal. She and her husband have been trying to conceive for over 2\u00a0years. History reveals a tuboplasty approximately 1\u00a0year ago to correct a closed fallopian tube.

However, PMmenstrual dysphoric disorder typically does not involve the full range of symptoms seen in bipolar disorder. \n\nBipolar I disorder is characterized by at least one manic episode and may also include depressive episodes. A \"mixed\" episode is defined by the presence of both manic and depressive symptoms simultaneously. Given the patient's symptoms, it seems like there might be a mislabeling in the options provided, but if considering the context of the description, a mixed state could be inferred within a bipolar I disorder context, especially given the fluctuation of mood states.\n\nThe other options don't fit the symptoms as well:\n- Adjustment disorder with depressed mood would imply recent significant life stressors requiring adjustment.\n- Cyclothymic personality describes someone with chronic, mild mood swings that don't meet the criteria for major depression or mania.\n- Generalized anxiety disorder involves persistent worry about various aspects of life without a clear trigger.\n\nPlease note that this is based on the information provided, and a definitive diagnosis would require a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation."
