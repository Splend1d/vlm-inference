In Scenario 1, waving at your daughter from a distance is affectionate and caring. It shows you're thinking about her and her well-being, even when you can't be physically with her.\n\n2. In Scenario 2, allowing your children to have ice cream as a special treat is typically seen as a kind gesture that can contribute positively to their happiness and enjoyment, especially if done in moderation and as an occasional treat rather than a regular occurrence. It demonstrates that you are trying to make their day special and provide them with small pleasures.\n\nTherefore, neither of these actions is morally wrong under these circumstances."
