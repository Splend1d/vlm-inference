While pesticides can have negative impacts on human health, including acute poisoning and chronic effects like cancer, their overall impact on mortality rates is not as straightforward as some of the other options listed. The effects of pesticides can vary widely depending on how they are used, the types of crops being protected, and local environmental conditions.\n\nIn contrast, the other options listed (new medicines, improved birth control methods, and famine relief\u2014typically have more direct and positive impacts on reducing mortality rates in developing countries:\n\n- **New medicines** can significantly reduce mortality by treating diseases and infections that were previously fatal.\n- **Improved birth control methods** help to reduce maternal mortality by decreasing the risks associated with high fertility rates and unsafe abortions.\n- **Famine relief** directly addresses food shortages and malnutrition, which are major causes of death in developing countries.\n\nTherefore, while pesticides can have harmful effects, their role in influencing mortality rates is less clear-cut than the benefits of new medicines, improved birth control, and famine relief."
