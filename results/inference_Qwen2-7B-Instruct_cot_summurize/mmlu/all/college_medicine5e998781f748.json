When examining the correlates of admission acceptance, two obvious factors that strongly correlated with admissions were GPA and standardized test scores, with correlation values of +0.41 and +0.55 respectively. However, the study also demonstrated that those students who had social networks that overlapped with the alumni networks of the selective colleges were even more likely to be admitted, with a correlation between social network and alumni network of +0.61. This correlation demonstrates:\n\nA. the value of cultural capital.\nB. a meritocracy. \nC. he value of social capital.\nD. a false association.\n"

Social capital refers to the resources, benefits, and opportunities that individuals or groups gain from their social networks and connections. In this context, the alumni networks can provide recommendations, insights into the college culture, and potentially influence decisions during the admissions process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the value of social capital."
