So, we subtract the energy content of the feces (647 kJ) from the total energy intake (9279 kJ.\n\nSimilarly, the metabolizable energy intake refers to the energy that can be used after accounting for energy lost in both feces and urine. So, we subtract the combined energy content of feces and urine ( (647 kJ + 318 kJ) from the total energy intake. \n\nTherefore, the digestible energy intake would be 9279 - 647 = 8632 kJ, and the metabolizable energy intake would be 9279 - (647 + 318) = 9279 - 965 = 8314 kJ. However, these values do not match any of the provided options exactly, indicating that there might be some misunderstanding or rounding in the original question."
