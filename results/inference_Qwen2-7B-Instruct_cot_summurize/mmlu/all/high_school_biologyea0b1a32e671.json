According to this principle, in a large and randomly mating population that is not undergoing any evolutionary changes, the frequency of the dominant (AA genotype, the frequency of the recessive aa genotype, and the frequency of the heterozygous Aa genotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- The frequency of the dominant AA genotype (p^2\n- The frequency of the recessive aa genotype (q^2\n- The frequency of the heterozygous Aa genotype = 2pq\n\nGiven that 4% of the population is black (recessive ( (aa), q^2 = 0.04. To find q (the frequency of the recessive allele), take the square root of 0.04:\n\n\\[ q = \\sqrt{0.04} = 0.2 \\]\n\nSince p + q = 1 ( (because p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele), you can calculate p:\n\n\\[ p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \\]\n\nNow, to find the frequency of the heterozygous Aa genotype (2pq:\n\n\\[ 2pq = 2 * 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.32 \\]\n\nSo, the frequency of the heterozygous condition is 32 percent.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 32 percent."
