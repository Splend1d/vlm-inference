The CPA may be charged with preparing a fraudulent return\n\nThe CPA's failure to inquire about the existence of documentation for business travel expenses on the client's tax return could potentially result in a charge of preparing a fraudulent return, especially if the expenses claimed are later found to be unsupported or false during an audit. This is because the CPA has a professional responsibility to ensure that the information provided for the tax return is accurate and supported by appropriate documentation."
