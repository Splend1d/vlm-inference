It focuses on the individual's potential for self-actualization and believes in the inherent goodness and creativity of people. This approach contrasts with more deterministic views like those found in biological, evolutionary, or behaviorist theories, which often attribute personality traits to genetic predispositions, evolutionary history, or environmental conditioning."
