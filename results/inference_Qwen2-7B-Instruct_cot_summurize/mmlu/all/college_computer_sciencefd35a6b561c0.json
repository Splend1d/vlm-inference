However, this option isn't listed among your choices, so it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or answer choices provided. Based on the calculation and given options, the closest correct answer would be **C. 38%**, but this doesn't exactly match the precise calculation result. The precise calculation yields a closer match to **31%** rather than any of the provided options."
