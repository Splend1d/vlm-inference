                    "text": "To find the average force exerted by the floor on the ball, we can use the impulse-momentum theorem, which states that the impulse ( \\(J\\) imparted to an object equals the change in momentum of the object. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ J = \\Delta p = m_f - p_i \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( J \\) is the impulse,\n- \\( \\Delta p \\) is the change in momentum,\n- \\( p_i \\) is the initial momentum, and\n- \\( p_f \\) is the final momentum.\n\nThe impulse is also equal to the average force \\( F_{avg} \\) multiplied by the duration of the force \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ J = F_{avg} \\cdot t \\]\n\nWe can express the change in momentum as:\n\n\\[ \\Delta p = m_f - (-mv_i) \\]\n\nSince the ball bounces back to nearly its original height, the final velocity \\( v_f \\) will be approximately equal to the initial velocity \\( v_i \\), but in the opposite direction. Thus, the final momentum \\( p_f \\) is nearly zero, and the initial momentum \\( p_i \\) is \\( -mv_i \\). Therefore, the change in momentum simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\Delta p = mv_f - (-mv_i) = 2mv_i \\]\n\nThe velocity \\( v \\) can be found using the conservation of energy principle. The kinetic energy at the bottom of the fall is converted into potential energy at the highest point of the bounce. We can set these energies equal to each other to solve for the velocity \\( v \\) just before it hits the ground:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgh \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( m\\) is the mass of the ball,\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity ( \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\),\n- \\(h\\) is the height from which the ball is dropped, and\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity at the moment of impact.\n\nSolving for \\(v\\), we get:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( v \\) into the expression for \\( \\Delta p \\), we have:\n\n\\[ \\Delta p = 2m(\\sqrt{2gh}) \\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( \\Delta p \\) into our impulse equation and solving for \\( F_{avg} \\):\n\n\\[ J = F_{avg} \\cdot t \\]\n\\[ 2m(\\sqrt{2gh}) = F_{avg} \\cdot t \\]\n\nGiven values:\n- \\( m = 0.08 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- \\( g = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)\n- \\( h = 3.2 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( t = 0.04 \\, \\text{s} \\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ F_{avg} = \\frac{2m(\\sqrt{2gh})}{t} \\]\n\\[ F_{avg} = \\frac{2(0.08)(\\sqrt{2(9.8)(3.2)})}{0.04} \\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ F_{avg} = \\frac{2(0.08)(\\sqrt{62.72})}{0.04} \\]\n\\[ F_{avg} = \\frac{0.16 \\times 7.92}{0.04} \\]\n\\[ F_{avg} = \\frac{1.2276}{0.04} \\]\n\\[ F_{avg} = 30.68 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nThis value doesn't match any of the provided options directly because there seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the question or calculation process. However, based on the calculations, none of the options A, B, C, or D matches the result of 30.68 N. It might be worth double-checking the question and the calculations. The correct approach was followed, but the result does not align with the given choices, indicating either an error in the question's setup or a misprint in the options."
