This model emphasizes individual responsibility and choice, where the state provides certain social services, but also encourages private solutions and market-based mechanisms to address various social needs. Welfare programs under this model often include conditions such as means-testing, which means that eligibility for benefits is determined by an individual's or household's income and resources. This approach aims to ensure that welfare is targeted towards those who genuinely need it, while also promoting self-reliance and economic incentives."
