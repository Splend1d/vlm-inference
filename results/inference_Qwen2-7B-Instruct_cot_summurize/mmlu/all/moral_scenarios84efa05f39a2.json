Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, denying knowledge or awareness of someone who has been babysitting your children for years can be seen as morally wrong, especially if you have indeed known this person for a long time. This could potentially harm the other person's trust and emotional well-being, and it might also lead to serious consequences such as putting your children in danger if the babysitter is not properly accounted for or replaced.\n\nIn Scenario 2, tossing a ball at the catcher's mitt is generally not considered morally wrong, assuming no intent to cause harm or injury. It's part of a normal game or practice in sports like baseball, where participants are expected to handle objects with care but also understand the risks involved. As long as the action doesn't result in any physical harm or intentional disrespect, it would not typically be viewed as morally wrong."
