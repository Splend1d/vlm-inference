H. von Wright's account of normativity, argues against the idea that one can \"legislate for oneself.\" Anscombe challenges the notion that individuals have the capacity to create their own moral rules or laws for themselves, which is central to von Wright's view on how norms function.\n\nSpecifically, Anscombe criticizes Butler's views through this lens, emphasizing the following points:\n\nB. The notion of \u201clegislating for oneself\u201d is absurd. Anscombe argues that it is not possible for individuals to create their own moral laws independently of any external standards or principles. She contends that morality cannot be self-generated but must be grounded in some objective standard or principle that transcends individual choice or will.\n\nIt's important to note that while Anscombe critiques various aspects of Butler's ethical theory, the specific criticism regarding \"legislating for oneself\" alignss with her broader argument against the autonomy of the individual in generating moral norms. This does not directly address the other options provided ( A. Our consciences is fallible, C. We really can derive an \u201cought\u201d from an \u201cis,\u201d and D. The concept of \u201cpleasure\u201d is unclear. These options might relate to other philosophical positions or theories, rather than Anscombe's direct critique of Butler."
