The marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve for a monopoly.\n\nIn a monopoly, the single seller has significant control over the market and can set prices above marginal costs. However, unlike a competitive market where firms sell identical products at a price equal to marginal cost, a monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve because it is the sole supplier. As a result, when a monopolist lowers its price to sell more units, its marginal revenue (the additional revenue from selling one more unit) decreases at a faster rate than the price decrease. This is because as the monopolist lowers its price to attract more buyers, it must sell those buyers at a lower price than the original price, reducing the revenue gained from each additional unit sold. Hence, the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve for a monopoly.\n\nThis characteristic affects how a monopoly operates:\n\n- A. Monopolies may not be as common among public utilities because these sectors often have natural barriers to entry that allow for some degree of regulation and competition.\n- C. The marginal cost curve for a monopoly does not necessarily slope upward; rather, it typically rises as the firm produces more output due to increased production costs or diminishing returns.\n- D. Monopolies's ability to maintain market power is not explained by the price-lowering effect alone but also by factors like patents, economies of scale, and control over resources or technology that prevent new competitors from entering the market."
