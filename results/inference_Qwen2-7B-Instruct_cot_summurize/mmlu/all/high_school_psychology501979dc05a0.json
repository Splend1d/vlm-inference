An example of this would be recognizing a celebrity when you see them, even if you can't say how you know them or their name. This recognition happens subconsciously based on past experiences and exposure, without explicit recall. \n\nA. Describing the taste of the cake at your last birthday party involves explicit memory because you are consciously recalling and articulating a specific sensory experience.\nB. Remembering how to tie a tie involves procedural memory, which is a type of implicit memory that allows us to perform tasks automatically, such as tying a tie or riding a bike, without having to consciously think through each step.\nC. Recalling the name of your junior high school shop teacher involves explicit memory, as you are consciously retrieving and recalling specific information from your memory."
