This can help mitigate leniency bias (where evaluators tend to rate all employees as performing well, or central tendency bias where they might rate most employees as average), because the structure of the method forces them to differentiate between employees more clearly. However, it's important to note that this method can also introduce its own biases if evaluators disproportionately place employees at the high or low ends of the spectrum."
