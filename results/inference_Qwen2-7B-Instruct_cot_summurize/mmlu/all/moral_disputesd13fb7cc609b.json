It fails to tell us what the appropriate punishment would be for all cases of criminal action: Kant's categorical imperative suggests that one should act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law. However, this doesn't necessarily specify how to apply it to specific cases or determine what constitutes just punishment for various crimes.\n\nB. It does not provide an adequate measure of moral desert: The principle of equality assumes that every individual has equal rights and duties, which might not always align with the varying degrees of culpability or moral responsibility of individuals involved in criminal actions. This can lead to situations where the punishment does not reflect the severity of the crime or the offender's level of guilt.\n\nC. It requires that we punish criminals in ways that are morally unacceptable: The \"eye for an eye\" concept can lead to a vicious cycle of retaliation and retribution, potentially escalating violence rather than promoting justice or rehabilitation. It may also overlook the importance of forgiveness, restorative justice, and the possibility of redemption.\n\nTherefore, Nathanson argues that these issues collectively represent significant problems with applying Kant's principle of equality and \"an eye for an eye\" in the context of criminal justice and moral desert."
