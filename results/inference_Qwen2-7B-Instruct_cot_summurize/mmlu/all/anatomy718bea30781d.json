The oculomotor nerve is responsible for controlling the movements of several muscles in the eye, including the medial rectus muscle which helps control the inward movement of the eye. Damage to this nerve can result in the eye not being able to move properly, leading to squinting or strabismus. \n\n- B. Trochlear nerve controls the inferior oblique muscle which helps in downward and outward movement of the eye. Its damage may cause upward deviation of the eye.\n- C. Ophthalmic trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensory innervation of the anterior part of the eyeball. It does not directly control eye movements.\n- D. Abducens nerve (CN VI) controls the lateral rectus muscle which helps in outward movement of the eye. Its damage would typically lead to an inability to move the eye outward, rather than causing a squint."
