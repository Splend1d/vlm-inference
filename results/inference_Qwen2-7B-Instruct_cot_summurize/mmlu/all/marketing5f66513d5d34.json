Corporate Brands**.\n\nCorporate branding is when an organization uses its own name across multiple products or services within the same company. This approach helps in building a strong brand identity and reputation, as consumers can associate the quality and values of one product with others from the same brand. Examples provided like Microsoft, Heinz, and Kellogg's all follow this strategy where the overarching company name is used for all its products."
