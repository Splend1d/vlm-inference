So,\n\\[ W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\]\n\n- For the second spring, it takes twice as much work (\\(2W_1\\)) to stretch it by half the distance (\\(\\frac{x}{2}\\)). So,\n\\[ 2W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}k\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ 2W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}k\\left(\\frac{x^2}{4}\\right) \\]\n\\[ 2W_1 = \\frac{1}{8}kx^2 \\]\n\nSince \\(W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\), we can substitute this into the equation for the second spring:\n\\[ 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{8}kx^2 \\]\n\\[ kx^2 = \\frac{1}{8}kx^2 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 1 = \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\nThis equation doesn't make sense as written because it implies that \\(k\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) times itself, which isn't correct based on our understanding. Let's correct the approach:\n\nThe key is to understand how the work changes with respect to the spring constant and displacement. Given that it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half the distance compared to the first spring, we can write the relationship between the work done on both springs as:\n\n\\[ 2W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}k'\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nWhere \\(W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\), so:\n\n\\[ 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}k'\\left(\\frac{x^2}{4}\\right) \\]\n\nSimplifying,\n\n\\[ kx^2 = \\frac{1}{8}k'x^2 \\]\n\nGiven \\(x^2\\) is common on both sides, we can divide both sides by \\(x^2\\) ( (assuming \\(x \\neq 0\\) ) to get:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{1}{8}k' \\]\n\nSolving for \\(k'\\),\n\n\\[ k' = 8k \\]\n\nTherefore, the force constant of the second spring is **D. 8k**."
