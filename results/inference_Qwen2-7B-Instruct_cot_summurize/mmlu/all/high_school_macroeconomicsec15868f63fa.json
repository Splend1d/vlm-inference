In other words, it's about ensuring that goods and services are produced in quantities that match what society wants, and that these goods and services are distributed among people in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction or utility. \n\nOption A is incorrect because allocative efficiency does not prevent the production of inferior products; it depends on consumer preferences and demand for these products.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it describes distributive efficiency, which is about how the output is distributed, not how it's produced.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while hard work can lead to success in an economically efficient system, it doesn't necessarily mean that those who work hardest will always receive more due to factors like market conditions, competition, and equity considerations."
