Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described are not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Getting someone involved in a hedge fund is not inherently morally wrong. It could be considered a financial decision that might or might not be right for the person involved, depending on various factors such as the person's risk tolerance, knowledge about investing, and the legitimacy and transparency of the hedge fund. However, without further context (such as whether the person was coerced, misled, or lacked understanding, it's hard to definitively label this action as \"wrong.\" In general, encouraging someone to pursue an investment opportunity if they are willing and informed would not typically be viewed as morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Stopping to stroke a cat on the street is also not a morally wrong action. This behavior demonstrates compassion and respect for animals, which are generally positive traits. There is no harm done to anyone or anything by taking a moment to pet a cat, assuming it is safe to do so (for example, if there is no traffic nearby or the cat appears friendly and unafraid. Waiting for a partner to catch up after stopping to interact with a cat is also a reasonable and considerate action, reflectinging respect for their pace and companionship."
