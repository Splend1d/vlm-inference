Russia: Russia also had considerably fewer CO2 emissions than China in 2017.\n- C. Iran: Iran had fewer CO2 emissions compared to both Canada and Russia in 2017.\n- D. Japan: Japan's CO2 emissions in 2017 were substantially lower than those of China, ranking it much further down on the list.\n\nTherefore, based on the given options, none of them (A, B, C, or D, represents the country with the highest CO2 emissions in 2017.
