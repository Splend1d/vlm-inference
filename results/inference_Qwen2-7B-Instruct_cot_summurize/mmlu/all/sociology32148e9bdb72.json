This can lead to issues of trust and can potentially alter the behavior of the subjects being studied, as they might act differently when aware that they are being observed. It's important to consider the ethical implications and obtain informed consent when possible, or ensure that deception is justified by the research objectives and that appropriate measures are taken to minimize harm."
