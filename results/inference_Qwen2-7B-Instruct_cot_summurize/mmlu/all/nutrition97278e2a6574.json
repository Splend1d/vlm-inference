All of the options given are correct\n\nObesity increases the risk of developing several health issues, including:\n\nA. **Type 2 diabetes** - Obesity is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. The excess fat, especially around the abdomen, can lead to insulin resistance and high blood sugar levels.\n\nB. **Cancer** - There is an increased risk of certain cancers in obese individuals, such as breast, colon, endometrial, kidney, and liver cancer. This is partly due to the hormonal changes associated with obesity that can promote cancer growth.\n\nC. **Cardiovascular disease** - Obesity is strongly linked to cardiovascular diseases ( like heart disease and stroke. It can lead to conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and narrowed arteries, which increase the risk of these diseases.\n\nTherefore, all the options provided are indeed correct."
