This is because the height of the mercury column in a barometer is determined by the atmospheric pressure acting on it, not by the cross-sectional area of the tube. According to Torricelli's law, the height (h) of the mercury column is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{P}{\\rho g} \\]\n\nwhere \\( P \\) is the atmospheric pressure, \\( \\rho \\) is the density of mercury, and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity. Since both barometers are subjected to the same atmospheric pressure, their mercury columns will reach the same height, regardless of the cross-sectional area of the tubes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. the same."
