This is because the properties of light (speed and wavelength) are dependent on the medium through which the light is traveling. In one medium, light travels at a different speed than in another medium, and this affects its wavelength due to the wave nature of light. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both speed and wavelength"
