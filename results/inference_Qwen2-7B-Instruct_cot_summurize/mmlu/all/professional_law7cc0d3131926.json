After the second game of the season, the plaintiff was suddenly dismissed as the coach for undisclosed reasons. After the dismissal was made public, the local newspaper ran an article discussing the plaintiff's tenure as coach. The article, which was written by the sports editor, stated that \"The plaintiff was a bad role model and morally unfit for the coaching job. \"The plaintiff brought suit against the newspaper for defamation. At trial, the plaintiff called a player on the basketball team to testify that \"the plaintiff was a good role model and respected by the players. \" In presenting its evidence, the newspaper called a witness to testify. He proposes to testify that he saw the plaintiff give beer to players on three occasions after victories. Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, witness's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, for impeachment purposes only.\nB. admissible, as substantive evidence.\nC. inadmissible, because specific instances of conduct is an improper method of proving character.\nD. inadmissible to prove character, but admissible for the purpose of showing intent or common scheme.\n"

The reason is that character evidence can often lead to unfair bias and does not necessarily correlate with the truthfulness of a statement. \n\nIn this case, the newspaper would want to introduce evidence of the plaintiff giving beer to players to show that the plaintiff was not a good role model and was morally unfit for the coaching job, as stated in the article. However, introducing specific instances of conduct as evidence of character is typically inadmissible under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which prohibits the use of specific instances of conduct to prove a person acted in accordance with the character (or lacked character traits such as honesty or truthfulness.\n\nInstead, if the newspaper wishes to introduce evidence regarding the plaintiff's actions to support their claim about his character, they may need to find another way to do so that does not involve introducing specific instances of conduct. They could argue that the statement made in the article was based on the general reputation of the plaintiff within the community or the perceptions of others who were aware of the situation, rather than on specific incidents."
