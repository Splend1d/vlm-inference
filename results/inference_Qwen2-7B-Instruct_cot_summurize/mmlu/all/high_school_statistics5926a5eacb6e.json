                    "text": "To find the probability that a patient with a specific set of symptoms will be diagnosed with at least one of these two conditions (Condition A or Condition B, we can use the principle of complementary probability. This means instead of directly calculating the probability for at least one condition, we calculate the probability for none of them and subtract from 1.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(P(A)\\) as the probability of being diagnosed with Condition A,\n- \\(P(B|A)\\) as the probability of being diagnosed with Condition B given that they have been diagnosed with Condition A,\n- \\(P(B|\\overline{A})\\) as the probability of being diagnosed with Condition B given that they have not been diagnosed with Condition A ( (where \\(\\overline{A}\\) represents \"not A\").\n\nWe are given:\n- \\(P(A) = 0.15\\),\n- \\(P(B|A) = 0.70\\),\n- \\(P(B|\\overline{A}) = 0.10\\).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of not being diagnosed with Condition A, which is \\(P(\\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of being diagnosed with Condition B given not being diagnosed with Condition A:\n\\[P(B|\\overline{A}) = 0.10.\\]\n\nThe probability of being diagnosed with at least one of the conditions is then calculated by considering both scenarios: being diagnosed with Condition A or being diagnosed with Condition B but not with Condition A. The latter scenario can be further broken down into two parts:\n1. Being diagnosed with Condition B and having already been diagnosed with Condition A (\\(P(A) \\times P(B|A)\\)).\n2. Being diagnosed with Condition B and not being diagnosed with Condition A (\\(P(\\overline{A}) \\times P(B|\\overline{A})\\)).\n\nThus, the total probability of being diagnosed with at least one of the conditions is:\n\\[P(\\text{At least one condition}) = P(A) + P(\\overline{A}) \\times P(B|\\overline{A}) - P(A) \\times P(B|A).\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[P(\\text{At Least one condition}) = 0.15 + 0.85 \\times 0.10 - 0.15 \\times 0.70 = 0.15 + 0.085 - 0.105 = 0.13 + 0.085 = 0.215.\\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to have taken a different path than intended based on the provided options and typical approach for such problems. The correct approach should consider the probability of not being diagnosed with either condition and subtract from 1, directly addressing the question asked without an intermediate step that led to a different result. Let's correct this:\n\nThe correct approach should directly address the probability of being diagnosed with at least one of the conditions, considering the probabilities of being diagnosed with each condition and their intersections. However, based on the structure of the problem, it's clear there was a misunderstanding in the calculation process leading to a discrepancy with the provided options.\n\nGiven the structure of the question and the provided answer choices, the correct method involves understanding that the probability of being diagnosed with at least one of the conditions can also be calculated by subtracting the probability of not being diagnosed with either condition from 1. \n\nGiven:\n- \\(P(A) = 0.15\\)\n- \\(P(B|A) = 0.70\\)\n- \\(P(B|\\overline{A) = 0.10\\)\n\nThe probability of not being diagnosed with Condition A is \\(0.85\\), and the probability of not being diagnosed with Condition B given not being diagnosed with Condition A is \\(0.90\\) ( (since \\(1 - 0.10 = 0.90\\)).\n\nTo find the probability of not being diagnosed with either condition, we need to consider both paths of not being diagnosed with Condition A and being diagnosed with Condition B but not being diagnosed with Condition A, and not being diagnosed with Condition A and not being diagnosed with Condition B:\n\\[P(\\text{Not A and Not B}) = P(\\overline{A) \\times P(\\\\overline{B|\\overline{A}) = 0.85 \\times 0.90 = 0.765.\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of being diagnosed with at least one of the conditions is:\n\\[P(\\text{At Least One}) = 1 - P(\\text{Not A and Not B}) = 1'text{At Least One}) = 1'text{Not A and Not B}) = 1"
