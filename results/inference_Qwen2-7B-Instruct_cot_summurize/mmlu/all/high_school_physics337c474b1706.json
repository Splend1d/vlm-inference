                    "text": "The correct answer is B. 2h.\n\nThe reason for this is that the distance an object falls under constant acceleration (like due to gravity, without air resistance, follows the formula \\(d = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\), where \\(d\\) is the distance, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\(t\\) is the time in seconds.\n\nIf an object falls a distance \\(h\\) during the first second, then for the next second, it would fall another \\(h\\) because the distance fallen each second increases by a factor related to the square of the time interval (due to the quadratic nature of the equation. Specifically, the distance fallen in the first two seconds can be calculated as:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2}g(1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}g(2^2) = \\frac{1}{2}g(1 + 4) = \\frac{5}{2}g\\]\n\nThis total distance for the first two seconds is not directly relevant to the question, but what matters is understanding that the distance covered in the second second is essentially the difference between the distances covered in the first and third seconds, which would again be \\(h\\) if you were to calculate it out based on the quadratic relationship. \n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 2h, considering the specific phrasing and options provided, though the explanation involves a deeper dive into the physics behind free-fall motion."
