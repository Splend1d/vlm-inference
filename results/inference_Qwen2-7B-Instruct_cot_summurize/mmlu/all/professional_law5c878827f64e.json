The plaintiff then calls a witness who was a passenger in the plaintiff's car but who also happens to be the defendant's former employer. On direct examination, the witness testifies to how the accident occurred and also expresses his opinion that the defendant is not a truthful person. Which one of the following areas of questioning is most likely to be held beyond the proper scope of cross-examination?\n\nA. In letters to prospective employers, the witness has described the defendant as very honest and dependable.\nB. The defendant recently filed an action against the witness for breach of contract.\nC. The plaintiff's injuries were not as serious as the plaintiff is claiming.\nD. The witness has been falsifying his income tax returns.\n"

The witness have been falsifying his income tax returns.\n\nThis is because the truthfulness or honesty of the witness is relevant to their credibility as a witness, which can be explored through cross-examination. However, allegations about the witness's own criminal conduct, such as falsifying income tax returns, typically go beyond the scope of what is appropriate for cross-examination as it may lead to irrelevant and potentially prejudicial information. It's important to note that the relevance and admissibility of evidence can vary based on the specific rules of evidence in the jurisdiction where the trial is taking place."
