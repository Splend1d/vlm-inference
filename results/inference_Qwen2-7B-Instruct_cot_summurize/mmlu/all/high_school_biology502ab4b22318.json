RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication.\n\nRNA viruses typically have lower rates of proofreading during replication compared to DNA viruses or cells. Proofreading refers to the ability of an enzyme to correct errors that occur during replication. DNA polymerases, which are involved in DNA replication, often have proofreading abilities that help maintain genetic stability. In contrast, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (which are involved in RNA replication, lack this proofreading capability, making RNA viruses more prone to mutations. This higher mutation rate can also contribute to the rapid evolution and adaptation of RNA viruses."
