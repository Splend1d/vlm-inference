While it might be considered intense or disturbing to some students, showing images of chains and shackles and having students read a slave song is not necessarily morally wrong. It can be seen as an educational approach that aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of a historical event. However, if the teacher's actions led to emotional distress or trauma for any student, then it could be considered inappropriate.\n\nScenario 2 involves deliberately destroying property, specifically test papers, which is a clear violation of respect for others' belongings and the rules set by the institution. This action is morally wrong because it involves disrespect, dishonesty, and potentially causing harm to another person or their property without justification."
