Fermentation\n\nDuring fermentation, glucose is broken down into various end products depending on the type of fermentation (alcoholic, lactic acid, etc. The exact byproducts can vary, but in general, fermentation processes often result in the production of substances like ethanol, lactic acid, or carbon dioxide, along with ATP (which can be represented as ADP in the context of energy transfer within the cell), and water. However, it's important to note that the direct mention of \"NADP+\" in this context might refer to a specific type of fermentation that involves NADP+ in the reduction process, such as in the case of photosynthesis where NADP+ is reduced to NADPH, which is used in the synthesis of organic compounds. In typical fermentation processes, the focus is usually on the breakdown of glucose for ATP production rather than on NADP+."
