It involves face-to-face meetings between state leaders, which is option B. This type of diplomacy allows for more direct communication and potentially quicker decision-making, but it can also lead to misunderstandings or escalate tensions if not handled carefully. Examples include summit meetings between heads of state or government officials discussing bilateral agreements."
