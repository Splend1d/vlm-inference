The contract stipulated that \"any party who wishes to assign this contract must have the written consent of the other party. \" On March 1, the seller placed the widgets on board a cargo vessel that was destined to transport the widgets to the buyer. On March 2, the buyer received the following telegram from the seller:\"Please be advised that the widgets are in transit. In addition, I hereby assign all my rights under our contract to our creditor. \"The buyer did not consent to the assignment. The next day, the ship carrying the widgets sank in a violent storm, destroying its entire cargo.

Since the buyer did not consent to the assignment, the creditor cannot enforce their rights under the contract against the buyer. Additionally, since the buyer never received the widgets, they are not liable for the debt under the contract. Therefore, the creditor is unlikely to recover anything from the buyer in this situation."
