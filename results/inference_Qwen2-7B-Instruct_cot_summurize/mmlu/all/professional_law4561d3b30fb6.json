The building had a commercial space on the first floor, with two apartments above it; one on the second, and another on the third floor. Several years ago, a teacher, in a signed writing, entered a three-year lease agreement with the professor. The teacher agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the professor's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the teacher has continued to pay his rent, and the professor continued to accept it. The professor rented the first floor to a restaurateur, who opened a sushi restaurant there. Within months, there was a citywide hookworm epidemic that was traced to the consumption of raw fish. The city council, in an attempt to protect the public from the parasites, passed an ordinance prohibiting all sushi restaurants from operating in the city. The restaurateur was forced out of business. She locked the doors and left a sign in the window: \"Closed until further notice. \"Within weeks, rats were attracted to the odor from the fish that was left in the restaurant, and the building became infested with them. The teacher could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the professor that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. The teacher's best defense is that the professor, by permitting the restaurateur to store the fish in the closed restaurant, caused a\n\nA. partial constructive eviction.\nB. partial actual eviction.\nC. constructive eviction.\nD. breach of implied covenant of habitability.\n"

                    "text": "The teacher's best defense would likely be option C: constructive eviction.\n\nConstructive eviction occurs when a landlord fails to maintain the property or makes it uninhabitable, forcing the tenant to vacate the premises without formally terminating the lease. In this scenario, the professor allowed the sushi restaurant to operate despite knowing about the potential health risks (the hookworm epidemic) and the resulting closure of the restaurant led to a rat infestation in the building. This situation could be seen as creating an environment so unsuitable that the tenant feels compelled to leave.\n\nOptions A and B, partial constructive and partial actual eviction, do not fit the scenario as clearly as constructive eviction does. Partial constructive eviction refers to a situation where only part of the property becomes uninhabitable, while partial actual eviction involves a landlord's direct action to remove a tenant from a portion of the leased premises. In this case, the entire building is affected, and the tenant feels compelled to move due to the professor's actions, which can support a claim of constructive eviction.\n\nOption D, breach of the implied covenant of habitability, also applies here. The covenant of habitability requires landlords to provide a dwelling that is safe, sanitary, and livable. By allowing the sushi restaurant to operate and then not addressing the issues caused by its closure, the professor breached this covenant. However, constructive eviction is a more direct legal theory that encompasses this breach, making it the primary defense for the teacher."
