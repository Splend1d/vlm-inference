The homeowner asks the contractor if they would be willing to build the house for $95,000.\n\nThis question relates to the concept of counteroffers in contract law. When a counteroffer is made, it terminates the original offer and creates a new proposal. In option A, the homeowner's request for a lower price does not terminate the contractor's original offer; instead, it constitutes a counteroffer. \n\nOption B, where the contractor withdraws the offer, does terminate the offer, making any further acceptance ineffective.\n\nOption C involves the death of the contractor, which may or may not terminate the offer depending on jurisdiction and the existence of an estate or successor-in-interest clause within the contractor's business structure. However, this is a complex legal scenario and not a simple termination of the offer.\n\nOption D, where the homeowner accepts the offer but proposes a different price, is also a counteroffer and would terminate the original offer."
