Marathons are long-distance races that require sustained effort over a period of several hours. Stamina allows runners to maintain their pace and continue running throughout the entire race without collapsing due to fatigue. While strength, power, and stride length can be important for other aspects of running, they are not as critical for success in a marathon as having the ability to sustain a moderate pace over a long distance."
