This helps stakeholders understand how cash has been generated and used by the government entity for its various activities. \n\nFor other types of financial statements:\n- A. Governmental fund financial statements focus on individual funds and do not require a comprehensive statement of cash flows.\n- C. Proprietary fund financial statements are also more focused on specific funds operations and may not require a detailed statement of cash flows as part of their standard presentation.\n- D. Fiduciary fund financial statements are used for funds held in trust and managed by the government but for someone else, and they may or may not include a statement of cash flows depending on the specific requirements or preferences."
