He acknowledges the importance of other values in a society, particularly those that aim for fairness and justice. Here's how his views align with the options provided:\n\nA. Egalitarian values concerning the elimination of inequalities that make people vulnerable to oppression: Wellman would likely support this value. He argues for a balance between individual liberty and social responsibilities, which implies a concern for equality and justice in society. His work often critiques the libertarian emphasis on absolute individualism and advocates for a more nuanced understanding of rights and responsibilities.\n\nB. Libertarian values concerning individuals' property rights and freedom of movement: While Wellman does recognize the importance of these values, he also critiques their potential negative impacts when taken to an extreme. He emphasizes the need for a society that balances individual freedoms with collective responsibilities, suggesting that total libertarianism might not be ideal for achieving a harmonious community.\n\nC. Both A and B: Given Wellman's critique of pure libertarianism and his advocacy for a society that incorporates both personal liberties and social responsibilities, it is reasonable to say that he would likely endorse both A and B. His work seeks to find a middle ground that respects individual rights while also promoting social cohesion and justice.\n\nD. Nothing; there are no values besides freedom of association: This statement contradicts Wellman's views. As mentioned, he does acknowledge and advocate for various values in addition to freedom of association, including those related to equality, justice, and social responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Wellman's acceptance of values goes beyond freedom of association, supporting both egalitarian and libertarian values within the context of a balanced society that prioritizes both individual rights and collective responsibilities."
