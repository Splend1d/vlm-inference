There are continuous nightly activities by the club, including loud music, unruly customers, throwing cans and bottles,urinating in public, shouting profanities, fist-fighting, and acts of vandalism. The neighbors are requesting an injunction to stop these activities and for remedial measures. The club defends that it cannot control its customers after they leave the premises, and it reminds the court that it has zoning approval. Its approval, however, is based on a grandfather clause that allows it as a non-conforming use \u0080\u0093 otherwise, the area surrounding the club is strictly residential. Will the court likely issue an injunction to attempt to alleviate the neighbor's problems?\n\nA. No, the right of free speech granted to a strip club outweighs the minor and temporary inconvenience of the neighbors.\nB. Yes, the interference is substantial, unreasonable and continuous \u0080\u0093 an injunction will be fashioned to control the nuisance.\nC. No, because there is no remedy for interference with use and enjoyment of land other than a tort action for trespass or to abate an abnormally dangerous condition.\nD. Yes, the activities of the club constitute an attractive nuisance that interferes with the public at large and must be abated.\n"

Yes, the interference is substantial, unreasonable and continuous \u0096 an injunction will be fashioned to control the nuisance.\n\nIn this situation, the court would likely consider several factors before deciding whether to grant an injunction. These factors include:\n\n1. **Nature of the Nuisance**: The activities described ( loud music, unruly customers, public urination, shouting profanities, fist-fighting, and acts of vandalism - are severe and continuous, which could be considered a substantial and unreasonable nuisance.\n\n2. **Zoning Approval**: While the club has a zoning approval, it was granted under a grandfather clause for a non-conforming use. This does not necessarily absolve the club from compliance with reasonable noise and behavior regulations that apply to all properties within the jurisdiction.\n\n3. **Impact on Neighbors**: The impact on the neighbors' quality of life and their rights to peaceful enjoyment of their property is significant and ongoing. This is a key consideration for courts when evaluating nuisances.\n\n4. **Proportionality of Relief**: An injunction tailored to address the specific nuisances while allowing the club to operate might be deemed appropriate. This could involve conditions such as time restrictions on loud music, security measures to manage crowd behavior, and cleanup requirements for any vandalism or littering.\n\n5. **Alternative Remedies**: Before considering an injunction, the court may also weigh if there are are alternative remedies available, such as monetary damages or other legal actions, but given the continuous nature of the problem and its impact on the neighborhood, an injunction seems more directly targeted to stopping the ongoing disturbance.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is reasonable to assume that the court would likely lean towards issuing an injunction to control the nuisance, especially considering the severe and continuous nature of the disturbances and their impact on the neighbors' quality of life."
