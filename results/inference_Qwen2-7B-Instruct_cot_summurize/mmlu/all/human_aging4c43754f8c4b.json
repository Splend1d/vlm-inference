Psychological - have all received significant support in research for their roles in how social support relates to better health. These areas often explore how relationships, behaviors, and mental health impact physical well-being.\n\nGerontology, which focuses on the study of aging, might not receive as much direct support in explaining the link between social support and health outcomes specifically due to its broader scope and emphasis on the aging process itself rather than the mechanisms linking social support to health. However, it's important to note that gerontological research does contribute to understanding the complex interplay between aging, social relationships, and health."
