The buyer later stopped the seller from continuing to use the strip for travel because no road had been constructed. The landowner sued the buyer, claiming that he still owned the forty-foot strip of land because it was not conveyed in the deed and was at best ambiguously stated. Will the court consider the outside evidence that the parties intended this to be a right-of-way over the buyer's land?\n\nA. No, the court will confine itself to what is in the four corners of the deed.\nB. No, because that would violate the parole evidence rule.\nC. Yes, because the court always has a right to reform the wording of a deed according to the court's interpretation of what it means.\nD. Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\n"

Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\n\nIn property law, courts often consider extrinsic evidence ( such as the parties' conversations, correspondence, and conduct to clarify ambiguous terms in a deed or other legal document. This is done to determine the true intent of the parties at the time of the transaction. In your scenario, since the deed contains an ambiguous term regarding the 40-foot strip of land, the court may consider the side agreement between the parties to better understand their intentions and resolve the ambiguity."
