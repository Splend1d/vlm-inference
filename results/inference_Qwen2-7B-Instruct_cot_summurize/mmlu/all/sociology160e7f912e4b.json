                    "text": "Smith & Tomlinson's argument, as presented in the options you've given, likely pertains to their stance on the factors influencing educational achievement, particularly within the context of ethnic minorities and gender disparities. While I can't provide a definitive answer without direct access to Smith & Tomlinson's specific work or research, I can offer an educated interpretation based on common educational theory and research.\n\nGiven the context, it seems likely that Smith & Tomlinson might have emphasized one of these points, possibly advocating for a nuanced view considering multiple factors. Here's a breakdown of each option:\n\nA. Differences in ethnic background being more significant than class or gender in predicting educational achievement - This statement leans towards the idea that ethnicity is a dominant factor in educational outcomes, overshadowing the influence of class and gender.\n\nB. Racism in schools undermines the move towards equality of opportunity for children from ethnic minorities - This option suggests that racial biases within educational systems hinder equal opportunities for students from ethnic minorities, highlighting systemic issues rather than individual characteristics.\n\nC. School character far outweighed ethnic background in determining educational success - This statement implies that the environment and culture of the school play a more critical role in student success than their ethnic background, suggesting that inclusive practices and positive school climates can mitigate the effects of ethnicity on educational outcomes.\n\nD. Gender differences in educational achievement could be attributed to inequalities of class - This option argues that gender disparities in education are are more likely due to class-based inequalities, implying that socioeconomic status plays a crucial role in explaining why girls and boys may perform differently academically.\n\nWithout detailed knowledge of Smith & Tomlinson's specific arguments, it's challenging to pinpoint which one they most strongly supported. However, if we were to choose based on the general consensus in educational research today, option C might resonate with contemporary views that advocate for the importance of creating equitable learning environments, which can positively impact students from diverse backgrounds regardless of their ethnicities. Option B also remains relevant in discussions about equity and inclusion in education, emphasizing the need to address systemic racism."
