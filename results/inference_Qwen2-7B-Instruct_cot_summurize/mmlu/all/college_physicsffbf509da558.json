In a p-type semiconductor, the Hall coefficient is positive due to the majority carriers being holes. In an n-type semiconductor, it is negative because the majority carriers are electrons. Thus, by measuring the Hall coefficient, one can deduce whether the semiconductor is doped with acceptor impurities (producing holes as majority carriers) or donor impurities (producing electrons as majority carriers)."
