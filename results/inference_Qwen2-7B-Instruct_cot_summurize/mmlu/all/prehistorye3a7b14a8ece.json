                    "text": "The spear-thrower, also known as a\u6295\u77f3\u5668 or atlatl, represents a significant innovation in prehistoric weaponry. This tool was used by early humans and allowed them to throw spears with much greater force and accuracy than could be achieved by hand alone. The atlatl consisted of a long, slender rod that was held in one hand while the spear was gripped in the other hand and positioned behind the atlatl. When the spear was released, it would accelerate down the length of the atlatl, gaining speed and kinetic energy, before being thrown forward. This resulted in a much more powerful throw, allowing for longer distances and greater penetration.\n\nThe use of the atlatl dates back to the Upper Paleolithic period, which began around 40,000 years ago, and continued through the later part of the Stone Age. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. It launched projectiles with greater force and accuracy beginning in the Upper Paleolithic and Late Stone Age.\n\nThis innovation greatly enhanced hunting capabilities, making it easier to hunt larger game and from greater distances. It also likely contributed to the development of more sophisticated social structures and territorial dynamics among early human societies."
