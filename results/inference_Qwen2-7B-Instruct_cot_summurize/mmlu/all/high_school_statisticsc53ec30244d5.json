For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.\n\nExplanation:\nThe equation given is Selling price = 15.9 \u2013 0.983 * age. This indicates that for every unit increase in age ( (which is one year in this context), the selling price decreases by the coefficient of age, which is 0.983. However, since the selling price is measured in $1,000 units, to find the actual decrease per year, you multiply 0.983 by 1,000, resulting in a decrease of approximately $983 per year. But, looking at the options provided, the closest correct statement is C, which correctly identifies that for each additional year, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590. This is because if you directly consider the constant term (15.9 in the equation, it represents the selling price when the age is 0 ( (i.e., for a new car), and the decrease per year is calculated as the absolute value of the coefficient of age, multiplied by 1,000 to adjust for the scale of the selling price, which is $983. However, considering the direct interpretation of the constant term and its relationship with the aging effect, option C provides the most accurate reflection of the relationship described by the equation, albeit not exactly matching the precise calculation method explained. The most precise answer would be that for each additional year, the selling price decreases by $983, but among the provided choices, C comes closest to accurately describing the relationship without being strictly mathematically correct in terms of how the decrease was derived from the equation."
