He believed that lying is inherently wrong and morally impermissible. Augustine's perspective on truth and honesty was deeply rooted in his Christian faith, which emphasized the importance of integrity and the moral duty to speak the truth. He saw lying as a violation of trust and a distortion of reality, both of which are are considered crucial for maintaining social order and spiritual well-being."
