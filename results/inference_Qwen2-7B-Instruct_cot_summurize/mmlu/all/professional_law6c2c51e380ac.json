Shortly thereafter, the woman's financial condition worsened significantly, but she failed to disclose this fact to the bank. Unaware of the woman's changed financial condition, the bank then agreed to lend money to the woman. The bank later learned of the woman's true financial condition. The bank refused to honor its promise to lend money to the woman, contending that the parties' contract was voidable at the bank's option because of the woman's misrepresentation. If the woman sues the bank for breach of contract, will the bank's misrepresentation defense likely succeed?\n\nA. No, because the woman did not make any subsequent affirmative misrepresentations about her financial condition.\nB. No, because the woman's representations were accurate at the time she submitted the loan application to the bank.\nC. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition in order to prevent them from being fraudulent.\nD. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to tell the bank about her changed financial condition due to the longstanding relationship of trust and confidence between them.\n"

No, because the woman's representations were accurate at the time she submitted the loan application to the bank.\n\nThe key point here is that the woman's representations were truthful when she initially submitted her financial statement. There was no misrepresentation made by her at the time of submitting the loan application. The bank's misrepresentation defense would not likely succeed based on the information provided, as there was no false or misleading information given by the woman. The bank's reliance on her initial statement and subsequent refusal to honor the loan agreement after discovering her financial condition worsened might be seen as a breach of contract rather than a successful defense based on her alleged misrepresentation."
