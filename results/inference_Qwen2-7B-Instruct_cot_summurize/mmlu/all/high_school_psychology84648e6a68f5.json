In this case, the combination of cognitive-behavioral techniques (aimed at modifying thoughts and behaviors ( and psychodynamic therapy, which explores the patient's unconscious motivations and past experiences, along with the biological intervention of intravenous feeding, fits well within the eclectic framework.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. eclectic."
