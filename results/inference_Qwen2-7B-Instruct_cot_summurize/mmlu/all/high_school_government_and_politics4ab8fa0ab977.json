It grants Congress the power to make all laws which are shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.\n\nAmong the options provided, option C best illustrates a use of the elastic clause:\n\nC. Congress passes legislation establishing a national speed limit.\n\nThis action involves Congress exercising its implied powers under the elastic clause to create laws that are deemed necessary for the functioning of the federal government. The establishment of a national speed limit falls under the broader authority to regulate interstate commerce and public safety, which Congress may interpret as necessary for the \"general welfare\" of the country."
