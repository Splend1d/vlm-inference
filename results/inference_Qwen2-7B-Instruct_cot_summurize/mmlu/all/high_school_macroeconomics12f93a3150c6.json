This directly offsets the demand for loans by the government, allowing more funds to flow into private sector investments, thus mitigating the crowding-out effect.\n\nHowever, this policy could exacerbate a potential macroeconomic problem known as an inflationary gap. An inflationary gap occurs when the actual level of economic activity exceeds its potential output, leading to higher prices rather than just higher output. By purchasing government securities, the central bank increases the money supply, potentially fueling demand-pull inflation. If the economy is already near full capacity or if there are strong upward pressures on prices due to other factors such as supply chain disruptions or high energy costs, this policy could push the economy further into an inflationary gap, causing prices to rise rapidly and eroding the purchasing power of consumers."
