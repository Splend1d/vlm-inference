This equation is particularly useful in thermodynamics because it accounts for the work done against external pressure, which is not considered in the calculation of \\(\\Delta U\\).\n\nThis equation applies:\n\n- **Not always** (because it depends on the conditions of the process. The applicability varies based on whether the system undergoes a constant pressure, constant volume, or other types of processes.\n  \n- **For constant pressure processes**, where the work done by or against the surroundings is \\(W = P\\Delta V\\), making this equation directly applicable.\n\n- **For constant temperature processes**, the equation still holds because the change in enthalpy (\\(\\Delta H\\)) is directly related to the heat added to or removed from the system at constant temperature, while \\(\\Delta U\\) represents the change in internal energy, and \\(P\\Delta V\\) accounts for the work done against external pressure.\n\n- **For constant volume processes**, the work done (\\(W = 0\\)) since there is no volume change, simplifying the equation to \\(\\Delta H = \\Delta U\\), but the general form still applies as a theoretical basis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **not clearly represented among the options provided** because none of them accurately states the conditions under which \\(\\Delta H = \\Delta U + P\\Delta V\\) is always applicable. However, the closest correct choice would be **B. only for constant pressure processes**, if considering the equation's direct relevance to work done against pressure. It's important to note that the equation can be used in a broader context depending on the specific conditions of the thermodynamic process being analyzed."
