The development of blade technology also occurred during this time, allowing for thinner and more precise tools.\n\nB. **Broadening of the Subsistence Base:** There was was an expansion in dietary habits, including the consumption of a wider range of foods beyond just large game. This likely included the utilization of smaller animals, birds, fish, and even plants, reflecting a more diverse and possibly more efficient use of available resources.\n\nC. **Larger Sites with Increased Populations:** As societal complexity grew, so did the size of human settlements. There0 were larger communal areas, evidence of permanent or semi-permanent habitation sites, and increased population densities. This suggests a higher degree of social organization and mobility patterns that allowed for the support of larger communities.\n\nThus, the Upper Paleolithic was characterized by a combination of technological advancements, dietary diversification, and changes in settlement patterns, reflecting a period of significant cultural and biological evolution in human history."
