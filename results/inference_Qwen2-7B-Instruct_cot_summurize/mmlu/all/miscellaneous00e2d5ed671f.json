This was an exhibition held at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1999, featuring works by young British artists known as the \"Young British Artists\" or YBA's, including Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, and Jake and Dinos Chapman. The exhibition included provocative pieces such as Emin's unmade bed and a pickled shark by Hirst, which sparked widespread controversy and public debate about the role of art and censorship."
