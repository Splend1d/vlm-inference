The fact that each monthly delivery is considered a separate contract also aligns with the definition of an installment contract. \n\nOption A ( divisible contract generally refers to a contract where the performance can be divided into smaller parts, but does not necessarily imply separate agreements for each part.\n\nOption C suggests that there are are 10 separate contracts, but in reality, they are one contract with multiple deliveries and payments under the same agreement.\n\nOption D describes a requirements-output contract, which typically involves one party agreeing to supply goods or services up to a certain amount, and the other agreeing to purchase that amount, regardless of when the actual sales occur. In this case, while there's a specific quantity agreed upon over time, the structure doesn't necessarily fit the description of a requirements-output contract."
