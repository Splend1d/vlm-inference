This means that they should be informed about what the research entails, the potential risks involved, and their rights to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. They should also have the opportunity to ask questions and receive clear answers. Options A, B, and D either lack this critical element of informed consent or suggest that there might be alternative activities available that could potentially mitigate the ethical concerns, but do not guarantee that the participation of students in research projects meets ethical standards."
