                    "text": "Attentional Load Theory, proposed by Jolicoeur and Healy in 1981, posits that there is a limited capacity for processing in the human mind when it comes to attention. This theory suggests that the brain can only process a certain amount of information at any given time, and this limitation affects how we perceive and respond to stimuli.\n\nThe correct statement from your options is:\n\nD. There is a general limit to the extent of attentional resources\n\nThis statement aligns with the core tenet of Attentional Load Theory, which states that there is a finite pool of cognitive resources available for processing incoming sensory information. When this resource is overwhelmed by too much information (high load), performance on tasks can suffer due to the inability to effectively filter out irrelevant information and focus on what is necessary.\n\nThe other options you've listed are related concepts but not directly stated as part of the Attentional Load Theory:\n\nA. The unity of our actions placing limits on attentional resources - This could be seen as a broader implication of the theory, suggesting that our ability to perform complex tasks requires a significant allocation of attentional resources.\n\nB. The degree to which an ignored stimulus is processed depends on the extent of processing required by the attended stimulus - This is more closely associated with the concept of \"inhibition of return\" or the phenomenon where a previously attended location becomes less likely to be attended again in the future. While it touches on aspects of attentional dynamics, it's not a central tenet of Attentional Load Theory.\n\nC. Selective attention facilitates inhibition of return - Again, this is related to the way attention can affect subsequent visual search processes, but it's not a core aspect of the Attentional Load Theory itself. Inhibition of return is a separate phenomenon observed in attentional processes.\n\nIn summary, while each of these statements touches on different aspects of attention and cognitive processing, the core of Attentional Load Theory is best represented by option D: there is a general limit to the extent of attentional resources."
