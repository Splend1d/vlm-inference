Pulse Modulators: In pulse modulation systems, VCOs can be used to generate a modulating signal that varies in frequency according to the input data signal.\n\nB. Frequency Modulators: VCOs are central components in frequency modulation (FM) circuits where the frequency of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal.\n\nC. Phase Locked Loops ( (PLL): PLLs often incorporate a VCO, which generates an output frequency that is proportional to the voltage applied to it. The VCO's output is used to control the frequency of the oscillator within the PLL, helping to maintain synchronization between two signals.\n\nTherefore, VCOs are indeed used in all these contexts."
