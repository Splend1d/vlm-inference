The parties met and signed a \"Letter Agreement\", which set forth the price, down payment amount, financing terms, the assets to be included, and a host of other pertinent details. The final closing date was not stated, but the purchasers left a down payment of $20,000 with the seller. The letter stated that the terms comprised their essential agreement, but that a formal document would be drafted by the parties' attorneys. Before that happened, the seller returned the check and refused to perform. The investor brought an equity action for specific performance to compel the sale. The equity court ruled that there was a complete and binding contract that must be specifically performed. Will the appellate court likely affirm the lower court's decision?\n\nA. No, because closing date was left out and the attorneys were supposed to compose the final contract with all of the remaining details put in.\nB. No, because this type of letter is basically a \"gentlemen's agreement\" that is not intended to be legally binding.\nC. Yes, because a letter of intent is legally binding if it sets forth the price, describes the business and is signed by both parties.\nD. Yes, because where the letter contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract.\n"

Yes, because where the letter contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA contract can be formed through various forms of communication, including letters, emails, oral agreements, or even text messages. As long as the agreement contains all the essential elements ( offer, acceptance, consideration, and capacity, the contract is legally binding. In the scenario you've presented, the letter agreement includes details such as the price, down payment, financing terms, assets to be included, and other pertinent specifics. This indicates that it might contain all the necessary elements for a binding contract. Therefore, if the lower court has determined that this letter constitutes a complete and binding contract, it is likely that the appellate court would affirm this decision based on the principle that a letter of intent can indeed form a legally binding contract when it includes all the essential terms. \n\nOptions A and B incorrectly suggest that a lack of a final draft by attorneys or that the agreement is merely a gentlemen's agreement would prevent the contract from being binding. However, the legal status of a contract does not depend on whether it has been formally drafted by lawyers or if it is referred to as a gentlemen's agreement. It is the content of the agreement and its fulfillment of the contract formation criteria that determine its binding nature. Option C is partially correct but does not fully capture the essence of why the appellate court might affirm the lower court's decision."
