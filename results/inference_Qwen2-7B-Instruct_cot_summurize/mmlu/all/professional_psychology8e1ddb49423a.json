It is often applied in fields such as economics, finance, and social sciences to understand how certain variables evolve over periods.\n\nThe correct answer is C. A trend analysis is typically used when a cross-sectional research design has been used. In a cross-sectional study, data is collected at a single point in time across different subjects or groups. Trend analysis allows researchers to examine how the variables of interest change across these different subjects or groups at the same time period.\n\nOptions A and B do not necessarily require trend analysis. If an independent variable is quantitative ( (A), other types of analyses might be more appropriate depending on the research question. Similarly, if the dependent variable is qualitative ( (B), categorical data analysis methods would be more suitable rather than trend analysis.\n\nOption D refers to a factorial research design, which involves examining the effects of two or more independent variables on a dependent variable. While this design can generate complex data that might benefit from trend analysis, it is not exclusive to it, and other statistical methods could also be applicable."
