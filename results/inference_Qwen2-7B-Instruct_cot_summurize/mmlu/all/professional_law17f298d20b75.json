The defendant was taken directly from the scene of the crime in a patrol car to the police station where he was placed, still handcuffed, in an interview room. He waited for about an hour, and a detective finally came in. The detective gave the defendant his Miranda warnings, and the defendant agreed to sign the waiver and speak to the detective. The defendant then confessed to the robbery. Which of the following allegations would be LEAST helpful in suppressing his statement?\n\nA. Before the defendant gave the statement he was refused permission to use the bathroom.\nB. The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement.\nC. The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause.\nD. The defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English.\n"

The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement.\n\nExplanation:\n- A. Being denied the use of the bathroom is an issue of humane treatment and might affect the voluntariness of the confession, but it does not necessarily invalidate the confession under legal standards.\n- B. Having a private lawyer at the time of giving a statement does not automatically make the confession inadmissible. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches after an individual has been formally charged, and if not yet charged, the presence of a lawyer is more related to the suspect's rights to counsel during interrogation than to the admissibility of any eventual confession.\n- C. An arrest lacking probable cause can lead to a suppression of evidence, but the confession itself might still be admissible if it was voluntary and made knowingly and intelligently. However, it could still impact the case as a whole.\n- D. Not being able to understand the Miranda warnings due to language barriers would typically raise concerns about the voluntariness and understanding of the defendant's rights, making this an issue that could potentially lead to the suppression of the confession.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, a confession is admissible if it is voluntary, regardless of whether the defendant speaks the same language as the officers or if they have a lawyer present before formal charges. However, the lack of translation services when the defendant cannot understand the warnings could still be considered during the voluntariness assessment."
