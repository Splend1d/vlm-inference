Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. People are socialized into a life of crime by associating with others who define it in positive terms.\n\nSutherland argued that individuals may adopt criminal behaviors because they perceive them as being acceptable or even desirable within certain subcultures. This idea is foundational to the concept of \"the deviance amplification theory,\" which suggests that the more one associates with deviant individuals, the more likely they are to engage in deviant activities themselves.\n\nThe other options do not accurately reflect Sutherland's findings or theories:\n\nB. The majority of crime is committed by middle-class people in professional occupations - This statement conflates Sutherland's work with broader societal statistics, and while white-collar crimes might be committed by professionals, it does not necessarily mean that the majority of all crimes fall under this category.\n\nC. Those who were arrested and charged with theft did not define themselves as thieves - This statement implies a misunderstanding of Sutherland's work, which actually posits that individuals can redefine what is considered \"normal\" or \"acceptable\" through their associations with others.\n\nD. The most dangerous criminals on the street were those who were highly skilled thieves - While skill is certainly a factor in the success of criminal activities, Sutherland's focus was more on the socialization aspects leading to criminal behavior rather than just the level of skill involved."
