Let's examine each option:\n\nA. It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia: This statement is not entirely accurate. While Graves' disease can lead to eye symptoms known as exophthalmos (or \"\u7a81\u773c\u75c7\" in Japanese, which means protruding eyes, it does not directly cause ophthalmoplegia. Ophthalmoplegia refers to a loss of eye muscle function and can be caused by various conditions, including but not limited to, Graves' disease.\n\nB. It causes a large multi-nodular goitre: This statement is true. One characteristic feature of Graves' disease is the development of a goitre, which is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. In some cases, the goitre may become multi-nodular, meaning it contains multiple lumps or nodules.\n\nC. It is commoner in males than females: This statement is false. Graves' disease is actually more common in women than in men. The exact ratio varies by region, but studies show that the prevalence is about 5-8 times higher in women compared to men.\n\nD. In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck': This statement is true. Derbyshire neck refers to a condition where the skin overlying the trachea (or windpipe, becomes thickened and induratedd due to fibrosis (scarring of the tissue. This condition was historically associated with Graves' disease, particularly in the UK, although its occurrence has decreased significantly with improved treatment options for the disease.\n\nIn summary, the correct statements are B (It causes a large multi-nodular goitre and D. In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck'."
