Six months after termination they meet at an art opening reception and begin to date. Over the next few months, the relationship progresses and they become sexual. In this situation, the psychologist has acted:\n\nA. Ethically because it had been 6 months since termination\nB. Probably ethically since there was no coercion involved and the relationship was consensual\nC. Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances\nD. Ethically according to professional standards, but the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment\n"

Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances\n\nProfessional guidelines, such as those set by the American Psychological Association (APA, prohibit psychologists from engaging in sexual relationships with current or former clients for a period of time that varies depending on the specific ethical code and the nature of the therapeutic relationship. This is to prevent conflicts of interest, power imbalances, and potential harm to the client. The APA's Ethics Code, for example, recommends that a \"cooling-off\" period of at least one year should elapse before a psychologist can engage in a romantic or sexual relationship with a former client.\n\nIn this scenario, regardless of how long it has been since the termination of therapy, the psychologist's decision to enter into a sexual relationship with her former client crosses professional boundaries and constitutes a violation of ethical standards."
