A multinomial logit**.\n\nA multinomial logit model, also known as a multinomial logistic regression, is used when the dependent variable has more than two unordered categories. In this case, the categories are choosing an equity fund, choosing a bond fund, and choosing a cash investment. The model allows us to understand the relationship between the choice of investment type and one or more independent variables (such as age, income level, risk tolerance, etc.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for this scenario:\n\n- A logit model ( typically refers to binary logistic regression which is used when there are are only two possible outcomes.\n  \n- An ordered logit model is used when the dependent variable is ordinal with more than two categories, but in this case, the choices are not ordered ( (choosing an equity fund is not inherently higher or lower than choosing a bond fund or a cash investment).\n  \n- A tobit model, or Tobit model, is used when there's censoring in the dependent variable, meaning that some observations are not fully observed but are known to be above or below a certain threshold. This does not seem applicable to the scenario described here."
