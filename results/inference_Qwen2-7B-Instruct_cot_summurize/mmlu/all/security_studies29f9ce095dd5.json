Investigations into the consequences of state security policies showed that women were subject to masculine dominated war policies as the likely victims as casualties of war or as post conflict targets. Women are increasingly subject to violence as a product of social circumstance.\nB. Gendered consequences of security issues have not challenged international relations theory. Constructivist theories of the state were mainstreamed without undermining the ideas of state as the centre of military power, or as the highest organization of human community.\nC. Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles.\nD. The literature that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s was primarily concerned with the ways in which women had served the purposes of nationalist campaigns, focusing on the biological characteristics of women as sexually reproductive beings, and with little focus on critical analysis.\n"

These studies demonstrated that women are indeed subject to the consequences of state security policies, often being the primary victims of war as casualties or post-conflict targets. They highlighted how women experience violence not only directly through combat but also indirectly through societal structures and policies.\n\nB. Contrary to the notion that these investigations merely added to international relations theory without challenging its foundations, they actually contributed to rethinking central concepts such as the state's role in military power and the organization of human communities. By emphasizing the gendered dimensions of security, they pushed for a more inclusive and nuanced approach to understanding security dynamics.\n\nC. Feminist and critical security theory has indeed shown that war can have gendered consequences. This recognition has led to a shift in how we understand and conceptualize gender roles in warfare, moving away from traditional binary notions of \"male\" and \"female\" and towards a more complex understanding that acknowledges the diverse experiences of men and women in conflict situations. This has influenced policy-making, participation in conflict resolution, and advocacy efforts against gender-based violence in war zones.\n\nD. While it is true that some early feminist analyses focused on women's roles in nationalist campaigns and their biological characteristics, the broader body of work that emerged during this period was far more comprehensive. It encompassed a critical examination of gender norms, power relations, and the systemic factors that perpetuate inequalities in security contexts. It also included a growing awareness of the intersectionality of gender with other identities like race, class, and sexuality.\n\nIn summary, the feminist and critical security approaches of the 1980s and 1990s have been instrumental in broadening the scope of security studies to include gender as a central concern, challenging traditional paradigms, and promoting a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of security that accounts for the varied experiences of different groups, particularly women."
