I, II, III, and IV\n\nIn each of these market structures (Perfect Competition, Oligopoly, Monopoly, and Monopolistic Competition - firms will maximize their profits by setting output levels where marginal cost (MC equals marginal revenue (MR). This is because at this point, any additional unit produced would not increase total revenue enough to cover the additional cost of production (the marginal cost), leading to an increase in profit, and thus it's the optimal point for profit maximization.\n\nHowever, the way they reach this point can vary significantly due to the differences in market power and competition within each structure:\n\n- In Perfect Competition, firms are price takers and have no control over the market price, so they set their output level based on MC = MR to maximize profits.\n- In Oligopoly, firms may collude or engage in strategic behavior, but in the long run, they will also produce at the MC = MR point, though it might be at a higher price than in perfect competition.\n- In a Monopoly, being the sole supplier, the firm has complete control over price and quantity, yet it still sets its output at the point where MC = MR to maximize profits.\n- In Monopolistic Competition, firms face differentiation in products, allowing them some control over prices, but they still operate at the MC = MR point to maximize profits. The key difference here is that firms have more pricing power due to product differentiation compared to perfect competition, which affects the exact level of output and price, but the principle remains the same."
