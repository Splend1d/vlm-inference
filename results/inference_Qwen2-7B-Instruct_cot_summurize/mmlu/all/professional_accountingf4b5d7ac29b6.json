Suspended losses can be carried forward, but not back, until utilized.\n\nExplanation:\n\nPassive activity losses that cannot be deducted in a given year due to limitations (such as excess of losses over income from passive activities, or the overall net investment income limitation) are \"suspended.\" These losses are carried forward indefinitely to offset future passive income, rather than being carried back to previous years or utilized against non-passive income. The rules around how these losses can be used may vary based on specific tax provisions, but the general rule regarding carryback and carryforward is as described in option B."
