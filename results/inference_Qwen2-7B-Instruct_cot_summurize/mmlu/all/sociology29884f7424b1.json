They represent images of women as both domesticated and independent\n\nPilcher's identification of soap operas as a 'feminine genre' of media is based on the idea that these shows often depict women in roles that reflect common stereotypes or roles associated with femininity. While it's true that many soap operas characters are women, and some female TV producers do work in this area, the key aspect Pilcher focused on was the representation of women within the genre.\n\nSoap operas often portray women in various roles, including being caretakers and homemakers (which can be seen as a reflection of traditional gender roles (the 'domesticated' part). At the same time, some soap operas also show women pursuing careers, making decisions, and having complex personal lives, which could be interpreted as representing women as independent. This dual representation of women in both traditional and modern roles is what Pilcher likely saw as central to characterizing soap operas as a 'feminine genre'."
