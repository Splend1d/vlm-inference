This, in turn, contributes to stronger economic growth. \n\nOn the other hand, more rapid consumption of natural resources (A) can lead to depletion of resources, higher costs, and environmental degradation that could hinder future growth. Higher adult illiteracy rates (B) reduce the workforce's skill level, limiting potential productivity gains. A falling stock of capital goods implies that there is less productive capacity available, which would also limit economic growth."
