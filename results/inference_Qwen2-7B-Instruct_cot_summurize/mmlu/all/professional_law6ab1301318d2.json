Destination contract\n\nIn a destination contract, the seller agrees to deliver the goods at a specific location (the destination point) which is usually the buyer's premises or another agreed-upon place. The seller is responsible for all costs and risks until the goods reach the specified destination.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D are also types of contracts in international trade, they do not specifically mention a \"delivery point\":\n\n- A. F.A.S. Contract ( stands for Free Alongside Ship, indicating the goods are made available on board the ship.\n- C. Shipment contract refers to a contract where the performance obligation is the shipment of goods.\n- D. F.O.B. Contract, or Free On Board, indicates that the seller delivers when the goods are made available to the buyer on board the vessel.\n\nTherefore, option B is the closest to specifying a delivery point as part of the contract terms."
