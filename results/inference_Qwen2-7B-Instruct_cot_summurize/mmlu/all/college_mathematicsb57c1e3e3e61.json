                    "text": "The interval of convergence for a power series is defined by the set of values for which the series converges. For most power series centered at zero (like \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n(x-a)^n\\), where \\(a\\) is the center of the series and \\(c_n\\) are the coefficients, the interval of convergence includes all \\(x\\) values in an open interval around \\(a\\), possibly including the endpoints.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(I) \\([-1, 3)\\): This interval suggests convergence for \\(x\\) in the range from -1 to 3, not including 3. This could be a valid interval depending on the specific power series.\n\n(II) \\(-\\infty, 0]\\): This is an interval that suggests convergence for all \\(x\\) less than or equal to 0. This could also be a valid interval depending on the specifics of the series.\n\n(III) \\([2, 2] \\cup [3, 3]\\): This interval essentially represents two points: \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\). A power series typically has an interval of convergence that is an open or half-open interval unless the series is specifically designed to converge only at certain isolated points.\n\n(IV) \\(-\\ininfty, \\infty\\): This would imply the series converges for all real numbers. This is also possible if the series is such that it converges everywhere.\n\nTo determine which of these are valid, we need to understand that:\n\n- (I and IV can potentially be valid intervals if the series converges within this range.\n- II could be valid if the series converges for all \\(x \\leq 0\\).\n- III is not a typical interval of convergence for a power series since it doesn't represent an open interval but rather two isolated points, which is unusual for a continuous interval of convergence.\n\nTherefore, without specific information about the nature of the series (its radius of convergence and behavior at the endpoints), we can't definitively say whether any of these intervals are valid for all cases. However, in terms of general possibilities:\n\n- **I and IV** are more likely to represent potential intervals of convergence for a standard power series, as they represent ranges of convergence.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be **C. (I) and (IV)**. These options represent the typical form of an interval of convergence for a power series, considering the nature of such series and their convergence properties."
