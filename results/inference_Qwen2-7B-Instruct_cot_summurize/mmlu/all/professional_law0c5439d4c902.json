In this scenario, the victim's statement, \"I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this,\" is made under circumstances where the victim believes their life is in danger (the beating has stopped but the victim still perceives a need to communicate critical information before potentially succumbing to their injuries. This type of statement is typically considered an exception to the hearsay rule and is admissible in court.\n\nOption A, \"excited utterance,\" refers to spontaneous statements made under the stress or excitement caused by the event itself, but it does not necessarily require the speaker to believe they are about to die.\n\nOption C, \"inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception,\" would apply if the statement did not fall under any exception to the hearsay rule, which it does in this case.\n\nOption D, \"inadmissible, because the victim was not questioned about the statement before being excused,\" is not the correct answer because the admissibility of a dying declaration is not dependent on the declarant being questioned about the statement immediately before being excused from the witness stand."
