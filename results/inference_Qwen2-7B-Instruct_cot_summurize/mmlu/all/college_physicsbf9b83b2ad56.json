Since the object is thrown horizontally, its vertical motion is solely affected by gravity.\n\nThe vertical displacement (\\(y\\)) of the object when it hits the ground can be found using the equation:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n- \\(t\\) is the time of flight.\n\nPlugging in the values given:\n- \\(g = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\),\n- \\(t = 2.0 \\, \\text{s}\\),\n\nwe get:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times (2^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 4 = 19.6 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nTherefore, the object was thrown from a height of 19.6 meters, which corresponds to option D."
