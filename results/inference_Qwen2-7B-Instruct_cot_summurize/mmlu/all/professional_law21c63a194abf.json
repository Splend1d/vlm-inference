                    "text": "The President appointed a delegation to enter into negotiations with representatives of a foreign government to study the problem of preventing the extinction of certain species of rabbits. The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. Assume that after the treaty goes into effect, a state legislature enacts a statute that provides that \"any licensed rabbit-hunter in the state and its surrounding environs may increase his monthly catch of rabbits from 10 to 15 in each of the specified months of the authorized rabbit-hunting season from the first day of October until the last day of February. \" If challenged, the enactment of the aforementioned statute would most likely be declared\n\nA. constitutional, because the regulation of hunting is within the area of state action.\nB. constitutional, because the enactment falls within the Tenth Amendment's reservedpowers.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because all treaties are the supreme law of the land.\n"

This implies that there is an international agreement regarding the protection and conservation of these endangered species.\n\nIf a state legislature were to enact a statute that allows increased hunting of rabbits during specific months, it could potentially conflict with the federal treaty and the international agreement. By allowing more hunting, the state statute might undermine the efforts to protect and conserve the endangered species, which are are part of the international agreement.\n\nTherefore, the statute might be challenged on the grounds that it violates the Commerce Clause, as it could interfere with or contradict the federal treaty and the international agreement aimed at protecting endangered species. Thus, the most likely outcome would be that the statute would be declared unconstitutional due to its potential conflict with federal and international laws."
