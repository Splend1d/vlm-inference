The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nWhich conclusion is supported by the passage?\n\nA. Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.\nB. North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\nC. Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\nD. Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.\n"

                    "text": "The conclusion supported by the passage is:\n\nC. Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\n\nThis is because the passage describes a situation where a caravan of traders captures and enslaves a large number of black Africans, with a particular emphasis on adult females and children. The text mentions that the caravan started with 64 camels and 16 people, but after the captures, it is augmented by 400 slaves, of whom 300 are women. This suggests that the enslavement has led to a significant decrease in the number of women relative to men in the captured population, which implies that there were more men taken as slaves than women. \n\nThe other options are not supported by the passage:\n\nA. The passage does not suggest that Africans passively accepted their capture and enslavement; rather, it shows that they resisted and had difficulty being moved against their will.\n\nB. There is no evidence provided in the passage suggesting that North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes. The context indicates that the enslavement is occurring within the framework of the slave trade between different regions, possibly involving different ethnic groups.\n\nD. While the passage mentions the value of slaves based on their age and gender, it does not specifically conclude that adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength. The valuation seems to be based more on the perceived beauty of the female slaves and the labor capacity of both males and females."
