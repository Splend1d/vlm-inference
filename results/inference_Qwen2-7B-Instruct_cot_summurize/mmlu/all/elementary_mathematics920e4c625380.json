This is 4 points fewer than he scored in his second game.\" can be translated into an algebraic equation. The key part here is \"4 points fewer,\" which means you subtract 4 from the number of points in the second game to get the number of points in the first game.\n\nLet p represent the number of points scored in the second game. Then, according to the information given, the equation that represents this situation is:\n\np - 4 = 18\n\nTo find the value of p ( (the number of points scored in the second game), we need to isolate p on one side of the equation. We do this by adding 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\np - 4 + 4 = 18 + 4\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\np = 22\n\nHowever, this equation does not match any of the options provided. It seems there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the original problem statement. The correct interpretation should lead to an equation where you start with the total points from the second game (p, subtract 4 points, and end up with the 18 points scored in the first game. \n\nSo, the correct equation to represent the relationship between the points scored in the two games based on the problem statement should be:\n\np - 4 = 18\n\nSolving for p:\n\np = 18 + 4\np = 22\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is actually represented by option B when interpreted correctly as:\n\n18 = p - 4; 22\n\nThis matches the corrected understanding that you start with the total points from the second game (p, subtract 4 points, and end up with the 18 points scored in the first game."
