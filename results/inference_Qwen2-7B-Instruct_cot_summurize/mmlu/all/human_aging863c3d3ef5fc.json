They have fewer novel experiences.\n\nOne theory to explain why time seems to pass faster as we age is that our brains process and encode new information at a slower rate as we get older. This means that older adults may experience fewer novel or unique experiences, which can make time feel like it's passing more quickly. In contrast, when we are younger, we tend to have more new experiences and learn more things each day, which can make time feel like it's moving more slowly.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is just one possible explanation, and there are other factors that could contribute to why time seems to pass differently for different people at different stages of their lives."
