The gravitational acceleration acting on this falling book is \\(g\\), which is approximately \\(9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) near the Earth's surface.\n\nThe other book, which remains on the table, is dragged by the string attached to the falling book. Since there is no friction (as specified in the question), the horizontal force applied by the falling book on the stationary book is equal to the tension in the string. This force causes the stationary book to move horizontally at the same acceleration as the falling book because Newton's second law (\\(F = ma\\)) applies equally to both books. Here, \\(F\\) is the force ( \\(m\\) is the mass of the object, and \\(a\\) is the acceleration.\n\nSince the force causing the acceleration is the same for both books (and it's due to gravity, which is \\(mg\\) where \\(m\\) is the mass of the falling book and \\(g\\) is the gravitational acceleration, and since \\(m\\) cancels out when comparing the accelerations of the two books, the acceleration of the stationary book is also \\(g\\).\n\nTherefore, the acceleration of the books is \\(g\\), making option C the correct choice."
