He often expressed skepticism towards traditional religious answers to the question of life's purpose. Darrow believed that life was uncertain and that there were no absolute certainties or guarantees. This aligns more closely with option C: \"Life was uncertain but ultimately rewarding.\" Darrow emphasized the importance of human agency, ethics, and the pursuit of justice as ways to find meaning in life. He was a proponent of secular humanism, which values human reason, ethics, and compassion over supernatural explanations.\n\nIt is important to note that Darrow's views evolved over time, and he did not provide a single, definitive statement on the meaning of life. His speeches and writings reflect a nuanced perspective that acknowledges the complexity and mystery of existence while advocating for a commitment to human dignity, social justice, and the betterment of society."
