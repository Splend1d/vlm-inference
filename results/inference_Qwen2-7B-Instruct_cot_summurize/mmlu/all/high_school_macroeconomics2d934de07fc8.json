This results in a higher inflation rate for a given level of unemployment, moving the Phillips curve to the left. \n\nThe other options do not correctly describe the effect of a negative or contractionary supply shock:\n\nB. Shifting the investment demand curve to the right would indicate an increase in investment, which is not a direct result of a contractionary supply shock.\n\nC. Shifting the money demand curve to the right typically occurs due to factors like higher income or expectations of higher prices, neither of which are directly associated with a negative or contractionary supply shock.\n\nD. Shifting the Phillips curve to the right would imply that higher inflation is associated with lower unemployment, which contradicts the typical effect of a contractionary supply shock."
