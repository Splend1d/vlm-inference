The psychologist: tells the client to call a physician immediately and to come in at 9:00 A.M. on Monday for a session. The psychologist makes no other attempt to intervene, and the client dies later that evening without making any other calls for assistance. In this situation, the psychologist's behavior was clearly\n\nA. unethical, because the client's needs were not addressed more directly\nB. unethical, because the psychologist should have delayed the trip and given the client an appointment for that afternoon\nC. unethical, because the psychologist should have called a physician directly\nD. ethical, because it was not possible to determine whether or not the client was being manipulative\n"

Psychologists have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of their clients, especially when serious threats to life are are made or attempted. The psychologist's actions do not appear to have been proactive or timely in addressing the immediate crisis. The fact that the client died later that evening without receiving additional help suggests a significant failure in professional responsibility. It is important for psychologists to have a plan in place for such emergencies, which may include providing immediate referrals to medical professionals or arranging for emergency services. Delaying the trip and providing an appointment for that afternoon might not have been sufficient given the severity of the situation."
