Education about older adults\n\nEducation about older adults can improve attitudes toward aging and older adults by increasing understanding, dispelling myths, and promoting respect for their experiences and contributions. This can be achieved through various forms of education such as workshops, seminars, books, documentaries, or interactive programs that aim to inform and engage people on topics related to aging.\n\nWhile options C and D might offer some exposure and perhaps a more nuanced view of older adults depending on the content and quality of the experience, they are not as systematic or focused as an educational approach. Option A, staying away from older adults, would likely not improve attitudes but rather maintain or even worsen stereotypes and misunderstandings."
