This relationship is described by Coulomb's law:\n\n\\[ F = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(F\\) is the force between the charges, \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant, \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) are the magnitudes of the charges, and \\(r\\) is the distance between the charges.\n\nIf you place the same charged particles twice as close to each other, \\(r\\) becomes half of its original value. Substituting \\(r/2\\) for \\(r\\) in the equation gives:\n\n\\[ F' = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{(r/2)^2} = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2/4} = 4 \\cdot k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \\]\n\nSo, the new force \\(F'\\) is four times the original force \\(F\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. four times as strong**."
