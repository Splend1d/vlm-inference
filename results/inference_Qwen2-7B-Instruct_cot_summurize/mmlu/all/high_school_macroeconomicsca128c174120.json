Lower tax rates on interest earned from savings.\n\nSupply-side economists, also known as trickle-down economists, believe that reducing taxes and regulations will encourage businesses to invest more, create jobs, and ultimately increase the overall economic output. Lowering tax rates on interest earned from savings can incentivize individuals to save more and invest in the economy, which according to supply-side theory, can lead to economic growth.\n\nA. Higher taxes on corporate profits could discourage investment and job creation, as it reduces the after-tax returns on investment.\nC. Removing investment tax credits might hinder investment activities, as tax credits are often used to encourage specific types of investments, such as those in renewable energy or research and development.\nD. A longer duration of unemployment benefits could potentially disincentivize people from seeking work, as they may have less motivation to find employment if they can rely on extended benefits. This is counter to the supply-side focus on incentives for work and productivity."
