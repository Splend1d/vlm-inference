He appears reluctant to remove his shirt for the examination, and says that he is embarrassed because he has grown breasts during the past year. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement?\n\nA. Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor\nB. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome\nC. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome)\nD. Normal development\n"

Normal development\n\nIn adolescence, especially in males, breast tissue can develop due to increased estrogen levels, which can occur from various sources including the adrenal glands or ovaries. The presence of bilateral fibroglandular masses beneath the nipple-areolar complex without any abnormalities in the penis or testes, along with normal serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone, suggests that this is likely a physiological process rather than an endocrine disorder.\n\nOptions A, B, and C suggest more specific conditions:\nA. An estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor is a rare possibility but not the most common explanation for male breast development.\nB. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome typically involves multiple organ involvement, including gastrointestinal issues, and is not primarily associated with breast development in males.\nC. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis ( Klinefelter syndrome) refers to a condition where there is an abnormal number of X chromosomes (usually two Xs instead of one X and one Y, leading to underdevelopment of the testes. This would typically lead to infertility, small testes, and low testosterone, not breast development.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most plausible answer is that this is a normal part of adolescent development."
