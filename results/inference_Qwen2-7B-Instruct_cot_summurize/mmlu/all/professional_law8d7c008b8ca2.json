The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. The court will most likely construe restriction (23) as a (an)\n\nA. negative easement.\nB. equitable servitude.\nC. affirmative covenant.\nD. fee simple absolute.\n"

In this case, restriction 23) specifically states that \"No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks.\" This restriction prevents the construction of buildings on a specific strip of land, which benefits the public utility companies that may need access to this space for infrastructure purposes, such as laying cables or pipes. This type of restriction is designed to protect the interests of the public utility companies and ensure they have adequate space for necessary utilities, while also preserving the aesthetic and functional integrity of the neighborhood by preventing structures on that strip of land."
