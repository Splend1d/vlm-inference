The latter implies \\(x^3 = -1\\), so \\(x = -1\\).\n\nFor \\(x = 0\\), substituting back into \\(y = -x^2\\) gives \\(y = 0\\).\n\nFor \\(x = -1\\), substituting back into \\(y = -x^2\\) gives \\(y = 1\\).\n\nSo, we have two critical points: \\(P(0, 0)\\) and \\(Q(-1, 1)\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the second partial derivatives:\n\n\\[f_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(x^3 + y^3 + 3xy) = 6x\\]\n\n\\[f_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}(x^3 + y^3 + 3xy) = 6y\\]\n\n\\[f_{xy} = f_{yx} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y}(x^3 + y^3 + 3xy) = 3\\]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix \\(D\\) at each critical point:\n\n\\[D = f_{xx}f_{yy} - (f_{xy}^2\\]\n\nFor point \\(P(0, 0)\\):\n\n\\[D_P = (6*0 - 3^2 = -9\\]\n\nSince \\(D < 0\\), \\(P(0, 0)\\) is a saddle point.\n\nFor point \\(Q(-1, 1)\\):\n\n\\[D_Q = (6*(-1) - 3^2 = -6 - 9 = -15\\]\n\nAgain, since \\(D < 0\\), \\(Q(-1, 1)\\) is also a saddle point.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. saddle point at P and at Q"
