This moral philosophy is often referred to as \"sentimentalism\" and it emphasizes the role of emotions and feelings in moral judgment. According to Hume, people's moral judgments are based on the emotional responses they have to certain behaviors, rather than on some objective, rational assessment of those behaviors."
