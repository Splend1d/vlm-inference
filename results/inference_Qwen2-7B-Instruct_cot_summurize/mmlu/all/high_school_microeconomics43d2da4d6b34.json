                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Dorothy cooks, since she has comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what absolute and comparative advantages mean:\n\n**Absolute Advantage:** This refers to the ability of an individual or entity to produce more of a good or service than another using the same amount of resources, or to produce the same amount using fewer resources.\n\n**Comparative Advantage:** This is the ability of an individual or entity to transform inputs into outputs at a lower opportunity cost than another.\n\nGiven that Ray can pull 50 weeds per hour and Dorothy can pull 100 weeds per hour, Dorothy clearly has an absolute advantage in pulling weeds. However, the question focuses on cooking, which is not directly addressed by the given information about the rate of weed-pulling.\n\nSince there's no information provided about the opportunity costs (i.e., how much time spent cooking affects the ability to pull weeds for either Ray or Dorothy, we cannot directly determine their comparative advantages in cooking based solely on the information given.\n\nHowever, the options suggest a comparison between cooking and pulling weeds. If we interpret the question's intent as asking who has an advantage in the activity that doesn't directly compare rates (\u2014pulling weeds versus cooking\u2014then the context shifts slightly.\n\nAssuming the goal is to choose who has a comparative advantage in the activity not directly compared (and given the information provided, it seems the focus should be on the activities that were directly compared: cooking and pulling weeds.\n\nGiven the information:\n- Dorothy has an absolute advantage in pulling weeds ((100 vs. 50 weeds per hour).\n- No information is provided to directly compare their abilities or efficiencies in cooking.\n\nWithout specific information on their relative efficiencies in cooking, it's challenging to definitively state one has a comparative advantage over the other in cooking. However, the options suggest a comparison based on the given data points.\n\nGiven the choices and assuming the question intends to ask about the activity with the most direct comparison provided (\u2014pulling weeds\u2014Dorothy's absolute advantage in pulling weeds suggests she likely has a comparative advantage in that activity as well, since the question does not provide evidence for her having a disadvantage in any activity.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and interpreting the question's intent to compare activities where direct comparisons are available, the closest answer would be:\n\nC. Dorothy cooks, since she has comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nThis interpretation assumes that the lack of information about cooking implies that Dorothy, who excels in the activity where direct comparison is provided (\u2014pulling weeds\u2014likely also has an advantage in cooking, making her choice to cook based on comparative advantage. This conclusion is speculative and relies on assumptions given the limited information provided in the question."
