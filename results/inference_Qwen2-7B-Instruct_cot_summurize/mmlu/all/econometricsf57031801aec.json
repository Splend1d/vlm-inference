The variance of the errors is not constant\n\nHeteroscedasticity refers to a condition in which the variance of the error terms, or residuals, in a statistical model varies across different levels of the independent variables. This means that the spread of the residuals is not consistent and can change with the value of the predictors. It's an important consideration in regression analysis because it can affect the reliability of statistical tests and confidence intervals."
