There are \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\) ways to do this.\n\n2. **Choose 1 card from each of the selected suits**: Once we have chosen the suits, we need to pick one card from each of those suits. In a standard deck, there are 13 cards in each suit ( (Ace through 10, and the face cards Jack, Queen, King). So for each of the 3 chosen suits, we can pick any one of the 13 cards. This gives us \\(13^3 = 2197\\) ways to pick one card from each of the 3 chosen suits.\n\nCombining these two steps, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits is the product of the two possibilities: \\(4 \\times 2197 = 8788\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. 8788**."
