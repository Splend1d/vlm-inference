Historical materialism as a paradigm is opposed to the broad goals of the global justice movement, which advocates an expansion of neo-liberalism in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\nB. Historical materialism has an established history of supporting global justice and opposing inequality; during the Cold War it was the basis of opposition to repressive communist states.\nC. Historical materialism does not provide any unique perspective on capitalism, and is more concerned with the history of capitalist trade than with exploitation or alienation of populations in the system.\nD. Historical materialism can concern both human rights and economic rights. It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.\n"

It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHistorical materialism is a concept that originated from Karl Marx's theory of historical development, which suggests that society's economic base ( (the means of production and the relations of production) determines its superstructure ( (the political, legal, religious, and ideological institutions). This theory posits that societal changes occur through class struggles, particularly those between the bourgeoisie ( (capitalist owners) and the proletariat ( (workers without property).\n\nThe global justice movement, also known as the alter-globalization movement, emerged in response to perceived injustices in globalization, such as economic inequalities, environmental degradation, and human rights violations exacerbated by policies like neoliberalism. This movement seeks to promote fairer and more sustainable global economic systems, often advocating for alternatives to traditional global economic structures.\n\nHistorical materialism has provided a theoretical framework for understanding these issues by highlighting the ways in which economic systems shape social relations and power dynamics. It supports the idea that societal change can be driven by economic transformations, which aligns with the global justice movement's goal of transforming global economic systems to be more equitable and just.\n\nThe Occupy protests, for instance, drew heavily on Marxist ideas, including those derived from historical materialism, to critique the existing capitalist system and advocate for broader social and economic reforms. The protesters highlighted issues like income inequality, corporate greed, and the concentration of wealth and power, which are are central concerns in both historical materialism and the global justice movement.\n\nTherefore, while historical materialism and the global justice movement share overlapping interests and theoretical foundations, they are not necessarily in opposition to each other. Instead, historical materialism offers a lens through which to analyze and critique the systemic issues that the global justice movement aims to address."
