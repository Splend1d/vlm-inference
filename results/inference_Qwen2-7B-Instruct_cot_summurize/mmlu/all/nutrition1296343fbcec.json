                    "text": "Intestinal failure is a condition in which the small and/or large intestine cannot absorb sufficient nutrients, fluids, or electrolytes. It can be caused by various conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, radiation damage, infections, trauma, or surgical procedures like colectomy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Always requires parenteral nutritional support - This statement is not entirely accurate. While many patients with intestinal failure require total parenteral nutrition ( (TPN) due to the inability to adequately absorb nutrients through the gut, some may eventually regain enough small intestinal function to allow for oral or enteral feedingings.\n\nB. May follow colectomy - This statement is true. A colectomy, which involves removing all or part of the colon, can lead to intestinal failure because it reduces the surface area available for nutrient absorption. However, recovery can occur with proper management.\n\nC. Is always permanent - This statement is false. Intestinal failure can sometimes be temporary, especially if it is due to acute conditions that resolve over time. With appropriate treatment, including management of underlying causes, rehabilitation, and in some cases, bowel surgery, recovery of intestinal function is possible.\n\nD. May benefit from sodium supplementation of >=90mmol/l - This statement depends on the specific clinical context. Sodium supplementation may be necessary in cases of significant sodium loss, but the target level would depend on the patient's individual needs and health status. In some cases, it might indeed be beneficial to maintain sodium levels at or above 90 mmol/l, especially if there is evidence of hyponatremia (low sodium levels. However, this should be managed under medical supervision, as high sodium intake could potentially exacerbate other conditions or lead to complications."
