A deposition of a person against whom another person contemplates filing an action may indeed be compelled by the party contemplating the action, without the need for leave from the court, before the action is filed. This is typically done to gather information or evidence that could be relevant to the potential lawsuit.\n\nII. It is also true that a deposition of the defendant in an action can be taken by the plaintiff without serving a subpoena on the defendant. This is possible under certain circumstances, such as when the plaintiff believes the defendant might not appear voluntarily or if the deposition is part of a discovery process.\n\nIII. Depositions can be taken even if all the testimony secured by it will be inadmissible at the trial. The primary purpose of a deposition is often to preserve testimony or evidence that might otherwise be lost or unavailable. While the testimony may not be directly used at the trial due to rules of admissibility, it can still be useful for various purposes, including strategic planning, identifying potential witnesses, or for use in motions and other legal proceedings.\n\nTherefore, all three statements are true in the context of depositions in civil suits."
