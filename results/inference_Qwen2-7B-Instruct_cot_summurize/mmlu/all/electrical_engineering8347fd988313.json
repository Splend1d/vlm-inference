The voltage used in directional heating depends on various factors such as the application (industrial heating, cooking appliances, etc.), the type of material being heated, and the desired efficiency.\n\nHowever, none of your options ( A. 1.5 KV., B. 15 KV., C. 33 KV., D. 66 KV. are specifically associated with \"directional heating.\" High voltage electricity is often used in industrial settings, but not necessarily for directional heating unless it's part of a specialized process.\n\nFor example, in some industrial applications like plasma cutting or plasma arc welding, high voltages can be used, but the voltages you've listed do not correspond to typical voltages used in these processes. \n\nIn the context of cooking appliances where a similar term might be misused, induction cooktops operate at around 2-4 KV AC, which is quite different from the options given.\n\nGiven the lack of specificity in your question and the variety of possible uses for \"directional heating,\" it's challenging to provide an accurate answer without more context. If this term refers to a specific industry or technology, additional details would be helpful. \n\nIn general, for household appliances, voltages are much lower ( typically around 120V AC in North America and 230V AC in Europe, which is safe for handling and does not fall into the range you've provided. \n\nFor professional or industrial applications, voltages could range widely depending on the equipment and safety regulations, potentially reaching up to several thousand volts DC or AC, but this is not specific to \"directional heating\" as described."
