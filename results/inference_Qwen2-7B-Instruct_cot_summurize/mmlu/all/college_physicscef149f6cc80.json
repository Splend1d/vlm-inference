To achieve this, we want the standard deviation of the rate (\u03c3_rate to be 1% of the mean rate \u03bc:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{rate} = \\frac{\\mu}{100} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{1.4}{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{100} \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \u03bc:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1.4}{1.9} = \\frac{1}{100} \\]\n\nThis equation doesn't directly solve for time but helps us understand the relationship between the standard deviation and the mean. To find out how many counts are needed for the uncertainty to be 1%, we need to consider that the standard deviation of the mean (\u03c3/\u221an decreases as the square root of the number of measurements n:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{rate} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nRearranging for n:\n\n\\[ n = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_{rate}}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nSince we want the uncertainty to be 1%, we substitute \u03c3_rate with 0.01 * \u03bc:\n\n\\[ n = \\left(\\frac{1.4}{0.01 \\times 1.9}\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\left(\\frac{1.4}{0.019}\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ n \\approx (73.67^2 \\]\n\n\\[ n \\approx 5442 \\]\n\nThis calculation shows that you would need approximately 5442 counts to achieve an uncertainty of 1%. However, this answer isn't among the options provided, which suggests that there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or the answer choices.\n\nGiven the context and options, none of them directly match the calculated result. Typically, such questions aim for an intuitive understanding rather than precise calculations. The options seem to be based on the assumption that increasing the count time will reduce the relative uncertainty, but without a specific formula relating time to uncertainty in this context, direct calculation isn't straightforward.\n\nIn a typical scenario where students learn about counting statistics, they often learn that the number of counts (N required to achieve a certain precision in the measurement of a rate (R is related to the square root of N in terms of the standard deviation of the mean. This is because the standard deviation of the mean (\u03c3/N is inversely proportional to the square root of N. \n\nGiven the nature of the question and the options provided, it seems like the question might be asking for a general principle or a rule of thumb rather than a precise calculation. Based on common principles taught in physics or chemistry classes regarding counting statistics, the correct answer would likely be the option that represents a significantly larger number of counts than the initial 10 counts, reflecting the idea that more counts lead to better precision. \n\nGiven the options:\nA. 80 s\nB. 110 s\nC. 2,000 s\nD. 5,000 s\n\nOption C (2,000 s) would likely be considered the closest to what one might intuitively expect based on the principles of counting statistics, as it is much larger than the initial 10 counts and reflects a significant increase in the number of counts that could improve the precision of the measurement.
