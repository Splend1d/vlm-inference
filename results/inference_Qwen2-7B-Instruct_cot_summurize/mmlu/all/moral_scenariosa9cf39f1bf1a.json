Wrong, Not wrong\n\nCutting someone's hair without their knowledge or consent can be seen as disrespectful and invasive, especially if they are elderly and sleeping, potentially making it a morally wrong act. However, not releasing a \"silver cure for viruses\" seems more like an ethical dilemma rather than a clear-cut moral wrongdoing, depending on the context and intentions. It could be seen as unethical if it results in harm or death due to lack of access to necessary treatments, but without further information, it's difficult to label it as unequivocally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
