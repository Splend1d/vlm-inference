The Aztec Empire was based on a complex system of expansion that included tribute, but also encompassed military conquest, administrative organization, trade networks, and a sophisticated religious and cultural system. The requirement for extensive and escalating human sacrifice was indeed a key aspect of their religious practices and ceremonies, often performed as part of rituals to appease their gods or maintain cosmic balance. This aspect played a significant role in their societal structure and territorial governance."
