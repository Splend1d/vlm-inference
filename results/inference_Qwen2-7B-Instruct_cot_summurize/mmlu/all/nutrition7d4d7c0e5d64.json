The rate of increase in the median age of populations is greater in develop countries than wealthy countries.\n\nExplanation:\n- A: This statement is not universally accurate and depends on the specific country or region. While many countries are experiencing an aging population, reaching 25% of the population being 65 years or older by 2040 may not apply to all countries equally.\n- B: This statement is generally true. Developed countries tend to have higher life expectancies and lower birth rates, leading to their populations aging more slowly compared to developing countries which might experience faster increases in median age due to improvements in healthcare and lower fertility rates.\n- C: This statement is incorrect. In general, the ratio of men to women tends to even out in older age groups because there are more males born (but as people age, the survival rates for both genders become more equal, and often women live longer than men.\n- D: This statement is incorrect. Generally, women have a lower mortality rate than men across the life course, partly due to biological factors such as hormonal differences and health behaviors."
