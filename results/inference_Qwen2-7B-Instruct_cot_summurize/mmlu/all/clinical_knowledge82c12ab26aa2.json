Central pain stimuli refer to those that directly stimulate the central nervous system, typically involving structures like the brain or spinal cord. The other options ( supra-orbital ridge pressure, pressure on the little finger pulp, and trapezius squeeze, all involve peripheral stimuli which can lead to pain signals being sent to the central nervous system."
