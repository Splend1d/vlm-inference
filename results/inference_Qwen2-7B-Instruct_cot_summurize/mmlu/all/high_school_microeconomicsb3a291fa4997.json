The ratio of income inequality to income equality in different countries.\n\nThe Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of income or wealth distribution within a population. It plots the cumulative percentage of the population on the horizontal axis against the cumulative percentage of income or wealth on the vertical axis. A perfectly equal distribution would be represented by a straight line (the line of perfect equality), while more unequal distributions would curve below this line. The further the curve is from the line of perfect equality, the greater the income or wealth inequality."
