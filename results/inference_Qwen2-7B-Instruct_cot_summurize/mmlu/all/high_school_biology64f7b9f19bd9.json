Their offspring will all inherit two B alleles and will all have brown fur.\n- B. BB Bb: One parent has two dominant B alleles for brown fur, and the other parent carries one dominant B allele and one recessive b allele for silver fur. Their offspring will all have at least one dominant B allele and will thus all have brown fur.\n- C. Bb bB: Both parents carry one dominant B allele and one recessive b allele for silver fur. When they mate, there is a 50% chance that their offspring will inherit the bb combination, resulting in silver fur.\n- D. Bb bb: One parent has one dominant B allele and one recessive b allele for silver fur, and the other parent carries two recessive b alleles for silver fur. Their offspring will all inherit at least one recessive b allele and will thus all have silver fur.\n\nTherefore, the only set of genotypes that could produce offspring with silver fur from parents that both have brown fur is C. Bb bB."
