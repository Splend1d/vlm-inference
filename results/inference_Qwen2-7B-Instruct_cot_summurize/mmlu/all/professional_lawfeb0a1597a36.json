The standard for overturning a jury's decision is quite high and typically involves showing that the error was \"plain\" and \"harmful,\" meaning it likely affected the outcome of the trial. In this case, the fact that the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson does not necessarily mean there was a legal inconsistency or error that warrants setting aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge. Each charge can have its own elements and evidence that may be sufficient for one charge but not for another, even if they are related crimes. The court would consider whether the jury could reasonably have found the defendant guilty of felony murder based on the evidence presented without needing to find guilt on the arson charge. Without more specific information about the circumstances and evidence of the case, it's difficult to definitively say why the motion would be denied, but in general, such motions would be denied unless there is clear evidence of legal error affecting the defendant's substantial rights."
