Granite, gabbro, diorite, quartz, feldspar: These are not all minerals; granite, gabbro, and diorite are rocks.\n- B. Gold, quartz, topaz, diamond, corundum: All are are minerals.\n- C. Gneiss, schist, phyllite, chlorite, mica: These are not all minerals; gneiss, schist, phyllite, chlorite, and mica are all metamorphic rocks.\n- D. Coal, chert, limestone, dolomite, halite: These are not all minerals; coal is a fossil fuel, chert is a sedimentary rock, and limestone and dolomite are sedimentary rocks made of calcium carbonate. Halite (is a mineral, but the presence of non-mineral items makes this an incorrect choice.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct because it contains only minerals."
