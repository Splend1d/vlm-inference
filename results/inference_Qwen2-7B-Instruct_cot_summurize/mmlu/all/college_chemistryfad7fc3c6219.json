                    "text": "The answer is C. Sc3+. \n\nAs we move from left to right across a period in the periodic table, the atomic radius generally decreases due to the increasing nuclear charge attracting electrons more strongly. However, as we move down a group, the atomic radius increases because of the addition of electron shells.\n\nSc3+ is a trivalent ion of scandium (Sc, which is located in the 3rd period and the 3rd group of the periodic table. When Sc loses three electrons to form the Sc3+ ion, it loses its outermost electrons first, leaving behind a smaller nucleus with a higher effective nuclear charge that attracts the remaining electrons more strongly. As a result, the radius of the Sc3+ ion is smaller than that of the neutral Sc atom.\n\nComparing the other options:\n\n- A. K+ is a monovalalent potassium ion. Potassium is located in the same group as Sc but further down the periodic table. As a result, the atomic radius of K+ would be larger than that of Sc3+.\n  \n- B. Ca2+ is a divalent calcium ion. Calcium is also in the same group as Sc but further down the periodic table. Therefore, the atomic radius of Ca2+ would also be larger than that of Sc3+.\n\n- D. Rb+ is a monovalalent rubidium ion. Rubidium is located in the same group as Sc but further down the periodic table. Thus, the atomic radius of Rb+ would be larger than that of Sc3+.\n\nIn summary, the Sc3+ ion has the smallest radius among the given ions."
