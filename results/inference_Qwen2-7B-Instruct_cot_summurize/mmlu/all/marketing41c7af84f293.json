Durable goods**.\n\nDurable goods are are products that are expected to last for more than one year. They are typically large, expensive, and purchased with significant consideration given to factors such as quality, durability, and cost. Examples include cars, appliances, furniture, and electronics. These goods often involve a higher level of risk because they are significant investments, and consumers want to ensure they are making a good choice given the expense involved. Additionally, durable goods are often purchased infrequently due to their cost and the need for them to meet long-term needs or desires."
