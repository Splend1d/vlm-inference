He thought that these virtues could be improved upon and refined over time, making them open-ended and subject to revision. This view also allowed for the possibility of cultural differences in what is considered virtuous behavior, but it did not limit the applicability of the concept of virtue to Aristotle himself or to his specific culture alone."
