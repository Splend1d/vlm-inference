Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, not telling someone their house is on fire is considered morally wrong because it disregards the safety and well-being of another person. In this case, there is an omission of information that could potentially cause harm or danger to the other person.\n\nIn scenario 2, aiming a baseball directly at your dog's head while playing catch can be seen as morally wrong because it involves intentional harm towards an animal, which is generally considered unethical and cruel. However, if the ball happened to hit the dog accidentally, it might not be considered morally wrong, but rather unfortunate and possibly negligent depending on the circumstances. The intent to harm the dog is what makes the action morally questionable in this context."
