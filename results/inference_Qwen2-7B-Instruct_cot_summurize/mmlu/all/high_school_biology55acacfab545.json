This creates a concentration gradient, or electrochemical gradient, with a higher concentration of protons on one side of the membrane (the intermembrane space. When these protons flow back into the matrix through the enzyme ATP synthase, which is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, the energy released from this flow drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi)."
