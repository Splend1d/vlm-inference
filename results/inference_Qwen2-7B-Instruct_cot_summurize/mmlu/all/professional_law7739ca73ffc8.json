After the property was sold at sheriff's sale for $50,000, the bank sent the consumer due notice of a deficiency still owing of $10,000. The original note, however, had limited bank's recourse to $50,000 or higher. There was no response and the bank entered a deficiency judgment for $10,000. When it started execution proceedings to collect the $10,000, the defendants entered a defense, arguing that the bank was limited to recourse of $50,000 or higher. The judgment for $10,000 was therefore void and unenforceable. Will the court allow enforcement of the deficiency judgment for $10,000?\n\nA. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because the limitation in the original note is voidable, due to the mortgagors' breach of the mortgage terms.\nB. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because advance notice to the mortgagors is all that is required to disregard a limitation in an original note.\nC. No, the court will preclude the entrance of the deficiency judgment because the limitation clause is still enforceable and is supported by public policy generally against deficiency judgments.\nD. No, the judgment will not be enforced because deficiency judgments have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n"

However, based on the typical legal principles, the most likely answer is:\n\nC. No, the court will preclude the entrance of the deficiency judgment because the limitation clause is still enforceable and is supported by public policy generally against deficiency judgments.\n\nIn many states, mortgage contracts include clauses limiting the lender's right to pursue additional amounts owed beyond the sale price of the property after foreclosure. These clauses are often upheld as a matter of public policy, balancing the interests of lenders and borrowers. Public policy may favor such clauses to prevent lenders from overreaching in collecting amounts owed, potentially through excessive deficiency judgments. Therefore, unless there is a specific provision in the law or case law within that jurisdiction that contradicts this general principle, the court is likely to uphold the limitation clause and prevent enforcement of the deficiency judgment for more than the amount allowed by the contract.\n\nIt's important to note that this answer is based on typical legal principles and practices and does not constitute legal advice. The actual outcome would depend on the specific laws, case precedents, and contractual details applicable in the jurisdiction where the foreclosure occurred."
