When the big fish swallows the small fish, the total mass of the system (big fish + small fish) increases, even though the velocity might remain approximately constant if we consider the small fish to be at rest before being swallowed. Thus, the momentum of the system increases. However, without knowing the exact velocities or masses involved, we cannot definitively state whether the speed changed as well. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the information given is that there's a change in momentum."
