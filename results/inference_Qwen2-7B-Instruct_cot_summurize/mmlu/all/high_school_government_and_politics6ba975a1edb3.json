The Supreme Court in several landmark cases has ruled that the death penalty can be constitutional under certain conditions. For example, in Furman v. Georgia ( (1972) and its aftermath, the Court struck down several state's death penalty laws as unconstitutional because they were applied in an arbitrary and capricious manner. However, in later decisions like Gregg v. Georgia ( (1976), the Court upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment when it was applied consistently with procedural safeguards that ensured fairness. The Court has since reaffirmed this position in subsequent cases."
