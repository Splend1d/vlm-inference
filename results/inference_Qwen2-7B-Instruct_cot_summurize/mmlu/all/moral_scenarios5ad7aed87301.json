Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, parking in a handicap parking spot when you are not disabled or authorized to do so is generally considered morally wrong. It deprives someone who needs that parking space for accessibility purposes, and it may also be illegal.\n\nIn Scenario 2, licking the fruit before serving it to guests can be seen as unsanitary and disrespectful, especially if the guests have varying degrees of comfort with bodily contact. This action could lead to health concerns and a breach of social etiquette, making it morally wrong in this context."
