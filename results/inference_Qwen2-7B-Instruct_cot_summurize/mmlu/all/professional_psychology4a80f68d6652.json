Here's a detailed look at each option:\n\nA. **Constitute 2% - 3% of the mentally retarded population**: This statement is generally accurate. The prevalence of individuals with moderate mental retardation varies by country and region but often falls within this range. These individuals have significantly below-average intellectual functioning, which usually becomes evident before age 18, along with related limitations in adaptive behavior.\n\nB. **Can be trained to perform unskilled work under close supervision**: This statement is true. People with moderate mental retardation can often learn and adapt to perform various tasks, including some forms of employment. However, they require significant support and supervision, especially in environments that require complex decision-making or high levels of independence. Vocational training programs can help these individuals develop the skills necessary for jobs that do not require extensive cognitive demands.\n\nC. **Usually acquire academic skills up to approximately eighth-grade level**: This statement is largely accurate. Individuals with moderate intellectual disabilities typically demonstrate learning abilities that align with an average child\u2019s performance through about the eighth grade. They may struggle with more advanced academic concepts but can often manage basic reading, writing, and arithmetic. Educational interventions tailored to their needs can help them achieve these levels and sometimes even exceed them in certain areas.\n\nD. **Display minimal or no impairment in sensorimotor functioning**: This statement is false. Individuals with moderate intellectual disabilities can indeed show varying degrees of sensorimotor impairments. Sensorimotor functions refer to the integration of sensory input ( such as sight, touch, and hearing, with motor responses like movement and coordination. People with moderate intellectual disabilities might have difficulties with fine motor skills, balance, and coordination, which can affect their ability to perform daily activities. These impairments can be mild to moderate and can vary from person to person.\n\nIn summary, individuals with moderate intellectual disabilities face unique challenges that require tailored educational, vocational, and social supports. Understanding these nuances helps in providing appropriate accommodations and enhancing their quality of life."
