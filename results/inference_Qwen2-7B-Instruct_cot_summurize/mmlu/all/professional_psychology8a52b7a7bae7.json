In vivo exposure and response prevention\n\nIn vivo exposure and response prevention (also known as in vivo desensitization or simply exposure therapy) is considered one of the most effective treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and agoraphobia. It involves gradually exposing the patient to their fears or anxiety-provoking situations while preventing them from performing compulsive behaviors that they usually use to alleviate their anxiety. Over time, this process helps patients learn that their fears do not necessarily lead to bad outcomes and that they can manage their anxiety without resorting to compulsions.\n\nWhile other options like cognitive restructuring (A), systematic desensitization (B), and cue-controlled relaxation training  C) can also be used in conjunction with exposure therapy, it is often exposure and response prevention that forms the core of treatment for these disorders."
