Wrong, Not wrong\n\nApplying for a job at a bank when you have experience in passing fake bills is considered morally wrong because it involves dishonesty and potentially illegal activities, which undermine trust and integrity within the financial system and violate laws against counterfeiting currency.\n\nOn the other hand, training one's dog to shake hands with people is not morally wrong. It could be seen as a harmless and even endearing behavior that might bring joy or amusement to others. However, it's important to ensure that the dog's welfare is not compromised during training, and that it doesn't cause any harm or discomfort to people it interacts with."
