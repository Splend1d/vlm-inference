In accordance with the supplier's customary business practice, the sales agent then mailed the following confirmation letter, which he signed and dated:\"As per your telephone order, this letter serves to confirm the purchase of 36 dozen cashmere socks, color purple, size 10 \u0080\u009413, at the agreed price of $250 per dozen. Total sales price: $9,000. \"This letter was received by the man, who briefly glanced at it but failed to notice the \"36 dozen\" wording or the total price. The man placed the letter in his files and did not respond to it. Three weeks later, the supplier tendered 36 dozen purple cashmere socks, which the man rejected on the grounds that he had ordered only three dozen. The supplier resold the same purple cashmere socks to another buyer for a total price of $8,000. The supplier sued the man for the $1,000 difference. If the man pleads the statute of frauds as a defense, will such a defense be successful?\n\nA. Yes, because the statute was not satisfied by the supplier's tender of the goods, which were rejected by the man, and the supplier did not rely on the oral agreement other than by attempting delivery.\nB. Yes, because the agreed price for three dozen socks was over $500, and the supplier's written memo incorrectly stated the quantity of goods ordered.\nC. No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisf' the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt.\nD. No, because the supplier's written memo operated as an acceptance, with proposals for additional terms that became part of the contract after the man failed to object to such additional terms within a reasonable time.\n"

No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisfy the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt.\n\nThe Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. This generally applies to contracts that cannot be performed within one year and involve a significant amount of money (typically over $500. In this scenario, the oral agreement for the purchase of goods valued at $9,000 would likely fall under the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. \n\nWhen the supplier sent the confirmation letter with the details of the order including the quantity of 36 dozen, the price, and the total sales price, this letter acted as a written confirmation of the agreement. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a written confirmation is considered a contract if it is sent within a reasonable time and includes all essential terms of the agreement, even if the terms are different from those originally discussed.\n\nIn this case, the man received the confirmation letter, which contained all the essential terms of the agreement. By failing to notice the discrepancies and rejecting the goods after they were delivered, the man did not provide timely notice of any objections to the terms of the written confirmation. Typically, under UCC Section 2-609(2)(b), a party must reject the goods and notify the other party of the rejection within a reasonable time after receiving them. The man's failure to do so within the required timeframe means he waived his right to object to the terms of the written confirmation, thus the statute of frauds would not serve as a successful defense for him."
