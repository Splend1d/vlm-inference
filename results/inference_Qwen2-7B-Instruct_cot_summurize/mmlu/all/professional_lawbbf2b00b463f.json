The landscaping firm was incorporated in New York and did all of its business in that state. The construction company was an LLC that had been filed in New York, with its members being domiciled in Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia. The landscaping firm filed a breach of contract claim in federal court in New York claiming diversity jurisdiction with an amount in dispute that was in excess of $100,000. The construction firm filed a motion to dismiss, claiming the landscaper-plaintiff did not have diversity jurisdiction. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, there is clearly no diversity in that the construction company LLC and the landscaper corporation were both registered and filed in New York, making them citizens of the same state.\nB. Yes, because diversity must be between natural citizens and business entities are not entitled to diversity but must find some other reason for federal jurisdiction.\nC. No, the motion to dismiss is premature and must wait until all discovery is completed before it will be considered.\nD. No, the plaintiff is a citizen of New York and the three members of the LLC are each from a different states, which gives complete diversity of citizenship.\n"

No, the plaintiff is a citizen of New York and the three members of the LLC are each from a different states, which gives complete diversity of citizenship.\n\nExplanation: In the context of federal courts, \"diversity jurisdiction\" refers to the power of a federal court to hear cases where the parties are from different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 ( Note that the threshold for amount in controversy has been mentioned as $100,000 in the question, but the actual federal threshold is $75,000. \n\nIn this case, although both the construction company and the landscaping firm are incorporated in New York, they are considered citizens of different states for the purposes of diversity jurisdiction. The construction company, being an LLC with members domiciled in Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia, brings about three separate states of citizenship. Therefore, even though both the parties are incorporated in the same state, their members come from different states, thus providing complete diversity of citizenship. Hence, the court would likely deny the motion to dismiss based on lack of diversity jurisdiction."
