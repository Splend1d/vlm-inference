The trial attorney failed to interview an alibi witness.\n\nThe most compelling ground for substantiatinging an ineffectiveness of counsel claim under the Sixth Amendment is if the attorney failed to take reasonable steps to investigate and present the defendant's case. In this scenario, failing to interview an alibi witness could be seen as a significant oversight, potentially impacting the outcome of the trial by not presenting all available evidence that could have been beneficial to the defendant's case. This directly violates the duty of the attorney to diligently prepare and defend their client, as required by the Sixth Amendment."
