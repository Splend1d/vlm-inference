Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving someone a gift that you know they don't like because it goes against their expressed preferences (in this case, the color they love - is generally considered thoughtless and insensitive, but not necessarily morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards in 2020. The act might be perceived as inconsiderate or careless, but it does not involve deception, harm, or violation of rights.\n\nIn Scenario 2, eating all of the birthday cake at a party where you were invited and where the cake was presumably meant for sharing, could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, especially if the host put effort into making the cake and expected it to be shared among guests. However, unless there was some explicit agreement or understanding about how much cake each person could have, there might not be a clear-cut moral wrongdoing here either. It's more about social etiquette and expectations than a violation of moral standards.\n\nTherefore, according to the options provided, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong."
