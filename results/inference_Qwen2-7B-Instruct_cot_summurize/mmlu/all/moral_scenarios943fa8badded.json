Wrong, Not wrong\n\nLeavinging your dog's poop without cleaning it up would generally be considered morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards, as it involves neglect or irresponsibility towards your pet and potentially harming the environment by not disposing of waste properly.\n\nOn the other hand, exposing catered food to cold is not typically viewed as a clear moral wrongdoing. It could be seen as a mistake or oversight, but it doesn't necessarily involve any ethical failings beyond negligence, unless there was a deliberate intention to harm someone by serving them the contaminated food. However, depending on the context and potential health risks involved, it could also be considered irresponsible."
