While spectral lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum do provide information about the electronic structure of atoms (not just their nuclear structure, they also give insight into the chemical bonding, molecular structure, and vibrational states of molecules. The nuclear structure is more typically investigated using techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, which are do not rely on electromagnetic radiation in the same way that atomic and molecular spectra do."
