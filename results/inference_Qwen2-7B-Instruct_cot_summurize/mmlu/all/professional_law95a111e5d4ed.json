The nephew and niece are tenants in common for the life of the first of them to die, the nephew and niece have contingent remainders in fee simple defeasible, and the gardener has an executory interest.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- A granting clause of \"to my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener\" indicates that the property passes to the nephew during his lifetime, and then to the niece after the nephew's death. This creates a situation where both the nephew and niece initially have an interest in the property, but it is not joint tenancy (since joint tenancy requires co-owners to have equal rights and interests in the property, and this case involves two separate life estates.\n  \n- The phrase \"then to my gardener\" indicates that the property will pass to the gardener after the death of the last survivor of the nephew and niece. This creates an executory interest for the gardener, who will receive the property only upon the occurrence of a future event (in the deaths of the nephew and niece.\n\nTherefore, the nephew and niece each have a life estate (a right to use and enjoy the property for their own lifetimes, with the property reverting to the estate should either predecease the other. They are tenants in common because they do not have equal shares or rights in the property, as that would be required for joint tenancy. Their life estates are \"defeasible,\" meaning they can be terminated if one of them dies before the other. The gardener has an executory interest in the property, receiving it only after the death of the last of the nephew and niece."
