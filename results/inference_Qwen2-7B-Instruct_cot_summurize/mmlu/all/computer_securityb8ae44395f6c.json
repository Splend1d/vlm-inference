This is achieved by including a MAC in each message, which the recipient verifies using the sender's public key.\n\n2. **An attacker impersonating the server.** TLS uses the server's digital certificate to authenticate the server's identity, ensuring that the client is communicating with the intended server rather than an attacker pretending to be it. The certificate is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), further enhancing this security.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. True, True**"
