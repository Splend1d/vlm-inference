Acetylcholine will not bind to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nExplanation: Enzymes play crucial roles in various biochemical processes, including neurotransmitter function. In the context of the synaptic cleft, enzymes help in the synthesis, storage, release, and degradation of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine. If a chemical agent denatures (i.e., causes the loss of structure and function - all enzymes in the synaptic cleft, it would impair their functions. Specifically, acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, would likely be affected. Without the proper breakdown of acetylcholine, its levels in the synaptic cleft could accumulate. However, the question focuses on the effect on acetylcholine's binding ability, which is primarily dependent on the integrity of the receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. The denaturation of enzymes does not directly affect the intrinsic properties of the postsynaptic receptors, so acetylcholine would still bind to these receptors if they remained intact. Thus, option B is the most accurate choice based on the information provided."
