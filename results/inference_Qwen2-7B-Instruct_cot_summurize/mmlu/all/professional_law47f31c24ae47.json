A buyer comes by, fully aware that it is the work of a famous Italian Renaissance artist, and quietly offers the $10 for an etching he knows to be worth at least $100,000. When the seller finds out that he made an awful mistake, and that the buyer knew that it was a precious work of art, he sued to get the $100,000 or for return of the etching. The buyer defended by alleging that the seller did not act reasonably to protect himself by knowing what he was selling. Under the Restatement of Contracts and the majority rule in the case law, will the court grant the buyer's motion to dismiss the seller's complaint?\n\nA. Yes, the seller should have had the items appraised before selling them. The seller always must know the value of what is being offered for sale.\nB. Yes, the seller cannot rescind a contract just because he later regrets it; either party may end up with the superior deal depending on luck, knowledge and variety of factors.\nC. No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there has been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.\nD. No, because a party always has a right to rescind a contract where the value of the product or services does not live up to his reasonable expectation.\n"

No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there has been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.\n\nUnder the principles of contract law, particularly when dealing with unilateral mistakes ( - situations where only one party was mistaken about a fact material to the contract - the courts generally do not allow rescission of the contract simply because one party wishes to benefit from the mistake. However, there are exceptions when the mistake was so significant that it was unconscionable or led to an extremely lopsided transaction, and especially when there is no substantial hardship to the other party.\n\nIn this scenario, if the buyer knew the etching was worth far more than the $10 it was priced at, and willingly bought it under those circumstances, it would likely be considered a case of unilateral mistake on the part of the seller. The seller's regret or realization of the mistake after the sale might not justify rescindinging the contract, unless it can be shown that the transaction was unconscionably unfair due to the significant disparity in perceived value, and there is no substantial hardship for the buyer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The seller would not be granted the motion to dismiss the buyer's defense, as long as the buyer's actions were not fraudulent or based on deception."
