Which statement follows from this correlation?\n\nA. If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.\nB. If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs.\nC. Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.\nD. 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\n"

This means that as self-efficacy increases, job satisfaction tends to increase as well, but the relationship is not very strong.\n\nFrom this information, the statement that follows correctly is:\n\nD. 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\n\nThis is because the square of the correlation coefficient ( \\(r^2\\) (is used to determine the proportion of variance in one variable that can be explained by another variable. In this case, \\(r = 0.30\\), so \\(r^2 = 0.30^2 = 0.09\\). Therefore, 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can indeed be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\n\nThe other statements are not necessarily supported by the given correlation value. Statement A suggests causality in one direction ( giving more control leading to higher job satisfaction, which is not directly supported by a correlation coefficient alone. Similarly, statement B reverses the direction of causality incorrectly. Statement C contradicts the nature of a positive correlation, suggesting that those who are more satisfied with their job are less confident in their ability to control their situation, which is not indicated by a positive correlation."
