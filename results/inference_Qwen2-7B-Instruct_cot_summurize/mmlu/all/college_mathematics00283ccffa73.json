This is because, for \\(p = 2\\), the norm satisfies the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as an equality, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be induced by an inner product.\n\nThe general form of a norm induced by an inner product (in finite dimensions) is given by:\n\\[\n\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle x, x \\rangle}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle\\) denotes the inner product.\n\nFor \\(p = 2\\), the norm is:\n\\[\n\\|x\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i|^2}\n\\]\nThis directly corresponds to the square root of the inner product of \\(x\\) with itself, satisfying the condition for being induced by an inner product.\n\nFor other values of \\(p\\), the norm does not satisfy the parallelogram law, which is a requirement for a norm to be induced by an inner product. Specifically:\n\n- For \\(p = 1\\) (\\(\\|x\\|_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i|\\)), there's no inner product that induces this norm.\n- For \\(p = \\infty\\) (\\(\\|x\\|_\\infty = \\max|x_i|\\)), similarly, there's no inner product inducing this norm.\n- For \\(p > 1\\) but not equal to 2, the norms do not satisfy the conditions to be induced by an inner product due to failing the parallelogram law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 2**."
