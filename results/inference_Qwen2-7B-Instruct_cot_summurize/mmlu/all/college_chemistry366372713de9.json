These metals often have unpaired electrons and include elements such as chromium (Cr, iron Fe, and titanium Ti. Zinc (Zn, on the other hand, typically forms complexes with an even number of electrons, making it diamagnetic and not capable of effectively quenching singlet oxygen through the same mechanism."
