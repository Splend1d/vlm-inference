Cross-links form by oxidation of -SH groups of cysteine to form disulphide bridges render the amino acid unavailable to digestion.\n\nDisulfide bridges, which are covalent bonds formed between two cysteine residues in a protein, can indeed make the protein more stable but also can affect its digestibility depending on the location of these bridges. However, it's important to note that not all proteins will have disulfide bridges, and their presence does not necessarily make the entire protein unavailable to digestion. Proteins with disulfide bridges might be more resistant to certain types of digestive enzymes, especially those that require reducing conditions to function properly.\n\nThe other options provided contain inaccuracies:\n\nA. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is its primary structure, not tertiary structure. Tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional shape of a protein, including interactions between different parts of the polypeptide chain.\n\nC. Cross-links between the \u03b5-amino group of lysine and the carboxyl group of glutamate do not typically occur in proteins. Instead, such interactions might refer to non-covalent interactions like electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonding.\n\nD. Not all proteins have the same secondary structure. Secondary structure refers to the local regularity in the conformation of a protein, which includes structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Different proteins can have different combinations of secondary structures based on their specific sequences and functions."
