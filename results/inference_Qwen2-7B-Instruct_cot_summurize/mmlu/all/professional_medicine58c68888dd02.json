The patient was at home at the time of the seizure. In the emergency department, she is given an additional 0.5 mg/kg dose of diazepam intravenously and the convulsion terminates. Within 2 minutes, her oxygen saturation drops to 75% and she appears cyanotic. Respirations are 10/min and shallow. She receives bag-valve-mask ventilation, followed by intubation and mechanical ventilation. Medical history is unremarkable. She takes no medications. Temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F). Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency?\n\nA. Airway occlusion\nB. Encephalitis\nC. Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive\nD. Meningitis\n"

Encephalitis**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Seizure Activity**: The patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that persisted despite the use of diazepam, which typically suggests a neurological issue. This seizure could be due to encephalitis or meningitis, both of which can lead to seizures.\n\n2. **Respiratory Distress Following Seizure**: After the seizure, the patient developed respiratory distress characterized by decreased oxygen saturation, cyanosis, and shallow breathing. This is indicative of respiratory failure, which can occur due to direct effects on the respiratory centers in the brain (as seen in encephalitis, or as a secondary effect due to other complications like fluid accumulation in the brain.\n\n3. **Medical History and Current Condition**: Since the patient's medical history is unremarkable, any sudden onset of symptoms like this, especially following a seizure, points towards a new, acute neurological condition such as encephalitis.\n\n4. **Temperature**: A high body temperature (39.1\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F) can be a sign of infection, which is consistent with encephalitis or meningitis.\n\n5. **Response to Treatment**: The fact that the patient responded to diazepam initially but then had respiratory distress suggests that the initial seizure was controlled by the medication, but another underlying issue (like inflammation from encephalitis - led to respiratory compromise.\n\nTherefore, considering the constellation of symptoms and the patient's response to treatment, encephalitis is the most plausible explanation for the patient's respiratory insufficiency. Further diagnostic tests would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
