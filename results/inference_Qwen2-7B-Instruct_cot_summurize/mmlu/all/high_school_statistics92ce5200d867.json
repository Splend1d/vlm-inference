This design can be described as\n\nA. a completely randomized design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments\nB. a matched-pairs design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine forming a pair\nC. a randomized block design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two blocks\nD. a randomized block design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments\n"

In this case, the two groups are randomly assigned based on the type of medicine they receive ( either the currently marketed medicine or the experimental medicine. \n\nB is incorrect because in a matched-pairs design, participants are grouped in pairs that are similar in some way before each member of the pair is randomly assigned to one of the treatments.\n\nC is incorrect because in a randomized block design, participants are first divided into blocks based on certain characteristics ( then within these blocks, they are randomly assigned to treatments. In your case, there's no mention of any specific grouping or blocking factor.\n\nD is also incorrect for the same reason as C. It incorrectly suggests that the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine are considered as 'blocks' rather than treatments in the context of the design."
