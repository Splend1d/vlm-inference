Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described can be evaluated based on ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Refraining from looking up a girl's blouse is not typically considered morally wrong. It shows respect for personal boundaries and modesty, which are are generally valued in US society.\n\nScenario 2: Painting one's dog a bright shade of purple might be considered unconventional or surprising by some, but it is not inherently morally wrong. The well-being of the animal should be the primary concern, and if the dog is healthy and happy, altering its appearance would not be morally problematic. However, depending on local laws and regulations, there could be specific circumstances where such an action might be restricted (for example, if it involves certain chemicals or dyes that are harmful to pets. In general, though, this scenario does not involve harm or ethical violations beyond societal norms."
