These sites are part of a broader archaeological sequence that marks the transition from the Chalcolithic ( to the Early Bronze Age cultures in Mesopotamia.\n\n- **Hassunan Culture**: This culture is known for its agricultural practices and is associated with the cultivation of cereals such as barley and wheat. The Hassunan people lived in the Tigris-Euphrates region during the 6th to 4th millennia BCE.\n\n- **Samarran Culture**: Building upon the Hassunan tradition, the Samarran culture expanded the complexity of agricultural societies, possibly including more advanced farming techniques and crop diversification. The Samarran period, dating from around 4th to 3rd millennia BCE, saw the development of larger settlements and the beginnings of urbanization.\n\nBoth cultures exhibit a significant shift from earlier hunter-gatherer societies to those based primarily on agriculture, which allowed for the support of larger populations and the emergence of social hierarchies. This agricultural foundation was crucial for the subsequent development of more complex societies and civilizations in Mesopotamia."
