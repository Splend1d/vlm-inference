The problem provides information about a circle with a circumference of \\(12\\pi\\) units.\n\nThe formula for the circumference (\\(C\\)) of a circle is:\n\\[C = 2\\pi r\\]\n\nGiven that the circumference is \\(12\\pi\\), we can set up the equation:\n\\[12\\pi = 2\\pi r\\]\n\nSolving for \\(r\\) (the radius of the circle:\n\\[r = \\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi} = 6\\]\n\nThus, the radius of the circle is 6 units. Since the sides of the square are the same length as the radius of this circle, each side of the square is also 6 units long.\n\nThe area (\\(A\\)) of a square is given by the formula:\n\\[A = s^2\\]\nwhere \\(s\\) is the length of a side of the square.\n\nSubstituting \\(s = 6\\) into the formula:\n\\[A = 6^2 = 36\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the square, in square units, is 36. \n\nThe correct answer is D. 36."
