This means initially, the title was divided into three parts: one part for each child (plus a life estate for the father.\n\n2. **Correction Deed**: The professor executed a \"correction deed\" changing the tenancy type from tenants in common to joint tenants with the right of survivorship. This deed also included the reservation of a life estate by the professor. When both children accept this new deed, the tenancy type changes, but the life estate remains reserved.\n\n3. **Son's Death**: Upon the son's death intestate ( (without a will), the doctor, as the son's sole heir, would inherit the son's share under state laws governing intestacy. \n\n4. **Joint Tenants with Survivorship Rights**: Since the son's share is now passed to the doctor, the title becomes held jointly between the daughter and the doctor. Joint tenancy with the right of survivorship means when one tenant dies, their share automatically passes to the surviving tenant(s) without going through probate.\n\n5. **Professor's Life Estate**: Despite the change in tenancy type and the death of the son, the professor still holds a life estate. This means he has the right to use and occupy the property until he dies, at which point his interest would pass to the daughter and the doctor according to the terms of the correction deed.\n\nTherefore, after all these events, the title to the apartment building is in the daughter and the doctor as joint tenants with survivorship rights, subject to the professor's life estate."
