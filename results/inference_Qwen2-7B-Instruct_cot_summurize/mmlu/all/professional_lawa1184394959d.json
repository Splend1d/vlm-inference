Convicted, because any death that is a natural and probable consequence of a felony is first degree murder.\n\nIn jurisdictions where the felony murder rule applies, a person can be convicted of first-degree murder if they commit a felony (in this case, robbery) and an unintended death occurs during the commission or attempted commission of that felony. The key factor here is that the death was a direct result of the felony, and there is no requirement to prove that the defendant intended to kill someone. \n\nThe fact that the gun discharged accidentally does not negate the application of the felony murder rule, as it is considered a foreseeable risk of committing a dangerous felony like robbery. Therefore, Max would likely be convicted of first-degree murder under this scenario."
