All males and no females will be affected.\n\nIn the case of mitochondrial diseases like MERRF, which are caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, the pattern of inheritance is maternally inherited. This means that the mitochondrial DNA comes only from the mother. Therefore, if an affected male with MERRF has children with a normal female, all of their daughters will inherit the mutated mitochondrial DNA from their mother and will thus be carriers of the disease but may or may not show symptoms depending on the severity of the mutation. \n\nHowever, their sons will not inherit any of their mitochondria from their father, so they will not receive the mutated mitochondrial DNA and will not have the disease. Instead, they can pass on their normal mitochondrial DNA to their children, who would then be unaffected, as they would receive healthy mitochondria from both parents."
