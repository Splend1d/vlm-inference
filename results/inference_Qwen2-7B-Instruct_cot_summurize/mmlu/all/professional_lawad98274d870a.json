After six months, the owner gave the woman a written option to purchase the condo for $100,000 before the expiration of the lease. With the owner's approval, the woman spent $10,000 to have the kitchen remodeled to her personal specifications. One month before the end of the lease, the owner notified the woman that he was revoking the option to purchase the condo. One week later, the woman delivered a written notice of acceptance of the option, but the owner refused to sell. If the woman initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is her strongest argument that an enforceable contract was formed between her and the owner?\n\nA. Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.\nB. Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.\nC. Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.\nD. After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.\n"

After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAn option contract is a type of contract where one party (the grantor, grants the other party (the grantee, the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a further agreement on specified terms within a certain time frame. The grantee typically pays a fee or \"option price\" for this privilege. In the context of real estate transactions, an option contract often allows a buyer to secure the right to purchase property at a set price within a specified period without committing to the sale immediately.\n\nIn this case, the owner's offer to sell the condo at $100,000 was for a period of six months before the end of the lease can be considered an option contract. By spending $10,000 to remodel the kitchen based on the expectation that she would have the right to buy the property at the specified price, the woman has demonstrated reliance on the offer. This reliance could be considered detrimental if the owner then decides to revoke the option, as it may have affected the woman's ability to make alternative arrangements or investments based on the expectation of purchasing the property.\n\nTherefore, under the principle of detrimental reliance, the woman's action in remodeling the kitchen can serve as evidence that a contract was formed when the owner revoked the option, potentially allowing her to seek legal remedies for breach of contract."
