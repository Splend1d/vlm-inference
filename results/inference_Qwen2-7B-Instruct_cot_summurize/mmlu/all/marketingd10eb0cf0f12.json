Price skimming\n\nPrice skimming is the most appropriate strategy for introducing a new and unique product to the market because it allows you to maximize profits by setting a high price initially while demand is high. This strategy capitalizes on the willingness of early adopters to pay a premium for novelty and exclusivity. As competitors enter the market or as the novelty wears off, you can then lower the price and attract more price-sensitive customers."
