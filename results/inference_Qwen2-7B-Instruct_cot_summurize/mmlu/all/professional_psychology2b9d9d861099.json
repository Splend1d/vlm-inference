Age is a bona fide occupational requirement.\n\nThis means that age is necessary for performing essential job functions, such as when safety regulations require certain age limits (for example, being an operator of heavy machinery or working with hazardous materials. In these cases, the employer must demonstrate that the age requirement is directly related to job performance and is not used as a pretext for discrimination.\n\nFor the other options:\n\nA. If employees in a given age group do not perform as well as some younger employees, this could potentially lead to age discrimination if it is not based on job-related factors. Age discrimination is illegal under many employment laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in the United States.\n\nC. Intelligence and personality tests should not be used to exclude candidates based on their potential for future performance unless they are job-related and consistent with business necessity. Predicting future job performance using psychological tests can be controversial and may not always be accurate or fair.\n\nD. Standardized test results showing that the incumbent does not have all the aptitudes expected for the particular job can justify excluding someone from consideration. However, these tests must also be job-related and not discriminatory.\n\nIt's important to note that employers should avoid asking about age during the initial stages of hiring and focus on qualifications, skills, and experiences that are relevant to the job. Any considerations of age must be based on legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons."
