The effect on the price is ambiguous because the price will adjust until the new equilibrium point is reached, which could result in a higher, lower, or unchanged price depending on how much demand and supply have increased. If demand increases more than supply, the price might rise; if supply increases more than demand, the price might fall; and if they increase equally, the price might remain the same."
