Post-structuralism provides no basis for political action, being a dangerous mix of faux radicalism, relativism and obscurantism, whilst constructivism is an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory.\nB. Constructivism offers a number of specific political theories applicable to Critical Security Studies but all of these lack the tenability required in security studies. Post-structuralist theories similarly lack the durability desired by CSS scholars.\nC. Post-structuralism and constructivism are ill-defined theories that are better described as political orientations, applicable in vague terms but lacking the substance required by scholars in contemporary security studies.\nD. Constructivism is too dangerous a mix of political ideologies, combining elements of radicalism and relativism. Post-structuralism is more of an orientation to world politics rather than a specific and applicable political theory.\n"

Post-structuralism provides no basis for political action, being a dangerous mix of faux radicalism, relativism and obscurantism, whilst constructivism is an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory.\n\nThis statement reflects a critique often leveled at both constructivism and post-structuralism within the context of Critical Security Studies ( (CSS). It suggests that while constructivism might offer some theoretical insights into the social construction of security issues, it may not provide concrete guidance for political action. Similarly, the statement argues that post-structuralism, with its emphasis on deconstruction and relativism, lacks a solid foundation for practical application in security studies due to its perceived obscurity and lack of clarity. This perspective views these theories more as philosophical orientations rather than comprehensive political theories capable of addressing the complexities and demands of contemporary security challenges."
