Start with total taxable income:\n   - Dividend income: $2,500\n   - Taxable interest income: $2,000\n   - Total taxable income: $4,500\n\n2. Subtract expenses allocable to income:\n   - Accounting fees: $500\n   - Trustee fees: $750\n   - Total expenses allocable to income: $1,250\n\n3. Calculate distributable net income:\n   - Distributable net income = Total taxable income - Total expenses allocable to income\n   - Distributable net income = $4,500 - $1,250\n   - Distributable net income = $3,250\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $3,250."
