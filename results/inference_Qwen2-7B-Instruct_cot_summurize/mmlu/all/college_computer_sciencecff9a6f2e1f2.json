However, this calculation does not take into account the processing time required for each packet. Since the CPU time required to execute the network protocol to send one packet is 10 milliseconds, we need to adjust our calculation to reflect the effective throughput.\n\nThe effective throughput will be limited by the slower of the two factors: the network bandwidth or the CPU processing time per packet. In this case, since the network can handle 1,000 packets per second without any additional constraints, the limiting factor is likely the CPU time required to process each packet. \n\nGiven that there are are 1,000 milliseconds in a second, and it takes 10 milliseconds to process one packet, you could theoretically process \\(1,000 \\div 10 = 100\\) packets per second. Since each packet is 1,000 bytes, the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another would be:\n\n\\[100 \\text{ packets/second} \\times 1,000 \\text{ bytes/packet} = 100,000 \\text{ bytes/second}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 100,000 bytes/ second."
