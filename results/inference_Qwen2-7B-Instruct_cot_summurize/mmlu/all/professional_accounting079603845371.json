Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on.\n\nSubstantial performance refers to situations where the party performing under a contract has substantially fulfilled their obligations, even if there are some minor defects or deviations from the exact terms of the contract. In option B, Leslie completed painting the entire room as requested, which is considered substantial performance despite the failure to put the electrical outlet covers back on. \n\nOptions A and D involve non-performance due to the delivery of incorrect items and performing the wrong task, respectively. Option C describes a scenario where the performance was not satisfactory according to the subjective judgment of the person who contracted the service, but it does not necessarily meet the criteria for substantial performance since the service was attempted."
