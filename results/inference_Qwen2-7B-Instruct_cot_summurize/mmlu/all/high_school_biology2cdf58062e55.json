All new alleles are the result of nucleotide variability.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- A is incorrect because not all phenotypic variation is solely due to genotypic variation. Environmental factors can also lead to phenotypic differences, even if the genotype remains constant.\n- B is incorrect because not all genetic variation leads to observable changes in phenotype. Some genetic variations may not affect the expression of traits and thus do not produce phenotypic variation.\n- C is incorrect because not all nucleotide variability results in neutral variation. Some nucleotide changes (mutations can be deleterious, beneficial, or have no effect on the organism's fitness or phenotype.\n- D is correct because new alleles are typically the result of nucleotide variability, which occurs when there is a change in the DNA sequence. This variability can lead to the creation of new alleles that might be selected for or against depending on their impact on the organism's survival and reproduction."
