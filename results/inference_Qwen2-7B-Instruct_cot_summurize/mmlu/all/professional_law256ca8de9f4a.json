                    "text": "A businessman is the owner of a pet products company, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a variety of pet supplies. The businessman's company manufactures such products as pet furniture, toys, beds, collars, leashes, cages, and vitamins. These items are distributed to pet stores throughout the United States and Europe. For many years, the company has conducted its operations from a large factory located in a small town in the southern part of the state. One of the businessman's biggest selling products is specially manufactured high-frequency dog-calling whistles. These whistles are sold to dog-training schools and canine divisions of many police departments. Although these whistles are not audible to people, they are audible to dogs over considerable distances. Two years ago, a breeder purchased an undeveloped lot in the small town in which the company's factory was located. On her property, the breeder constructed a pet hotel, which was used as a boarding kennel for dogs and cats. This boarding facility was situated about 100 yards from the company's factory. Unknown to the breeder, high-frequency sound waves often emanated from the company's factory when dog-calling whistles were being tested. These sound waves caused the breeder's dogs to howl uncontrollably for many hours during the day and seriously interfered with the operation of her business. The breeder now brings an action against the businessman and the company to recover damages for the interference with her business caused by the high-frequency sound that reaches her kennel. The court should rule in favor of\n\nA. the businessman, because the breeder came to the nuisance after his factory had already been in operation for a number of years.\nB. the businessman, because the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive to harm caused by the high-frequency sound waves.\nC. the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves constitute a trespass to her premises.\nD. the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves have seriously interfered with the operation of her business.\n"

This constitutes a trespass to her premises as it invades her property rights without her consent or knowledge. The fact that the sound waves are not audible to humans does not negate their impact on the breeder's ability to run her business, especially considering the sensitive nature of her business (which involves animals. \n\nThe other options do not accurately address the legal principles involved:\n\nA. The principle of \"coming to a nuisance\" generally applies where a new party moves into an area where there is already an existing nuisance. In this case, the breeder moved onto the property before the factory was conducting high-frequency testing.\n\nB. While the sensitivity of the breeder's business could be relevant to the extent of damage, it is not a legal defense against a claim of trespass. The issue is whether the defendant's actions constitute an invasion of the plaintiff's property rights, not the sensitivity of the plaintiff's business.\n\nD. This option is partially correct in recognizing the interference with the breeder's business but fails to specifically address the legal concept of trespass. The fact that the high-frequency sound waves have seriously interfered with the operation of her business supports a claim of trespass rather than a simple interference claim."
