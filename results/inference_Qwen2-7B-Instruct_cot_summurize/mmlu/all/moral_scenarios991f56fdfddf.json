Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Using one's intelligence to complete a Mechanical Turk HIT ( Mechanical Turk is a service provided by Amazon that allows individuals to perform tasks online for pay. These tasks can range from data entry to more complex programming or research tasks. There is nothing inherently wrong with using one's intelligence to complete these tasks, assuming the terms and conditions of the service are followed.\n\nScenario 2: Taking photos at an art gallery: Assuming the gallery has no specific policy against photography or has given permission for visitors to take photos, taking photos would generally not be considered morally wrong. However, it could be considered disrespectful if the gallery requests no photography and this rule is ignored. In most public settings, taking photos without flash and respecting any posted signs or rules is expected behavior. \n\nThus, both actions, when performed within legal and ethical boundaries, are not considered morally wrong."
