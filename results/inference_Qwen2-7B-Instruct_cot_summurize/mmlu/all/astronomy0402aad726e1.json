                    "text": "The correct answer is A. In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster, centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.\n\nDuring the formation of the solar system, the material that would eventually become the planets was initially dispersed in a protoplanetary disk around the young Sun. This disk was composed of dust, gas, and other particles. As the disk began to rotate, it started to flatten into a disk shape due to the conservation of angular momentum. The material in the equatorial plane of this disk tended to move outward due to the Coriolis effect ( caused by the rotation of the Sun and the solar system as a whole.\n\nAs a result of this outward movement of material, the inner regions of the disk (closer to the Sun where the rotation was slower, received a higher concentration of heavier materials. These heavier materials included metals and rock, which have greater density than the lighter gases like hydrogen and helium. Centrifugal forces, acting perpendicular to the plane of rotation, helped to separate these materials based on their mass and thus contributed to the formation of the inner, denser planets like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.\n\nThe outer region of the disk, where the rotation was faster, received a higher concentration of lighter gases, leading to the formation of the outer, gaseous giant planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, which are much less dense than the materials that formed terrestrial planets."
