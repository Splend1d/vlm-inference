Introducing private sector business principles into the public sector\n\nThe guiding principle behind New Public Management ( is to introduce management techniques and practices from the private sector into the public sector, with the aim of improving efficiency, effectiveness, and responsiveness in the delivery of public services. This approach emphasizes performance measurement, customer focus, and the use of market mechanisms to enhance service quality and value for money. It does not necessarily involve profit maximization, replacing public management with private sector management, or solely focus on restructuring public organizations, although these elements can be part of implementing NPM strategies."
