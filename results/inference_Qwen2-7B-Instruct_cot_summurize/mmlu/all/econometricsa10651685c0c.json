However, parameter estimates themselves are typically not considered to be inherently biased solely because the data is non-stationary when used in levels form. Bias in parameter estimates usually refers to systematic errors that occur if there's a flaw in the model specification, measurement error, or other modeling issues unrelated to the stationarity of the data. \n\nIn the context of time series analysis, if two non-stationary series are cointegrated ( meaning they share a common stochastic trend, then the regression coefficients can still be interpreted causally even though the series are non-stationary. In such cases, the parameter estimates might not be biased due to the cointegration relationship, but they can still suffer from issues like overfitting, high variance, or lack of robustness. \n\nSo, while parameter estimates might not be directly \"biased\" by the non-stationarity per se, they can indeed face challenges related to consistency, efficiency, and interpretability due to the underlying non-stationarity. Therefore, option D does not accurately describe a direct consequence of using non-stationary data in levels form."
