Vitamin D deficiency in the mother\n\nThis condition often occurs when a premature infant does not receive enough vitamin D, which is crucial for the proper development of bones. Premature infants have less developed lungs and kidneys, which can affect their ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight and efficiently convert it from its inactive form (calcidiol to its active form (calcitriol. Additionally, they may not get enough vitamin D through their diet or supplementation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while all of the options provided can contribute to the risk or manifestation of health issues in premature infants, option C specifically addresses the primary cause of rickets of prematurity related to vitamin D deficiency. The other options (hypocalcaemic convulsions, use of frusemide diuretic, and vitamin D deficiency in the mother can each independently impact the health of a premature infant, but they are not directly linked to rickets of prematurity as vitamin D deficiency is."
