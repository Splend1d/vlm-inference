Binocular cues come from the differences in perspective between our two eyes (like convergence, retinal disparity, and motion parallax. Monocular cues, which can be used by one eye alone, include texture gradient, relative size, and shading.\n\nThe other options listed do play roles in perception but they don't specifically pertain to depth perception:\n\nA. Proximity and similarity help us organize objects into groups based on how close they are appear or if they seem to belong together, but they don't directly help us perceive depth.\nB. Top-down processing refers to using high-level cognitive information to interpret sensory input, while bottom-up processing involves building perceptions from sensory data. While these processes influence all perception, they do not specifically relate to depth perception.\nD. Size and shape constancy refer to our ability to perceive objects as staying the same in size and shape despite changes in viewing conditions. They do not directly contribute to our ability to perceive depth."
