P or wage rate of labor > MRP of labor and with one additional unit of labor, wage rate < MRP.\n\nIn microeconomics, particularly in the context of production theory, the firm aims to maximize its profits. The profit-maximizing condition occurs when the Marginal Revenue Product (of labor ( (MRP) equals the wage rate ( (w). Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n\\[ w = MRP \\]\n\nThis condition implies that the last dollar earned from hiring an additional unit of labor ( (wage rate) should equal the last dollar earned from the output generated by that unit of labor ( (MRP).\n\nWhen the price of the product (P) or the wage rate of labor exceeds the MRP of labor, it indicates that the marginal revenue generated by hiring one more unit of labor is higher than the cost of hiring that unit. This situation suggests that the firm should continue to hire additional units of labor until the point where the wage rate equals the MRP. At this point, any further increase in labor would result in a decrease in profits because the cost of hiring the next unit of labor exceeds the revenue it generates.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly represents the condition under which the firm maximizes its profits by hiring labor up to the point where the wage rate is greater than the MRP, but with the next unit of labor, the wage rate becomes less than the MRP, indicating diminishing marginal returns and thus the optimal point has been reached."
