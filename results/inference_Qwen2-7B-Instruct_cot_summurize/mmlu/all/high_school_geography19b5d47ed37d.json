China lacks natural resources but has a massive labor force.\n\nChina does indeed have a large population, which historically provided a significant labor force for its industries. However, it also possesses considerable natural resources, including minerals, coal, and various metals. Yet, the availability of labor has been a key factor in China's industrial development.\n\nJapan, on the other hand, does not have a particularly rich natural resource base, which has driven its focus on technological innovation and efficient use of resources.\n\nTaiwan is known for its thriving industrial sector and a highly educated workforce, which makes it a major player in electronics and other high-tech industries.\n\nTherefore, option B accurately reflects a characteristic of China's industrial region."
