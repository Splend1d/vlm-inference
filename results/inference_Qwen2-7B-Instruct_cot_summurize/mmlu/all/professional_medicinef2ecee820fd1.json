Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\nA. collateral estoppel\nB. proximate cause\nC. res ipsa loquitur\nD. respondeat superior\n"

In medical malpractice cases, it can be used when the harm suffered by the patient is so unusual or extraordinary that it is presumed to be the result of negligence, unless the defendant (in this case, the healthcare provider) can prove otherwise. \n\nIn the given situation, since the patient's injury (the presence of a surgical sponge in her pelvis - occurred during a surgical procedure, it might be argued that such an event is so unlikely to happen without negligence that the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to show that they were not negligent."
