This disclosure alerts the users of the financial statements about the nature and impact of the non-compliance with GAAP. It does not necessarily mean issuing an adverse opinion, expressing no assurance, or limiting the use of the financial statements. Instead, it involves providing additional information to help users understand the financial position and performance presented in the statements more accurately."
