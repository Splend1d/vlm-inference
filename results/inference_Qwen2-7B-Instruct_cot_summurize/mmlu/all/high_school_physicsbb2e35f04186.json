Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?\n\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\nB. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\nC. No, because we don\u2019t know the mass of the cart.\nD. Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\n\nExplanation:\nTo determine the direction of the net force acting on an object, we need to consider Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum ( \\(F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}\\). The momentum of an object is given by \\(p = mv\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the object and \\(v\\) is its velocity.\n\nIn the scenario described:\n\n- At \\(t_1 = 0.10\\) s, the cart is moving east at 25 cm/s.\n- At \\(t_2 = 0.20\\) s, the cart is moving east at 15 cm/s.\n\nThis indicates that the cart has slowed down. However, without knowing the magnitude of any external forces (like friction or air resistance) acting on the cart, we cannot definitively conclude the direction of the net force. It could be that the net force is still directed eastward (if these opposing forces are balanced, or it could be directed westward if the opposing forces are stronger than the original eastward force.\n\nOption A incorrectly assumes that the slowing down implies the momentum change is in the opposite direction, which is not necessarily true without knowing the specifics of the forces involved. Option C mentions the mass of the cart, but the question does not provide enough information about the forces acting on the cart to determine the direction of the net force based solely on the change in velocity over time and the initial and final velocities. Option D also fails to account for the possibility that the net force could be in the opposite direction if the forces opposing motion (like friction or air resistance) are strong enough.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, as we do not have sufficient information about other forces acting on the cart to determine the direction of the net force."
