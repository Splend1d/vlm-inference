Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn scenario 1, building a \"man cave\" can be seen as indulging in one's own interests at the expense of shared spaces or responsibilities, potentially leading to neglect of family or communal needs. This might be considered morally wrong if it involves significant disregard for others' feelings or needs, especially if the actions lead to conflict or harm.\n\nIn scenario 2, handing your brother a toothbrush is a neutral act that doesn't inherently have any moral implications. It is a helpful and common action, unless there are underlying issues like hygiene concerns that were not mentioned. Therefore, this act would not be considered morally wrong.\n\nPlease note that morality can vary based on cultural, societal, and individual perspectives. However, under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020, these actions would typically be evaluated as described above."
