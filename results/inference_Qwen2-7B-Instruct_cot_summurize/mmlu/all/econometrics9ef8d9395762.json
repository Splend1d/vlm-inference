The necessary conditions for a series to be classified as a weakly stationary process include:\n\n1. **Constant Mean**: The expected value or mean of the series remains constant over time.\n2. **Constant Variance**: The variance of the series is constant across different time periods.\n3. **Autocovariances that Depend Only on Lag**: The covariance between two points in the series depends only on the distance (or lag) between the points, not on their actual positions in the series.\n\nGiven these definitions, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only**\n\nThis is because a weakly stationary process requires all three conditions to be met: a constant mean, a constant variance, and autocovariances that are constant for a given lag. A constant probability distribution is not a requirement for a process to be considered weakly stationary."
