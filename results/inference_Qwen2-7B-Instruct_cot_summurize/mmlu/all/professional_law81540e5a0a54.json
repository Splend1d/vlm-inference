Due to allegations of illegal activities in other massage parlors not affiliated with this owner, the city canceled the owner's personal license and revoked the business permits. The only information provided was a general notice from the city declaring a new policy on massage parlors that had to be rapidly instituted for the welfare of the community. She sued the city in federal court, claiming that her business had been taken without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment takings clause. She claimed a lack of procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court granted a motion to dismiss based on her not having a property interest that was affected, including in the license and permits. She appealed the decision. Will the federal Court of Appeals affirm the lower court dismissal of her case?\n\nA. Yes, because there is no right to earning a living under the substantive due process clause.\nB. Yes, because the state interest in protecting the public from illegal activities required the state action that was taken.\nC. No, because once the parlor had opened with all the proper permits, it could not be deprived of its licenses for any reason until they were up for renewal.\nD. No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process.\n"

No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe owner of the massage parlor has a property interest in her business license and operating permits, which were taken away by the city without providing the required procedural due process. Property interests, as recognized by the U.S. Constitution, include both rights created by legislation or governmental action and pre-existing rights that the government cannot abrogate without following due process. In this case, the owner claims that her business was taken without just compensation, which is a direct violation of the Fifth Amendment's takings clause. Furthermore, she argues that the revocation of her business permits and personal license violated the Fourteenth Amendment's procedural due process clause, as she did not receive adequate notice or an opportunity to be heard before the action was taken. Given these arguments, the federal Court of Appeals might find that the lower court's dismissal of the case was inappropriate, as the owner does have a claim regarding her property rights and procedural due process. Therefore, the correct answer is D, indicating that the Court of Appeals may reverse the lower court's decision if it finds merit in the owner's claims."
