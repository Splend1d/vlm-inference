There would be a shortage created of corn.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, the equilibrium price and quantity are determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves. When a price ceiling is set above the equilibrium price, it does not affect the market because the price ceiling is effectively ignored. The market would still operate at the equilibrium price where supply equals demand. However, if the question implies that the price ceiling is below the equilibrium price ( which seems to be a mistake based on your scenario but let's consider this hypothetical case for the sake of answering the question), then setting a price ceiling below the equilibrium would create a shortage because the quantity demanded at that lower price would exceed the quantity supplied. \n\nIn the scenario you've described, where the price ceiling is above the equilibrium price, there would be no change in the amount of corn demanded or supplied, meaning the market would continue to operate at its equilibrium level unaffected by the price ceiling. So, none of the options A, B, C, or D would be true under the correct interpretation of your question. It appears there might have been a misunderstanding in the formulation of the question."
