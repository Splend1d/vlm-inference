By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following is the best description of the plans being changed above?\n\nA.

Workers were threatening communist revolution.\n\nThe excerpt from Hermione Hobhouse's work suggests that there was a concern among those in power that unless the working-class received improvements and opportunities post-World War I, there could be a revolution akin to the one in Russia. This fear led to the implementation of Addison's Act to address these concerns through housing improvements. However, by 1920, this fear was diminishing, and the government began to reconsider its housing policies, leading to the deferral or reduction of housing schemes, such as the Kingfield Street scheme in Poplar."
