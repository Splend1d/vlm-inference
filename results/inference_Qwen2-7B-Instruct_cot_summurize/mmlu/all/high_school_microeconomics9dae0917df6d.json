When a price floor is imposed, it leads to a situation where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at that price level. This results in a surplus of the good in the market, as producers are willing to supply more than consumers are willing to buy at the artificially high price. The surplus persists as long as the price floor remains in effect, since it prevents the price from falling back to its equilibrium level where supply equals demand."
