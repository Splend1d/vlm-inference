If the demand curve is price elastic and the supply curve is price inelastic**.\n\nWhen an excise tax is imposed, it increases the price paid by consumers and decreases the price received by producers. The burden of the tax is shared between producers and consumers based on their respective price elasticities of demand and supply.\n\n- **Price Elasticity of Demand (**measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good.\n- **Price Elasticity of Supply** measures how much the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in its price.\n\nIn scenario A, with a price elastic demand curve and a price inelastic supply curve, the tax burden falls more heavily on consumers because the quantity demanded is very sensitive to price changes (consumers will significantly reduce their consumption in response to the higher price, thus absorbing a larger portion of the tax cost. Meanwhile, the quantity supplied is not as responsive to price changes, so producers do not see a significant decrease in sales and therefore bear less of the tax burden compared to consumers.\n\nIn other scenarios:\n- B involves a perfectly elastic supply, which means that producers can sell any amount at the given price, so they bear the full tax burden.\n- C involves a price inelastic demand, meaning consumers are less responsive to price changes, so they absorb more of the tax cost, but the question asks for the scenario where consumers pay the largest burden, which is not the case here since producers still bear some burden.\n- D involves a perfectly inelastic demand, which also means consumers will buy the same amount regardless of the price increase, leading them to bear the full tax burden, but this contradicts the question's focus on producers' burden.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A, as it correctly identifies the scenario where consumers pay the largest burden due to the combination of price elasticity of demand being high and price inelasticity of supply."
