The probabilities of all possible values of \\(X\\) must add up to one.\n\nThis follows from the axioms of probability, which state that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes in a sample space must equal 1. In the context of a discrete probability distribution, this means that if you sum the probabilities of all possible values that \\(X\\) can take, the total will be 1. \n\nLet's briefly address why the other options are not always true:\n\nA. The expected value of \\(X = np\\) is true specifically for a binomial distribution, where \\(n\\) is the number of trials and \\(p\\) is the probability of success on each trial. This formula does not apply to all discrete probability distributions.\n\nB. The sum of all possible values of \\(X\\) being equal to one is incorrect. In a probability distribution, it's the sum of the probabilities, not the sum of the values themselves, that equals one.\n\nD. The probability distribution being bell-shaped and symmetric is characteristic of a normal (or Gaussian) distribution, which is continuous. This description does not apply to all discrete probability distributions, which may not exhibit a bell shape or symmetry."
