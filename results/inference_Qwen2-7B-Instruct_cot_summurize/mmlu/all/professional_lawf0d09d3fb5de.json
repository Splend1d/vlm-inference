Upon the friend's death, the deed states that the land should revert to the woman or to her cousin and his heirs if the condition precedent (the sale of liquor on the land) has not been met.\n\nThe friend passed away before the condition could potentially trigger a transfer to the cousin, as no mention of liquor being sold on the land is provided. Therefore, the condition for the cousin to inherit the land does not come into play.\n\nThe friend died intestate, meaning without a will, so his estate would be distributed according to the laws of intestacy in the relevant jurisdiction. Typically, under intestacy laws, the estate would pass to the friend's closest relatives, such as his heirs ( usually including family members like children, parents, siblings, etc., depending on the jurisdiction's specific rules.\n\nSince there is no indication that the cousin's interest in the deed was triggered, and the friend's estate must be settled according to law, the proceeds from the harvest would most likely go to the friend's heirs under the applicable intestacy laws.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. The friend's heirs."
