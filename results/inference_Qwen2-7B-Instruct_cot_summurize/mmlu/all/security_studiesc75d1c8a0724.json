The statement emphasizes that mothers are not merely passive objects in society, but they play an active role in the military recruitment process. Military recruiters often target mothers due to their influence over family decisions, particularly when it comes to the enlistment of their children or spouses. This highlights how military organizations strategically engages with family dynamics to maintain and expand its forces.\n\nB. By focusing on the role of 'military moms', one can uncover the extent to which gendered strategies are employed in sustaining and recruiting for the military. This includes understanding how societal roles and expectations, particularly those related to gender, are leveraged by military institutions. It also involves recognizing how the concept of 'family' is used to garner support and loyalty within the military community.\n\nD. The importance of mothers to the exercise of military power cannot be overstated. They are integral to the logistical, emotional, and financial support that enables military personnel to carry out their duties effectively. However, this contribution is often overlooked in traditional security analyses that tend to focus on state actors and inter-state conflicts. Highlighting the role of 'military moms' brings attention to the non-military aspects of security and underscores the broader social and familial impacts of military operations."
