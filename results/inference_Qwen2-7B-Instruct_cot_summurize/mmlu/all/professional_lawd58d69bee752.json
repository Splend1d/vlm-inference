The loaves were to be delivered on the first day of each week, with payment to be made within four days of delivery. For the first four weeks, the bakery delivered loaves to the supermarket and the supermarket made the appropriate payments. When the fifth delivery arrived, the supermarket discovered that the shipment contained 80 whole wheat loaves and 20 sourdough loaves. The manager of the supermarket immediately called the bakery to complain about the shipment. The operator of the bakery apologized and offered to send 20 loaves of whole wheat bread within 24 hours. What is the probable legal effect of the operator's conversation with the manager with regard to the fifth shipment?\n\nA. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment and cancel their contract.\nB. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment, but would be held liable for the remaining deliveries.\nC. The supermarket would not be entitled to reject the operator's offer to \"cure. \"\nD. The supermarket would have a right to \"cover\" by purchasing substitute loaves of bread.\n"

The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment and potentially cancel their contract.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (Article 2 (Sales), if the goods delivered do not conform to the contract terms, the buyer has certain rights. In this scenario, the bakery did not deliver the exact number and type of loaves as specified in the contract. The supermarket manager's decision to reject the shipment due to non-conformity could be justified under the principles of breach of contract. \n\nThe manager could then potentially cancel the contract based on the bakery's failure to fulfill its obligations as stated in the contract. However, it's important to note that the specific legal effects can vary based on jurisdiction, the wording of the contract, and other factors. The manager might also seek compensation for damages incurred due to the breach of contract. \n\nOptions B, C, and D suggest actions or rights that might apply in different scenarios, but they don't directly address the situation described where the goods delivered do not match the agreed-upon terms."
