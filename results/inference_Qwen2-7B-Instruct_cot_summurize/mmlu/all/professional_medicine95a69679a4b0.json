Metabolism**.\n\nCarbamazepine is an enzyme inducer, particularly of cytochrome P450 enzymes ( mainly CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. This means that it can accelerate the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by these enzymes, potentially leading to lower blood levels of those drugs and possibly reduced therapeutic effect or loss of efficacy. Vitamin D metabolism is influenced by several enzymes, including those in the cytochrome P450 family. Therefore, if carbamazepine is inducing these enzymes, it could potentially affect the metabolism of vitamin D, affecting its bioavailability and absorption. This could be one reason why the physician recommends increasing the intake of vitamin D to ensure adequate levels despite potential changes in its metabolism due to carbamazepine use."
