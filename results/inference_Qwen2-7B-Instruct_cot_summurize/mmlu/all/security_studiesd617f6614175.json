Economic policies plays a crucial role in addressing poverty by influencing factors such as employment rates, income distribution, access to education and healthcare, infrastructure development, and overall economic growth. Policies aimed at stimulating the economy, promoting job creation, ensuring fair wages, and redistributing wealth can all contribute to reducing poverty levels. Additionally, aid programs designed to alleviate poverty often come with conditions tied to economic reforms and development, further illustrating the connection between economic policy and addressing humanitarian concerns like poverty."
