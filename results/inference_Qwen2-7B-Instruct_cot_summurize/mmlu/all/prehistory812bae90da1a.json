It provides an overview of wide areas, making it ideal for detecting landscape changes over time, such as deforestation, urban sprawl, or historical land use patterns. Other options might be useful in more specific contexts or for deeper subsurface analysis, but for large-scale land modifications, aerial photography offers a comprehensive and broad perspective."
