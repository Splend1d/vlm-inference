The multiplier effect amplifies the initial change in spending throughout the economy.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of the multiplier is reduced when there is inflation ( or a rise in the price level. This is because, as the price level rises, the real value of money decreases. When aggregate demand increases and leads to higher prices, consumers feel poorer due to the decrease in the purchasing power of their income. As a result, they tend to save more and spend less, which dampens the overall economic activity and reduces the multiplier effect. \n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C describe scenarios where the price level either remains constant or changes in a way that does not directly reduce the effectiveness of the multiplier effect."
