The prime minister's death triggered a civil war between rival factions within the country. To prevent U. S. involvement in this country's political crisis, Congress passed an appropriations bill prohibiting any funding for U. S. military operations in this foreign country. The appropriations bill was passed over a presidential veto. Thereafter, the President issued an executive order directing U. S. Navy and Army troops to the foreign country to restore order. Is this executive order constitutional?\n\nA. Yes, because the President, as commander- in-chief of the armed forces, has the power to authorize such military expeditions.\nB. Yes, because the President has inherent power to regulate foreign affairs as long as there is no formal declaration of war.\nC. No, because the President cannot usurp Congress's spending power by taking action that supersedes a congressional appropriations bill.\nD. No, because the executive order was neither authorized by federal statute nor ratified by the Senate.\n"

No, because the President cannot usurp Congress's spending power by taking action that supersedes a congressional appropriations bill.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe President's power as commander-in-chief does not extend to overriding congressional budget decisions through executive order. The Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse, which includes the authority to appropriate funds for the military and other government activities. When Congress passes an appropriations bill denying funding for specific military actions, it is exercising its constitutional authority. The President cannot circumvent this by issuing an executive order to deploy troops, especially when doing so would involve using military resources that have not been appropriated by Congress. This scenario highlights the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, where the President's role is to enforce laws, including those related to the budget, rather than to legislate or fund new policies unilaterally."
