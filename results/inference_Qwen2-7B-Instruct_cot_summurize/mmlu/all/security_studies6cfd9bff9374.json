Withdrawal of economic trade rights with the domestic market.\n\nThis option seems to be a bit confusing as it refers to the domestic market rather than an external market or country. Typically, when discussing economic tools for security policy, one would consider actions that involve interactions with other countries or markets, such as export controls, control of munitions and arm sales, and import restrictions. Withdrawing trade rights with the domestic market doesn't fit into the context of international security policy as it primarily focuses on internal trade regulations rather than strategic interactions with other nations."
