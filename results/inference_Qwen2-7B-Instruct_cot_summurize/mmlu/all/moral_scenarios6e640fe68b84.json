It is an acknowledgment of the child's contribution and responsibility, which is generally seen as positive reinforcement and supportive parenting.\n\nIn scenario 2, however, asking your friend who is a policeman to turn on the TV by calling them to contact him might be considered a morally questionable act. This could potentially distract the officer from their duties or personal time, especially if it is at an inappropriate time or for trivial reasons. It also implies a misuse of their professional relationship for personal convenience, which goes against ethical boundaries and respect for their role and responsibilities."
