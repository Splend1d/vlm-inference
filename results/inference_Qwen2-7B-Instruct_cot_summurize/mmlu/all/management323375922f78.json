Financial planning\n\nWhile financial planning is an important aspect of running any business, it is not typically considered a recognized form of business continuity planning. Business continuity planning (BCP) generally refers to strategies and plans designed to ensure the survival of an organization in the face of disruptive events. Common components of BCP include contingency planning, which deals with specific risks and how to recover from them; scenario planning, which involves developing strategies for various possible future situations; and building or infrastructure planning, which focuses on maintaining or securing physical assets. Financial planning, however, primarily focuses on managing cash flow, investments, and budgets to achieve long-term financial goals rather than addressing disruptions to business operations."
