This is known as the right to counsel. The court must appoint an attorney for a defendant who qualifies as indigent (meaning they cannot afford to pay for legal representation. Therefore, regardless of the potential sentence (whether it is more than six months or none at all, the court must appoint a lawyer for Defendant since he has been found to be indigent. \n\nSo, option A is correct. Options B, C, and D might apply under certain circumstances, but they do not negate the obligation of the court to appoint an attorney when a defendant is found to be indigent."
