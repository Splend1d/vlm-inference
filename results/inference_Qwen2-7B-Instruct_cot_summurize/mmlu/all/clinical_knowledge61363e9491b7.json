Pain management involves addressing physical symptoms, psychological impacts such as anxiety or depression that can be exacerbated by pain, and potential pharmacological interventions which include medications and other treatments like physical therapy or acupuncture. Additionally, regular reassessments are necessary to adjust the plan based on how the patient responds to treatment and any changes in their condition. Therefore, option C best encapsulates the comprehensive approach needed in pain management."
