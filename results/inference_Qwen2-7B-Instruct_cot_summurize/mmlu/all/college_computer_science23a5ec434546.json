                    "text": "In two's complement, an overflow occurs when the result of an addition cannot be represented within the allocated number of bits. This happens specifically when the carry into the most significant bit (MSB (is different from the carry out of the MSB.\n\nFor one's complement, overflow occurs when the sum of two positive numbers results in a negative number or vice versa. It happens when there is no carry into the MSB but there is a carry out of the MSB, or when there is a carry into the MSB but no carry out of the MSB.\n\nSign and magnitude representation has overflow if the sign bit changes during the operation, meaning the result has both a leading 1 (negative) and a leading 0 (positive).\n\nGiven the numbers `011000` and `011000`, both represent +24 in decimal. Adding these together should yield 48, which is still within the range for a six-bit number (-32 to 31). \n\n- **Two's Complement**: Since we're adding two positive numbers, there won't be any overflow because the result is still positive and fits within the 6-bit limit.\n  \n- **One's Complement**: The same logic applies; since it represents positive numbers in the same way as two's complement for non-negative numbers, there will be no overflow.\n\n- **Sign and Magnitude**: Again, both numbers are positive, so there would be no overflow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. All three representations**"
