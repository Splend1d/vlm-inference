The rate of blood lactate accumulation is determined by the difference between the rate of lactate appearance ( which is largely due to muscle lactate production during anaerobic glycolysis - and the rate of lactate clearance, which includes processes like lactate efflux from muscles back into the bloodstream and subsequent metabolism in the liver and other organs. When lactate production exceeds its clearance, lactate accumulates in the blood."
