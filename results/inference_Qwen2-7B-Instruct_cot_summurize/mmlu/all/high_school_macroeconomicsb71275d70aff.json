Decrease the money supply; increase taxes; reduce government spending.\n\nTo close an inflationary gap, which is a situation where the actual level of economic activity exceeds its potential level and leads to higher prices, policymakers aim to reduce aggregate demand. This can be achieved through contractionary fiscal policy (and/or monetary policy.\n\n- Decreasing the money supply by the central bank (such as the Federal Reserve in the US) reduces the amount of money available for lending and spending, thus decreasing aggregate demand.\n- Increasing taxes directly reduces the disposable income of consumers and businesses, thereby decreasing their spending capacity and aggregate demand.\n- Reducing government spending also decreases the overall demand in the economy since less money is being spent on public goods and services.\n\nBy implementing these measures, the economy's aggregate demand is brought closer to its potential output, helping to stabilize prices and close the inflationary gap."
