This means that in the long run, a firm can adjust all its inputs, including the scale of production. This could involve building new plants (increasing the number of workers, or even entering or exiting a market. The long run allows for full adjustment to changes in demand, meaning that the firm can change its size to match the level of demand.\n\n- **Short Run**: Some inputs are fixed, while others are variable. In the short run, at least one input must remain constant. For example, a factory might have a fixed number of machines but can hire more workers or work overtime to increase output. Changes in demand in the short run lead to adjustments in variable inputs, but the firm cannot immediately change its fixed inputs like the size of its plant or the number of machines it owns.\n\nThus, the correct understanding would be that in the **long run**, all inputs are variable, allowing firms to adjust their scale of operations fully in response to changes in demand. In contrast, in the **short run**, some inputs are fixed, which limits the firm's ability to adjust fully to changes in demand."
