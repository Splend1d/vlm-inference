This results in a trigonal planar structure where carbon has three electron domains (two sigma bonds and one lone pair. The presence of these three electron domains around the carbon atom leads to sp2 hybridization.\n\n2. **CO32-** - Carbon forms double bonds with one oxygen and single bonds with the other two oxygens. This structure results in a trigonal planar arrangement around the carbon atom, similar to CO2, with three electron domains (two sigma bonds and one lone pair, leading to sp2 hybridization.\n\n3. **NO2-** - Nitrogen forms a double bond with one oxygen and a single bond with another oxygen. The nitrogen atom also has one lone pair. This gives a total of four electron domains around the nitrogen atom (three bonding pairs and one lone pair, which corresponds to sp2 hybridization.\n\n4. **NO3-** - Nitrogen forms a triple bond with one oxygen and single bonds with the other two oxygens. This results in a trigonal planar structure around the nitrogen atom with three electron domains (two sigma bonds and one lone pair, which again corresponds to sp2 hybridization.\n\nTherefore, all the molecules listed (CO32-, NO2-, and NO3- exhibit sp2 hybridization around the central atom."
