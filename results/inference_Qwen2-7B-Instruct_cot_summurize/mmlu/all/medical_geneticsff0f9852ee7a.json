Males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. Therefore, for a male to exhibit an X-linked recessive trait, he must inherit the recessive allele from his mother since he only has one X chromosome. For a female to exhibit the same trait, she would need to inherit the recessive allele from both her mother and father, which is much less common because women typically carry a single copy of the normal allele on their second X chromosome.\n\nGiven that the frequency of males affected by this condition is 0.1 ( (or 10%), this directly corresponds to the proportion of males who inherited the recessive allele from their mothers. Since only females can pass on the recessive allele to their offspring, we can infer that the frequency of females carrying the recessive allele (and thus potentially expressing the condition, if they also receive it from their father, is also 0.1 or 10%. However, the question asks for the frequency of affected females, not just carriers. \n\nTo find the frequency of affected females, we need to consider that for a female to express the condition, she must receive the recessive allele from both parents. The frequency of males in the population is irrelevant to calculating the frequency of affected females, as the condition's presence in females depends solely on them inheriting the recessive allele twice. Given that the frequency of females being carriers (i.e., having at least one recessive allele is 0.1, and assuming a random mating population, the frequency of affected females would be half of the carrier frequency because only half of these carriers will express the phenotype due to the requirement for both alleles to be recessive. Thus, the frequency of affected females would be 0.1/2 = 0.05. However, none of the provided options directly matches this calculation. \n\nIt seems there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the question. If we're looking for the frequency of females that are carriers (not necessarily affected, given the options, then 0.01 would indeed represent the frequency of females being carriers based on the assumption that each female has a 1 in 10 chance of inheriting the recessive allele from her father ( and assuming a random mating scenario where the frequency of males affected reflects the frequency of recessive alleles in the population. This interpretation alignes with option A, considering the typical inheritance pattern and the given options. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the provided options and the typical genetic inheritance patterns, is:\n\nA. 0.01"
