This method does not reflect the actual interest expense or the changing carrying value of the bond over time as it would under the effective interest method.\n\nHere's how the amounts would be affected:\n\n**Bond Carrying Value:**\n- **Effect:** The bond's carrying value is understated.\n- **Explanation:** Under the straight-line method, more interest income is recognized than what would be recognized using the effective interest method. Since the interest income is overstated (due to the higher amortization amount), the bond's carrying value decreases less than it should, resulting in an understated carrying value.\n\n**Retained Earnings:**\n- **Effect:** Retained earnings are overstated.\n- **Explanation:** The company records higher net income each period because the interest income is overstated. This leads to an overstatement of retained earnings since the profit is not accurately reflected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Understated Overstated**\n\nThis reflects that the bond carrying value is understated and retained earnings are overstated due to the use of the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method for amortization."
