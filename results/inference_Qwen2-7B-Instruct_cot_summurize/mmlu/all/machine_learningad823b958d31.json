Typically, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used for this purpose due to its natural fit with the maximum likelihood estimation in GMMs. However, it's also possible to use gradient descent by directly optimizing the log-likelihood function of the GMM.\n\nStatement 2 is false. Learning a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier typically involves computing the mean and covariance for each class, which is an operation that scales at least quadratically with the number of attributes, assuming you need to compute these statistics for each dimension independently. Therefore, the claim of linear time complexity with respect to the number of records in the dataset is not generally true under standard assumptions about how the classifier is learned."
