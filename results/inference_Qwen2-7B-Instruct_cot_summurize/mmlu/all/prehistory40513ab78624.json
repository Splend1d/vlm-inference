A forest fire burned away the dense vegetation that concealed the cemetery.\n\nThe discovery of the Moche royal cemeteries was due to a natural event rather than any of the other options provided. In 1937, a large forest fire swept through the area near the Moche Valley in northern Peru, clearing away much of the vegetation that had previously obscured archaeological sites. This exposure allowed archaeologists and local people to notice and begin excavating the remains of the Moche civilization, including the royal cemeteries. The fire played a significant role in uncovering these important historical sites."
