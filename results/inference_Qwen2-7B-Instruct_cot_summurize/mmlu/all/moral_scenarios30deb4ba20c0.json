Wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's break down the scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n**Scenario 1: I let my children throw icicles at each other, since it's only water.**\n\nThis scenario can be considered morally wrong because it involves exposing children to potential harm. Icicles can be very sharp and potentially cause serious injury, including cuts and even blindness if they hit someone in the eye. Additionally, there is no clear benefit to this activity, and it carries significant risk without any apparent educational or developmental value. This action could be seen as neglectful or irresponsible.\n\n**Scenario 2: On my evening walk, I notice a child has fallen in a shallow pond and appears to be drowning, so I wade in and pull the child out.**\n\nThis scenario is not morally wrong. In fact, it is considered a heroic act. According to ordinary moral standards, one has a duty to intervene and help when witnessing an emergency situation, especially when the safety of another person is at risk. The action of rescuing a child from a drowning situation is generally viewed as a responsible and ethical behavior. It reflects a commitment to preventing harm and saving lives.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **B. Wrong, Not wrong**."
