                    "text": "Interferons are part of the body's innate immune system and play a crucial role in defending against viral infections. They operate through several key mechanisms:\n\nB. Binding to neighboring cells: Interferons do indeed bind to neighboring cells, but not directly to viruses. When a cell is infected with a virus, it produces interferons. These interferons then bind to receptors on the surface of nearby, uninfected cells. This binding triggers a series of events within the cell that inhibit viral replication.\n\nSpecifically, interferons activate a protein called STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription), which then enters the nucleus and influences the expression of hundreds of genes involved in antiviral defense. These genes produce proteins that can inhibit viral replication, block the assembly of new viral particles, or promote the destruction of infected cells.\n\nThe action of interferons is not just limited to inhibiting viral enzymes; they also help to create a general state of cellular resistance to subsequent viral infection. By activating these antiviral genes, interferons prepare the cell to better defend itself against future attacks.\n\nSo while option B accurately describes one of the primary actions of interferons, it is important to note that interferons do not directly bind to viruses themselves, nor do they produce a \"long-lasting state of resistance\" as an independent mechanism. The long-lasting state of resistance comes about as a result of the genes being activated, which can lead to a more robust and persistent antiviral response in the infected cell and surrounding cells."
