This concept is often used in sociology to describe how economic and social status changes from one generation to the next.\n\nThe correct answer is B. movement into different occupational categories between generations. \n\nThis means that the occupational status of parents (or previous generations) may differ significantly from that of their children or grandchildren. For example, if a family moves from a blue-collar job to a white-collar job, or vice versa, across multiple generations, this would be considered inter-generational mobility.\n\nOptions A, C, and D refer to specific aspects of mobility but do not capture the broader generational perspective that defines inter-generational mobility."
