According to the Central Limit Theorem, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, provided the sample size is sufficiently large. Typically, a sample size of 30 or more is considered large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply, although it can be less if the original population distribution is not too far from normal. In this case, with a sample size of 16, the distribution might not be perfectly normal but should approach normality given the large population size and the fact that the population has a mean and standard deviation.\n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution will be the same as the population mean, which is 210 mg/dL. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution, also known as the standard error, is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size. Thus, the standard error (SE = \u03c3/\u221an = 15/\u221a16 \u2248 3.75 mg/dL.\n\nTherefore, the sampling distribution of these sample means would be approximately normal with a mean of 210 mg/dL and a standard deviation (standard error) of approximately 3.75 mg/dL."
