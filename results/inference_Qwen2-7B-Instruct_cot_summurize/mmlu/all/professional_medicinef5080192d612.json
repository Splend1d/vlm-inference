Past medical history reveals cystic fibrosis. Examination of the knee reveals fluctuance on palpation of the joint but no increased warmth; mild restriction in range of motion due to the swelling is also noted. Numerous bruises are noted in various stages of resolution. Further history reveals easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month. The most likely explanation for these findings is\n\nA. acquired factor VIII deficiency\nB. diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection\nC. hypocomplementemia\nD. malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K\n"

                    "text": "The most likely explanation for these findings is:\n\nD. malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K\n\nCystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder affecting the lungs, pancreas, and other organs, often leads to malabsorption issues, especially of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K. These vitamins play crucial roles in various bodily functions, including blood clotting and maintaining healthy skin and bones. Malabsorption of vitamin K can lead to an insufficient supply of this vitamin, which is necessary for the proper function of several blood-clotting factors, such as factors II, VII, IX, and X. This can result in prolonged bleeding times and increased bruising, similar to what was observed in the patient. The presence of easy bruising and bleeding from the gums, along with the sudden onset of swelling and fluctuance in the knee without a history of trauma, suggests that vitamin K deficiency might be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The other options listed do not directly explain the combination of symptoms presented, especially the specific relationship to cystic fibrosis and the described clinical presentation."
