Birds can be found on islands located farther from the mainland than the birds' maximum nonstop flight distance.\n\nThis observation, known as the \"Galapagos finches\" phenomenon, led Darwin to conclude that species evolve over time through natural selection, adapting to their environments and giving rise to new species. The finches on the Galapagos Islands had evolved different beak shapes and sizes, which allowed them to exploit various food sources available on each island, illustrating the process of adaptation and speciation.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D are provide interesting biological facts, they do not specifically relate to the core concept of descent with modification, which is central to Darwin's theory of evolution."
