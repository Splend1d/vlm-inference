The pain is relieved with sitting up and leaning forward. There is no family history of heart disease. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows distant heart sounds. An ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. An x-ray of the chest shows normal findings. The most likely cause of his condition is injury to which of the following tissues?\n\nA. Aortic intima\nB. Esophageal sphincter\nC. Myocardium\nD. Pericardium\n"

Pericardium. \n\nThe patient's symptoms\u2014constant substernal chest pain exacerbated by coughing and inspiration, relieved by sitting up and leaning forward\u2014suggest pericarditis or pericardial effusion. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the double-layered sac that encases the heart. It can be caused by viral infections, autoimmune diseases, or other inflammatory conditions. The diffuse ST-segment elevation on the ECG is characteristic of pericardial involvement.\n\nThe normal findings on the chest X-ray do not exclude pericarditis as a diagnosis since it does not typically show specific signs of pericardial disease. However, it could suggest that there is no evidence of cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, or other findings that might be associated with pericarditis.\n\nIn contrast:\n- Injury to the aortic intima would more likely present with symptoms related to aortic dissection or aneurysm, not pericardial symptoms.\n- The esophageal sphincter is not directly related to the symptoms described.\n- Myocardium refers to the heart muscle itself, which would be more likely to cause symptoms related to myocardial infarction ( (heart attack) if the symptoms were related to ischemia or necrosis of heart tissue."
