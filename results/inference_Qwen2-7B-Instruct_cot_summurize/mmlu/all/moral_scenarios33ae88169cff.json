In fact, it is commendable and aligns with values of education, cultural appreciation, and recognizing significant contributions to society.\n\nScenario 2 involves someone longing for ice cream at midnight. This desire or craving is a personal preference and does not involve any actions that could be considered morally wrong. It is a natural human inclination that does not harm others or violate any moral standards."
