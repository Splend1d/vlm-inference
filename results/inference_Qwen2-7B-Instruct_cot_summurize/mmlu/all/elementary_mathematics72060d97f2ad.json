It means dividing the total number of months (\\(m\\)) by \\(4\\) to get \\(12\\), which is essentially asking \"how many times does \\(4\\) go into \\(m\\)\"? This alignes with finding the total number of months when you know the number of years and the months per year.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: \\(m \\div 4 = 12\\)."
