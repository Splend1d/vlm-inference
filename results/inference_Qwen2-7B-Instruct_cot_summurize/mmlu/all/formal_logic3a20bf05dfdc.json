(\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Cx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Py \u2022 Nyx)]\n\nExplanation:\n- Ax represents \"x is an animal\"\n- Cx represents \"x is cruel\"\n- Py represents \"y is a person\"\n- Nxy represents \"x neglects y\"\n\nThe sentence says that there exist some animals (Ax and some cruel people (Cx who neglect some person (Py). So, we need to find the animals (Ax) that are neglected by the cruel people (Cx, which means we need to find a person (y) who is both a person (Py and gets neglected by some animal Ax from the set of animals that are neglected by the cruel people.\n\nOption A correctly represents this relationship by stating that there exists an x (which is an animal and is neglected by someone (y), and also there exists a y (who is a person and is being neglected by some x (which is an animal)."
