Since each flip is independent and the coin has an equal chance of landing on either side, each individual flip has a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of being either True or False. To find the probability of the specific sequence occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each individual event happening in sequence:\n\n\\[P(\\text{TFTFT}) = P(T) \\times P(F) \\times P(T) \\times P(F) \\times P(T)\\]\n\nGiven each flip has a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), we have:\n\n\\[P(\\text{TFTFT}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT is \\(\\frac{1}{32}\\).\n\nThe correct answer is C. \\(\\frac{1}{32}\\)."
