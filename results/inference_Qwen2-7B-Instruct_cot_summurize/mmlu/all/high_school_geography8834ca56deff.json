Fourth\n\nIn the concentric zone model developed by Ernest Burgess, the fourth zone is characterized by low-income housing, slums, ethnic ghettos, and areas of general deterioration. This zone surrounds the central business district (CBD) and is typically where lower socioeconomic groups reside due to factors such as affordability and proximity to employment opportunities within the CBD. As you move outward from the CBD, the zones generally represent increasing distances from the city center with different socio-economic statuses."
