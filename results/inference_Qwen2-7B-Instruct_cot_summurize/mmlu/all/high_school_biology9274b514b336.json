In this case, the dorsal fins and tails in ichthyosaurs and fish share a common ancestral origin but serve similar functional roles (providing support and propulsion in water.\n\nAdaptations to a common environment refer to traits that help organisms survive and thrive in specific environments. Both ichthyosaurs and fish have developed these structures to enable them to live in aquatic environments effectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. B and C only. However, considering the nature of the question, it might be more precise to say A and C since \"convergent evolution\" refers to the independent development of similar features in species from different lineages, which isn't the case here since ichthyosaurs are not fish, they just share similarities due to their aquatic lifestyle, which is an adaptation to their environment."
