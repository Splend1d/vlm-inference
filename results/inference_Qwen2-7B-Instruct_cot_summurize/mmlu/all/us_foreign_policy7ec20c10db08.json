Its general anti-statism opposes centralized government\n\nAmerican exceptionalism often includes a strong belief in individual liberty and a skepticism towards centralized authority. This anti-statist philosophy can lead to resistance against the creation of a world government, which would involve significant centralization of power over international affairs. While opinions on world government may also be influenced by perceptions of its practicality (B) and the adequacy of existing institutions like the United Nations (C), the core issue for opponents of world government rooted in American exceptionalism is more likely to stem from their general skepticism towards centralized governance. Therefore, option A best captures this aspect of American exceptionalism."
