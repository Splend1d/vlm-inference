                    "text": "To address these statements, let's analyze each one separately:\n\n**Statement 1:** \"Every group of order 159 is cyclic.\"\n\nGiven that the order of the group \\(G\\) is \\(159\\), we can factorize this as \\(159 = 3 \\times 53\\). Since \\(159\\) is a product of two distinct prime numbers, by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, there exists an abelian group of order \\(159\\). Moreover, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists at least one Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup for each prime \\(p\\) dividing the order of \\(G\\). For our case, we have a Sylow \\(3\\)-subgroup and a Sylow \\(53\\)-subgroup. Both of these subgroups will be cyclic since the orders of these primes are less than \\(4\\), ensuring that they have cyclic groups of their respective orders ( due to the existence of primitive roots modulo \\(p\\) for primes \\(p > 2\\).\n\nThe key here is to show that \\(G\\) itself must be cyclic. Since \\(159 = 3 \\times 53\\) and both \\(3\\) and \\(53\\) are prime, we can apply the fact that if a group has a prime order, it is cyclic. Also, if \\(G\\) had an element of order \\(159\\), then \\(G\\) would indeed be cyclic. However, to prove this directly, we need to consider the structure of \\(G\\) in terms of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nGiven that \\(159 = 3 \\times 53\\), and assuming \\(G\\) does not have elements of order \\(159\\) ( (which would make \\(G\\) cyclic immediately), we can leverage the fact that any group of order \\(pq\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct primes with \\(p < q\\) and \\(p\\) does not divide \\(q-1\\), has a normal subgroup of order \\(q\\). This is because the number of Sylow \\(q\\)-subgroups divides \\(p\\) and is congruent to \\(1\\) mod \\(q\\), which in our case implies that there is exactly one Sylow \\(53\\)-subgroup, making it normal.\n\nSince both \\(3\\) and \\(53\\) are prime and \\(3\\) does not divide \\(53-1=52\\), \\(G\\) has a normal subgroup of order \\(53\\). Let's denote this subgroup as \\(H\\). If \\(H\\) has an element of order \\(53\\), then \\(H\\) is cyclic and generates a subgroup of \\(G\\). Given that \\(|G:H|=3\\) and \\(3\\) is prime, \\(G/H\\) is cyclic, meaning there exists an element \\(gH\\) in \\(G/H\\) of order \\(3\\). The preimage of \\(gH\\) under the quotient map \\(G \\rightarrow G/H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) of order \\(3 \\cdot 53 = 159\\), and since \\(H\\) is normal, this subgroup is also cyclic, generated by the preimage of \\(g\\).\n\nThus, **Statement 1** is true: every group of order \\(159\\) is cyclic.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\"\n\nGiven the order of \\(G\\) is \\(102 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 17\\), we again look at the prime factorization. A group of order \\(pq\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct primes with \\(p < q\\) and \\(p\\) does not divide \\(q-1\\) (has a normal subgroup of order \\(q\\). In our case, since \\(17\\) is prime and \\(2\\) does not divide \\(16\\), \\(G\\) has a normal subgroup of order \\(17\\).\n\nHowever, to address the statement more directly, let's consider the structure. Any group of order \\(pq\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct primes, has either a normal subgroup of order \\(p\\) or \\(q\\), depending on whether \\(p\\) divides \\(q-1\\). In our case, \\(2\\) does not divide \\(16\\), so there is guaranteed to be a normal subgroup of order \\(17\\). This subgroup is nontrivial (since \\(17\\) is prime) and proper (since its order is less than the order of \\(G\\)).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2** is also true: every group of order \\(1\\) has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. True, True**."
