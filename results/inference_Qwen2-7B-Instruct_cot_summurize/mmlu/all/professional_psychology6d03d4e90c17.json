Selection is how you choose people for the study and assignment is what group they go in.\n\nRandom selection refers to the process of choosing participants for a study from a larger population in such a way that each member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the study. This helps ensure that the sample is representative of the population, which reduces selection bias.\n\nRandom assignment, on the other hand, involves allocating participants to different groups ( (such as experimental and control groups) in a study. This is done randomly so that each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to any group. Random assignment helps to ensure that the groups are equivalent at the start of the experiment, thus reducing the potential for confounding variables.\n\nBoth methods are crucial in maintaining internal validity, ensuring that the results can be attributed to the experimental manipulation rather than other factors."
