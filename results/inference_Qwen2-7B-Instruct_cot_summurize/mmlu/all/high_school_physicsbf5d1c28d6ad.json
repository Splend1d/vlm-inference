The formulas for these quantities are:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{v^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\]\n\\[ H = \\frac{v^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{2g} \\]\n\nFor the range to be equal to the maximum height, we set \\( R = H \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} = \\frac{v^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{2g} \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation by cancelling out common terms (and considering \\( v \\) and \\( g \\) are non-zero):\n\n\\[ \\sin(2\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity \\( \\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\) (assuming \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[ 2\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\tan(\\theta) = 2 \\]\n\nSo, \n\n\\[ \\theta = \\tan^{-1}(2) \\]\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the question asks for the angle where the range equals the maximum height, not the angle directly related to the tangent of 2. In the context of projectile motion, the angle at which the range equals the maximum height is indeed when the projectile is launched at 45 degrees ( because at this angle, the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity are equal, leading to a symmetric trajectory where the time to reach the maximum height equals the time to cover the range horizontally. Therefore, the correct answer choice is:\n\nC. 45\u00b0"
