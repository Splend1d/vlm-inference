She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?\n\nA. No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.\nB. No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.\nC. Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.\nD. Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.\n"

No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.\n\nIn personal injury cases, especially those involving lost earning capacity, the evidence can often be speculative in nature. This is because it is inherently difficult to predict exactly what a person's earnings would have been if they were not injured. The jury must make a judgment call based on the best available information, which may include expert testimony about the potential future income of someone in the plaintiff's position.\n\nAppellate courts generally do not overturn jury awards simply because there is some degree of speculation involved. Instead, they look for instances where there has been clear error in the application of the law or a significant deviation from legal standards. In the case described, the jury was allowed to consider the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer, which is a relevant factor given the plaintiff's occupation and career aspirations before the accident. As long as the jury's decision was reasonable and within the bounds of the evidence presented, the appellate court is unlikely to reverse the verdict on this basis alone."
