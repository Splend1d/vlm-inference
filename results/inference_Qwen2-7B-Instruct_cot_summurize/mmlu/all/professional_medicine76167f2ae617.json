Hemopneumothorax, not under tension\n\nThis condition involves a combination of pneumothorax ( (air in the pleural space) and hemothorax ( (blood in the pleural space), typically resulting from trauma like a knife wound. The \"not under tension\" part implies that the pressure within the pleural cavity is not high enough to significantly compress the heart or other organs, unlike in a tension pneumothorax or hemothorax where there is a high-pressure build-up requiring immediate intervention. The symptoms described\u2014such as the air-fluid level, partial lung collapse, and elevation of the stomach bubble\u2014support this diagnosis. The mediastinum being in the midline suggests that the structures within the chest are not being pushed to one side by a high-pressure fluid collection."
