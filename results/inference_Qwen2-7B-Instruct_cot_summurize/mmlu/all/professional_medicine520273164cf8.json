She has a 2-year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5000/mm3 , and platelet count is 35,000/mm3 . A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. CT scan of the abdomen\nB. CT scan of the chest\nC. Bronchoscopy\nD. Bone marrow aspiration\n"

The low platelet count (35,000/mm3), along with the history of recent radiation therapy and the presence of multiple ecchymoses (bruising), suggests a possible bone marrow suppression or disorder affecting platelet production. Bone marrow aspiration can help determine if there is a problem within the bone marrow that might be causing the low platelet count.\n\nRadiation therapy can lead to bone marrow suppression, and the history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy may contribute to this issue. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor doesn't typically cause low platelet counts, but it's still relevant for managing her overall health.\n\nA CT scan of the abdomen (A, CT scan of the chest B, or bronchoscopy C could potentially provide useful information depending on the findings from the bone marrow aspiration, but they are are not the primary next steps in diagnosing a low platelet count without additional symptoms or signs suggesting a different underlying condition."
