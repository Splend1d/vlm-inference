According to the problem:\n\n- Every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before.\n- Every day, there are three times as many ants of Species B than before.\n\nGiven this, we can write:\n- On Day 1, Species A will have \\(2a\\) ants, and Species B will have \\(3b\\) ants.\n- On Day 2, Species A will have \\(4a\\) ants, and Species B will have \\(9b\\) ants.\n- ...\n- By Day 5, Species A will have \\(2^5a = 32a\\) ants, and Species B will have \\(3^5b = 243b\\) ants.\n\nWe know that on Day 0, the total number of ants is \\(a + b = 30\\), and on Day 5, the total number of ants is \\(32a + 243b = 3281\\).\n\nNow, let's solve this system of equations to find \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\n1) \\(a + b = 30\\)\n\n2) \\(32a + 243b = 3281\\)\n\nFrom equation 1), we can express \\(b\\) as \\(b = 30 - a\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(b\\) into equation 2) gives us:\n\n\\[32a + 243(30 - a) = 3281\\]\n\nExpanding and simplify:\n\n\\[32a + 7290 - 243a = 3281\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[-211a = 3281 - 7290\\]\n\n\\[-211a = -4009\\]\n\nDivide by \\(-211\\):\n\n\\[a = \\frac{-4009}{-211} = 19\\]\n\nSo, there are 19 ants of Species A on Day 0.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many ants of Species A there are on Day 5:\n\n\\[32a = 32 \\times 19 = 608\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is 608, which corresponds to answer choice D."
