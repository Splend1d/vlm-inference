His absolutist position, which he developed in response to the perceived relativism in legal discourse, emphasizes the importance of certain fundamental principles that must be upheld under all circumstances. \n\nNagel argues that the core of the absolutist position is not simply any one of the options provided (A, B, C, or D. Instead, it involves a commitment to uphold the rights and dignity of individuals, particularly in situations where these might be threatened by the state's actions. This commitment is rooted in the belief that certain principles, such as the right to life, are inviolable and cannot be overridden by the state or by any other considerations.\n\nThus, while none of the options provided directly captures Nagel's absolutist position, option A (\"human persons have a right to life\") is most closely aligned with the central tenet of his view. However, it is important to note that Nagel's absolutism goes beyond this single principle and involves a broader defense of individual rights and liberties against state overreach. It is not about endorsing the means ( (C), justifying the ends ( (C), or directing hostility at its true object (D), but rather about asserting the inviolability of certain fundamental rights and the duty of the state to respect them."
