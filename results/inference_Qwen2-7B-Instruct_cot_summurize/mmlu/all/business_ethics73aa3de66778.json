Post-modern ethics indeed emphasize that ethical norms and values are not universal but are relative to specific contexts and individuals. This implies that there is no single set of moral rules that apply to everyone in all situations; instead, individuals must develop their own ethical compass based on their personal experiences, cultural background, and the circumstances they find themselves in.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. 1,2,3\n\nThis implies that the statement supports the idea that ethics are context-specific ( (1), individual-specific (2), and that individuals have an internal guide to ethics (3)."
