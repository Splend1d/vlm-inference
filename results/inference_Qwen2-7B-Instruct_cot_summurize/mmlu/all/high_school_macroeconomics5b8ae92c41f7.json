This increased demand for the domestic currency leads to its appreciation. An appreciation of the currency makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, leading to a decrease in net exports. Since net exports become smaller, the overall effect on GDP is amplified compared to a closed economy like Economy Y, where there is no trade with other economies, and thus no impact on net exports from changes in the exchange rate. Therefore, the same expansionary monetary policy is more effective at stimulating GDP growth in Economy X because it boosts consumption through lower interest rates and increases investment by attracting foreign capital, both of which have a larger multiplier effect in an open economy."
