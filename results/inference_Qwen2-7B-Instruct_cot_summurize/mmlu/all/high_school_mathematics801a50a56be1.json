Given that he divided these pins into two equal piles, each pile would have \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) pins.\n\nHe then gave away \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}\\) of one pile to his brother. Since this fraction comes from only half of his total pins (because he split them into two equal piles, and then took \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of one of those halves, it means he gave away \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the amount given away is \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{x}{12}\\).\n\nGiven that John had 66 pins left after giving some away, we can write:\n\n\\[x - \\frac{x}{12} = 66\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{11x}{12} = 66\\]\n\n\\[11x = 66 \\times 12\\]\n\n\\[11x = 792\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{792}{11}\\]\n\n\\[x = 72\\]\n\nTherefore, John originally had 72 pins, which corresponds to option B."
