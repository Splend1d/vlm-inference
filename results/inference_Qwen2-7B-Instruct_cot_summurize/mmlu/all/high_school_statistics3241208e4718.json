The new mean would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Original Sum of all values} + 40}{\\text{Number of values}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{New Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Original Sum of all values}}{10} + \\frac{40}{10} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{New Mean} = \\text{Original Mean} + 4 \\]\n\nThus, the mean increases by 4 points."
