This amount was the fair market value of the work to be performed. The landscaper performed the work for four months but was then offered another job for $500 per month and, after notifying the homeowner, stopped doing the promised work and took the other job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything. The homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper to complete the work for $300 per month. In a lawsuit between the landscaper and the homeowner, what is the likely result?\n\nA. The homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.\nB. The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.\nC. The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.\nD. Neither the landscaper nor the homeowner will recover, because neither has suffered any loss.\n"

The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.\n\nIn this scenario, the landscaper had an agreement with the homeowner for a total fee of $300 per month for six months, totaling $1,800. The landscaper worked for four months, thus completing 4/6 = 2/3 of the contracted work. \n\nThe fair market value for the work done by the landscaper is therefore 2/3 * $1,800 = $1,200. \n\nSince the landscaper breached the contract by stopping work prematurely without justification (after giving notice as per the contract terms), the homeowner is obligated to pay for the work completed. Hence, the likely result is that the landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach. \n\nOptions A and B do not accurately reflect the payment for work completed, and option D is incorrect because the landscaper did provide services and is entitled to compensation for those services."
