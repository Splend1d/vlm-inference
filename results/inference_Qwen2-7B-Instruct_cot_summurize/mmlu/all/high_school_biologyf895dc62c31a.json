Their offspring have less genetic variation than the parents.\n\nExplanation:\nMules are sterile hybrids between a donkey (Equus asinus) and a horse (Equus ferus caballus. Since they can't reproduce sexually, they don't produce offspring through meiosis. Therefore, they do not contribute to genetic variation in their species, but rather combine existing genetic material from two different species. This means their offspring will have less genetic variation compared to the original species because there's no recombination or mixing of genetic material during meiosis. \n\nA. They have a relative evolutionary fitness of zero is not necessarily true. While they cannot contribute to evolution via sexual reproduction, they can still influence evolution through non-genetic means like natural selection or by influencing the environment around them.\n\nC. Mutations cannot occur in their genomes is false. Mutations can occur in any organism's genome, including mules, though their contribution to the population's genetic diversity is limited since they cannot reproduce sexually.\n\nD. If crossing-over happens in mules, then it must be limited to prophase of mitosis is incorrect. Crossing-over typically occurs during meiosis, not mitosis. However, since mules cannot undergo meiosis, this statement does not apply to them."
