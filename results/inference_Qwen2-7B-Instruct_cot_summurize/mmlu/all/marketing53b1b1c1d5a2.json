Public relations.\n\nPublic relations (PR) is a strategic communication process used to manage the flow of information between an organization and its publics. It often involves using various media platforms, including television and radio, to disseminate messages aimed at influencing public perception or behavior. While opinion leaders and opinion formers can be part of PR strategies, the direct focus on reaching and educate large audiences through mass media like TV and radio aligns more closely with the practice of public relations. Opinion followers and opinion formers refer more to individuals within the audience who may be influenced by these messages rather than the method of delivery itself."
