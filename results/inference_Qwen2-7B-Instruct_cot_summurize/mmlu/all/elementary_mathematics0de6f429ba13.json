If the tens digit is 5 or more, the number rounds up to the next hundred. If it's less than 5, it rounds down to the current hundred.\n\nGiven the result is 500, the original number must have been in the range of 450 to 549 ( inclusive. This is because:\n- Any number from 450 to 499 would round up to 500.\n- Any number from 500 to 549 would already be 500 after rounding.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nA. 458: This falls within the range of 450 to 499, so it could be the number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\nB. 463: This also falls within the range of 450 to 499, so it could be the number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\nC. 547: This falls within the range of 500 to 549, so it could be the number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\nD. 559: This falls outside the range of 450 to 549. It would have to be rounded up from 550 to reach 500, so it cannot be the number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 559."
