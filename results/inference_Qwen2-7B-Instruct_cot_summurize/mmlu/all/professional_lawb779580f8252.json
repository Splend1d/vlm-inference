The note read as follows: \"Do you think this contract of sale for my boat complies with state law? I would have talked to you in person about this, but I'm on my way out of town. I will be back next week.\" The attorney reviewed the document and wrote a one-page letter to the client stating that the document complied with state law. The lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a reasonable fee. The client refused to pay the attorney anything, arguing that she had never agreed to retain the attorney and that she had received nothing of value from the attorney because the sales transaction was never concluded. Assume that there is no applicable statute or rule governing the formation of attorney-client relationships in the jurisdiction. If the attorney sues the client for the $500, will the attorney be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because even if the parties had an agreement, that agreement was discharged under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\nB. No, because the attorney and the client never agreed on the essential terms of a contract.\nC. Yes, because the attorney took action on the client's note to his detriment.\nD. Yes, because the client's note and the attorney's performance created an implied- in-fact contract.\n"

Yes, because the client's note and the attorney's performance created an implied-in-fact contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the attorney interpreted the client's note as an instruction to review a contract related to the boat sale and provide legal advice. By reviewing the document and writing a letter based on that review, the attorney provided services, which indicates acceptance of the task described in the client's note. This exchange of services between the attorney and the client creates an implied-in-fact contract. As the attorney has provided services and incurred costs (in this case, a bill for $500), the client is obligated to pay for those services unless there is a valid defense or counterclaim against the attorney's actions.\n\nThe other options do not accurately reflect the circumstances presented:\n\nA. The doctrine of frustration of purpose typically applies when an unforeseen event renders the purpose of a contract impossible to achieve, which does not seem to be the case here.\n\nB. Even though there may not have been an explicit agreement, the conduct of both parties suggests they intended to form a relationship for the provision of legal services, which constitutes an implied-in-fact contract.\n\nC. The concept of taking action to one's detriment is relevant in situations like promissory estoppel, where someone acts based on another's representation, but it doesn't directly apply to the question of whether the attorney-client relationship was formed in this context. The focus should be on whether the elements of an implied-in-fact contract were present."
