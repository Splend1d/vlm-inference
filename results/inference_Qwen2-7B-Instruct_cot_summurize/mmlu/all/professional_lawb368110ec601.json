The will was duly probated shortly thereafter. In 2005, the son conveyed the tract of land to a friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 2009. The son's will, duly probated following his death, named the friend as sole legatee and devisee of the son's entire estate. In 2008, the son mortgaged the tract of land to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 2008, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to a rancher in 1988 and recorded in 1988. In that instrument, the son purported to grant the rancher a mortgage on the tract of land. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, the State of Baden has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. What is the probable legal effect of the son's mortgage agreement in 2008 with the bank?\n\nA. The mortgage would be invalid, because the son conveyed his interest in the property to the friend in 2005.\nB. The mortgage would be invalid, because the first mortgage in 1988 would take precedence over the second mortgage.\nC. The mortgage would be invalid, unless the mortgagee bank had knowledge of the prior conveyance to the friend.\nD. The subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n\nIn a jurisdiction like Baden, which follows a notice-type recording statute and a title theory for mortgages, the priority of interests in real property is determined by the date of recording. This means that any subsequent good faith purchaser or creditor who records their interest before another unrecorded interest will have priority over that other interest. \n\nGiven this context, when the son mortgaged the land to the bank in 2008, he did so after the deed conveying the land to his friend in 2005 was already executed but not recorded. Since the friend did not record the deed conveying the land from the son, her interest was not properly noticed to third parties, including the bank. Therefore, when the bank recorded its mortgage in 2008, it established a superior interest in the land over the unrecorded conveyance to the friend.\n\nAs a result, under Baden's recording statute and title theory for mortgages, the bank's mortgage would prevail over the friend's unrecorded interest in the land. This is because the bank acted as a good faith purchaser for value without notice of any prior unrecorded interest, thus satisfying the requirements of the recording statute."
