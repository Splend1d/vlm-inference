In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, which is located on a knoll above the lake, the caterer entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the caterer a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notifying the neighbor, the caterer proceeded with his plan to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. In an action by the caterer to enjoin the neighbor's use of the road in transporting sand, the court will most likely\n\nA. issue an injunction against the neighbor to prevent the further use of the road to haul sand.\nB. refuse to grant the caterer's prayer for relief because the servient owner continues to have the right to use his own land.\nC. issue an injunction against the neighbor unless it can be shown that the neighbor's use did not unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access.\nD. dismiss the cause of action because the caterer's only remedy would be monetary damages.\n"

The court will most likely issue an injunction against the neighbor unless it can be shown that the neighbor's use of the road did not unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access. \n\nIn a situation where one party has a right-of-way over another party's land, the party with the easement (in this case, the caterer - has the right to use the designated path or area as long as they don't unreasonably interfere with the other party's use of their land. If the neighbor's use of the road, such as heavy hauling for sand transport, is found to significantly damage the road and prevent the caterer from using it, then the court may grant an injunction to prevent further use until the issue is resolved.\n\nOptions A and B are too definitive without considering the specific circumstances and the potential impact of the neighbor's use on the caterer's rights. Option D might be considered if there was no interference with the caterer's easement rights, but since the road's condition is negatively impacting the caterer's access, an injunction seems more appropriate under these conditions."
