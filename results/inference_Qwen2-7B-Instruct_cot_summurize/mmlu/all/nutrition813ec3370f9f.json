Negative calcium balance and bone mineral loss\n\nWhile sodium (salt) itself does not directly impact calcium excretion or absorption, high dietary sodium intake can contribute to negative calcium balance and bone mineral loss. This is because consuming too much salt increases the body's need to excrete sodium through the kidneys. To do this efficiently, the kidneys also remove excess potassium, bicarbonate, and calcium. Over time, this can lead to a state where the body is not able to absorb enough calcium from the diet, leading to a negative calcium balance. This can contribute to bone mineral loss, especially if there is already a low intake of calcium and other essential nutrients like vitamin D and phosphorus.\n\nIt's important to note that moderate salt intake does not necessarily lead to these effects and that other factors, such as overall diet quality and lifestyle, also play significant roles in bone health and calcium metabolism."
