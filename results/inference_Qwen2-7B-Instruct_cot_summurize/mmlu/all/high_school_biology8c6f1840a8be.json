Therefore, options A (sporulation, B fission, and C budding, are all types of asexual reproduction where an organism can produce offspring without the involvement of another individual. \n\nHowever, D, meiosis, is not a mode of asexual reproduction. Instead, it is a type of cell division that results in the production of gametes (sperm or eggs) through sexual reproduction."
