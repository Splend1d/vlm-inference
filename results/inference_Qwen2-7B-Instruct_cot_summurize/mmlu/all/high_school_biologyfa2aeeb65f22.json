At the beginning of the experiment, the axon is at rest and has a threshold measured at \u201370 mV at 37oC. The axon receives one stimulus that triggers one action potential in the axon. Subsequent stimuli are much stronger. Which of the following statements explains what happens when several strong stimuli are experienced by the axon?\n\nA. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201390 mV.\nB. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201350 mV.\nC. The strength of the action potential becomes greater.\nD.

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The strength of the action potential becomes greater.\n\nWhen an axon receives multiple strong stimuli, it can lead to a process called \"action potential summation\". This occurs because the initial depolarization caused by the first stimulus may not be sufficient to reach the threshold for an action potential. However, if subsequent stimuli occur quickly enough, their effects can add up (summate) and finally cross the threshold, leading to the generation of an action potential. The strength of this action potential would not decrease but rather become more robust due to the cumulative effect of the stimuli.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not accurately describe the effects of receiving multiple strong stimuli on the axon:\n\n- A. Hyperpolarization refers to a state where the membrane potential is more negative than the resting potential. Repeated strong stimuli can lead to a condition known as \"tetanus\", which involves continuous muscle contractions, but does not directly cause the axon itself to hyperpolarize to a higher value than its resting potential.\n  \n- B. Hyperpolarization to \u201350 mV implies a more negative resting potential, which is not a typical response to repeated strong stimuli. Instead, these stimuli could lead to repetitive firing or a plateau phase in the action potential's waveform, depending on the neuron's properties and the timing of the stimuli.\n\n- D. An increase in the frequency of action potentials could happen under certain conditions, such as during repetitive stimulation where the intervals between stimuli are short enough to allow for full recovery of the neuron's refractory period. However, this is not necessarily a direct result of the strength of the stimuli; it depends on the specific characteristics of the neuron and the pattern of stimulation."
