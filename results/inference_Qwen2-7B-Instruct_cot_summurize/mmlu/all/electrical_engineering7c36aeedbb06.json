This is because the holding current provides enough 'push' to keep the SCR in the conducting state once it has been turned on.\n\nGiven that the latching current is 20 mA, the holding current would usually be larger but not necessarily one of the options provided directly proportional to the latching current. The exact value can depend on the specific SCR model and its datasheet specifications. However, without more specific information about the SCR model in question, we cannot definitively choose between A, B, C, or D.\n\nTypically, the holding current for a standard SCR might range from several tens of milliamps to several amperes, depending on the application requirements. Therefore, option C (10 mA, seems unlikely given that it's significantly lower than the latching current. Options A, B, and D could be plausible choices based on common holding currents for SCR devices, but without further details, none of these options can be confidently selected as the 'correct answer'. \n\nIn real-world applications, the actual holding current should always be checked against the specific device's datasheet to ensure proper operation and safety."
