                    "text": "To evaluate this sum, let's first understand what each term represents. The notation $\\lceil x \\rceil$ refers to the ceiling function, which gives us the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $x$. So, we're essentially looking at the smallest integer for each square root from $\\sqrt{5}$ to $\\sqrt{29}$.\n\nLet's break down the range into intervals based on perfect squares, since these will help us identify the values of $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil$ more easily:\n\n- For $\\sqrt{5}$ to $\\sqrt{8}$, $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 3$, because $\\sqrt{4} < \\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{6}, \\sqrt{7}, \\sqrt{8} < \\sqrt{9}$.\n- For $\\sqrt{9}$ to $\\sqrt{15}$, $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 4$, because $\\sqrt{9} < \\sqrt{10}, \\ldots, \\sqrt{15} < \\sqrt{16}$.\n- For $\\sqrt{16}$ to $\\sqrt{20}$, $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 4$, but here we start seeing numbers where the ceiling is actually 4, as opposed to 3.\n- For $\\sqrt{21}$ to $\\sqrt{25}$, $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 5$, because $\\sqrt{21} < \\sqrt{25} < \\sqrt{36}$.\n- Finally, for $\\sqrt{26}$ to $\\sqrt{29}$, $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 5$, but again, there are are specific points within this range where the ceiling jumps to 5.\n\nNow, let's count how many terms fall into each category:\n\n- There are are 4 terms ($\\sqrt{5}$ to $\\sqrt{8}$) with $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 3$.\n- There are 7 terms ($\\sqrt{9}$ to $\\sqrt{15}$) with $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 4$.\n- There are 5 terms ($\\sqrt{16}$ to $\\sqrt{20}$) with $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 4$.\n- There are 5 terms ($\\sqrt{21}$ to $\\sqrt{25}$) with $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 5$.\n- There are 4 terms ($\\sqrt{26}$ to $\\sqrt{29}$) with $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 5$.\n\nSo, the total sum can be calculated by adding up the contributions from each category:\n\n- Contribution from $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 3$: $4 \\times 3 = 12$\n- Contribution from $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 4$: $7 \\times 4 + 5 \\times 4 = 36$\n- Contribution from $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 5$: $5 \\times 5 + 4 \\times 5 = 45$\n\nAdding these contributions together: $12 + 36 + 45 = 93$\n\nTherefore, the answer is **not listed among your options**, indicating a potential error in the provided choices or in my interpretation. Given the standard format and typical difficulty level of such problems, it seems likely that there might have been a misunderstanding in either the question setup or the options provided. However, based on the calculation process and logic, the correct approach would yield a different result than any of A. 112, B. 111, C. 2006, D. 110."
