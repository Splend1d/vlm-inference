                    "text": "B. B is perpendicular to the surface.\n\nIn a superconductor under ideal conditions, the electric field (E) is zero inside the material due to its ability to completely suppress any externally applied electric field. This implies that there is no net current flowing within the superconductor, as current density is directly proportional to the electric field through Ohm's law in conductors. The absence of current means that the magnetic field (B) cannot change, leading to B being constant everywhere within the superconductor.\n\nHowever, at the surface of a superconductor, there is a discontinuity in the normal component of the electric field and a discontinuity in the tangential component of the magnetic field due to the Meissner effect. These discontinuities are related by Maxwell's equations:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial n} = -\\mu_0 \\cdot I \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial n} \\) is the normal component of the electric field discontinuity,\n- \\( \\mu_0 \\) is the permeability of free space,\n- \\( I \\) is the current density.\n\nSince there is no current flowing within the superconductor, \\( I = 0 \\), this implies that the normal component of the electric field discontinuity is zero. Given this, and using Faraday's law of induction, we can infer that the tangential component of the magnetic field (\\( \\vec{B} \\)) must be perpendicular to the surface of the superconductor to ensure continuity of the magnetic flux across the boundary, as well as to satisfy Ampere's law with Maxwell's addition.\n\nTherefore, option B correctly describes the condition just outside the surface of a superconductor: the magnetic field B is perpendicular to the surface."
