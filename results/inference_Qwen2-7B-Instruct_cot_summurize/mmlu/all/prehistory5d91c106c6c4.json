This information would not directly help in determining when people entered the Americas from Siberia, as the presence or absence of sled dogs does not necessarily correlate with human migration patterns across land bridges. Anthropologists would need to consider historical evidence such as archaeological findings, genetic studies, and cultural artifacts to determine migration timelines."
