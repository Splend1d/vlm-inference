Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn scenario 1, putting a 2-cent stamp on a bill that is intended to be delivered to someone else's address is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards. The intention might seem deceptive, but since there is no direct harm caused and it's a minor action, it typically wouldn't be viewed as morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, coughing into food at a grocery store can be considered morally wrong because it poses a health risk to others who might handle or consume the food. It is generally expected that people take reasonable care to prevent spreading germs, especially in public places like grocery stores where many people are involved with the same items."
