That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

This historical context suggests that the answer should reflect an action that facilitated Western Europe's access to new resources or markets.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa - This option could potentially support the assertion if it led to increased access to resources or markets for Western European societies.\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire - While this event certainly expanded Spanish territories and resources, it was part of a broader pattern of European expansion and resource exploitation, not solely responsible for the \"quantum jump\" in productivity that is central to the author's argument.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity - This religious movement had cultural and political impacts, but it does not directly correlate with the economic productivity needed for global hegemony as described by the author.\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan - This option contradicts the assertion, as it represents a period of limited interaction and resource exchange for Japan rather than contributing to Western Europe's productivity gains.\n\nGiven these considerations, **option A ( The colonization of the interior of Africa** would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that helped Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E., as it aligns with the exploitation of resources from outside continents, which was was a key component of Western Europe's rise to global dominance during that period."
