Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \nPlanting in the rainforest could be considered morally wrong if it involves deforestation or habitat destruction, which often leads to loss of biodiversity and contributes to climate change. This action would depend on the specifics of how and where the planting occurred. \n\nOn the other hand, using olive oil instead of peanut oil for cooking dinner for someone with a peanut allergy is not a morally wrong action. It's a responsible and considerate choice that prevents potential harm to the allergic individual."
