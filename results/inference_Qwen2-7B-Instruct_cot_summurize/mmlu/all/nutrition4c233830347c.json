Natural polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils typically contain 18 carbon atoms with at least two carbon-carbon double bonds, and these double bonds are usually in the cis configuration. This structure allows for greater flexibility and fluidity in the cell membranes where these fats are found, compared to saturated or monounsaturated fats. Examples of such fatty acids include linoleic acid (which is common in many vegetable oils."
