His pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is sitting upright and appears catatonic. Physical examination shows rigidity. During the examination, he becomes hostile and attempts to assault the physician. This patient most likely ingested which of the following drugs?\n\nA. Diazepam\nB. Methamphetamine\nC. Oxycodone\nD.

PCP can cause a variety of psychiatric effects such as hallucinations, paranoia, and catatonia. It can also lead to rigidity and aggression in some cases. The other options do not typically present with these specific symptoms:\n\n- A. Diazepam: This drug is anxiolytic and sedative, causing relaxation and decreased anxiety.\n- B. Methamphetamine: Known for its stimulant effects, methamphetamine users often exhibit hyperactivity, agitation, and paranoia but not typically catatonia or rigidity.\n- C. Oxycodone: An opioid pain reliever, oxycodone usually causes drowsiness, pain relief, and sometimes constipation; it does not typically induce the symptoms mentioned.\n\nGiven the symptoms, PCP is the most likely culprit based on the clinical presentation."
