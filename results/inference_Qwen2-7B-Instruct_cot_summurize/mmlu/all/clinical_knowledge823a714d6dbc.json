The blood glucose concentration tends to remain relatively stable because the body is efficiently managing its energy stores. This is due to several mechanisms, including the\u52a8\u5458 of stored glucose, increased insulin sensitivity, and the sparing of glucose for the brain and muscles. However, individual responses can vary based on factors like fitness level, duration and intensity of the exercise, and pre-exercise nutrition."
