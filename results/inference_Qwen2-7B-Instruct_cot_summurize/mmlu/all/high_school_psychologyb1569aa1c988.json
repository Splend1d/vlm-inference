They have a low absolute threshold for light, meaning they can detect very faint light sources, but they are not as sensitive to color as cones and have a lower spatial resolution. \n\nA. Rods are actually located on the periphery of the retina, not in the center. \nB. Yes, rods do synapse with bipolar cells, just like cones.\nC. Cones, not rods, respond more quickly to bright colors."
