An accumulation of inorganic phosphate. \n\nDuring intense exercise like multiple sprints, muscles use up their stored ATP and rely more on anaerobic metabolism, which generates lactic acid and inorganic phosphate as byproducts. The accumulation of inorganic phosphate can contribute to muscle fatigue by interfering with the reuptake of energy molecules into muscle cells."
