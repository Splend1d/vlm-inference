This means that if an action or principle cannot be universally applied without contradiction, it is not morally justifiable. This concept is often associated with Immanuel Kant's deontological ethics.\n\nPrescriptivity refers to statements that prescribe how one ought to behave. Moral judgments are often normative in nature, telling us what we should do or what is right and wrong. This feature highlights that moral judgments aim to guide and direct our actions.\n\nThe other options provided do not capture the essence of logic in moral judgments as succinctly:\n\nA. Consequentialism focuses on the outcomes of actions rather than their adherence to rules or duties, while hedonism specifically advocates for maximizing pleasure or happiness, which is not a universally accepted principle in all ethical theories.\n\nC. Contractualism is a theory that suggests that moral norms can be justified by hypothetical agreements among individuals, which is different from universalizability.\n\nD. Consistency and coherence refer to the internal structure of a moral system, but they do not encapsulate the essence of moral judgments in the same way that universalizability and prescriptivity do."
