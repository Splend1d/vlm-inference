Neither Rose nor Jave.\n\nThe equity method of accounting is used when an investor has significant influence over the investee, which typically means owning between 20% and 50% of the voting stock of the investee. Since Goll Co. has less than 20% ownership in both Rose Co. and Jave Co., it does not have the ability to exert significant influence over their operations and financial policies. Therefore, Goll should account for neither of these investments using the equity method. Instead, it would likely account for them under the cost method or potentially the fair value method if specific conditions are met."
