This response is primarily orchestrated by the sympathetic nervous system, which is part of the autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system triggers the release of stress hormones such as adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) and cortisol from the adrenal glands. These hormones prepare the body to either confront the threat (fight) or escape from it (flight). This physiological response increases heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels in the blood, among other effects, to enhance physical capabilities for immediate action."
