This development occurred over a long period, with the earliest known Chinese civilization emerging around the Yellow River basin during the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties periods, which predate the discovery at An-yang related to the Shang Dynasty. The unification under the Qin Dynasty was a significant historical event but not the starting point of Chinese civilization. External influences from neighboring regions like the Indus Valley did exist but were not the primary source of Chinese civilization's origins."
