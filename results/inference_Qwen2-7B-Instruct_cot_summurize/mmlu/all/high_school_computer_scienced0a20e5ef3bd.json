The song was saved using fewer bits per second than the original song.\n\nWhen saving a digital audio file, the number of bits used to encode each sample of sound can affect the quality of the recording. A higher bit rate results in better quality because it captures more details of the original sound. If the student saved the file with a lower bit rate than the original recording, this would likely result in a lower sound quality."
