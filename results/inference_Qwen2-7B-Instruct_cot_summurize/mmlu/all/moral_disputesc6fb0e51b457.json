According to Richardson-Self, there are different forms of misogynist speech:\n\n- **Interdivisional misogynist speech**: This refers to statements made by one group (e.g., men, women, or another gender group) that express hostility or derogation towards another group.\n  \n- **Intradivisional misogynist speech**: This is when members within the same group (typically referring to women) make derogatory comments about other women within their group.\n\n- **Interpersonal misogynist speech**: This type involves direct, personal attacks or derogatory remarks made between individuals of any gender.\n\nBased on these definitions, the correct answer would be **D. A and B only** if we strictly follow the terms provided in the context of Richardson-Self's categorization. However, it's important to note that the term \"interdivisional misogynist speech\" isn't commonly used in mainstream discussions on misogyny, so the most accurate response might simply be **C. Interpersonal misogynist speech**, depending on the specific context or framework being referenced."
