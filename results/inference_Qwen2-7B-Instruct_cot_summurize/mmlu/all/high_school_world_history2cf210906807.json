The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nWhich of the following historical developments from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. most inspired the instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph to boycott foreign cloth?\n\nA. The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires\nB. The development of joint-stock companies\nC. The importation of food crops from the New World\nD. The African slave trade\n"

                    "text": "The instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph to boycott foreign cloth were most likely inspired by the development of joint-stock companies ( (option B). \n\nDuring this period, the establishment of joint-stock companies such as the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company played significant roles in global trade and colonization. These companies controlled large territories overseas, extracted wealth, and traded goods with other regions including India. The presence and influence of these companies might have led to a sense of national pride and a desire to support local industries over imported goods.\n\nBoycotting foreign cloth could be seen as a form of economic nationalism, aimed at supporting local industries and reducing dependence on foreign imports. This action was also part of a broader movement towards Swadeshi ( (self-reliance) which encouraged Indians to produce their own goods, especially textiles, to counteract the negative effects of colonial trade policies and the exploitation of Indian resources by European companies. This movement was an essential component of the Indian independence struggle and the nonviolent resistance advocated by Mahatma Gandhi."
