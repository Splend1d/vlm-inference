At the time, no one was in the treatment room except the doctor and the child; the mother had left the room to get a cup of coffee. Two weeks later, when the child told her mother what had occurred in the treatment room, the mother suffered severe emotional distress that caused her to become physically ill. In an action against the doctor by the mother on her own behalf to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress, is the mother likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the mother was contributorily negligent in leaving the child alone with the doctor during treatment.\nB. No, because the mother was neither the direct victim of the doctor's conduct nor a contemporaneous witness.\nC. Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.\nD. Yes, because the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.\n\nIn this scenario, the mother's emotional distress was caused by the doctor's intentional and outrageous behavior (molesting the child) during the medical treatment. This type of behavior is generally considered sufficiently extreme and outrageous to meet the standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The fact that the mother did not witness the act being committed directly but learned about it afterward does not necessarily disqualify her from seeking recovery, as she is the intended victim and suffered emotional distress as a result of the doctor's actions. Additionally, the foreseeability of the mother experiencing distress upon learning of the child's abuse supports her claim, as emotional distress is a commonly recognized consequence of such acts."
