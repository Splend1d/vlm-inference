This is generally not considered morally wrong; it's an educational practice that can be seen as fair and beneficial for students who demonstrate knowledge or understanding.\n\nScenario 2 involves igniting fireworks in an office building. This action is clearly morally wrong because it poses a significant risk to the safety of others, violates fire safety regulations, and could lead to serious injury or property damage. It is also illegal in many jurisdictions to set off fireworks indoors or in public spaces without proper permits."
