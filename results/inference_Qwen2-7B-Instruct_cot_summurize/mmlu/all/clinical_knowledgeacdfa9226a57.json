The other options may lead to muscle contraction rather than relaxation: \n\nB. A more forceful nerve stimulus would typically result in stronger muscle contractions, not relaxation.\n\nC. Uncovering the actin binding sites ( which happen during muscle contraction as the myosin heads attach to the actin filaments - would actually facilitate further contraction, not relaxation.\n\nD. Saturation of the actin binding sites usually refers to a state where the muscle fibers are fully contracted and cannot contract any further, thus they would not relax under this condition."
