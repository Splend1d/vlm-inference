However, according to the World Bank's estimates:\n\n- The global median income per capita was around $5,800 in 2020.\n  \nGiven the options you provided, none directly match the actual median international income. However, if we had to choose the closest option based on the scale of the choices given, option C ($10,000) would be the furthest from the global median income estimate I mentioned.\n\nFor precise information, one should refer to the latest World Bank or similar international economic organization's reports."
