In his work, particularly in \"Utilitarianism,\" John Stuart Mill argues that the highest form of happiness involves \"higher\" pleasures which come from intellectual, aesthetic, and moral pursuits. These pleasures contribute to personal development and the flourishing of human capacities. Mill suggests that a life rich in these higher pleasures is more fulfilling than one merely filled with excitement or tranquility.\n\nTherefore, based on Mill's philosophy, the answer would be:\n\nC. both a and b.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this interpretation is somewhat of a simplification. Mill's views on happiness are complex and depend on the context and specific definitions of 'tranquility' and 'excitement.' He does not necessarily equate happiness with either state exclusively but rather suggests that a combination of various types of pleasures contributes to a good life."
