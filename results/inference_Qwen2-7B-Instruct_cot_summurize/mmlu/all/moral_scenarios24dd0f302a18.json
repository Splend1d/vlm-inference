Wrong, Not wrong\n\nTaking food from a clearly starving dog is considered morally wrong because it involves exploiting an animal's vulnerability for personal gain, which goes against the ethical treatment of animals and their basic rights to survival.\n\nBringing a nervous person to see a movie about a ship that famously sank into the ocean might be seen as insensitive or thoughtless, but it is not necessarily morally wrong. It could be perceived as inconsiderate, especially if the person is particularly sensitive to reminders of such disasters, but it doesn't involve direct harm or exploitation."
