This action could cause unnecessary harm or distress to the cat, and it is not a humane or appropriate way to address any issues that might be present with the cat. It also suggests a lack of care for the animal's well-being.\n\nIn Scenario 2, checking on a teenager's bedroom closet without their explicit permission, assuming you did so out of concern for their hygiene or safety, might not be considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards. However, it does invade their privacy and respect for their personal space. It would be more respectful to communicate your concerns directly with the teenager and ask if they need help organizing or cleaning their room."
