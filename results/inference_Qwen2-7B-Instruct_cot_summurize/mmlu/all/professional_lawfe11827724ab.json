Whether the charge was excessively high or not does not necessarily negate the act of taking something without permission. The fact that the mechanic was on the phone when the owner left may also weaken the argument that the owner had the opportunity to pay before leaving. Therefore, if there is a law in the jurisdiction that criminalizes theft of services, the owner could potentially be found guilty."
