In the context of cloning, where offspring are genetically identical copies of the parent, the heritability for traits would be 100%, not any of the options provided.\n\nHowever, given the options:\n\nA. 0% - This is incorrect because cloned organisms have identical DNA and thus their traits will show high heritability.\n\nB. 25% - This is also incorrect for the same reason as above; it's less than 100%.\n\nC. 50% - This is incorrect because it suggests half of the traits are due to genetics, which doesn't apply when discussing the heritability of traits in a clone.\n\nD. 75% - This is also incorrect for the same reason.\n\nSo, while none of these options are correct based on the understanding of heritability in cloned populations, if we were to pick the closest answer, it would be an understanding that heritability would be 100% for traits in a cloned population. None of the provided options accurately reflect this fact."
