The argument is:\n\n1. ~C \u2283 D ( (Premise 1)\n2. D \u2283 C  ( (Premise 2)\n3. C      ( Conclusion)\n\nLet's break down each component:\n\n- ~C: This means \"not C\"\n- D: This is just \"D\"\n- C: This is just \"C\"\n\nNow, let's create a truth table for these components.\n\n| C | ~C | D | ~C \u2283 D | D \u2283 C |\n|---|----|---|--------|-------|\n| T | F  | T |   T    |   F   |\n| T | F  | F |   T    |   T   |\n| F | T  | T |   T    |   T   |\n| F | T  | F |   T    |   T   |\n\nNow, let's add the conclusion C to the table:\n\n| C | ~C | D | ~C \u2283 D | D \u2283 C | C |\n|---|----|---|--------|-------|---|\n| T | F  | T |   T    |   F   | T |\n| T | F  | F |   T    |   T   | T |\n| F | T  | T |   T    |   T   | F |\n| F | T  | F |   T    |   T   | F |\n\nThe argument is attempting to show that if \"~C implies D\" and \"D imply C\", then \"C\" must be true. To determine if this is valid, we check if whenever the premises (~C \u2283 D and D \u2283 C) are true, the conclusion (C) is also true.\n\nWe see that in row 2 of the truth table, both premises (~C \u2283 D and D \u2283 C) are true, and the conclusion (C) is also true. \n\nHowever, in row 1, the premise (~C \u2283 D) is true but the conclusion (C) is false. This means that there is at least one case where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Invalid.
