When the resistance \\(R\\) is doubled, the current \\(I\\) flowing through the circuit also changes because of Ohm's Law (\\(V = IR\\)). If \\(R\\) doubles and \\(V\\) remains constant, \\(I\\) will halve.\n\nGiven this, if we initially have power \\(P_1 = I^2R\\) and then \\(R\\) doubles to \\(2R\\), the new power \\(P_2\\) becomes \\(P_2 = (I'^2 \\cdot 2R\\). Since \\(I'\\) is half of \\(I\\) ( (because \\(V = I'R\\) when \\(R\\) is doubled and \\(V\\) stays constant), we substitute \\(I' = \\frac{I}{2}\\) into the equation for \\(P_2\\):\n\n\\[P_2 = \\left(\\frac{I}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot 2R = \\frac{1}{4}I^2 \\cdot 2R = \\frac{1}{2}I^2R\\]\n\nTherefore, the total power dissipated by the circuit when the resistance is doubled will be halved.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. It will be halved."
