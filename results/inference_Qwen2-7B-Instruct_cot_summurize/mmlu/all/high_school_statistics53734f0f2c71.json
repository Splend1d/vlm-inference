This November, the average donation is $155.\nThis statement is correct because it directly states the average donation amount from the data provided.\n\nB. 50% of all donations this November are more than $155.\nThis statement is not necessarily true without additional context. In a normal distribution, the median would be equal to the mean if the distribution is perfectly symmetrical. However, without knowing the shape of the distribution or having enough information to calculate percentiles, we cannot conclude that exactly 50% of the donations are above the mean. This statement could be true for a symmetric distribution but not necessarily for skewed distributions.\n\nC. We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\nThis statement suggests a confidence interval calculation. To find such an interval, we would typically use the formula for a confidence interval of a mean: \\(\\bar{x} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\\), where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean, \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level ( (in this case, approximately 1.96 for a 95% confidence level), \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation, and \\(n\\) is the sample size. Plugging in the values:\n\\[155 \\pm 1.96 \\left( \\frac{32}{\\sqrt{100}} \\right)\\]\n\\[= 155 \\pm 1.96 \\times 3.2\\]\n\\[= 155 \\pm 6.272\\]\nThis results in an interval approximately from $148.728 to $161.272, not $91 to $219.\n\nD. We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.\nUsing the same formula as in option C, this interval closely matches the calculated interval, making it the most accurate representation of a 95% confidence interval for the mean based on the given data.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate statement is **D. We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161**."
