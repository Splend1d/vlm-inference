Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the act of going into debt to pay for gambling is generally considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is because it can lead to financial strain on oneself and others, especially if it involves borrowing money from friends, family, or using high-interest loans.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking out a gun to clean it is not inherently morally wrong. It is a routine action for gun owners who maintain their firearms. However, it's important to consider the context and safety measures involved. If done safely and responsibly, without any intention of harm, this action would not be morally wrong."
