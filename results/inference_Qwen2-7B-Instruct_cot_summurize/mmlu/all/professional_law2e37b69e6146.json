He then pushed the woman out of the way and ran out of the subway car while carrying the purse. The man was apprehended on the subway platform while in possession of the purse. In a jurisdiction that follows the common law with respect to criminal offenses, of what crime can the man properly be convicted?\n\nA. Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse.\nB. Larceny, because he made no threat to use force.\nC. Robbery, because he physically took the purse from the woman's presence.\nD. Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse.\n"

Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse.\n\nRobbery is typically defined as the taking of property from another person's presence through the use of force or fear. In this scenario, the man did not use force when initially grabbing the purse, but the use of force was used when he pushed the woman out of the way to escape with the purse. This meets the criteria for robbery under the common law definition, even though the force was applied after the initial theft. \n\nLarceny, on the other hand, is the unlawful taking of someone else's property without the use of force or fear. Since the man used force to escape with the purse, the crime would not be considered larceny under common law definitions."
