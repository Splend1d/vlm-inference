Here, $k$ is the number of features (or dimensions) and $T$ is the number of observations.\n- $\\hat{u}^t$ is the transpose of $\\hat{u}$, which means its dimensions will be flipped, so it will become a $T$x$k$ matrix.\n\nWhen you multiply a matrix of dimensions $m$x$n$ with another matrix of dimensions $n$x$p$, the result is a matrix of dimensions $m$x$p$. So, in this case:\n\n$\\hat{u}^t * \\hat{u}$ = $T$x$k$ * $k$x$T$ = $T$x$T$\n\nSo, the correct answer would be none of the options provided since they do not match the dimensions $T$x$T$. If there was an option for $T$x$T$, that would be correct."
