The candidate subsequently lost the election and sued the newspaper for defamation. The newspaper defended on the grounds of truth. At trial, the candidate took the stand and testified that he was not a thief. Thereafter, the newspaper called a witness to testify that three years ago the candidate committed a larceny while employed at his former job. Upon objection by the candidate's attorney, the witness's testimony should be\n\nA. excluded, because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\nB. excluded, because it is improper character evidence.\nC. admitted as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity.\nD. admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.\n"

They cannot introduce extrinsic evidence to prove a separate incident that they claim demonstrates the plaintiff's guilt. The witness's testimony about the candidate committing a larceny in the past would not be admissible as it is an attempt to prove the candidate's character for honesty or dishonesty based on an act outside of the current charges, which is generally not allowed under the rules of evidence."
