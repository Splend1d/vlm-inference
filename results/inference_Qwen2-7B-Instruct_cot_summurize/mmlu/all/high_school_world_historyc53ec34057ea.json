Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

The information given pertains to the economic activities and trade practices within a specific kingdom, and it does not directly address the broader context of religious spread, international trade development, disease transmission, or nomadic migrations creating powerful empires.\n\nHowever, based on the information given:\n\n- Option A ( \"Religions were often spread through warfare during the period.\" cannot be supported as the passage does not discuss religious spread or warfare.\n\n- Option B \"International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\" can be indirectly supported because the passage mentions trade connections, specifically the exchange of copper for gold, suggesting some form of international trade was occurring. However, without more context on the extent and nature of these trade connections, this statement should be considered speculative based on the given information alone.\n\n- Option C \"Diseases spread along trade routes.\" cannot be directly supported from the passage as it does not provide any information about the spread of diseases.\n\n- Option D \"Nomadic migrations created powerful empires during the period.\" cannot be directly supported either, as the passage does not mention nomadic migrations or the creation of powerful empires.\n\nGiven the limitations of the information provided, the most accurate statement that could be supported based on the passage is:\n\nB. International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nBut it's important to note that this conclusion is drawn from a very narrow set of details provided in the passage and may not fully capture the broader historical context described in the options."
