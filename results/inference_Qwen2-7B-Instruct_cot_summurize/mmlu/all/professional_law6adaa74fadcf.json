The neighbor's predecessor had received an easement from the woman's predecessor in title to cross the woman's land for access to the public highway. This access was desired even though the neighbor and his predecessor had other access to public roads. Recently, the woman erected a large solar collector on a portion of her land subject to the easement, even though the woman has other power resources. The location was essential to acquire the maximum sunlight. However, by erecting the collector there, the woman effectively cut off the neighbor's ability to use the easement. The local zoning code permits the use of solar collectors. The neighbor immediately sued to compel the woman to remove the solar collector. Must the solar collector be removed?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor has other means of access.\nB. No, because the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors.\nC. Yes, because the easement remains valid.\nD. Yes, because the woman has other power resources.\n"

Yes, because the easement remains valid.\n\nThe key factors here are the existence of an easement that grants the neighbor access across the woman's property for the purpose of reaching the public highway, and the fact that this access is still necessary despite the neighbor having other access to public roads. The erection of the solar collector by the woman effectively blocks this easement, denying the neighbor the right granted by the easement agreement. \n\nWhile the zoning code permitting the use of solar collectors might seem relevant, it does not override the rights and obligations under the easement agreement. The neighbor's lawsuit aims to enforce the terms of the easement, which requires the woman to allow access through her land as specified. Therefore, the solar collector must be removed to comply with the easement's conditions, even if the woman has alternative power resources or other means of access."
