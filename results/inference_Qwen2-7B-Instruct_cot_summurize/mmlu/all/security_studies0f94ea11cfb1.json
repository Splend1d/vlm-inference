Security systems are detrimental to usability and can make IT systems less functional, and therefore less attractive to the consumer.\nC. There is pressure to reduce the time it takes to get a new IT product or system onto the market, so security systems are sacrificed in order to reduce the time-to-market.\nD. All of these options.\n"

All of these options.\n\nEach of the mentioned options presents significant obstacles to developing IT security in the context of commerce and marketing:\n\nA. **No Direct Return on Investment (** This is a major challenge because many organizations are primarily focused on short-term profits and tangible returns. Investing in robust security measures that do not immediately generate revenue can be difficult to justify, especially when the costs of potential breaches far exceed the investments made in security.\n\nB. **Security Systems Detrimental to Usability:** Security measures often involve additional layers of authentication, encryption, and other protocols that can sometimes slow down user interactions with the system or website. This can lead to a decrease in user satisfaction and potentially increase the likelihood of users opting for more streamlined alternatives, which might have fewer security features but better usability.\n\nC. **Pressure to Reduce Time to Market:** In today's fast-paced business environment, there is immense pressure to launch products and services quickly to stay competitive. This rush to market can sometimes lead to cutting corners on security to meet deadlines, potentially compromising the integrity and safety of the system. The trade-off between speed and security becomes particularly challenging in this scenario.\n\nAll these factors can collectively impede the development and implementation of effective IT security measures, making it crucial for organizations to find balanced solutions that address both the need for rapid innovation and the imperative for strong security."
