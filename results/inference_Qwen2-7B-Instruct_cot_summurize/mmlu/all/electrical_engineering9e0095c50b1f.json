The key here is \"conducting\" materials, which can include both magnetic and non-magnetic ones. When an alternating current flows through a coil near the material to be heated, it creates a changing magnetic field. This magnetic field induces eddy currents in the conductive material, which in turn produce heat due to the resistance of the material. This method is used in various applications such as metal hardening, melting, and heating parts in manufacturing processes."
