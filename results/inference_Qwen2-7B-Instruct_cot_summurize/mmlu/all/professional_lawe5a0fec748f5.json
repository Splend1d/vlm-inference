Over a year later, police detectives arrested a defendant after obtaining reliable information that the defendant was the robber who was responsible for killing the store's owner. Afterward, the defendant was taken to the station house where he was booked for the crime and then incarcerated. The next day, the prosecuting attorney made a decision to delay indictment until he could discover the identity of the defendant's accomplice. The defendant was then released from police custody. In this jurisdiction the statute of limitations for murder is five years. Five months later, the prosecuting attorney, after unsuccessfully attempting to secure information on the defendant's cohort, indicted the defendant, charging him with felony murder. Shortly before trial, the only eyewitness to the crime died. He would have testified that the defendant did not participate in the robbery. The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because of the delay between the date of the crime and the date of the indictment will most probably be\n\nA. granted, because the prosecutor is constitutionally required to press charges, if at all, within a reasonable time after probable cause is established.\nB. granted, because the delay in prosecuting the defendant actually prejudiced him.\nC. denied, because pre-indictment delay does not violate the Constitution, as long as it does not exceed an applicable statute of limitations.\nD. denied, because the delay was not excessive and was for a permissible purpose.\n"

The defendant was arrested and taken into custody within over a year of the crime, and the prosecution waited five months after that arrest before deciding to indict the defendant. Since the delay did not exceed the five-year statute of limitations, it would not automatically result in the dismissal of the indictment under the absence of other constitutional violations or prejudicial effects.\n\nHowever, the defense might still argue that the delay prejudiced the defendant by impairing his ability to prepare a defense, such as the loss of potential witnesses or evidence. If the court finds that the delay indeed prejudiced the defendant's right to a fair trial, it might consider dismissing the indictment or taking other remedial measures rather than simply dismissing the case outright. The specific outcome would depend on the totality of circumstances and any additional evidence presented during the court proceedings."
