Here's a brief overview:\n\n1. **For a period of time following childbirth (** In some traditional societies, especially in Africa, women are required to undergo a postpartum period known as \"sheltering\" or \"isolation.\" This practice involves abstaining from sexual activity, including sex with her husband, until the woman has healed from childbirth. The duration and specific practices can vary significantly among different cultures.\n\n2. **During menstruation** - Many cultures around the world have had taboos or restrictions associated with menstruation. These can include prohibitions on activities such as swimming, participating in religious ceremonies, or even entering the house. The specifics of these restrictions vary widely by culture and region.\n\n3. **Between parents and children** - While this option is more open-ended, it can refer to cultural practices that restrict physical contact or intimacy between parents and their adult children. For example, in some Asian cultures, there might be a level of formality and respect maintained in interactions between parents and adult children that differs significantly from Western norms. This could be seen as a restriction on how close they feel comfortable being physically with each other.\n\nSo, while each individual explanation might not fit every culture exactly, collectively, these options encompass a range of historical and contemporary practices found across diverse cultural contexts."
