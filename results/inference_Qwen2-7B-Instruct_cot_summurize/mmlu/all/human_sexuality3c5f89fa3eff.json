The virus can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, typically during sexual activity, but also through oral-genital sex. Here's what each option implies:\n\nA. Avalon could not contract genital herpes from performing fellatio ( oral-genital sex) on the guy.\n\nThis statement is false. Genital herpes can indeed be transmitted through oral-genital sex.\n\nB. If Avalon contracted genital herpes she can be cured with antibiotics if administered immediately after the first occurrence.\n\nThis statement is also false. Antibiotics, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, can help reduce the duration and severity of symptoms during an outbreak, but they cannot cure the underlying infection. Once someone is infected with HSV, they remain infected for life.\n\nC. If Avalon contracted genital herpes she will only be contagious when she has a break out.\n\nThis statement is partially true. People with genital herpes are most contagious when they have active sores or lesions, but they can also transmit the virus when no symptoms are present (this is called asymptomatic shedding). This means that even when there are no visible signs of infection, the virus can still be present and can be transmitted to others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. none of the above**."
