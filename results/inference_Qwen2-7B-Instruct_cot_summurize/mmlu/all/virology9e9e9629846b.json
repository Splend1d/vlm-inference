Multiple nucleotide deletions and substitutions.\n\nPoliovirus, like many RNA viruses, has a high mutation rate due to the lack of proofreading ability of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This high mutation rate provides a large pool of genetic variation that can lead to the emergence of more virulent strains. \n\nAmong the options provided:\n\n- A. Mutation of the RNA genome at only a few positions: While this can occur, it's less likely to result in a significant increase in virulence compared to larger mutations.\n- B. Recombining with another enterovirus: This could potentially introduce new genetic material, but the outcome would depend on the specific genes involved and their effects on the virus's properties.\n- C. Altering its protein coat: This could affect the virus's ability to interact with host cells or evade the immune system, but the impact on virulence would depend on the specifics of the alteration.\n- D. Multiple nucleotide deletions and substitutions: This process can lead to significant changes in the viral genome, potentially altering critical functions such as replication, protein synthesis, or interaction with host cells, which could result in increased virulence.\n\nTherefore, the most direct way for poliovirus to become more virulent is through multiple nucleotide deletions and substitutions in its RNA genome, as these changes can have substantial effects on its biological properties."
