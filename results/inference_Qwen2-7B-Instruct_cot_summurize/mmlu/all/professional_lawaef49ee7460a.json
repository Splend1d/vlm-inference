The roof's manufacturer had supplied nondefective materials to the installer, who was a franchisee (and not an employee) of the manufacturer. The leaks resulted from the carelessness of the installer during the from the carelessness of the installer during the installation of the roof. The installer's truck, which had been parked in front of the homeowner's house during the roof installation, bore the manufacturer's logo. The manufacturer was aware that the truck and the literature supplied by the installer both displayed the manufacturer's logo. Is there any basis for a claim by the homeowner against the manufacturer?\n\nA. No, because a franchisor has no duty to supervise the conduct of a franchisee.\nB. No, under the rule that a manufacturer is liable only for defects in a product that existed at the time the product left the hands of the manufacturer.\nC. Yes, because the installer was a franchisee of the manufacturer.\nD. Yes, under the rule of apparent agency.\n"

This doctrine allows for liability when a third party reasonably believes that an individual or entity has the authority to act on behalf of another based on the actions or representations made by the principal (in this case, the manufacturer. \n\nHere, the homeowner reasonably believed that the installer had the authority to act on behalf of the manufacturer, given the presence of the manufacturer's logo on the installer's truck and promotional materials. The manufacturer's awareness of these actions further supports the argument that the manufacturer had control over the installer's actions and should be held liable for any damages caused by the installer's carelessness. Therefore, the manufacturer may be held liable for the injuries sustained by the homeowner due to the roof leaks caused by the installer's negligence.\n\nThe other options presented do not accurately address the situation:\n\nA. A franchisor does have some responsibility to ensure that franchisees comply with certain standards, but the doctrine of apparent agency is more directly applicable here.\nB. While it's true that manufacturers are typically liable only for defects in their products, the doctrine of apparent agency applies to the actions of the installer, who was acting under the impression of being representing the manufacturer.\nC. The fact that the installer was a franchisee does not necessarily mean that the manufacturer is automatically liable for the installer's actions; it depends on the specific circumstances and whether the manufacturer can be held responsible through the doctrine of apparent agency."
