HM pays insufficient attention to the role of the labourer, instead focusing on the capitalist as the source of power and most important actor. HM can also allude to capitalist power structures, to the detriment of supporting the human security of workers.\nB. HM too often accuses capitalism of acting solely in self-serving ways, and explains everything in terms of class struggle, to the detriment of wider analysis. Some versions of HM claim to have uncovered objective laws of history which are widely disputed in their accuracy.\nC. HM is inevitably reductionist and oversimplifies the complexities of capitalism, recognising only its negative aspects and harmful effects.\nD. All of these options.\n"

This criticism points out that Historical Materialism (HM) might not sufficiently emphasize the laborer's role or the importance of worker security. It could be argued that HM might overly focus on the capitalist class as the primary agent of change, potentially neglecting the agency and conditions of those who produce the wealth. This perspective suggests that HM might not adequately support or advocate for the well-being of the working class.\n\nB. This criticism argues that HM can sometimes be overly simplistic in its view of capitalism, attributing every action to self-interest and class struggle. This narrow focus might limit the ability of HM to analyze other factors influencing society and economic systems. The claim that HM uncovers objective laws of history that are widely disputed implies that some might find HM's theoretical framework overly deterministic and lacking in empirical validation or flexibility.\n\nC. This criticism focuses on the potential for HM to be reductionist, meaning it might overly simplify complex social and economic phenomena, focusing mainly on capitalism's negative impacts without fully exploring its multifaceted nature. This critique highlights that HM might not account for the nuances within capitalism or consider alternative economic systems and ideologies.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct because it includes all three criticisms mentioned above, encapsulating the range of viewpoints that might be taken regarding the limitations of Historical Materialism."
