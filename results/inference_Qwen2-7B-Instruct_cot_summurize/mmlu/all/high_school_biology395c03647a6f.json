Secondary succession would begin to occur. \n\nSecondary succession refers to the process of ecological succession that occurs on a site that has been previously occupied by a community of plants or animals, but has been disturbed (in this case, by a fire. After the fire clears away the existing vegetation and kills off many of the animals, a new community will gradually take hold, with pioneer species like grasseses, shrubs, and certain types of trees filling the area before more complex ecosystems can develop. This is different from primary succession, which happens in areas where no living organisms have existed before, such as on newly exposed rock surfaces."
