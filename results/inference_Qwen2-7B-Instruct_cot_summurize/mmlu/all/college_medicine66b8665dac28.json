Glucagon increases blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen into glucose) and gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of new glucose). The increased demand for energy during exercise triggers the release of glucagon from the pancreas.\n\nIncreased pH ( (which refers to a more alkaline environment) can inhibit the activity of enzymes involved in glycogen breakdown, including glycogen phosphorylase, which is responsible for catalyzing the first step in glycogen breakdown. Therefore, an increase in pH would likely inhibit glycogen breakdown rather than activate it."
