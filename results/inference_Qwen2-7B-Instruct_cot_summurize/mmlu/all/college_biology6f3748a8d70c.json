However, red fox populations are sometimes attacked by a fatal parasite, the mange mite. As mite population sizes increase at a given site, how are hare and fox populations most likely to respond at the same site? (Assume that hares have no major predators at this site other than foxes.)\n\nA. Both fox and hare populations will decrease.\nB. Both fox and hare populations will increase.\nC.

Both fox and hare populations will decrease.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe presence of the mange mite on red fox populations is likely to result in a decline in fox numbers due to the increased mortality caused by the parasite. With fewer foxes present, there would be less predation pressure on the hare population, allowing hare numbers to potentially increase. Therefore, both the fox and hare populations are most likely to experience a decrease in numbers as the mange mite negatively impacts the red fox population."
