The psychologist obtained a statistically significant F-ratio for the interaction between two independent variables, which means that the effect of one variable depends on the level of the other variable. In other words, the relationship between one independent variable and the dependent variable changes at different levels of the second independent variable.\n\nTo clarify the other options:\nA. The statement about \"the effects of one variable being significant across all levels of the second variable\" does not necessarily follow from an interaction effect being significant. An interaction indicates that the effect of one variable is not consistent across the levels of the other variable.\nC. Statistical significance of the main effects (the individual effects of each independent variable without considering the other) does not directly imply statistical significance of the interaction effect. They can be tested separately.\nD. While it's true that the variables are considered jointly in an interaction, the significance of the interaction itself does not mean that the variables are only significant when considered together; rather, it shows that their combined effect cannot be explained by simply adding their individual effects."
