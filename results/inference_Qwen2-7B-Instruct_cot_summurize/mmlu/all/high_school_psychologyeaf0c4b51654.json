Groupthink occurs when the desire for harmony or conformity in a group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. One of the key lessons from Janis's research is that group members should feel free to express dissenting opinions. This is because dissent can help to uncover flaws in the group's thinking, prevent the suppression of alternative ideas, and lead to more thorough and effective decision-making. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals in a group to speak up and voice their concerns or differing viewpoints."
