The toxicologist testified that the defendant's blood alcohol level, registered after his arrest, was 0. 14%. At the close of the toxicologist's testimony, the trial judge, over defense objections, instructed the jury that, in accordance with state law, a person with a blood alcohol level greater than 0. 10% is presumed to be intoxicated. No other instruction relating to that presumption was given. A relevant statute in this jurisdiction makes driving while intoxicated a felony and defines intoxication \"as a state of severely impaired mental and physical capacity caused by the ingestion of drugs or alcohol. \"The defendant was subsequently convicted of driving while intoxicated. On appeal, his conviction should be\n\nA. affirmed, because the defendant had an opportunity to rebut the presumption.\nB. affirmed, because the judge's instruction merely permitted the jury to reach a conclusion that they could have decided upon without the presumption.\nC. reversed, because the jury might determine that the instruction in effect relieves the prosecutor of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nD. reversed, because such an instruction may be considered an indication of guilt and, therefore, violative of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\n"

The introduction of a presumption can shift this burden onto the defendant to rebut the presumption. In this case, the jury was instructed that if the defendant's blood alcohol level exceeded 0.10%, they were to presume the defendant was intoxicated under state law. However, no instruction was given regarding how this presumption interacts with the burden of proof. This lack of clarity could lead the jury to believe that once the presumption is triggered, it becomes part of the state's case, potentially relieving them of the responsibility to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n\nGiven the potential misinterpretation of the instruction and its impact on the jury's decision-making process, the correct course of action would be to reverse the conviction to ensure a fair and legally sound outcome."
