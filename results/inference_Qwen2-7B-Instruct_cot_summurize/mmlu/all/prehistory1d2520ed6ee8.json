Caral was developed around 2600 BCE, which predates the other examples listed.\n\nHere's a brief overview of each option:\n\nA. Jericho in Israel: This ancient city was inhabited as early as 7500 BCE, but it is not considered a complex society in the same sense as those that emerged later.\n\nB. Caral in Peru: The oldest known complex civilization in the Americas, Caral was developed around 2600 BCE. It is characterized by monumental architecture, such as pyramids and temples, and social stratification.\n\nC. Stonehenge in England: Constructed between 3000 and 1500 BCE, Stonehenge represents an advanced prehistoric culture but is not considered a complex society in the same way as those found in the Americas or Mesopotamia.\n\nD. Olmec along the Gulf Coast: The Olmec civilization is one of the earliest in Mesoamerica, developing around 1200 BCE, and is known for its colossal stone heads and complex trade networks. However, it is not the earliest complex society listed here.\n\nTherefore, Caral in Peru ( is the correct answer based on the criteria of being being the earliest complex society among the options given."
