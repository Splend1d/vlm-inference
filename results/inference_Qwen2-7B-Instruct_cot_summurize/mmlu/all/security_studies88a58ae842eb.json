Security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favouring some subjects and marginalising others.\n\nPost-structuralist perspectives in security studies often critique the way power dynamics and narratives are constructed within the field. They argue that security discourse can be used as a tool for maintaining certain power structures and ideologies, often privileging dominant groups while marginalizing others. This includes how it defines what constitutes a threat or legitimate action in warfare, influencing policies and practices. Therefore, according to this viewpoint, security studies can both contribute to theoretical understanding and also perpetuate existing power imbalances."
