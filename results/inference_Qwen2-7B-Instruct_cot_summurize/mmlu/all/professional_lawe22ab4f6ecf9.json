The shopper contended that the doors, which were programmed to swing inward, swung outward and injured him as he attempted to enter the store one afternoon. The shopper's brother-in- law, who was an eyewitness to the accident, was not called to testify at trial. Moreover, the shopper's attorney failed to depose the brother-in-law, who redomiciled out of state shortly after the accident. With respect to the shopper's failure to offer the brother-in-law's testimony at trial, on request by the supermarket's attorney, the court should\n\nA. instruct the jury that it raises the presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nB. instruct the jury that it constitutes an adoptive admission that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nC. permit the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nD. neither instruct the jury on the matter nor permit the supermarket's attorney to argue the matter.\n"

However, the court can allow the attorney to present arguments based on the evidence before the jury. In this case, since the shopper did not call their brother-in-law as a witness and the attorney failed to depose them, the absence of their testimony could potentially lead the jury to infer that their testimony might have been unfavorable to the shopper's case. This inference can then be argued by the supermarket's attorney but not officially instructed by the court as a legal presumption."
