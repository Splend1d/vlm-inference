The image gets smaller at first and then bigger in size.\n\nWhen an object is placed between the focal point (f) and the lens, it creates an enlarged, upright image on the same side as the object. As the lens moves closer to the object, the image will initially increase in size because the magnification \\(m\\) (which is the ratio of the image height to the object height, given by \\(m = \\frac{v}{u}\\), where \\(v\\) is the image distance and \\(u\\) is the object distance from the lens - will be greater than 1, indicating an enlarged image.\n\nHowever, as the lens continues to move closer to the object, the image distance \\(v\\) will decrease, causing the magnification \\(m\\) to decrease as well. This means that while the image is still upright and enlarged compared to the original size when the lens was further away, it will eventually start to decrease in size until it reaches a minimum when the lens is right above the coin ( (at a distance equal to the focal length, f). After this point, as the lens moves even closer to the coin, the image will again begin to increase in size but will now be inverted due to the negative image distance values that occur when the image is formed on the same side as the object for objects placed beyond the focal point but closer than the lens distance.\n\nIn summary:\n- Initially, the image size increases.\n- Eventually, the image size reaches a minimum or even becomes inverted depending on how close the lens is to the coin."
