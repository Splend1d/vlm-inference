H \u2261 R: This formula represents that H and R are equivalent, meaning they have the same truth value. It doesn't capture the conditional nature of the sentence.\n- B. H \u2022 R: This formula represents that H and R both must be true for the statement to hold. It doesn't capture the \"unless\" condition.\n- C. H \u2228 ~R: This formula represents that either H (being helpful) or the negation of R (not being rude by the patients) must be true. It captures the conditional nature of the sentence well.\n- D. H \u2228R: This formula represents that either H or R must be true. It doesn't capture the specific condition that doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude."
