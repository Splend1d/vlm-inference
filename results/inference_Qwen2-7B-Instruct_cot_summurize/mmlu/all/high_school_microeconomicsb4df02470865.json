The labor-leisure trade-off favors the income effect or more leisure at higher wage rates.\n\nThe backward bending supply curve represents a situation where, beyond a certain point, as wages increase, the quantity of labor supplied decreases. This is because the income effect becomes dominant over the substitution effect for some individuals. At higher wage rates, the increased income allows individuals to afford more leisure time without needing to work as many hours, hence they choose to work less."
