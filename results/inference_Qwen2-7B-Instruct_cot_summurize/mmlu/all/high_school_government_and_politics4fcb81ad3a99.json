Concentrate their campaign efforts on \"battleground\" states. \n\nThe Electoral College system in the United States allocates electoral votes to each state based on its representation in Congress (which is determined by population. Therefore, winning the majority of electoral votes does not necessarily require winning the majority of popular votes nationwide. Instead, the focus is on winning enough states to secure at least 270 electoral votes.\n\n\"Battleground\" states refer to those that have a close balance between the two major political parties and are are therefore critical to winning the presidency. These states often have competitive elections and can significantly influence the outcome of the election. Candidates typically allocate more resources, such as time, money, and campaign staff, to these states to maximize their chances of victory."
