Its jurisdiction is territorial and focuses on events occurring within the boundaries of these member states. However, there are certain circumstances under which the ECHR may apply extraterritorially, beyond the immediate borders of the member states:\n\nB. The ECHR applies extraterritorially in circumstances where a member State exercises effective control: This is particularly relevant in cases involving military interventions, peacekeeping operations, or other situations where an ECHR member state has significant influence over a foreign territory. For example, if a member state's troops are deployed in a conflict zone and engage in actions that violate human rights, those actions could potentially be subject to scrutiny under the ECHR.\n\nC. The ECHR applies extraterritorially where a member State has contributed forces to a UN peacekeeping mission: When a member state contributes troops to a UN peacekeeping operation, the actions of its soldiers can be held accountable under the ECHR if they violate human rights. This is because the UN peacekeepers are often acting under the authority of the contributing member state and thus their actions can be considered as acting on behalf of that state.\n\nIt's important to note that these applications of the ECHR are not automatic and require specific legal frameworks or international agreements that permit such extraterritorial jurisdiction. Moreover, the interpretation and application of the ECHR in such contexts are subject to debate and interpretation, with varying views among legal scholars and practitioners regarding the limits and scope of this extraterritorial jurisdiction."
