Fee splitting occurs when two or more parties agree to divide the professional fee for a service, often involving the referral of clients between professionals. The prohibition against fee splitting aims to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure that professional judgments are not compromised by financial incentives.\n\nIn this scenario, Dr. Vic Vasquez is receiving a percentage of the fees collected by Dr. Bernice Banquist for both regular clients and referred clients. This arrangement constitutes fee splitting and is thus considered unethical according to the professional ethics guidelines set forth by the APA and CPA."
