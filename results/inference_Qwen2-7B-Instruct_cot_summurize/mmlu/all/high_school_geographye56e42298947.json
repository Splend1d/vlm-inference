Replacement fertility is achieved.\n\nReplacement fertility refers to the average number of children a woman needs to have during her reproductive years in order to replace herself and maintain a stable population size, assuming no one moves in or out of the population. This is typically around 2.1 children per woman in developed countries, but can vary based on factors such as age at first birth, fertility rates, and life expectancy.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not accurately describe the conditions necessary for achieving zero population growth:\n\n- A) CBR ( CDR = 5 2: This equation does not make sense in the context of population growth calculations. The correct formulas would be CBR ( CDR = 0 (for a stable population or CBR / CDR > 0 for population growth.\n\n- B) Births + Immigration = Deaths + Emigration: This equation represents a balance between births, deaths, and migration, but it doesn't specifically indicate the conditions for zero population growth. Zero population growth occurs when the number of births and deaths are exactly match each other, regardless of migration.\n\n- C) Total fertility 5 3: While a total fertility rate of 3 would lead to population growth, a rate of exactly 3 is not sufficient for zero population growth unless there is no migration. For ZPG, the fertility rate must be below replacement level (i.e., less than approximately 2.1 children per woman, assuming no migration."
