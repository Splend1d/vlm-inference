This technique involves measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes into stable daughter products. By knowing the half-life of the parent isotope, scientists can calculate how long it has been since the rock or meteorite was formed. \n\nThis method has provided a precise age for the Earth, estimated to be about 4.54 billion years old. Other methods like those mentioned in options A, B, and C also provide insights but are not as precise or universally accepted for establishing the age of the Earth. For example, while fossils can tell us about the history of life on Earth, they don't directly tell us when the Earth itself was formed. Similarly, cratering history gives us an idea of how long certain areas have been exposed, but not necessarily when the Earth started."
