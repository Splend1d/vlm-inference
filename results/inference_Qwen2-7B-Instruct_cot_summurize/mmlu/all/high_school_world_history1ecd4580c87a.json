The King of China is a Tartar, and one of the descendants of [Ghenghis] Khan\u2026In all the Chinese provinces, there is a town for the [Muslims], and in this they reside. They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China\u2026\nWhen we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand\u2026In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]\u2026\"\nIbn Battuta, Voyages, 1332\u20131346 C.E.\nWhich of the following changes to Chinese policies regarding trade occurred under the Ming Dynasty of China?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The text provided by Ibn Battuta describes his experiences during his travels in the late 13th to early 14th centuries, long before the Ming Dynasty (which ruled from 1368 to 1662). Therefore, it does not provide any information about changes to Chinese policies regarding trade under the Ming Dynasty.\n\nHowever, based on historical knowledge:\n\nA. The Chinese government did indeed restrict foreign merchants to specific sites in coastal cities during the Ming Dynasty. This was part of a policy to control trade and manage the interaction between Chinese society and foreigners.\n\nB. The Chinese government did indeed monopolize the production and sale of certain key resources such as salt and iron during the Ming Dynasty, which was part of its broader strategy to control the economy and ensure fiscal stability.\n\nC. There is no historical evidence to suggest that the Ming Dynasty endorsed Chinese merchants to conduct trade missions abroad on an official scale. While Chinese merchants did engage in trade and travel, particularly through the maritime Silk Road, official state-sponsored missions were less common compared to earlier dynasties.\n\nD. The Ming Dynasty was characterized by a revival of Confucian principles, rather than a departure from them. While there may have been some relaxation of Confucian orthodoxy in certain areas, the overall governance and policies-making continued to be grounded in Confucian thought and ideals.\n\nThus, without specific information from the text, it's not possible to definitively answer which change occurred under the Ming Dynasty based solely on the provided Ibn Battuta passage. However, based on historical context, option A (restricting foreign merchants to specific sites in coastal cities, would likely be correct if looking for a change in Chinese trade policy under the Ming Dynasty."
