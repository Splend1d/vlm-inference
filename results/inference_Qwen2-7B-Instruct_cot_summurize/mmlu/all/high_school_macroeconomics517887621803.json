This increased demand can stimulate economic activity and push the GDP above its full employment level, assuming other factors remain constant. However, if the economy was initially below its full employment level, the additional spending from the tax cuts might not fully utilize all available productive capacity, leading to some resources being idle (i.e., unemployment remaining positive but below full employment levels.\n\nSelling bonds in the open market by the central bank (the Federal Reserve in the U.S. context) is part of monetary policy, and it represents a contractionary measure. When the Fed sells bonds, it takes money out of circulation, which can reduce the money supply and raise interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, potentially dampening investment and consumption. In the context of the question, if the economy was already operating above its full employment level, selling bonds would help to cool down the economy by reducing the amount of money in circulation, which could help to bring GDP back towards the full employment level. \n\nThe combination of these two policies actions\u2014reducing taxes to boost consumption and selling bonds to tighten monetary policy\u2014could have resulted in an economy where current real GDP is higher than the full employment real GDP. This scenario implies that the economy was initially below full employment, and the tax cuts helped to stimulate growth beyond its natural level, while the subsequent tightening of monetary policy helped to avoid overheating and inflationary pressures, aligning with the given conditions."
