The shape and color of these flowers facilitate hummingbird pollination. They can easily reach the nectar, but the position of the flower limits access for larger pollinators like bees, which typically cannot fit into such narrow spaces. This adaptation allows the flower to specialize in being pollinated by hummingbirds."
