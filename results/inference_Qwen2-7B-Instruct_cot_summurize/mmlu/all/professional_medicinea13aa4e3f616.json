Polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation.\n\nTreatment with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) leads to depletion of T-cells in the patient's immune system. This can result in a phenomenon called cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm, where the immune system reacts to the sudden decrease in T-cells by releasing high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on hands and feet can be associated with this cytokine release syndrome."
