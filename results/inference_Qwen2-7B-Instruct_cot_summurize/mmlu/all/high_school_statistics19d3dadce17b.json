This means there's an 84.13% chance of a fuse lasting less than or equal to 60 minutes. Therefore, the probability of lasting more than 60 minutes ( i.e., lasting at least 1 hour is 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587.\n\n### Company II\n\n- Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 55 minutes\n- Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 5 minutes\n\nFor Company II:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{60 - 55}{5} = 1 \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, a Z-score of 1 corresponds to the same cumulative probability of approximately 0.8413. This means there's an 84.13% chance of a fuse lasting less than or equal to 60 minutes. Therefore, the probability of lasting more than 60 minutes, i.e., lasting at least 1 hour, is also 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth companies have a similar probability ( around 15.87% for their fuses to last at least 1 hour. Thus, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. For both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is approximately 0.1587."
