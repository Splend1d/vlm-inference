There is an uncertain relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and skeletal health, particularly in terms of bone mineral loss, due to the influence of various confounding lifestyle factors. \n\nObservational studies have produced mixed results. Some suggest that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may be beneficial for bone health, potentially reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures (1. This could be due to the high content of vitamins, minerals, and fiber in these foods, which might contribute to maintaining bone density.\n\nHowever, other studies indicate that certain aspects of fruit and vegetable consumption might not necessarily lead to bone health benefits. For instance, high intake of vitamin C or potassium from fruits can increase calcium excretion, potentially leading to decreased bone mineral density over time 2. \n\nSupplementation studies often show more direct effects because they control for dietary intake variables, but this doesn't always translate to real-world outcomes since supplementation is not part of most people's' daily diets. \n\nTherefore, while fruits and vegetables are generally considered healthy components of any diet, their direct impact on bone mineral loss might be less clear-cut than initially thought due to the complex interplay with lifestyle factors. A balanced diet rich in a variety of nutrients, including those found in fruits and vegetables, along with adequate physical activity and sufficient calcium intake, remains recommended for maintaining good skeletal health.\n\nReferences:\n1.
