However, it is important to note that Mill's view is nuanced and differs from some other philosophical perspectives.\n\nIn Mill's utilitarian framework, the ultimate goal of human actions should aim at maximizing happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people. This does not necessarily equate to solely focusing on one's own happiness ( option C, but rather considers the collective well-being. \n\nMill argues that while individuals might have various desires, the morally right course of action often involves balancing these desires with the interests and welfare of others. This can include fulfilling duties ( option A, pursuing virtues ( option B, and considering the impact of one's actions on the happiness of others.\n\nTherefore, while none of the options perfectly encapsulate all of Mill's views, option C (his or her own happiness, is not the sole focus according to Mill's utilitarian philosophy. The correct interpretation would depend on the specific context within Mill's works, but generally, he emphasizes a balance between individual interests and the greater good."
