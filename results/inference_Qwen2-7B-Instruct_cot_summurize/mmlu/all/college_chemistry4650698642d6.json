However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question as the calculation yields a value not listed among the options. \n\nGiven the options, the closest answer would be:\n\nD. 1.433 x 10^-26 J T-1\n\nThis could be due to a conversion factor used in the original data that was not mentioned or a potential typo in the question or options."
