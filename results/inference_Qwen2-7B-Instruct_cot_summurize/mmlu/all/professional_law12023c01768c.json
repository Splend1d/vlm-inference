They increase the evidence required to convict a person than when the act was done.\n\nEx post facto laws are laws that change the legal consequences of actions that were committed before the enactment of the new law. These laws are generally prohibited in most legal systems, including the United States, because they can be used to punish individuals retroactively, which can be seen as unfair. \n\nA. This statement is true; ex post facto laws can make an act that was previously considered legal and not punishable by law now considered illegal with severe penalties.\n\nB. This statement is also true; ex post facto laws can prescribe harsher punishments for actions that were committed before the law was changed.\n\nD. This statement is true; ex post facto laws can alter criminal offenses or punishment in a way that is prejudicial to the individual who committed the act prior to the law change.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is C: Ex post facto laws do not increase the evidence required to convict a person than when the act was done. In fact, such laws cannot legally increase the burden of proof needed for conviction, as that would violate principles of fairness and due process."
