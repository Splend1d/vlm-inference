When you square a quantity with an uncertainty, the relative uncertainty increases by a factor of two. This is because the relative uncertainty (\\(\\delta x / x\\)) in a squared term becomes \\(2 \\times (\\delta v / v)\\) when considering \\(v^2\\).\n\nSo, if the uncertainty in \\(v\\) is 10%, then the uncertainty in \\(v^2\\) would be \\(2 \\times 10\\% = 20\\%\\).\n\nSince kinetic energy involves \\(v^2\\), the relative uncertainty in the kinetic energy will also increase by this factor when compared to the relative uncertainty in \\(v\\). Therefore, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy would be \\(20\\%\\).\n\nThe correct answer is D. 20%."
