The neighbor's testimony describing the man as a \"good neighbor\" is an opinion about the man's character, rather than evidence that directly relates to the events in question\u2014specifically, whether the man acted in self-defense or committed an unprovoked attack. Such evidence would be more appropriately considered under the context of character evidence rules, which typically exclude such opinions from being used to infer the likelihood of criminal behavior."
