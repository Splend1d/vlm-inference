The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been \"squatters\" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?\n\nA. Call her previous physician to obtain more history\nB. Order a chest x-ray\nC. Order a test for HIV antibody\nD. Repeat the PPD skin test\n"

Order a chest x-ray**.\n\nA positive PPD (purified protein derivative) skin test indicates a past or present infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB. Given the history of the family's living conditions and the child's positive PPD test, there is a significant risk that the child may have active TB disease, especially since she has not had much medical care recently and her parents mention that she has been \"squatters\" in vacant buildings. This situation puts her at higher risk for TB exposure.\n\nA chest x-ray can help identify any signs of active TB such as cavities, nodules, or other abnormalities in the lungs. It is crucial in this scenario because it can confirm the presence of active TB disease, which would necessitate immediate treatment to prevent the spread of the infection and to protect the child's health.\n\nOption A ( calling her previous physician for more history could also be considered, but it might not provide immediate information about her current condition or the need for urgent intervention. Option C, ordering an HIV antibody test, is not typically indicated in this context unless there is specific reason to suspect HIV infection, which is not suggested based on the given information. Option D, repeating the PPD skin test, might not clarify the situation further since the initial test was positive, suggesting active infection."
