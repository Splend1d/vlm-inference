By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts.\n\nThis statement is not entirely accurate because it suggests that there was a significant effort in the 1970s to broaden the scope of peace studies, but it also implies that this effort failed. While it's true that some scholars did advocate for a broader focus on peace studies, including integrating social justice, environmental concerns, and other global issues into the field, there is no definitive historical record suggesting that such efforts were universally unsuccessful or that they did not lead to significant advancements in the discipline. In fact, over time, peace studies have indeed expanded its scope to include a wider range of issues beyond traditional military conflicts.\n\nThe other statements are generally accurate representations of aspects of the development of peace studies in the 20th century:\n\nA. The development of peace studies did indeed see a growing interest in conflict prevention, resolution, and peacekeeping as the understanding of complex causes and dynamics of conflict deepened.\n\nB. During the height of the Cold War, peace studies faced criticism and skepticism, often being associated with appeasement due to its focus on reducing violence rather than engaging in direct confrontation with adversaries.\n\nD. Peace studies evolved to emphasize a more holistic approach to conflict, moving away from state-centric views and incorporating perspectives from various social, economic, and environmental dimensions."
