A reporting mechanism and right to individual petition\n\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (and Protocol) has an enforcement mechanism that includes both a reporting mechanism and a right to individual petition. \n\n1. Reporting Mechanism: This involves states parties reporting periodically on the measures they have taken to implement the provisions of the covenant, and the progress made in this regard.\n\n2. Right to Individual Petition: Individuals can submit complaints about violations of their rights under the covenant to the Human Rights Committee, which is the body established by the UN to monitor the implementation of the covenant by its state parties. The committee then decides whether there has been a violation of the covenant and makes recommendations or decisions accordingly.\n\nSo, both options A and C are not entirely accurate because they do not encompass the full enforcement mechanism provided by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
