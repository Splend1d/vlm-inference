This means that both \"fit\" and \"unfit\" genes can be inherited, but the frequency of their occurrence in a population will change over time due to differential survival and reproductive success.\n\nB. Differential survival and reproductive success is a key component of natural selection, as it determines which individuals are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation.\nC. Competition for limited resources is another important factor in natural selection, as it drives the evolution of traits that help individuals obtain food, shelter, mates, and other resources necessary for survival and reproduction.\nD. Overproduction of offspring is also a crucial aspect of natural selection, as it increases the chances of some individuals producing enough offspring to ensure that at least some of them survive to adulthood and reproduce themselves."
