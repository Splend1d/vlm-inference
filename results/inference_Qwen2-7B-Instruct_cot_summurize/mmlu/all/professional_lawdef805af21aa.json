In the contract of sale, Beeson and Sloan agreed that the property was to be used for the purpose of building a commercial shopping mall. The contract required Beeson to pay Sloan a deposit of $12,500, with the balance of the purchase price payable at closing a month later on December 1. On November 24, the city council rezoned the property so that it could be used only for single-family residential purposes. As a consequence, Beeson refused to honor the contract. Sloan now brings an action for specific performance arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion places the loss on the buyer. Beeson argues that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him. If judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because\n\nA. Sloan assumed the risk.\nB. Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\nC. legal title remained in Sloan.\nD. equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n"

Equity, in this context, refers to principles of fairness and justice applied by courts, and the judge may decide that enforcing the contract would not be fair to Beeson, who may have been misled about the property's potential use. This decision might also take into account the risk assumption, implying that Beeson did not fully understand or was not adequately informed about the risks associated with purchasing property, particularly regarding zoning regulations. Therefore, the court might rule in favor of Beeson, releasing them from the contractual obligations due to circumstances beyond their control."
