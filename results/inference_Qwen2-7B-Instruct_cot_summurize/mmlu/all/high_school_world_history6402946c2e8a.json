Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.\nGhana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, addressing the Organization of African Unity, 1963\nWhich of the following factors was most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage?\n\nA.

He argues that these states must unite based on shared purposes, plans, and efforts to effectively develop and contribute to world peace. This suggests that ethnic, linguistic, and religious differences within African countries could hinder cooperation, as could external interference from the Cold War superpowers, which might support factions aligned with their geopolitical interests rather than promoting African unity and self-determination."
