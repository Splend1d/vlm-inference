Wundt set up a laboratory and focused on empirical evidence that could be replicated. \n\nWilhelm Wundt's establishment of the first laboratory dedicated to psychological research in 1879 was pivotal in establishing psychology as a scientific discipline. By conducting experiments and focusing on empirical evidence, Wundt laid the groundwork for the systematic study of the mind and behavior. This approach allowed for the testing of hypotheses, the replication of studies, and the accumulation of knowledge based on observable phenomena, all of which are fundamental aspects of the scientific method."
