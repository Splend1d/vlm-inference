This lack of competition allows the monopolist to control prices and output, as it is the sole supplier in the market. The other options do not accurately describe characteristics of a monopoly:\n\nB. Price equal to marginal revenue: In reality, in a monopoly, price is typically set above marginal revenue, because the monopolist can charge more due to the absence of close substitutes and the lack of competition.\n\nC. Perfectly elastic demand curve: Monopolies faces a downward sloping demand curve, not a perfectly elastic one. The demand curve slopes downward because the monopolist must lower its price to sell additional units, unlike in perfect competition where demand is considered perfectly elastic ( (price equals the marginal cost).\n\nD. Weak barriers to entry: This is actually a characteristic of oligopoly or competitive markets rather than monopoly. Monopolies has strong barriers to entry because new firms cannot easily enter the market due to factors like patents, exclusive control over resources, or high startup costs."
