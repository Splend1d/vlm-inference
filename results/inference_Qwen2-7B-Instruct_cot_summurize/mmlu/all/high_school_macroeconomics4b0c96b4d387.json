Real GDP will remain unchanged.\n\nThe government spending increase of $12 million and the tax collection increase of $12 million would not necessarily have an impact on the real GDP. When the government increases its spending, it can stimulate the economy by increasing demand for goods and services. However, if the government simultaneously raises taxes by the same amount, it might reduce consumer purchasing power or investment, potentially offsetting the initial stimulus effect of increased government spending. \n\nIn this scenario, the net effect on aggregate demand (and thus on real GDP, would depend on how these changes interact with other economic factors such as the multiplier effect, changes in consumption and investment, and the level of government spending relative to private sector spending. If the increase in government spending is exactly offset by the increase in taxes, and assuming no other changes in the economy, the overall impact on real GDP would likely be zero. \n\nIt's important to note that in reality, the actual impact could be different due to various economic factors and behavioral responses not accounted for in this simplified scenario."
