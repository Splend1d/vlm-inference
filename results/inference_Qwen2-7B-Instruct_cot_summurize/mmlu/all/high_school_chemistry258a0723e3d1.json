This method can help identify and quantify various isotopes of an element, which are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. By analyzing the relative abundances of these isotopes, scientists can gain insights into the isotopic composition of samples, which is crucial for understanding processes such as radioactive decay, nuclear reactions, and the formation of molecules in various environments (including biological systems, geological processes, and interstellar media. Therefore, examining data obtained from mass spectrometry does support the understanding of the existence and properties of isotopes."
