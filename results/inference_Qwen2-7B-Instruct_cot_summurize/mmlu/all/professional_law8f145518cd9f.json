The defendant denied that he stamped the letters. There were no witnesses to the defendant stamping the letters. The prosecution attempted to present a co-worker to testify that defendant maintained sole control of the stamp and used it once daily at 3 p.m. to sign all outgoing letters, and then immediately returned it to his safe. The co-worker would testify that he saw the defendant using the stamp in that habitual manner over a period of many years. The defense objected because this did not prove that the defendant's practice was followed on the dates in question. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, what will the court rule?\n\nA. The testimony is inadmissible because evidence of habit is not admissible in a criminal case under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\nB. The testimony is inadmissible because evidence of prior habit will only distract the jury from deciding whether the defendant actually acted that way on the specified dates.\nC. The testimony is admissible because it proves that the defendant was the only person who could have used the stamp.\nD. The testimony is admissible because habit and routine practice are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n"

The testimony is admissible because habit and routine practice are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of a person's habit or routine practice may be admitted to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the habit or routine. This type of evidence is known as \"habit evidence\" and can be used to show that a person typically conducts themselves in a certain way, which can be relevant to proving the identity of the perpetrator in certain circumstances.\n\nIn this case, the co-worker's testimony about the defendant's habitual use of the stamp to sign outgoing letters could potentially establish that the defendant had the opportunity to affix the rubber-stamp containing his signature to the fraudulent letters, given that there were no witnesses to the act itself. However, it's important to note that while this type of evidence can be persuasive, it still needs to be considered alongside other evidence in the case, and the jury must ultimately determine if the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on all the evidence presented."
