However, considering the context and the closest fit to what might be asked, option B \"Platelet\" could be seen as relevant since platelets are derived from megakaryocytes, which are part of the myeloid lineage.\n\nGiven the options you've provided, none of them directly matches the correct answer based on standard biological knowledge. However, if we're to choose the most appropriate one among the given choices, the answer would be:\n\nB.
