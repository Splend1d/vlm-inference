Impact. This refers to how significantly the message affects the audience or the situation it addresses. Impact can encompass various factors such as the relevance, urgency, and emotional resonance of the message. Public relations professionals often aim to craft messages that have a high impact to ensure they are noticed, understood, and acted upon by their target audience.\n\nWhile all the criteria mentioned (proximity, timeliness, prominence, and impact\u2014play significant roles in determining the effectiveness of news and public relations messages\u2014impact tends to be the overarching goal that guides the creation and dissemination of these messages. It integrates elements of the other criteria, such as ensuring that a timely, prominent, and relevant message has a substantial effect on its intended audience."
