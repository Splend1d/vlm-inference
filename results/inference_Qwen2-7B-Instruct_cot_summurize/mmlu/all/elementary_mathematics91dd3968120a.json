Since vinegar corresponds to 2 parts, you divide the amount of vinegar by the vinegar ratio to find out how many total \"parts\" you're dealing with:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total parts} = \\frac{\\text{Amount of vinegar}}{\\text{Vinegar ratio}} = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\]\n\nThis means that for every ounce of vinegar, you need 0.45 parts of oil (because \\(4.5 \\div 9 = 0.45\\). To find out how much oil you need for 9 ounces of vinegar, multiply the number of parts of vinegar by the oil ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Oil needed} = \\text{Amount of vinegar} \\times (\\text{Oil ratio} / \\text{Vinegar ratio}) = 9 \\times (0.45 = 4.05 \\]\n\nHowever, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the calculation or the options provided because none of them match exactly 4.05. Given the closest options and correcting for a potential misinterpretation or rounding in the explanation:\n\nThe correct approach to directly use the ratio without breaking down into parts would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Oil} = \\text{Amount of vinegar} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Oil ratio}}{\\text{Vinegar ratio}} \\right) = 9 \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\right) = 9 \\times 2.5 = 22.5 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 22.5 ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar."
