He signed an agreement with the local swimming club to use their swimming pool four times per week. The agreement, which had a duration of one year, stated that the man could use the poo1 four times per week for $250 per month, due on the first day of each month. For three months, the man paid the $250 on the first and made use of the swimming pool. Toward the middle of the third month, the man was involved in an automobile accident. Shortly thereafter, the man sent the following letter to the swimming club:\"Please be advised that because of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, my physician has advised me not to engage in any strenuous activities. Since I will not be able to make use of the pool anymore, no further payments will be forthcoming. \"Which of the following does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter?\n\nA. The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pooi.\nB. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.\nC. The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.\nD. The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pool. This is true because the man's letter effectively communicates his intent to breach the contract by refusing to pay future installments. The swimming club can enforce this right as soon as it receives the letter.\n\nB. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract. This statement is also accurate because the man's letter constitutes a repudiation of the contract, allowing the swimming club to take legal action to enforce the agreement.\n\nC. The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him. This is correct because under the doctrine of rescission, the man can still fulfill his contractual obligations and avoid legal consequences if he retracts his repudiation before the swimming club takes any action.\n\nD. The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract. This statement is incorrect. Once the man repudiates the contract through his letter, the swimming club can immediately take legal action to enforce the contract, regardless of when the next payment is due. There is no requirement for the club to wait until the next payment date before initiating legal proceedings for breach of contract."
