The homeowner then gives a bank a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the bank to the homeowner in the amount of $50,000. The investor then records. The bank then records. The homeowner lost his job and was unable to pay the mortgages on the property.

The party with the earliest recordation date has the highest priority. Here's how it breaks down:\n\n1. **Friend**: The friend's mortgage was was was recorded first, so they have the highest priority.\n2. **Investor**: The investor's mortgage was0 was recorded after the friend's but before the bank's, so their mortgage comes second in line.\n3. **Bank**: The bank's mortgage was recorded last, giving them the lowest priority.\n\nWhen the property is sold at foreclosure for $160,000, the proceeds will be distributed according to the priority of the mortgages:\n\n- First, the friend would receive the full amount of their mortgage, which is $100,000, since their mortgage had the earliest recordation date.\n- After paying off the friend, there would be $160,000 - $100,000 = $60,000 remaining.\n- Next, the investor would receive their full amount of $80,000, but since only $60,000 is left, they would receive the entire $60,000 available, leaving no funds for further distribution.\n- Finally, the bank would not receive any funds since there are not enough proceeds left to cover its mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. $0.00** for the friend, because the amount they are owed ($100,000) exceeds the sale price of the property ($160,000), leaving nothing to distribute beyond that amount."
