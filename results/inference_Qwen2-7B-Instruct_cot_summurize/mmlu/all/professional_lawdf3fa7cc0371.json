On March 25, as the landscaper was almost finished with the work on the front yard, the homeowner said to the landscaper, \"I'm very pleased with your work to date. If you are willing, I would like you to landscape my backyard, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 1. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time. \" The landscaper replied, \"Agreed. Let's shake hands on it. \" They shook hands. What is the probable legal effect of the landscaper's promise on March 25 to landscape the backyard?\n\nA. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable unilateral contract.\nB. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\nC. The landscaper's promise was voidable, since it was not in writing.\nD. The landscaper's promise was illusory, thereby creating an unenforceable contract.\n"

                    "text": "The landscaper's promise on March 25 to landscape the backyard would most likely create an enforceable bilateral contract (B. This is because there was a mutual exchange of promises: the homeowner offered to pay the landscaper $10,000 upon completion of the work, and the landscaper agreed to perform the additional landscaping work in the backyard within the specified timeframe. The handshake, while not legally binding in all jurisdictions without words or actions affirming the agreement, along with the clear offer and acceptance, indicates a meeting of the minds and thus creates a binding agreement. \n\nOptions A, C, and D are do not accurately reflect the situation described:\n\n- A. Unilateral contracts typically involve one party making a promise to perform an action in exchange for something of value from another party ( (here, the homeowner did not promise to do anything specific in return for the landscaper's action).\n- C. There is no requirement that all contracts be in writing for them to be enforceable in every case. The nature of the agreement (being bilateral and involving a clear exchange of promises - makes this option less applicable.\n- D. An illusory contract implies that one party has no obligation to fulfill their part of the agreement, which does not fit the scenario where both parties have clearly agreed to specific terms.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is B, assuming standard legal principles apply, and considering the context provided."
