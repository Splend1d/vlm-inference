However, to conclusively determine the correct answer, we need to consider if there's a specific property that holds for all numbers in the sequence.\n\nGiven that the pattern starts with 28 and each subsequent number is obtained by adding 14, we notice that every number in the sequence will be of the form \\(28 + 14n\\), where \\(n\\) is a non-negative integer. This means:\n\n- Every number in the sequence is divisible by 7, as 28 is divisible by 7, and adding multiples of 14 (which is also divisible by 7 (to a multiple of 7) keeps the result a multiple of 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**D. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 7.**\n\nThis is the only option that must hold true for every number in the sequence given the rule of adding 14 to generate the next number from the previous one."
