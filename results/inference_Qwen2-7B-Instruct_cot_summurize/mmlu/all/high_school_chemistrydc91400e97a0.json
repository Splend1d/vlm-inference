The samples were titrated with standard potassium hydroxide, KOH, solution. Cresol red was the acid-base indicator used in the titration. The samples required 31.75, 32.38, and 41.75 mL to reach the endpoint. Which of the following might explain why one of the samples required significantly more base to reach the endpoint?\n\nA.

There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker.\n\nThe reason this option is correct is that if there's a base contaminating the beaker, it would increase the initial concentration of the base (in this case, the conjugate base of phenol, which is C6H5O-. This would lead to a higher pH at the beginning of the titration. As a result, more base (KOH in this case - would be needed to reach the equivalence point, where the moles of KOH equals the moles of C6H5O-. This would explain why one of the samples required significantly more base to reach the endpoint compared to the others. \n\nOptions A, B, and D do not explain the need for significantly more base to reach the endpoint. Adding the indicator too late or using the wrong indicator wouldn't cause such a significant difference in volume required for titration. Similarly, contamination by acid wouldn't increase the volume of base needed; instead, it would decrease it, since the acid would react with the base before reaching the equivalence point."
