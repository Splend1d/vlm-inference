Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the outcomes listed below followed the delivery of Lin Zexu's letter?\n\nA. Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West\nB. A successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories\nC. Violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority\nD. The expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory\n"

However, the context of his letter was related to the Opium Wars between China and Britain, particularly the First Opium War.\n\nThe letter did not achieve its intended goal of banning the opium trade in China as the British government refused to comply with Lin's demands. Instead, the situation escalated into military conflict. The British used their superior naval power to defeat the Chinese navy, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, which imposed new trade terms more favorable to the West ( (Outcome A). This treaty also resulted in the cession of Hong Kong to Britain, among other concessions.\n\nTherefore, the closest correct answer based on historical events would be:\n\nA. Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the letter itself did not directly lead to any of the listed outcomes but was part of a larger series of diplomatic exchanges and conflicts leading up to the Opium Wars."
