Economic interdependency between states will strengthen global security and lead to a reduction in international conflict. Human migration will lead to overcrowding and resource scarcity but this will be addressed by the technological advancements of developing states to which most migration will take place.\nC. The primary cause of conflict, both at international and sub-national level will be based in ideological differences between populations as resources scarcity, population growth and human migration forces diverse identity groups into increasingly close contact.\nD. Environmental concerns will be overshadowed by immediate threats to international security, posed by global economic crisis and the subsequent rise of fundamentalist ideologies and violence. Human migration will be managed within the current global economic system as poverty restricts movement although there is a limited risk of transnational revolt as a result of disempowerment and resource scarcity.\n"

Human migration will indeed arise as a result of global inequalities in the distribution of power, wealth, and resources. Disempowerment of populations can lead to competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements. Environmental threats and resources scarcity will exacerbate these issues, leading to conflict over access to essential resources such as water, food, and energy.\n\nB. While economic interdependency between states has the potential to strengthen global security and reduce international conflict, it also creates vulnerabilities that can be exploited. For example, during economic crises, countries may become more isolated and less cooperative, potentially increasing tensions. Moreover, the uneven distribution of technological advancements does not necessarily solve the problem of resource scarcity or overcrowding, especially in regions where these technologies are not available or accessible to all.\n\nC. Ideological differences are certainly factors in some conflicts, but the primary causes of conflict in the 21st century are likely to be more complex. They include not only ideological differences but also economic disparities, political instability, environmental degradation, and demographic pressures. As populations grow and resources become scarcer, diverse identity groups may come into closer contact, leading to increased friction and potential conflict.\n\nD. Environmental concerns cannot be overshadowed by immediate threats to international security. Climate change and environmental degradation pose significant long-term risks that will impact economic stability, food security, and geopolitical dynamics. This, in turn, can fuel conflicts over resources and exacerbate existing tensions. While the global economic system may manage migration to some extent, it cannot address the root causes of environmental degradation and inequality that drive conflict. Moreover, the risk of transnational revolt due to disempowerment and resource scarcity remains high, particularly in regions where governments are are weak or unable to provide basic services and protection.\n\nIn conclusion, the nature of developing conflicts in the 21st century will be shaped by a combination of economic, political, social, and environmental factors. Addressing these issues will require a comprehensive and multifaceted approach that takes into account the interconnectedness of these factors and their potential to exacerbate each other."
