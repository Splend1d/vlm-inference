Yes, every builder-seller warrants that a newly constructed home is built in a good and workmanlike manner.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, there is an implied warranty of habitability in a new construction contract. This means that the builder-seller guarantees that the home is built in a good and workmanlike manner, free from major defects that would prevent it from being habitable or safe to occupy. If the buyer experiences drainage and interior flooding problems due to the home not meeting code regulations, this could be considered a breach of this warranty. Therefore, the court may hold the builder-seller liable to repair the defects at their own expense."
