For a given level of government spending they produce a deficit during a recession and a surplus during an expansion.\n\nAutomatic fiscal policy stabilizers refer to government programs that adjust automatically in response to changes in the economy, typically smoothing out economic fluctuations without requiring explicit legislative action. These stabilizers operate through mechanisms like progressive taxation (where higher income earners pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes) and unemployment insurance, which increase government spending (or decrease revenue) during recessions when incomes fall and decrease government spending (or increase revenue) during expansions when incomes rise. This helps to stabilize the economy by counteracting the effects of business cycles. \n\nSo, option A is correct because during a recession, when incomes and taxable incomes fall, government revenues also decline, but spending on social services such as unemployment benefits may rise, leading to a budget deficit. Conversely, during an expansion, when incomes and taxable incomes rise, government revenues increase, while spending on social services might fall, potentially leading to a budget surplus.\n\nOptions B and D are incorrect because automatic fiscal stabilizers aim to shorten recessionary and inflationary periods rather than prolong them. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that a regressive tax system ( where lower income earners pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes - is a fundamental component of automatic stabilizers, which is not accurate; progressive taxation is what leads to automatic stabilization."
