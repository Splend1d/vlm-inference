In other words, it's the number of slots between the start and end points of a single loop of wire.\n\nIf there are 100 conductors and 10 parallel paths, then each path consists of \\( \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\) conductors.\n\nSince the conductors form loops that span across the slots on the rotor, the pitch (P) can be calculated by taking the total number of slots per pole (S divided by the number of conductors per loop (C:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{S}{C} \\]\n\nHowever, we do not have the direct information about the number of slots per pole (S). But since each conductor forms a complete loop and spans over 10 slots (as deduced from the fact that there are 10 conductors per path and 10 paths, this implies each conductor occupies 10 slots.\n\nTherefore, the pitch would be the number of slots per conductor, which is 10.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 10."
