Science seeks to understand the natural world through empirical evidence, while ethics seeks to understand moral truths and principles.\n\nB. Both are are considered essential components of a worthwhile life. Science helps us understand the universe and improve our lives, while ethics guides our behavior and relationships, helping us lead more morally fulfilling lives.\n\nC. Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. In science, hypotheses are tested through experiments and observations. Similarly, ethical theories are evaluated by considering the logical implications of those theories on various scenarios and situations."
