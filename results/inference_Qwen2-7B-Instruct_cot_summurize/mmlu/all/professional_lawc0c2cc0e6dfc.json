At trial, after briefing from both parties, the court permitted the jury to hear testimony that there had been several previous accidents in the same building. The jury found for the student, and the university appealed. One of the university's arguments on appeal is that the testimony about the previous accidents should have been excluded as irrelevant and highly prejudicial. Which standard of review applies to this argument?\n\nA. Abuse of discretion.\nB. Clearly erroneous.\nC. De novo.\nD. Harmless error.\n"

Abuse of discretion.\n\nThis is because the decision to admit or exclude evidence is generally within the discretion of the trial judge, and such decisions will be upheld on appeal unless the reviewing court finds that the judge abused that discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial judge's decision is arbitrary, fanciful, or clearly unreasonable. In the context of admitting evidence, this means the judge made an error in judgment that was not merely wrong but so unreasonable that it constituted an abuse of the judge's discretion."
