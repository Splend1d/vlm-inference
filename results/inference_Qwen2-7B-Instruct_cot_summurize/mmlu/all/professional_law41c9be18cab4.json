The building was called a \"twin\" home, i.e., it was divided into two separate residential units. However, the front entrance was located entirely on one of the lots; there was a door through the party wall that the occupants of the adjoining residence used to access their home. Owner sold the lot on which the stairway was located to the buyer, and owner continued to reside in the remaining part of the building. The deed did not contain a reservation of a right to use the doorway. The parties later disputed whether owner could continue to use the entrance that was located on the lot that he sold. What will a court most appropriately decide regarding the rights of the disputing parties?\n\nA. The owner retained an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway.\nB. The buyer can prevent access to owner because the deed was defective in not reserving a right to use the doorway.\nC. The court will automatically order a new deed be drafted containing court-ordered language that includes a reservation of rights.\nD. The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of owner to use the doorway.\n"

In this case, since the owner relied on the doorway to access their portion of the building after selling the lot with the stairway, it can be argued that they have a need to continue using this access point. \n\nCourts generally recognize such implied easements as a way to ensure that property owners can effectively use their land without undue burden. The existence of a party wall and the practical necessity of using the doorway further support the argument for an implied easement. Therefore, the court would likely find that the owner has a legal right to continue using the entrance through the party wall."
