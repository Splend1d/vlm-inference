The implication is that if one considers the life of a fully developed individual to have intrinsic value, then the life of an embryo with potential to develop into a full individual should also be considered valuable.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not directly address the argument about higher mental capacities and the criteria for personhood. Option A suggests that embryos do possess such capacities, which contradicts the original argument, but does not provide a direct response. Option B questions the relevance or meaning of saying that a person exercises higher mental capacities, which is more of a philosophical stance rather than a response to the specific argument presented. Option C acknowledges the soundness of the argument but identifies a logical fallacy, which does not provide a counterpoint to the argument itself.\n\nTherefore, option D provides a direct ethical counterpoint to the argument that embryos are not persons because they lack certain cognitive abilities, by emphasizing the continuity and moral equivalence between an embryo and a fully formed person."
