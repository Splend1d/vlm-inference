The defendant put a loaded gun in his coat pocket and went outside for a walk, not sure if and when he may see the victim. The defendant passed by a bar and decided to go inside for a drink. While in the bar, he drank several bottles of beer and became intoxicated. While walking home from the bar, the defendant bumped into the victim. As soon as the defendant recognized him, he pulled out his gun and shot and killed the victim. In this jurisdiction, first-degree murder is defined as a premeditated and deliberate killing. All other forms of murder are second-degree murder. The defendant is guilty of\n\nA. first-degree murder.\nB. second-degree murder.\nC. involuntary manslaughter.\nD. voluntary manslaughter.\n"

The fact that the defendant carried a loaded gun with them and planned to potentially use it against the victim suggests that there was time for premeditation. Additionally, the decision to go to a bar and consume multiple bottles of beer, which led to intoxication, could be seen as an action that furthered the intent to commit the crime rather than impulsively acting upon seeing the victim.\n\nTherefore, given the definition of first-degree murder as a premeditated and deliberate killing, the defendant would most likely be found guilty of:\n\nA. First-degree murder."
