Low income so decreased ability to purchase nutrient-rich foods\n\nThis statement is not universally applicable as an increased risk factor for vitamin or mineral deficiencies among older people in high-income countries. While low income can certainly be a barrier to purchasing nutritious foods, it is not a characteristic exclusive to high-income countries. Moreover, older people in high-income countries often have access to a variety of food options and may not face the same affordability issues compared to those in lower-income settings.\n\nThe other statements listed are valid reasons for increased risk of deficiencies among older individuals:\n\nB. Decreased mobility and little time spent outdoors in the sunshine: Older adults might have reduced mobility which limits their ability to engage in outdoor activities that provide natural sunlight exposure necessary for vitamin D synthesis.\n  \nC. Decreased intrinsic factor in the stomach: As people age, their stomach's ability to produce intrinsic factor, a protein essential for vitamin B12 absorption, can decrease, leading to potential deficiencies.\n\nD. High nutrient requirements for tissue turnover: Older adults often require higher nutrient intakes due to changes in body composition and metabolism, such as muscle loss ( (sarcopenia), but their dietary intake may not keep up with these needs."
