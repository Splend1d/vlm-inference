However, during a recession, when there is a significant drop in aggregate demand leading to unemployment, classical economists suggest that the best way for an economy to return to full employment is through expansionary monetary policy. This involves measures taken by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to increase the money supply, which can lead to lower interest rates and stimulate borrowing and investment. This increase in economic activity helps to reduce unemployment and return the economy to full employment.\n\nOptions A ( falling wages and prices, B: rising wages and prices, and D: increased government spending are not typically viewed as the primary means of returning an economy to full employment according to classical analysis. Falling wages and prices might occur naturally in a recession but are not seen as a proactive solution. Rising wages and prices could potentially lead to inflation rather than recovery from recession. Increased government spending might help in the short term, but classical economists generally advocate for reducing government intervention in the economy during recessions."
