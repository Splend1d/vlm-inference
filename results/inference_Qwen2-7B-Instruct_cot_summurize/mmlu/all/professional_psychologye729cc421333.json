Critical period.\n\nA critical period refers to a specific timeframe during development when an organism is particularly sensitive to certain experiences or environmental stimuli. If these experiences occur within the critical period, they can have a significant impact on development. If the critical period passes without the necessary experience, the individual may not be able to develop the expected skills or abilities, even if the opportunity presents itself later. \n\nSensitive periods and secular trends could also relate to developmental concepts, but they do not specifically address the timing differences across cohorts due to genetic or environmental influences in the way that critical periods do. Canalization refers to the process by which development tends to follow a typical path despite variation in the environment, but it does not directly address the concept of timing differences across cohorts."
