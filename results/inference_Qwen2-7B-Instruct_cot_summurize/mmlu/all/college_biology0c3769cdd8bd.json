This change in protein structure or function can lead to a new phenotype. \n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\nB. The polarity of tRNA does not become opposite to that of DNA; rather, it's the anticodon of tRNA that matches the codon on mRNA.\nC. Methylation of nucleic acids typically has specific functions and does not directly lead to a new phenotype through altering the sequence or function of proteins.\nD. Reading a gene in the 3' to 5' direction is not how genes are expressed in cells; genes are transcribed in the 5' to 3' direction."
