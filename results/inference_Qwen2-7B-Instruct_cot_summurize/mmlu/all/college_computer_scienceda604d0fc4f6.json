The worst-case scenario would be when Bob's answers is such that it maximally splits the remaining possibilities into two halves after each question. \n\nIn the first question, Bob can tell us whether the number is in the lower half (1-500) or the upper half (501-1000). \n\nIf it's in the lower half, we again ask about the subinterval 1-250, and so on. Each time we split the interval in half.\n\nTo find out how many questions are needed in the worst case to find the number:\n\nWe need to solve for \\(n\\) in the inequality: \\(2^n \\geq 1000\\).\n\n\\(2^9 = 512\\), and \\(2^{10} = 1024\\).\n\nSo, it takes 10 questions in the worst case to determine the number between 1 and 1000 if we use an optimal strategy.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 10."
