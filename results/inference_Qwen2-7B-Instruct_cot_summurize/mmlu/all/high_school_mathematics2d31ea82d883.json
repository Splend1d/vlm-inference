Here, it's more straightforward to use the disk/washer method because we're rotating about the y-axis.\n\nFirst, let's find the points of intersection between \\(y = e^x\\) and \\(y = 2\\). Setting them equal to each other:\n\n\\[e^x = 2\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n\\[x = \\ln(2)\\]\n\nThis gives us the upper limit of integration. Since we're rotating around the y-axis, we need to express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\) for our function, which is \\(x = \\ln(y)\\) ( since \\(y = e^x\\) implies \\(x = \\ln(y)\\).\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) of the solid of revolution can be found using the washer method formula:\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} [R(y)]^2 - [r(y)]^2 dy\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(R(y)\\) is the outer radius,\n- \\(r(y)\\) is the inner radius,\n- \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the limits of integration.\n\nIn this case, the outer radius \\(R(y)\\) is given by \\(y = 2\\), and the inner radius \\(r(y)\\) is given by \\(y = e^x\\), or equivalently \\(y = e^{\\ln(y)} = y\\), since \\(y\\) is now our variable of integration.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{1}^{2} (2^2 - y^2 dy\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{1}^{2} (4 - y^2 dy\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi [4y - \\frac{1}{3}y^3]_{1}^{2}\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi [(4*2 - \\frac{1}{3}*2^3) - ( (4*1 - \\frac{1}{3}*1^3)]\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi [(8 - \\frac{8}{3}) - ( (4 - \\frac{1}{3})]\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi [8 - \\frac{8}{3} - 4 + \\frac{1}{3}]\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi [\\frac{24}{3} - \\frac{8}{3} - \\frac{12}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}]\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi [\\frac{5}{3}]\\]\n\n\\[V = \\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\]\n\nEvaluating this gives approximately:\n\n\\[V \u2248 \\frac{5 * 3.1416}{3} \u2248 5.236\\]\n\nNone of the provided answer choices (A. 0.296, B. 0.592, C. 2.427, D. 3.998 match the calculated value of approximately 5.236. It seems there might have been an error in either the calculation or the provided options. The correct calculation leads to a different result than those given."
