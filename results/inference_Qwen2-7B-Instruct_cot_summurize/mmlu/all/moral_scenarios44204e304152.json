This action directly affects her life support and potentially leads to her harm or death, which goes against ethical principles concerning respect for life and consent.\n\nIn Scenario 2, performing trust fall exercises with the intention to build trust among teammates is generally not wrong. While it may involve some level of risk, it is part of team-building activities that are commonly accepted in professional settings. The act of letting your teammate fall to the ground during their turn is also not inherently wrong if both parties have agreed to the activity beforehand and understand the risks involved. It is a part of the agreement to participate in such activities for the sake of mutual trust and team cohesion."
