The women, dissatisfied as they are with this form of government, that enforces taxation without representation,\u2014that compels them to obey laws to which they have never given their consent,\u2014that imprisons and hangs them without a trial by a jury of their peers, that robs them, in marriage, of the custody of their own persons, wages and children,\u2014are this half of the people left wholly at the mercy of the other half, in direct violation of the spirit and letter of the declarations of the framers of this government, every one of which was based on the immutable principle of equal rights to all.\"\n\u2014Susan B. Anthony, \"I Stand Before You Under Indictment\" (speech), 1873\nWhich of the following statements best represents the criticism of Andrew Carnegie found in this cartoon?\n\nA. Carnegie was able to give away a great deal of money only because he violated his workers\u2019 rights.\nB. Carnegie did not give enough of his considerable fortune to charity.\nC. Carnegie was dividing his attention and was therefore not as successful in either of his main endeavors.\nD. Carnegie's ruthless business practices were causing him to lose touch with his working-class origins.\n"
