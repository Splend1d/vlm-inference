It is more significant in small populations because there is less genetic variation to begin with, and the effects of random events can have a larger impact on allele frequencies. In contrast, mutation, non-random mating, and natural selection can occur in populations of any size, but their effects might be more pronounced or predictable in larger populations due to the greater genetic variability and the law of large numbers."
