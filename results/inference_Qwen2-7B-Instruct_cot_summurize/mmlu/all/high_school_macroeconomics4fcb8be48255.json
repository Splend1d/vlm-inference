This is because they anticipate that prices will rise in the future, making their current money less valuable. As a result, they may choose to spend or invest their money sooner, leading to an increase in the demand for money. This phenomenon is known as precautionary demand for money.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. A recession typically leads to lower aggregate demand and, consequently, lower interest rates, which might encourage spending and reduce the demand for money.\n\nB. A higher price level generally results in lower real balances ( (money's purchasing power decreases), but it does not necessarily lead to an increase in the demand for money; rather, it can cause a decrease if people anticipate further inflation.\n\nC. Higher interest rates usually make borrowing more expensive, which might discourage spending and investment, thus potentially reducing the demand for money, not increasing it."
