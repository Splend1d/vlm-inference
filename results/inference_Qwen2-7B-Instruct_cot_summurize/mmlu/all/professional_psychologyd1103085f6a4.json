When using aversive techniques, such as punishment, to teach a new behavior, it can lead to increased emotional reactivity in the individual being trained. This is because the aversive stimuli can cause feelings of fear, anxiety, or anger, which can make learning more difficult and potentially harmful for the individual. It's important to note that while punishment may suppress unwanted behavior in the short term, it does not necessarily lead to long-term changes in behavior or improve the individual's ability to learn new behaviors."
