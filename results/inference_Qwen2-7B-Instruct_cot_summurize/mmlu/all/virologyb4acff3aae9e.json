Men with frequent unprotected sex\n\nPreP involves taking antiretroviral medications to prevent HIV infection. It is primarily recommended for individuals who are at high risk of acquiring HIV, such as those with consistent and frequent exposure to the virus, often due to sexual practices without protection. Therefore, men who engage in frequent unprotected sex would fall into this category. However, it's important to note that PreP can also be beneficial for other high-risk groups, including women and individuals in certain occupational settings.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare provider to determine if PreP is appropriate based on your individual risk factors and health status."
