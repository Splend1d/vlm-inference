An elderly woman, who was worried about her failing health, had heard that the fortuneteller was clairvoyant and could see into the future. Consequently, the woman decided to see the fortuneteller in order to have her Tarot cards read. As the fortuneteller was telling the woman her fortune, she suddenly said, \"I have a vision. If you give me $25,000 tomorrow, you will live to be 100 years old. \" The woman, who was 72 years of age, believed the fortuneteller and gave her the money the next day. The following week, the woman's physician informed her that she had a serious heart disease and he didn't expect her to live for more than a year or two. If the woman asserts a claim against the fortuneteller based on deceit, the plaintiff should\n\nA. prevail, because she relied to her detriment on the fortune teller's foretelling.\nB. prevail, if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe that the woman would live to be 100 years of age.\nC. not prevail, unless there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties.\nD. not prevail, unless the fortuneteller warranted the truth as believed.\n"

A fiduciary relationship exists when one party places trust and confidence in another, and there is a corresponding duty to act in the best interests of the former. In the context of a fortune teller, such a relationship may not typically be assumed unless specifically circumstances indicate an unusual level of trust and reliance beyond what is common for entertainment services.\n\nDeceit requires proof that the defendant intentionally misled the plaintiff with false information, causing the plaintiff to suffer harm. Without evidence of a fiduciary relationship, the plaintiff cannot argue that the defendant had a specific duty to provide truthful information. Additionally, the mere fact that the prediction did not come true does not automatically imply deceit; it must be shown that the defendant knew the statement was false or acted recklessly without caring about the truthfulness of their prediction.\n\nOptions A and B suggest that the plaintiff should prevail under certain conditions, which are not necessarily met in this situation due to the lack of a pre-existing fiduciary relationship. Option D implies that the fortuneteller must have warranted the truth as believed for the plaintiff to have grounds for a deceit claim, which is not a standard requirement for establishing deceit in general legal contexts."
