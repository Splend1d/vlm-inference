Free trade allows each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve.\n\nExplanation:\n- A) Nations may specialize based on comparative advantage, not just absolute advantage. Comparative advantage refers to producing a good at a lower opportunity cost than another good, even if they are both better at producing it (than the other country. \n- B) This is true. By trading with other nations, countries can consume more than what they could produce alone within their own production possibility frontier. This is because countries can specialize in what they produce most efficiently and trade for what they need but cannot produce as efficiently.\n- C) This is incorrect. While specialization can occur based on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage, the principle that matters most in trade is comparative advantage, not absolute advantage.\n- D) This is false. Protecting domestic industries through tariffs or other trade barriers does not allow nations to consume beyond their production possibility curve. It merely reduces the volume of trade and the efficiency of resource allocation."
