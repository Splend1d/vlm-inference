POSITIVE FEEDBACK\u2192 disrupting homeostasis by creating deviations in the status quo\n\nIn the context of systems theory and family systems, positive feedback typically refers to a mechanism where the output of a system amplifies its input, leading to an increase or decrease in the state of the system. However, it is not directly related to \"disrupting homeostasis\" or \"creating deviations in the status quo.\" While positive feedback can indeed disrupt equilibrium or homeostasis in some systems, this specific framing is not a standard definition within systems theory as it pertains to family dynamics.\n\nLet's clarify the other options:\nA. EQUIFINALITY ( refers to the idea that regardless of the path taken, the outcome is the same. This concept implies that different processes or pathways can lead to a single, identical final state.\nB. WHOLENESS suggests that the collective behavior and properties of a system cannot be understood simply by analyzing its individual parts; rather, the whole exhibits emergent properties that are not present in the parts alone.\nC. HOMEOSTASIS is a biological term that describes the ability of a system to maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes. In the context of a family system, this could mean the family maintains certain norms, roles, or emotional states despite external pressures or conflicts.\n\nSo, while all these concepts are integral to understanding family systems from a systems theory perspective, option D does not capture the essence of how positive feedback operates or is conceptualized within systems theory."
