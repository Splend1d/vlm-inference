Total peripheral resistance.\n\nWhen an individual exercises, their heart rate increases as the body requires more oxygenated blood to be delivered to the muscles. This increase in heart rate leads to a decrease in total peripheral resistance ( because the body dilates blood vessels to allow for increased blood flow and oxygen delivery to the active muscles. This process helps maintain adequate blood flow despite the increased cardiac output.\n\nPulse pressure, stroke volume, and systolic blood pressure can actually increase during exercise due to the increased cardiac output and the body's compensatory mechanisms to maintain adequate perfusion pressure."
