Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a capillary column followed by electron capture detection\n\nGas Chromatography (GC is a technique used for separating and analyzing compounds in a mixture based on their boiling point or molecular size. The use of a capillary column allows for increased efficiency and capacity in the separation process. Electron Capture Detection (ECD is particularly sensitive to compounds containing halogens like chlorine, which is crucial for detecting CFCs.\n\nB and C are less suitable because Thermal Conductivity Detection (TCD and Flame Ionization Detection (FID both detect based on physical properties like thermal conductivity or ionization that aren't specifically sensitive to halogenated compounds like CFCs.\n\nD is not a measurement method but rather a chemical conversion and analytical technique. It involves converting the CFCs into chloride ions which can then be measured via titration with silver ions (Ag+). While this method could theoretically work for quantification after separation, it doesn't directly address the detection of trace amounts of CFCs in an air sample. Therefore, the most appropriate choice for direct detection would be option A."
