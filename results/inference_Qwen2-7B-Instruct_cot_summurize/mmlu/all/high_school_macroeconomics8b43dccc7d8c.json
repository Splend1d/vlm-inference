France should specialize in and export wine while Belgium should specialize in and export cheese.\n\nThe absolute advantage refers to the ability of a country to produce a particular good using fewer resources than another country. Based on the given data, France can produce both wine and cheese with fewer labor hours compared to Belgium. Therefore, France has an absolute advantage in both products.\n\nHowever, the comparative advantage refers to the ability of a country to produce a particular good at a lower opportunity cost than another country. Opportunity cost is the value of what must be forgone to obtain something. In this case, the opportunity cost is measured by the number of labor hours required to produce one unit of each product.\n\nTo determine the comparative advantage, we calculate the opportunity cost for each country:\n\nFor France:\n- Opportunity cost of producing wine = 80/40 = 2 units of cheese\n- Opportunity cost of produce cheese = 40/80 = 0.5 units of wine\n\nFor Belgium:\n- Opportunity cost of produce wine = 60/15 = 4 units of cheese\n- Opportunity cost of produce cheese = 60/60 = 1 unit of wine\n\nComparing the opportunity costs, we see that France has a lower opportunity cost in producing wine (0.5 units of wine instead of 2 units of cheese) compared to Belgium (4 units of cheese instead of 1 unit of wine). This means France has a comparative advantage in wine production. Conversely, Belgium has a lower opportunity cost in producing cheese (1 unit of wine instead of 4 units of cheese) compared to France (2 units of cheese instead of 0.5 units of wine), so Belgium has a comparative advantage in cheese production.\n\nTherefore, France should specialize in and export wine, while Belgium should specialize in and export cheese, to maximize efficiency and benefit from trade."
