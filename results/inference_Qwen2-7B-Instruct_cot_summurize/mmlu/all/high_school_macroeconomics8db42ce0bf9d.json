This calculation adjusts the nominal interest rate to reflect the actual cost of borrowing or return on lending after accounting for inflation. \n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. What one sees when looking at bank literature typically refers to the nominal interest rate, which is the stated interest rate on a loan or investment before adjusting for inflation.\n\nB. The nominal interest rate divided by the inflation rate does not represent the real interest rate. Instead, this formula would give you the percentage change in purchasing power per period due to changes in the price level, not the real interest rate itself.\n\nC. The nominal interest rate plus the anticipated inflation rate would not provide the real interest rate. Adding inflation to the nominal interest rate would result in an incorrect adjustment for the true cost or return, as it doesn't account for the reduction in purchasing power caused by inflation."
