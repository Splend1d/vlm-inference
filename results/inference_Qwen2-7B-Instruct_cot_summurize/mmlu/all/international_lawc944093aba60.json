This concept is based on the principle that all member states have a shared responsibility for the security of each other.\n\nAmong the options you provided:\n\nA. The right to self-defence by more than one nation acting in concert \u2013 This is a part of the principle of collective security, as it involves multiple nations coming together to defend a member state under the framework of international law, specifically the United Nations Charter.\n\nB. The right of one's allies to defend the victim State \u2013 This alignss with the concept of collective security, as it suggests that an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all, and thus necessitates a collective response.\n\nC. The authorisation of armed force by the UN Security Council \u2013 This is also consistent with collective security, as the UN Security Council can authorize collective action (including the use of armed force) under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n\nD. The authorisation of peacekeeping missions by the UN General Assembly \u2013 While the UN General Assembly plays a role in the decision-making process regarding peacekeeping operations, the actual authorization and deployment of such missions typically comes from the UN Security Council. Peacekeeping missions under collective security are aimed at preventing conflict or resolving disputes through non-military means, including monitoring ceasefires, protecting civilians, and supporting the implementation of peace agreements.\n\nIn summary, collective security encompasses all these elements, emphasizing the cooperation and joint actions among nations to ensure the security of each member state, often facilitated by international organizations like the United Nations."
