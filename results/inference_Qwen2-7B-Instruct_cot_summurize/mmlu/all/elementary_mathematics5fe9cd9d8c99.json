Calculate the total number of apples by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of apples per box.\n2. Divide the total number of apples by the number of apples used per pie.\n\nStep 1: Total number of apples = Number of boxes * Apples per box\n\\[ \\text{Total number of apples} = 15 \\times 18 \\]\n\nStep 2: Number of pies = Total number of apples / Apples per pie\n\\[ \\text{Number of pies} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of apples}}{7} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of apples} = 15 \\times 18 = 270 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of pies} = \\frac{270}{7} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of pies} = 38 \\text{ with a remainder} \\]\n\nSo, the bakers can make 38 whole apple pies with the apples they have. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 38."
