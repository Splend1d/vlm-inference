This action is entirely neutral and doesn't involve any moral wrongdoing. It's a common academic activity that respects others' space and time if conducted appropriately.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 1 leans towards being morally questionable ( while scenario 2 is not morally wrong."
