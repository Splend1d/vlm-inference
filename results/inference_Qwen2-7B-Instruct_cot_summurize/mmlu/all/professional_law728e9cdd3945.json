Prior to her father's death, the woman had already taken over the operations on the father's farm due to his declining health. Recently, the woman had granted a coal company rights to strip-mine coal from underneath the farm. Their agreement stipulated that the coal company would pay the woman a per-ton royalty for the coal extracted. In addition, the coal company agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace top soil on the surface of the land. After the coal company commenced its strip-mining operations, the woman noticed that the company was not filling in the excavated area as previously agreed. However, because the company paid the woman all the coal royalties from the strip mining, she did not voice any objection regarding its failure to replace the top soil. Two years later, the coal company had now completed its strip-mining operation under its arrangement with the woman. The coal company's right to strip-mine coal from the woman's property would be an example of a (an)\n\nA. profit-a-prendre.\nB. license.\nC. easement in gross.\nD. voluntary waste.\n"

A \"license\" is permission granted by one party to another to do something on their property, but it is revocable at will. It does not create a lasting interest in the land like a profit-a-prendre does.\n\nC. An \"easement in gross\" is a non-landlocked easement, meaning it is not appurtenant to any particular piece of land. It allows a person or entity to have a specific use of land belonging to someone else, but it does not involve extracting anything from the land.\n\nD. \"Voluntary waste\" refers to the intentional destruction or waste of property, which is not applicable to the scenario described where the woman is receiving royalties for coal extraction and has not objected to the coal company's actions."
