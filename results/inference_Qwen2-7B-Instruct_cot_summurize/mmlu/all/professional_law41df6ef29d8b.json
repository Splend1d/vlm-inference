After four hours of steady driving, the truck driver stopped at a lounge and consumed five bottles of beer. He left the tavern in an intoxicated condition and then drove off to make his final delivery. As he came to the top of a steep incline in the highway and started his descent, an 11-year-old girl suddenly darted out into the road directly in front of him. The truck driver slammed on his powerful air brakes and swerved sharply to the left to avoid hitting her, but the girl was struck by the tractor- trailer and was seriously injured. The girl's parents, on behalf of their daughter, assert a claim against the lumber company to recover damages for the girl's injuries. At trial, which of the following is LEAST likely to be admissible?\n\nA. Evidence that the truck driver's reputation for driving is poor, if the lumber company and truck driver argue that the latter was not negligent.\nB. Evidence that the truck driver pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of DUI arising from this incident.\nC. Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if an investigator for the lumber company's insurance company testified for the lumber company that they deny ownership of the truck.\nD. Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if the lumber company argues that the truck driver was an independent contractor.\n"

In this scenario, the fact that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer would typically be relevant to the issue of whether the lumber company should be held liable for damages under the theory of respondeat superior ( (if the truck driver was an employee) or under a theory of direct negligence or contractual liability. \n\nHowever, the statement by the insurance company investigator denying ownership of the truck is potentially problematic. Ownership denial could relate to the legal responsibility of the lumber company, but it doesn't necessarily address the issue of liability insurance coverage. Insurance coverage is usually not directly relevant to proving who owns the vehicle or who is responsible for the accident. It might be used to argue about the extent of the damages the lumber company may have to pay, but not as a direct factor in determining ownership or liability.\n\nIt's important to note that the rules of evidence vary by jurisdiction and can depend on specific procedural rules. For example, in some jurisdictions, statements made by parties regarding their ownership of property might be considered relevant to prove ownership itself, even if those statements are made during a conversation between an insurance adjuster and a party involved in a dispute. However, this would still need to be within the scope of admissibility under local evidentiary rules, which might consider such statements as hearsay unless there's an exception for admission under certain circumstances, like admissions by a party-opponent.\n\nIn summary, while the information about insurance coverage could be relevant to the broader case, the direct statement from the insurance company denying ownership might not be as directly relevant or admissible as other pieces of evidence, especially when it comes to establishing the lumber company's liability or responsibility for the accident."
