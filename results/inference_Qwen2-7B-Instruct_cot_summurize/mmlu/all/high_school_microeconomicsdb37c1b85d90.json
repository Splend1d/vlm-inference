This is because each firm is a price taker, meaning it has no control over the market price of its product and must accept the prevailing market price. The firm's demand curve represents the total quantity of the product that consumers are willing and able to purchase at each given price, across all possible prices in the market. Since this demand curve reflects the entire market demand, it is the same for every firm in the industry."
