The condition is more commonly diagnosed in adolescent girls and young women, although it can affect people of all genders and ages.\n\nBased on the information provided, **Maria, a 16-year-old Caucasian female, who is an A student and talented musician, but who feels that her life is out of control**, ( is the individual who would be most likely to develop anorexia nervosa among the options given. This conclusion is based on several factors:\n\n- **Age and gender**: Adolescence is a common time for onset of eating disorders, and females are disproportionately affected.\n- **Perfectionism and self-control**: Maria's concern about her life being \"out of control\" suggests she may have high standards for herself, which could contribute to feelings of inadequacy and the need to exert control over one aspect of her life ( such as her body image.\n- **Emotional stress**: Feeling overwhelmed can be a trigger for developing eating disorders as a coping mechanism.\n\nIt's important to note that the development of an eating disorder involves complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors, and not all individuals with these characteristics will develop anorexia nervosa. Early identification and intervention are crucial for effective treatment."
