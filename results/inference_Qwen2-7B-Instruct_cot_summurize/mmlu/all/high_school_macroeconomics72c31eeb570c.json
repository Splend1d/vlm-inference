Fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy.\n\nKeynesian economists believe that government intervention through fiscal policies ( such as changes in taxes and government spending - can be more effective in managing economic fluctuations compared to monetary policies, which involve adjustments in interest rates and money supply controlled by central banks. They argue that during recessions or depressions, increasing government spending or cutting taxes can stimulate aggregate demand and boost economic activity more directly and immediately than adjusting interest rates. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Keynesian economics also includes ideas about the elasticity of investment demand ( (which can vary based on the specific model), the inherent instability of the economy due to factors like business cycles ( (though this is not universally accepted within Keynesianism), and the potential role of inadequate demand rather than supply in causing economic downturns. But among the options provided, Keynesian economists would most likely agree with statement B: fiscal policy being more effective than monetary policy."
