The kernel of a homomorphism \\(f: G \\rightarrow H\\) is the set of all elements in \\(G\\) that map to the identity element in \\(H\\). By definition, the identity element in any group is distinct from the empty set, and thus, the kernel must contain at least the identity element of \\(G\\) ( if \\(G\\) is non-trivial. Therefore, the kernel of a homomorphism can be the trivial group (consisting only of the identity) but cannot be empty unless \\(G\\) itself is the trivial group.\n\nStatement 2 is true. It is indeed not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group. If there were such a homomorphism \\(f: G \\rightarrow H\\), where \\(G\\) is finite and \\(H\\) is infinite, then \\(f(G)\\), being a subgroup of \\(H\\), would also be finite ( because it's generated by a finite set (the image of the generators of \\(G\\) under \\(f\\)). This contradicts the assumption that \\(H\\) is infinite. Hence, the only homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group is the trivial one, which maps every element of the finite group to the identity element of the infinite group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
