Wrong, Not wrong\n\nSelling exotic wild animals without proper permits or in violation of wildlife protection laws would generally be considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020. This is because such actions can lead to illegal exploitation and harm to endangered species, and it goes against ethical considerations regarding animal welfare and conservation.\n\nOn the other hand, cloaking a new discovery made during work hours is not necessarily morally wrong. It depends on the context and the rules set by the employer. If there are no conflicts of interest, the employee might be entitled to claim intellectual property rights over their discovery. However, if the action involves deception or violates trust within the workplace, it could be considered unethical. But in general, the act itself doesn't have clear moral implications without additional information about the circumstances and the nature of the discovery."
