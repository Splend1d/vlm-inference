In each of these market structures, the condition of P > MC leads to an inefficient allocation of resources compared to a perfectly competitive market. This inefficiency results in a loss of potential economic welfare, which economists refer to as deadweight loss. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. All of the above."
