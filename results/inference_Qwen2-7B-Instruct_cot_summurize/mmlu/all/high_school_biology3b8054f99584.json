Breast milk contains maternal antibodies that protect against gastrointestinal pathogens. \n\nBreast milk is rich in immunoglobulins, particularly secretory IgA, which helps protect infants from infections, especially in the gut. It also contains other immune factors like lactoferrin and enzymes that aid in digestion and fight pathogens. While breast milk does contain nutrients that support infant growth and development, it does not contain vaccines, and it doesn't directly provide red blood cells with adult hemoglobin."
