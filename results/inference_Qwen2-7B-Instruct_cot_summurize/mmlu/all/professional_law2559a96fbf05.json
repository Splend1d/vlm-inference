She immediately contacted the seller and asked about the quality of the coin. The seller assured her that the coin was in mint condition. The collector then agreed to purchase the coin for $10,000. The contract stipulated that delivery would be \"F. O. B. at the collector's establishment,\" with payment to be made one week after delivery. The seller stated that the coin would be shipped out at the end of the week. When the collector received the coin, she noticed that the coin had a large scratch across the face. Nonetheless, the collector accepted delivery. Two weeks later, the collector sold the coin to another collector for $12,000. The collector has refused to pay anything to the seller. The seller brought a breach of contract action against the collector, who, in turn, has filed a counterclaim against the seller. Who is most likely to prevail, and in what amount?\n\nA. The collector is entitled to nominal damages, because the coin was received in a damaged condition.\nB. Neither party should prevail, because the risk of loss was on the seller, but the collector did not incur any loss, since she sold the coin for a profit.\nC. The seller is entitled to $10,000, because the collector accepted delivery of the coin.\nD. The seller is entitled to $12,000, because the collector's resale constituted a conversion.\n"

The seller is entitled to $10,000, because the collector accepted delivery of the coin.\n\nUnder the terms of the contract, the risk of loss (i.e., the responsibility for any damage or loss to the coin during transit - was transferred to the buyer when the coin was delivered to the collector's establishment. Once the collector accepted delivery of the coin, even if it was damaged, she became responsible for the risk of loss. Therefore, the seller can claim that the contract was breached because the coin was not in the condition specified in the contract (mint condition). \n\nIn this situation, the seller is entitled to recover the contract price of $10,000. The fact that the collector subsequently sold the coin for a higher price does not mitigate the seller's right to the full contract price, as the risk of loss had already been transferred to the collector. The collector's counterclaim might argue that the contract was void due to the misrepresentation of the coin's condition by the seller, but this would need to be proven in court. Without evidence that the seller intentionally misled the collector, the seller would likely prevail in recovering the $10,000."
