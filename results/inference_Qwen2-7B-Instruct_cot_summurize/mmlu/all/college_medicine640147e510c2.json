This typically occurs during high-intensity or anaerobic exercise when the body can't supply enough oxygen to the muscles for aerobic respiration. As a result, glycolysis continues even in the absence of oxygen, producing lactate as a byproduct. \n\nA. Oxygen is readily available actually decreases lactate production because aerobic respiration ( which requires oxygen, can efficiently convert glucose to energy without producing lactate.\n\nB. Pyruvate being converted to lactate happens under anaerobic conditions, but it's not due to lack of pyruvate formation from glucose breakdown, but rather because of the lack of oxygen to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for the citric acid cycle.\n\nD. Glycolysis activation at the onset of exercise does increase lactate production, but this is more related to the intensity of the exercise and the subsequent decrease in pH, not just the activation of glycolysis itself."
