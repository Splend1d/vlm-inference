Osgood inherited the property from his father and farmed the land until 2006, when he reached the age of 70. He then decided to retire and move to Scottsdale, Arizona. At that time, Osgood conveyed Desertacre to Cutler \"for his use during his natural life. \"After taking possession of the property, Cutler executed a mortgage on Desertacre in the amount of $100,000. In 2009, Osgood died and in his will, the testator devised Desertacre to his son, Desmond, with remainder to Deirdre. The will provided that Desmond and Deirdre took Desertacre \"subject to Cutler's mortgage. \"At the time of Osgood's death, Desertacre had a market value of $300,000. When Desmond learned of the devise, he was hesitant about taking title to Desertacre because he did not want to incur any indebtedness. Assume that Culter is still alive and in possession of the tract. With respect to the mortgage, Desmond will be\n\nA. liable for the mortgage, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.\nB. liable for the mortgage, because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.\nC. not liable, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.\nD. not liable, because he did not personally grant the mortgage.\n"

When Osgood died and left Desertacre to his son Desmond with the condition that he took the property \"subject to Cutler's mortgage,\" this indicates that Desmond is to receive the property with the existing mortgage still in place. However, there is no indication that Desmond assumed or agreed to be responsible for the mortgage. Typically, a conveyance of property \"subject to\" a mortgage means that the buyer takes the property with the existing encumbrance, but it does not necessarily mean that the buyer assumes the debt associated with the mortgage unless specifically language states otherwise or the assumption is explicitly agreed upon.\n\nTherefore, without any evidence that Desmond has assumed the mortgage or that there was an agreement for him to take responsibility for the debt, he would not be liable for the mortgage."
