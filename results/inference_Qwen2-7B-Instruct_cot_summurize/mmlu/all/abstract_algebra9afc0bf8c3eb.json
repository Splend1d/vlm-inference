A cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. If \\(G\\) is a cyclic group and \\(\\phi: G \\rightarrow H\\) is a group homomorphism, then the image \\(\\phi(G)\\) is also cyclic. This is because if \\(G = \\langle g \\rangle\\), where \\(g\\) is a generator of \\(G\\), then \\(\\phi(G) = \\{\\phi(g^n) | n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\langle \\phi(g) \\rangle\\), showing that \\(\\phi(G)\\) is generated by \\(\\phi(g)\\) and hence is cyclic.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\"\n\nThis statement is also **True**. An Abelian (or commutative) group is a group in which the group operation is commutative, i.e., for any two elements \\(a, b\\) in the group, \\(ab = ba\\). If \\(G\\) is an Abelian group and \\(\\phi: G \\rightarrow H\\) is a group homomorphism, then for any \\(a, b \\in G\\), we have \\(\\phi(ab) = \\phi(ba)\\) due to the homomorphism property. Since \\(G\\) is Abelian, \\(ab = ba\\), so \\(\\phi(a)\\phi(b) = \\phi(b)\\phi(a)\\). This shows that \\(\\phi(G)\\) is also an Abelian group, as the commutative property is preserved under homomorphisms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. True, True**."
