How would the first ionization energy value for a neutral atom of potassum compare to those values?\n\nA. It would be greater than both because potassium carries a greater nuclear charge then either chlorine or argon.\nB. It would be greater than both because the size of a potassium atom is smaller than an atom of either chlorine or argon.\nC. It would be less than both because there are more electrons in potassium, meaning they repel each other more effectively and less energy is needed to remove one.\nD. It would be less than both because a valence electron of potassium is farther from the nucleus than one of either chlorine or argon.\n"

It would be less than both because a valence electron of potassium is farther from the nucleus than one of either chlorine or argon.\n\nIonization energy generally increases across a period (from left to right on the periodic table due to an increase in nuclear charge ( and decreases down a group due to an increase in the shielding effect and electron-electron repulsion. Potassium is in Group 1 (or Column 1) of the periodic table, which means it has one electron in its outermost shell. This electron is farther from the nucleus than the valence electrons in chlorine (Group 17) or argon (Group 18), making it easier to remove and thus requiring less energy. Therefore, the first ionization energy for potassium would be lower than that of chlorine or argon."
