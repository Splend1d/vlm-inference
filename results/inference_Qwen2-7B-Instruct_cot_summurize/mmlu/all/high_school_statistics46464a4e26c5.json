Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The number of tosseses before a \"5\" appears when tossing a fair die.\n\nThis is not a binomial random variable because it does not meet the criteria of having a fixed number of trials (each trial is not independent (since the outcome of one toss affects the next), and it doesn't have exactly two outcomes per trial.\n\nB. The number of points a hockey team receives in 10 games, where two points are awarded for wins, one point for ties, and no points for losses.\n\nThis is not a binomial random variable because there are more than two outcomes per game (win, tie, or loss). A binomial experiment requires only two outcomes per trial.\n\nC. The number of hearts out of five cards randomly drawn from a deck of 52 cards, without replacement.\n\nThis is a binomial random variable. It has a fixed number of trials (n=5, each draw is independent of the others (assuming the deck is large enough that removing one card doesn't significantly affect the probability of drawing a heart on subsequent draws, and there are only two outcomes per trial: drawing a heart (or not.\n\nD. The number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers.\n\nThis is also a binomial random variable. It has a fixed number of trials n=5, each trial (examining a driver is independent of the others, and there are only two outcomes per trial: motorist wears a seat belt or does not.\n\nTherefore, both C and D can be considered binomial random variables based on the given conditions. However, if we must choose one, C specifically adheres to the definition of a binomial random variable without needing additional assumptions about independence, as it directly states a scenario involving a fixed number of independent trials with two outcomes."
