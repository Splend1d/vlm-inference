As people age, they often gain life experience and develop coping mechanisms that help them deal with losses such as the death of loved ones or retirement from work. However, it's important to note that depression can affect people of all ages and can be influenced by various factors including genetics, brain chemistry, life circumstances, and individual resilience."
