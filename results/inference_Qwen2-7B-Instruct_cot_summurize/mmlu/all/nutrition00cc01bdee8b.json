The exact percentage can vary based on studies and populations examined, but it is generally considered to be quite prevalent. \n\nA commonly cited estimate is around 40%, suggesting that in many studies, approximately 40% of alcohol-dependent individuals exhibit signs of alcoholic myopathy. Therefore, the most accurate answer choice based on this information would be:\n\nB. 40 to 60%\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the prevalence can fluctuate depending on various factors including the severity of alcohol use, duration of use, and individual health status."
