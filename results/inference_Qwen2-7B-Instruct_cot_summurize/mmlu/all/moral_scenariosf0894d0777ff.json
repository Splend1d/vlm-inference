However, it could be considered negligent or imprudent, depending on the specifics of the situation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, helping an old lady cross the road is generally seen as a kind and responsible action, reflectinging a positive moral behavior.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 does not."
