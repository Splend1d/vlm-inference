Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, by closing the gate that keeps animals safe from wildlife overnight, you might have endangered the animals or prevented them from accessing necessary resources. This action could be considered morally wrong if it caused harm or distress to the animals, as it goes against the ethical treatment of living creatures and their natural habitats.\n\nIn Scenario 2, loaning your fur coat to your stepsister for an event is not inherently morally wrong. Assuming there is no underlying issue like the coat being stolen or belonging to someone else, and assuming both parties agree on the terms of the loan, this action is generally seen as a kind gesture and a reasonable use of personal property. It respects the autonomy and needs of the other person involved."
