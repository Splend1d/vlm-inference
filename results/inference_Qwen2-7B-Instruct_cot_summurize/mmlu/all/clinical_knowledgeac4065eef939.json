When the catheter is blocked.\n\nA bladder washout, also known as bladder irrigation, is typically carried out when there's a blockage in the catheter that prevents urine from flowing freely from the bladder. This procedure helps clear the obstruction and ensures proper drainage of urine, preventing potential complications like infection or kidney damage. It should be performed by medical professionals due to the risks involved and the need for sterile technique.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not necessitate a bladder washout. Clear urine indicates normal function, a catheter bypass is not a condition requiring intervention but rather an indication of a different issue, and a dirty catheter might require cleaning but does not inherently call for a washout unless it obstructs urine flow."
