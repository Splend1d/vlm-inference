Past medical history is negative for any similar episodes. He does not take any medications. He smokes cigarettes, has a 40\u00a0pack-year history, and consumes more than 8\u00a0cans of beer per day. Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal a serum amylase level of 467\u00a0U/L (reference range: 28-100\u00a0U/L) and a\u00a0\u03b3-glutamyltransferase\u00a0level of 212\u00a0U/L (reference range: <\u00a055\u00a0U/L). Referred pain in this patient is transmitted to the spinal cord by which of the following nerves?\n\nA. anterior rami of T1-T5\nB. anterior rami of T6-T10\nC. anterior rami of T11-T12\nD. posterior rami of T1-T5\n"

                    "text": "The referred pain in this patient is transmitted to the spinal cord by the anterior rami of T6-T10.\n\nThe pain experienced by the patient likely originates from the pancreas due to the elevated levels of serum amylase and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase. The pain can be referred to other areas via the somatic nervous system. In the thoracic region, the pain signals from the pancreas travel through the dorsal root ganglia associated with the spinal nerves. The anterior rami of T2-T10 spinal nerves carry pain sensations to the brain, so option B, \"anterior rami of T6-T10,\" is the correct answer.\n\nOptions A, C, and D pertain to different types of nerve fibers or locations that do not directly correspond to the transmission of pain signals from the pancreas to the brain. Option A refers to the anterior rami of T1-T5, which would not include the thoracic region where the pain sensation starts. Option C refers to the anterior rami of T11-T12, which is part of the lower thoracic region but does not encompass the full range of thoracic levels responsible for transmitting pancreatic pain. Option D refers to the posterior rami of T1-T5, which carry motor signals rather than sensory ones like pain."
