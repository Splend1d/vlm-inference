It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nWhich of the following groups would be most likely to support the perspective of Frederick Douglass?\n\nA.

The perspective he presents in the quote reflects the views of the abolitionist movement, which sought the immediate end of slavery. Northern Republicans during the 1860s, led by figures like Abraham Lincoln, generally supported the abolition of slavery and were part of the political coalition that pushed for the passage of the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery.\n\nA. Southern Democrats in the 1880s - These individuals would likely oppose the abolition of slavery as they benefited economically from the institution of slavery.\n\nB. Western ranchers in the 1850s - While many western ranchers might not have been directly involved in the institution of slavery, they might not necessarily share Douglass' perspective on it. Their interests could be more focused on land use, cattle ranching, and other aspects of frontier life.\n\nC. Southern farmers in the 1830s - This group would likely support the perspective of maintaining or expanding slavery, given that their economic livelihood was tied to the institution."
