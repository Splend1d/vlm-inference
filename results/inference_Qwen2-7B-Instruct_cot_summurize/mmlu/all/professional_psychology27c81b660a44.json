This choice often requires the psychologist to consider various factors including the nature of the program, the specific outcomes it aims to achieve, and the characteristics of the participants. Professional judgment is crucial here as it allows the psychologist to tailor the assessment to the unique aspects of the program, ensuring that the measures accurately capture what the program intends to impact.\n\nOptions A and B are not ideal choices. Averaging scores might not increase reliability or validity in this context because the goal is to evaluate individual changes rather than group averages. Selecting the test with the highest reliability does not necessarily ensure that the test is valid for assessing the program's goals.\n\nOption C suggests involving the principal, which can be beneficial for gaining insight into the broader implications of the program's results within the school environment. However, it does not directly address the selection of appropriate dependent variables for the evaluation. Moreover, the principal's perspective may be influenced by organizational priorities rather than solely the psychological validity of the measures.\n\nTherefore, option D, using professional judgment, is the most appropriate choice as it allows the psychologist to consider both the program's goals and the psychometric properties of the tests to select the most suitable measures for evaluating the program's effectiveness."
