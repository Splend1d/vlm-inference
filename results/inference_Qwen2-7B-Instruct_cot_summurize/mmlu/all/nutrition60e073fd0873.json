Age can affect health outcomes in its own right, but it's generally easier to control for or account for in studies comparing different dietary patterns.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that controlling for all potential confounding variables is crucial in research, and ideally, studies should strive to include adjustments for multiple factors including smoking habits (A, social class/position B, and physical activity C, to provide a more accurate picture of the relationship between diet and health outcomes."
