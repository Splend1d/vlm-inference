This strategy encourages collaboration and shared success, which can foster positive relationships and reduce negative feelings between groups. When students work together towards common objectives, they learn to appreciate each other's contributions and build mutual respect.\n\nOption A ( increasing opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions can also be beneficial as it allows students to interact in a less tense environment, but it may not directly address the underlying causes of hostility.\n\nOption B having a respected member of the community speak to the students about the benefits of cooperation might help raise awareness, but it does not actively engage the students in cooperative activities.\n\nOption C where each group selects a representative to discuss ways to reduce hostility can be a step towards dialogue, but it doesn't necessarily ensure that all members of the groups are participating or benefiting from the discussion.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most comprehensive strategy that directly engages the students in cooperative tasks, promoting positive intergroup relations."
