This is because new firms can quickly join the market if prices are high enough, increasing supply, while existing firms may leave the market if prices fall too low, decreasing supply. This responsiveness translates into a more elastic long-run supply curve, meaning that small changes in price lead to relatively large changes in quantity supplied."
