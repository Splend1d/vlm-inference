                    "text": "In four-dimensional geometry, the sum of the angles in a triangle does not necessarily add up to 180 degrees. The reason is that the concept of \"flat\" or Euclidean geometry, which assumes angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, doesn't directly translate into higher dimensions in the same way.\n\nIn three-dimensional space (which we can think of as our everyday experience), the sum of the angles in a triangle is indeed 180 degrees if the triangle lies on a flat plane. However, when you move into four dimensions, the space becomes \"curved\" in some sense, and this curvature affects how angles behave.\n\nThe exact relationship between the angles in a triangle and their sum in four-dimensional space depends on the curvature of the space. In spaces with positive curvature (like the surface of a sphere but extended into four dimensions), the sum of the angles in a triangle would be more than 180 degrees. In spaces with negative curvature (which is harder to visualize but mathematically possible), the sum could be less than 180 degrees.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. never.\n\nThis is because the sum of the angles in a triangle in four-dimensional space will generally not equal exactly 180 degrees due to the intrinsic curvature of the space."
