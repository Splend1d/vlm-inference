Discussing the possibility of termination and referral can be part of this process, allowing the client to express any concerns or perspectives they may have about continuing therapy with the same professional. It also opens up the opportunity to explore alternative treatments or providers, which could potentially offer a fresh perspective or different therapeutic techniques that might better suit the client's needs. This approach respects the client's autonomy and ethical considerations regarding the well-being and progress of the client."
