It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nFrederick Douglass was most influenced by which of the following social movements?\n\nA.

Second Great Awakening.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening was a religious revival movement that swept through the United States during the early 19th century. It emphasized personal religious experience and emotionalism, and it led to the establishment of new denominations, such as the Methodists and Baptists. This movement played a significant role in shaping Douglass's views on abolitionism and civil rights. He believed that moral and spiritual transformation could lead to societal change, a belief that was central to the Second Great Awakening. Douglass was also involved in the Underground Railroad, an anti-slavery network that helped enslaved people escape to freedom, which was also deeply rooted in the religious and moral fervor of the Second Great Awakening."
