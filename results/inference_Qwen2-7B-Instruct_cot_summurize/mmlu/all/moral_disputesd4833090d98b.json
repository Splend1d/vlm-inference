He emphasized that these methods did not involve torture or coercive interrogation practices and resulted in valuable intelligence. This supports option C, indicating that successful interrogation can be achieved without resorting to torture.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not accurately capture the essence of Soufan's testimony or the broader implications of using torture as an interrogation method. While there might be circumstances where torture could potentially work in very limited situations (option A is not supported by Soufan's testimony, which focuses on the effectiveness of non-coercive methods; option B incorrectly suggests a binary choice between endorsing a single act of torture and endorsing torture as a practice; and option D asserts a blanket prohibition against torture without exception, which is not necessarily supported by Soufan's emphasis on the effectiveness of traditional interrogation techniques."
