Two individual buyers of the car each filed a class action, in different states, against the manufacturer, asserting the same products liability claims on behalf of all buyers nationwide. One class action was filed in federal court and the other was filed in state court. The parties in the federal action reached a court- approved settlement, and the court entered judgment dismissing the action with prejudice. The manufacturer's attorney has moved to dismiss the state court action on the basis of res judicata (claim preclusion). Should the state court look to federal or state law to decide the effect of the judgment?\n\nA. Federal law, because the judgment was entered in federal court.\nB. Federal law, because the judgment was the result of a nationwide action governed by the federal class action rule.\nC. State law, because the judgment is being asserted in a state court.\nD. State law, because there is no general federal common law and preclusion is a common law doctrine.\n"

State law, because the judgment is asserted in a state court.\n\nWhen considering the effect of a judgment in another jurisdiction for purposes of claim preclusion ( also known as res judicata), the state where the subsequent case is brought applies its own substantive law. This principle is based on the concept of comity, which respects the judgments of other courts within the same state system. Thus, even though the original judgment was issued by a federal court, the state court deciding the issue of claim preclusion will apply its own state law to determine whether the doctrine of res judicata applies to bar the later state court action. \n\nIt's worth noting that while federal courts can issue judgments, they are still bound by the laws of the state where they are located when deciding issues related to state law, such as preclusion doctrines. In this scenario, since the subsequent action is in a state court, it would apply state law to determine the effect of the federal court judgment."
