Separation of powers\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issuing, enforcing, and adjudicating all disputes regarding a new regulation could potentially violate the principle of separation of powers. In a system that adheres to this constitutional principle, the functions of government are divided among three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial. The EPA is an executive branch agency, typically responsible for creating and enforcing regulations, but not adjudicating disputes related to those regulations. Adjudication usually falls under the purview of the judiciary or sometimes the executive branch in specific administrative courts, depending on the jurisdiction and legal framework. Thus, conflating these roles within one entity can blur the lines between the legislative, executive, and judicial powers, which is at odds with the separation of powers principle."
