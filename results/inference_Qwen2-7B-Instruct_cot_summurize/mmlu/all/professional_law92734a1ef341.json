He said to the roofer, \"We'll have a deal when you begin to do the work necessary for this job.\" The roofer did not directly respond to the offer but he went out and purchased the supplies and materials needed for the homeowner's specifications. When he arrived at the site with the supplies he found a message from the homeowner that he revoked the offer. Can the homeowner revoke the offer under these circumstances?\n\nA. Yes, because an offer for a bilateral contract can be revoked before its acceptance.\nB. No, because the act of purchasing supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance and a contract was formed prior to homeowner's attempted revocation.\nC. No, because the offer had to remain open for a reasonable period of time before it could be revoked.\nD. Yes, because an oral offer to enter a bilateral contract is never enforceable.\n"

No, because the act of purchasing supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance and a contract was formed prior to homeowner's attempted revocation.\n\nUnder the circumstances provided, the homeowner's offer to pay $2,000 for the roofing repairs constituted a unilateral contract (not a bilateral one, as the homeowner specified no specific actions required from the roofer other than his agreement to perform the repairs. However, the concept of acceptance in unilateral contracts is slightly different from bilateral contracts. In this case, the roofer's actions of purchasing the necessary supplies and materials in accordance with the homeowner's specifications can be considered an implied acceptance of the offer. By taking such action, the roofer has effectively engaged in conduct that constitutes performance, which is tantamount to acceptance in this context.\n\nThe fact that the homeowner later tried to revoke the offer after the roofer had already begun preparing for the job does not allow for the revocation, as the roofer's actions have already constituted acceptance of the offer. This is supported by legal principles that generally prohibit revoking an offer once the offeree ( in this case, the roofer \u2013 has relied on the offer to their detriment. Here, the roofer's purchase of materials and preparations for the job would constitute such reliance.\n\nTherefore, the homeowner cannot revoke the offer under these circumstances, as the roofer's actions effectively accepted the offer through their conduct, forming a binding contract between the two parties."
