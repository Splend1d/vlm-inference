This means manufacturers can produce more bicycles at a lower cost, leading to an increase in the supply of bicycles. This shift in the supply curve to the right indicates an increase in the quantity supplied at every given price. However, this does not necessarily imply a change in the demand for bicycles, which would be influenced by factors unrelated to the production cost."
