After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:\"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000. Loan to be repaid at the rate of $1,000 per month, starting one month after the completion of the apartment house. The loan is to be secured by a mortgage on the property. \"The developer then contracted with a construction company to build the apartment for $800,000. After the contract was signed and construction had begun, the developer asked the investor when he would be receiving the $100,000 the investor promised to lend him. The investor replied, \"I've changed my mind. I think this is too risky an investment. I'm not going to lend you the money. \"In an appropriate action to secure specific performance of the investor's promise to lend him the $100,000, the developer will\n\nA. win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.\nB. win, because land is unique, making the legal remedy inadequate.\nC. lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.\nD. lose, because the developer cannot show detrimental reliance.\n"

This written agreement constitutes a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds, which typically requires that certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforceable. The Statute of Frauds ensures that these agreements are valid and legally binding.\n\nGiven that the agreement is in writing, it provides evidence of the contract between the developer and the investor. If the developer can prove that the investor has reneged on their promise to lend the money, the developer may seek specific performance as a remedy. Specific performance is a legal remedy that compels a party to fulfill their contractual obligations, rather than paying damages. It is particularly applicable in cases involving unique items or situations where monetary damages are not adequate compensation, such as real estate transactions.\n\nIn this case, since the property is unique and the developer has already taken steps based on the agreement (such as contracting with a construction company, specific performance might be granted to enforce the investor's obligation to provide the loan. The developer can argue that they have relied detrimentally on the investor's promise and that enforcing the contract would prevent significant loss or hardship."
