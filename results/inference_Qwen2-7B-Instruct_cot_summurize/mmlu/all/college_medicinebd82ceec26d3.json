Pathological changes to the prefrontal cortex: Substance abuse during adolescence can indeed lead to structural and functional changes in the prefrontal cortex, which is crucial for executive functions such as decision-making, planning, and impulse control. These changes might be due to direct toxic effects of substances on the brain or to the chronic stress that often accompanies substance use disorders.\n\nII. Increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations: While substance abuse can sometimes lead to or exacerbate symptoms like auditory hallucinations, especially in individuals with a predisposition to schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, it is not a direct consequence of executive function impairment. The relationship between substance use and auditory hallucinations is complex and can depend on multiple factors including the specific substance used, the individual's mental health history, and the context of use.\n\nIII. Reduced behavioral impulse control: This is a likely outcome of substance abuse, particularly if it occurred during adolescence when the brain is still developing. Impaired impulse control can manifest in various behaviors, such as continued substance use despite negative consequences, risky sexual behavior, or poor decision-making in general.\n\nTherefore, options I and III are most likely true of this patient."
