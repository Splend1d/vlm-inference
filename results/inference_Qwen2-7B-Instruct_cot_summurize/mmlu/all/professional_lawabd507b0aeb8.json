The pedestrian was seriously injured in the accident and sued the motorist to recover damages for personal injuries. There were no witnesses to the accident. The motorist claims that the traffic light was green at the time she entered the intersection. The pedestrian now has amnesia and cannot remember how the accident occurred. At trial, the pedestrian's attorney calls a witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that she was in the emergency room at the hospital when the pedestrian was brought in following the accident. The witness further testifies that while the pedestrian was being treated for his injuries, the nurse asked him, \"How did you get hurt?\" The pedestrian replied, \"The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection. \"Upon objection, this evidence is\n\nA. admissible as a statement made for purposes of medical treatment and diagnosis.\nB. admissible as a present sense impression.\nC. inadmissible, because the witness was eavesdropping on a confidential communication between the pedestrian and a hospital representative.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

This exception allows statements made by a person to a health care provider during the course of receiving medical treatment to be admitted into evidence, as they are considered to be part of the natural flow of communication necessary for proper medical care. Since the pedestrian was receiving medical treatment at the time he made the statement, this exception would likely apply, making the statement admissible."
