They did not look or think like us.\n\nUp to 50,000 years ago, the species that existed were Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis, which are distinct from anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens. These earlier hominins had different physical characteristics, such as shorter and stockier builds compared to modern humans, and their brain sizes were generally smaller than those of modern humans. In terms of cognitive abilities, while it's difficult to definitively compare cognitive capacities across species, Neanderthals showed evidence of more complex tool use, art, and possibly language. However, they did not possess the same level of technological innovation or cultural complexity seen in later Homo sapiens populations. Therefore, the relationship would be characterized by differences in both physical appearance and cognitive capabilities."
