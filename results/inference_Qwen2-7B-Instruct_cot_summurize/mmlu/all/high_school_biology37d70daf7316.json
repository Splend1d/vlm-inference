Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms.\n\nTay-Sachs disease is an example of a genetic condition that follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent - one copy from each parent's chromosome 15 - to express the disease. People who carry just one copy of the mutated gene are heterozygous for the condition, but they typically do not show any symptoms of the disease. These individuals are known as carriers.\n\nThese carriers can pass the healthy version of the gene to their offspring, which helps to preserve the allele in the population despite the detrimental effects of the disease. Over generations, this mechanism allows for the persistence of recessive alleles even when the disease they cause leads to early death in homozygous individuals ( those with two copies of the mutated gene."
