The JIT approach usually involves a large number of suppliers while traditional approaches usually involve only a small number of suppliers.\nB. The JIT approach requires centralized purchasing while traditional approaches encourage purchasing decisions by production employees.\nC. The JIT approach uses a push-through system while traditional approaches use a pull-through system.\nD.

The JIT approach operates with low inventory levels while traditional approaches may operate with high inventory levels.\n\nIn a Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing system, inventory is kept to a minimum to reduce waste and improve efficiency. This is achieved by closely coordinating the production process with the customer demand. In contrast, traditional manufacturing approaches often maintain higher inventory levels to ensure that there is always enough stock to meet demand, which can lead to increased storage costs and potential obsolescence of products."
