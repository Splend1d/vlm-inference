While it might seem plausible given the order of visits, consider that \\(u\\) could be a descendant of \\(v\\) in \\(T\\) if \\(v\\) explores branches that include \\(u\\) without \\(u\\) being an ancestor of \\(v\\) in \\(T\\). The order of visiting nodes does not necessarily dictate the ancestor-descendant relationship in \\(T\\).\n\n### Statement III: If \\(w\\) is the lowest common ancestor of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in \\(T\\), then \\(w = u\\).\n\nThis statement is false because:\n- By definition, \\(w\\) is the lowest common ancestor, meaning it is an ancestor of both \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).\n- However, since \\(u\\) is visited before \\(v\\), it's possible that \\(u\\) is already \\(v\\)'s ancestor in \\(T\\) ( or vice versa, depending on the structure of \\(T\\).\n- It's not necessarily true that \\(w\\) would have to equal \\(u\\) under these conditions; \\(w\\) could be a different node that satisfies the condition of being being an ancestor of both \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) with no child being an ancestor of both.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the analysis, **only Statement I** (\\(post(u) < post(v)\\)) must be true based on the provided conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is **A. I only**."
