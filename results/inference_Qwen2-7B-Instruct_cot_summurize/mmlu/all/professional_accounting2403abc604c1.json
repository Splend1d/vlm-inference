Since the period ends on June 30, we need to calculate how much of this $6,000 is still unpaid at the end of June.\n\nAssuming the billing cycle starts on the 1st of each month, and given that the payment wasfor May's utilities was made on June 1, it means that the utility service for the first 15 days of June (i.e., from June 1 to June 15, was covered by the previous month's payment. Therefore, the liability for June would cover the service from June 16 to June 30.\n\nTo find out the liability for June 30, we can calculate the proportion of the $6,000 bill that corresponds to the last 15 days of June:\n\n\\[ \\text{Liability for June} = \\frac{\\text{Days of June covered by June's bill}}{\\text{Total days in June}} \\times \\text{Total bill for June} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Liability for June} = \\frac{15}{30} \\times 6000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Liability for June} = 0.5 \\times 6000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Liability for June} = 3000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount that Dash Co. should report as a liability in its June 30 balance sheet is $3,000. However, this value is not listed among your options. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or error in the provided choices. Based on the calculation, none of A through D accurately reflects the correct answer, which should be $3,000."
