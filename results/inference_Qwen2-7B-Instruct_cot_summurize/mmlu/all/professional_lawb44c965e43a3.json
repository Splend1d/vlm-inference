During one of his opponent's campaign speeches, he stated that the mayor had once propositioned a prostitute. A television correspondent who was covering the election was present when the opponent made the statement. She recorded the opponent's remark about the mayor in her notebook. In a stunning upset, the opponent defeated the mayor in the election. Many of the pollsters attributed the mayor's loss to the question of his moral character following the opponent's smear campaign depicting the mayor as a client of prostitutes. Following the election, the mayor sued the opponent for defamation, basing his suit on the opponent's statement that the mayor had \"once propositioned a prostitute. \" At trial, the mayor calls the television correspondent to testify concerning her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech attended by the television correspondent. The television correspondent's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity.\nB. admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\nC. inadmissible, because the notebook entry is the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

As a journalist covering the election, she would have been actively listening and taking notes or recording the event. Her testimony as to what she heard during the campaign speech would be considered direct evidence based on her firsthand knowledge. This type of testimony is generally admissible in court as it provides an account of the statement made by the opponent, which is directly relevant to the defamation case brought by the mayor.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because the fact that the correspondent recorded the statement does not automatically make the recorded note the best evidence under the rules of evidence. While the recording might be admissible if it meets certain criteria ( such as being authentic and having been made contemporaneously with the event), the primary basis for admitting the testimony would be the correspondent's firsthand knowledge, not the medium of recording. \n\nOption D is incorrect because while the statement itself may be considered hearsay ( an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted), the testimony of the television correspondent recounting the statement would likely be admitted as a non-hearsay exception, specifically as a statement made for the purpose of establishing or proving a fact of consequence in the current controversy ( in this case, the fact that the opponent made the defamatory statement during the campaign speech."
