Pregnancy has been complicated by mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators. At the beginning of the second stage of labor, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. After 10 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration to 60/min. The patient has the acute onset of shortness of breath, rapidly develops cyanosis, and becomes unresponsive. Her pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected. Immediate resuscitation is started. Five minutes later, there is bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Amniotic fluid embolism\nB. Intracerebral hemorrhage\nC. Myocardial infarction\nD. Status asmaticus\n"

                    "text": "A. Amniotic fluid embolism\n\nThe symptoms presented by this woman are highly indicative of an amniotic fluid embolism ( (AFE). This condition occurs when amniotic fluid enters the mother's bloodstream during labor or delivery, causing a severe allergic reaction. The sudden onset of shortness of breath, cyanosis, unresponsiveness, inability to detect a pulse or blood pressure, and bleeding from multiple sites are all classic signs of AFE.\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, and status asthmaticus are less likely given the presentation of symptoms. An intracerebral hemorrhage typically presents with sudden neurological deficits such as weakness, numbness, confusion, or loss of consciousness, but not the respiratory symptoms seen here. A myocardial infarction might cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and possibly shock, but it would not lead to the sudden onset of respiratory distress followed by unresponsiveness. Status asthmaticus is an exacerbation of asthma that causes severe wheezing and difficulty breathing, but it does not usually result in the rapid development of cyanosis and unresponsiveness, nor does it involve bleeding from the nose and mouth.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Amniotic Fluid Embolism ( (AFE)."
