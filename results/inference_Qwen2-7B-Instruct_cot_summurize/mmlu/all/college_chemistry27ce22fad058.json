NH2\u2212\n\nThis is because ammonia can donate a pair of electrons to form an ammonide ion (NH2\u2212, which is a stronger base than the neutral molecule or other possible ions like NH4+ or N2H4. The ability of ammonia to act as a base is due to its lone pair of electrons that can participate in a coordinate covalent bond with a proton (H+. In the case of liquid ammonia, it forms stable complexes with itself and other molecules, including the ammonide ion, which is more basic than the neutral ammonia molecule."
