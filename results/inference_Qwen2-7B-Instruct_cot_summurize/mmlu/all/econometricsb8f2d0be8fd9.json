It ensures that the error term has an expected value of zero given any values of the explanatory variables.\n\nii) $\\text{Var}(u_t) = \\sigma^2$: This is the assumption of homoscedasticity. It ensures that the variance of the error term is constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n\niii) $\\text{Cov}(u_i, u_{i-j}) = 0 \\forall j$: This is the assumption of no autocorrelation. It ensures that there is no correlation between the error terms across different observations.\n\niv) $u_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$: This is the assumption of normal distribution. It's not directly related to consistency, unbiasedness, or efficiency of the OLS estimator in the same way as the previous three assumptions. However, it is used in the derivation of the standard errors for hypothesis testing in linear regression models.\n\nConsistency refers to the property of an estimator to converge in probability to the true parameter value as the sample size increases. Unbiasedness means that the expected value of the estimator equals the true parameter value. Efficiency refers to an estimator achieving the lowest possible variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nGiven these definitions, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. i), ii), and iii) only"
