This adjustment is made using the Consumer Price Index ( (CPI) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The purpose of this adjustment is to maintain the purchasing power of the poverty line, ensuring that it remains a meaningful measure of economic hardship even as prices for goods and services change.\n\nThe poverty line is used to determine eligibility for various government programs and benefits. It is calculated based on the cost of a \"poverty threshold basket\" of food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities, adjusted for family size. Families and individuals below this threshold are considered to be living in poverty."
