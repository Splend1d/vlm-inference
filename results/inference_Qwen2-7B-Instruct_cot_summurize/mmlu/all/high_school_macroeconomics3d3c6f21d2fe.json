It suggests that as unemployment falls below a natural rate (indicating strong economic activity), inflation tends to rise, and vice versa.\n\nAmong the options provided, the one that creates the trade-off depicted by the Phillips curve is:\n\nB. An increase in input costs that corresponds with an increase in unemployment\n\nThis scenario implies that when input costs rise, firms may face higher production expenses, potentially leading them to reduce hiring or increase prices to maintain profit margins. The increase in unemployment could be a result of firms adjusting their labor needs in response to these higher costs. However, it's important to note that the direct link between input costs and unemployment in this context is a simplification for the purpose of understanding the Phillips curve. In reality, the relationship between unemployment and inflation is more complex and influenced by various economic factors beyond just input costs."
