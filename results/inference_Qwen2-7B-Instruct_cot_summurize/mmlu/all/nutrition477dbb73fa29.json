When you consume more Vitamin A than your body needs, the excess can be stored in your liver and eventually lead to toxicity. Symptoms of Vitamin A toxicity include nausea, dizziness, headache, irritability, and vision problems. Severe toxicity can even lead to blindness or death. \n\nThe other options listed are not typically consumed in excess to dangerous levels as they are either water-soluble (like vitamin C and B vitamins, which are the body will excrete any excess through urine, or they have a lower potential for toxicity due to their role in various bodily functions and the body's ability to regulate intake. Zinc toxicity is also possible but less common and usually occurs from dietary sources rather than supplementation."
