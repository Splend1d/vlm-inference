This action increases the banks' reserves, but because the reserve requirement is five percent, banks must hold these reserves as required by law. The remaining funds, after setting aside the required reserves, can be lent out to borrowers, which in turn increases the money supply.\n\nHowever, the amount that can actually be lent out and thus increase the money supply is limited by the reserve requirement. In this case, for every dollar sold, only 95 cents can be lent out due to the 5% reserve requirement. \n\nGiven that the Fed sells $10 million worth of securities, the calculation for how much can potentially be lent out (and thus contribute to the increase in the money supply is:\n\n$10,000,000 * (95/100 = $9,500,000\n\nSince the initial sale reduces the total amount of money available in the banking system by the full $10 million, the potential decrease in the money supply is directly tied to the $10 million sale, not the $9,500,000 that could potentially be lent out. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the money supply can potentially decrease by the full amount sold, or $50 million ( ($10 million - $9.5 million that could potentially be lent out).\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. decrease by $50 million."
