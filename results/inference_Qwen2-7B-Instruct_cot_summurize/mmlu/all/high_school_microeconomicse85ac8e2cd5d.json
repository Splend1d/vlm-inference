A superstar basketball player's $40 million earnings: This represents earned income from their work as a professional athlete.\n\nB. Social Security retirement income: This is a form of government-provided income for eligible retirees based on their contributions during their working years, not a transfer earning.\n\nC. A welfare payment from social services: Welfare payments are can be considered a form of transfer earning as they are provided by the government to those in need, but it's important to note that these payments are intended to support individuals who may not have the means to earn sufficient income.\n\nD. A cashier at a restaurant receiving the same $8 an hour that other cashiers receive: This is also earned income, as the cashier is compensated for their work.\n\nIn summary, none of these options directly represent a transfer earning, which typically involves money being given from one person or entity to another without any expectation of return or compensation."
