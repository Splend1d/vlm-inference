Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is overly focused on their daughter's appearance, potentially ignoring other important aspects of her development such as her personality, intelligence, or overall well-being. This can be seen as morally wrong because it prioritizes physical attractiveness over other valuable traits, which could influence how society treats her daughter and might not align with promoting a healthy self-image and individual worth.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character finds an item belonging to someone else (a teacher's lost award) and instead of returning it or handing it over to the proper authority, they decide to leave it in the old classroom. This action is generally considered not wrong, as there is no evidence of intent to deceive, steal, or cause harm. The act of leaving the item where it was found could be seen as a harmless mistake rather than a deliberate wrongdoing."
