Upon request and showing of good cause.\n\nIn the United States legal system, a defendant has certain rights to inspect and have access to information about potential jurors. This includes a right to receive a list of prospective jurors' names and addresses. However, this right is not absolute and may be subject to limitations. The provision of such information typically requires a request from the defense, and in some jurisdictions, there may also be a requirement to show \"good cause\" for why this information is necessary. Good cause could refer to specific concerns or reasons that necessitate the defense's need for this information, such as potential juror bias or the need to challenge for cause or peremptory challenges.\n\nIt's important to note that the specifics of these procedures can vary by jurisdiction and are are subject to interpretation by judges."
