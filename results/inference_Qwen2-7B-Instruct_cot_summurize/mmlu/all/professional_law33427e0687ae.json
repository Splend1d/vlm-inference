After conducting the sessions, the professor submitted an expense report to the owner of the bar review course. Her expense voucher included a $225 travel expenditure to a fourth city where the professor had attended a symposium unrelated to the bar review course. The professor also submitted the $225 travel expenditure to the administrator for the faculty at the law school where she teaches. The dean of the law school had previously approved the professor's appearance at the symposium. The owner paid the professor for the symposium-related expenditure but indicated that the expense item was improperly billed to his company. The professor was indicted for false pretenses. In her defense, she contends that the double billing was the result of a bookkeeping error. Her defense should be\n\nA. valid, if her mistake was reasonable.\nB. valid, if she didn't know that the billing to the bar review company included the symposium expenditure.\nC. invalid, if her bookkeeping error was unreasonable.\nD. invalid, because white-collar crime imposes absolute criminal liability.\n"

In this scenario, the professor billed the same travel expenditure to both the owner of the bar review course and the law school where she teaches. This is considered fraudulent because she knowingly submitted the same expense claim twice, intending to receive payment from both sources for the same expense.\n\nThe professor's defense that it was a \"bookkeeping error\" does not hold up under legal scrutiny. If the error was truly due to a misunderstanding or oversight, it would likely be considered an accounting mistake rather than an intentional act of fraud. However, the key factor here is that the professor knew about the double billing and still proceeded with submitting the claims, which indicates an intention to deceive and defraud.\n\nTherefore, option C, \"invalid, if her bookkeeping error was unreasonable,\" is the correct answer. The professor's defense will likely not be valid if the court determines that her actions were not merely an innocent mistake but an intentional attempt to defraud both entities by double billing."
