In Parkinson's disease, there is a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a part of the brain that sends signals to the basal ganglia involved in controlling movement. This results in a deficiency of dopamine, leading to motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with movement.\n\nMajor depressive disorder ( (A) can be associated with changes in neurotransmitters including serotonin and norepinephrine, but not specifically dopamine. Autism ( (B) and Alzheimer's disease  ((D) are are also associated with various neurological changes, but they do not specifically involve a deficit of dopamine as a primary feature."
