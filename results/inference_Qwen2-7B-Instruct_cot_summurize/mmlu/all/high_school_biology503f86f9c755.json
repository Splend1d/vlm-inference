Dark-colored ones inhabit the lava formations, while light-colored mice inhabit the desert. Which of the following statements is correct about this scenario?\n\nA. The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.\nB. The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.\nC. Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\nD. Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.\n"

Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\n\nExplanation: The scenario describes a case of natural selection where different phenotypes (the observable characteristics of an organism) are favored in different environments. In this case, dark-colored mice are found in the black lava formations, and light-colored mice are found in the light-colored sandy desert. This suggests that the coloration of the mice is adapting to their respective environments, with darker colors providing better camouflage in the lava formations and lighter colors providing better camouflage in the sandy desert. This is an example of adaptation through natural selection, where environmental pressures (in this case, the color of the surroundings influencing the likelihood of predation or survival - favor certain traits over others, leading to evolutionary change."
