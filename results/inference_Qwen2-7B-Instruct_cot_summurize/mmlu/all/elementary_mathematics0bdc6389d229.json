They start with the smallest number (11,633 but then jump to 167,213 which is larger than the next number 161,455.\n- **Option B**: This is correctly ordered from least to greatest. Each number increases by a small amount, so it clearly shows ascending order.\n- **Option C**: The sequence is not ordered correctly. It starts with a relatively small number 11,145 and then jumps to much larger numbers.\n- **Option D**: Although the numbers increase, there's a typo in the last number which should be 125,213 instead of 105,213 to maintain the order as given, the numbers are not listed in ascending order as they are are presented here.\n\nTherefore, only **Option B** correctly lists the numbers from least to greatest."
