This means that although the right to privacy is not explicitly stated in the Constitution, it has been inferred from various amendments within the Bill of Rights, particularly those that protect individual liberties such as freedom of speech, religion, and search and seizure protections. Over time, these protections have been combined to create a broader concept of privacy rights, which the Supreme Court has used to uphold various individual rights in cases involving privacy."
