After work, the defendant went out drinking with one of the other cooks, and they were commiserating about their lack of money. They decided that the only way out of their rut was to rob a local bank. They then agreed to carry out a bank heist on the following Friday. In accordance with their plan, the cook on Monday purchased two ski masks to be used in the robbery. On Wednesday, after learning that the cook had bought the masks, the defendant got cold feet and told the cook he was renouncing his involvement in the robbery scheme. On Friday, the cook carried out the robbery without the defendant's participation. This jurisdiction requires an overt act for the crime of conspiracy. Is the defendant guilty of conspiracy?\n\nA. Yes, because the cook and the defendant did enter into an agreement to commit the bank robbery.\nB. Yes, because the purchase of the ski masks was a sufficient overt act in the furtherance of the crime.\nC. Yes, because the defendant did not thwart the cook from committing the robbery.\nD. No, because the defendant's withdrawal was effective.\n"

No, because the defendant's withdrawal was effective.\n\nIn order to establish conspiracy, there must be an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, and at least one overt act in furtherance of that agreement must have been committed by one of the conspirators. However, if a conspirator withdraws from the conspiracy before the crime is committed and communicates this withdrawal to the other conspirators, their liability for conspiracy can be negated.\n\nIn this case, the defendant expressed his intent to renounce his involvement in the robbery scheme on Monday, three days before the actual robbery took place on Friday. Since the defendant communicated his withdrawal effectively before the overt act (the bank robbery) occurred, he cannot be held liable for the conspiracy. Therefore, the defendant is not guilty of conspiracy."
