The activation energy of a reaction: The activation energy is a key component in the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a chemical reaction to the activation energy (Ea), the temperature (T), and the gas constant (R).\n\nB. The rate constant at various temperatures: By rearranging the Arrhenius equation, you can solve for the rate constant (k) given values for Ea, T, and R.\n\nC. The shelf life of a consumer product or drug: In practical terms, the shelf life of a product can often be estimated by determining how long it takes for the reaction rate to decrease to a level where the product is no longer effective. This involves understanding the kinetics of the degradation reactions involved, which can be described using the Arrhenius equation."
