The polynomial degree\n\nThe polynomial degree determines the complexity of the model. A low-degree polynomial may not capture the underlying trend in the data ( leading to underfitting (high bias). On the other hand, a high-degree polynomial can fit the training data very closely, including its noise, potentially leading to overfitting (high variance).\n\nThe other options also play some role but do not have as direct an impact on this trade-off:\n\nB. Whether we learn the weights by matrix inversion or gradient descent is more about the computational method used for fitting the model, not the model's complexity.\n\nC. The assumed variance of the Gaussian noise impacts how the model should handle uncertainty, but it does not directly control the model's complexity.\n\nD. The use of a constant-term unit input allows the model to include an intercept term, which helps avoid forcing the regression line to go through the origin. This doesn't affect the model's complexity but rather how it is parameterized."
