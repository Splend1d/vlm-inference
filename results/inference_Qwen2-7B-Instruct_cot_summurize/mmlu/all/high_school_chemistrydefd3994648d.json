                    "text": "The atomic radius of an element generally decreases as you move from left to right across a period in the periodic table due to the increasing effective nuclear charge. Magnesium is located in the third period, so we can expect that sodium (which is in the same group but in the second period) will have a smaller atomic radius.\n\nThe first ionization energy also tends to increase from left to right within a period because the electrons are being pulled closer to the nucleus by the stronger nuclear charge. Sodium is also expected to have a higher first ionization energy compared to magnesium, as it is in the same group but in the next period where the effective nuclear charge is greater.\n\nConsidering these trends:\n\n- For atomic radius: Sodium's atomic radius would be smaller than magnesium's. Among the choices, option C (135 pm is the smallest value, suggesting it might be the correct choice.\n  \n- For first ionization energy: Sodium's first ionization energy should be higher than magnesium's. Option D lists a higher value (523 kJ/mol compared to magnesium's 737 kJ/mol.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most probable values for the ionization energy and atomic radius of sodium would be closest to option D: 135 pm and 523 kJ/mol. This matches both the trend towards a smaller atomic radius as you move from left to right across a period and the trend for increased ionization energy in the same direction. \n\nTherefore, the answer is **D. 135 pm, 523 kJ/mol**."
