The owners buy the office next door, and this doubles the customer seating.\n\nThis option represents a long-run adjustment because it involves a significant change that the business can only make after careful consideration and planning over time. Buying the office next door to expand seating capacity requires investment, potentially involves legal and financial procedures, and is not something that can be done instantly or without preparation.\n\nA. The owners switching from whole wheat to sourdough bread could be considered a short-term or long-term adjustment depending on how permanent the change is. It might involve some adjustment in recipes, customer preferences, and potentially some investment in new equipment or ingredients, but it's generally more manageable than option D.\n\nB. Hiring several part-time workers to cover dinner shifts is typically a short-term adjustment to handle increased demand. It might require some training and coordination, but it does not fundamentally alter the business model or infrastructure.\n\nC. Working overtime on a busy weekend is also usually a short-term adjustment aimed at meeting peak demand without requiring significant changes to the business structure or resources.\n\nIn contrast, option D involves a substantial change in the physical space and customer capacity, which is indicative of a long-run adjustment as it requires strategic planning, investment, and possibly changes in operations and staffing."
