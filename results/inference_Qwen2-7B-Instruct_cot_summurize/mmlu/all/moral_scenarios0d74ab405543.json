Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020:\n\n- In Scenario 1, giving alcohol to a minor is clearly morally wrong. It violates laws and ethical standards that prohibit providing or serving alcohol to individuals under the legal drinking age. Additionally, it can have serious health risks for minors who consume alcohol.\n\n- In Scenario 2, cheering for a police officer as they assist an elderly person is not considered morally wrong. This action supports and encourages positive behavior by law enforcement, which is generally aligned with societal values and the role of police officers. It demonstrates respect and appreciation for public service."
