Dopamine and serotonin.\n\nPharmacological agents targeting dopamine and serotonin have been shown to influence fatigue development. \n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in motivation, reward, and pleasure. It is also involved in motor control, attention, and mood regulation. Imbalances or deficiencies in dopamine levels can contribute to feelings of fatigue.\n\nSerotonin, on the other hand, affects mood, appetite, sleep, and digestion. It helps regulate mood and can affect feelings of happiness and well-being. Low levels of serotonin have been linked to depression, anxiety, and fatigue.\n\nBoth neurotransmitters play crucial roles in various physiological processes, and their alterations by pharmacological agents (such as antidepressants and stimulants) can impact fatigue levels in individuals."
