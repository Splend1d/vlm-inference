This implies that since these reproductive cells are derived directly from the genetic material of the individual, they are considered integral components of that person rather than independent entities in themselves. However, it's important to note that this viewpoint is distinct from mainstream medical and ethical perspectives which generally consider ova and sperm as human for the purposes of reproduction and genetic lineage."
