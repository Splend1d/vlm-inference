These axioms are:\n\n1. **Closure**: For all \\(a, b \\in H\\), it must be true that \\(a * b \\in H\\). This corresponds to option A.\n\n2. **Associativity**: For all \\(a, b, c \\in H\\), the equation \\((a * b) * c = a * ( (b * c)\\) must hold. Since \\(H\\) is a subset of \\(G\\), and \\(G\\) is associative by definition, this axiom is automatically satisfied for any subset \\(H\\).\n\n3. **Identity Element**: There must exist an element \\(e \\in H\\) such that for every \\(a \\in H\\), \\(a * e = e * a = a\\). Option D states that \\(H\\) contains the identity element, which is one of the necessary conditions for \\(H\\) to be a group.\n\n4. **Inverse Element**: For each \\(a \\in H\\), there must exist an element \\(b \\in H\\) such that \\(a * b = b * a = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element. Option B states that for every \\(a \\in H\\), its inverse \\(a^{-1}\\) is also in \\(H\\).\n\nOption C essentially says that for all \\(a, b \\in H\\), \\(a * b^{-1} \\in H\\), which is related to the existence of inverses but not as comprehensive as requiring that both \\(a\\) and \\(b^{-1}\\) are in \\(H\\) for all \\(a, b \\in H\\), which is what option B does.\n\nTherefore, for \\(H\\) to be a group, it needs to satisfy all these conditions, meaning that options **A**, **B**, and **D** ( along with the implicit requirement from **B** that the inverse of any element in \\(H\\) is also in \\(H\\), are essential. Thus, collectively, these conditions imply that \\(H\\) should satisfy options **A**, **B**, and **D** to be considered a group."
