When you split the sample into two sub-samples and estimate the model separately for each, the RSS for each sub-sample will be calculated based on the data within that specific subset.\n\nThe total RSS for the entire sample can be thought of as the sum of the RSS from both sub-samples because each observation contributes to the overall error sum of squares regardless of which sub-sample it belongs to. Therefore, if you add up the RSS from the first sub-sample and the RSS from the second sub-sample, you should get the total RSS for the whole sample.\n\nSo the correct answer would be:\n\nD.
