According to the problem statement:\n\n\\[P(E) = 2 \\times P(O)\\]\n\nSince there are three odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and three even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die:\n\n\\[P(O) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\\[P(E) = 2 \\times P(O) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\]\n\nHowever, these calculations don't add up correctly because they exceed 1, which can't be right for probabilities. The correct interpretation should consider that the total probability sums to 1, so we have:\n\n\\[P(O) + P(E) = 1\\]\nGiven \\(P(E) = 2P(O)\\), substituting \\(P(E)\\) gives us:\n\\[P(O) + 2P(O) = 1\\]\n\\[3P(O) = 1\\]\n\\[P(O) = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\\[P(E) = 2P(O) = \\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\nNow, to find the probability of rolling a 5 (which is one of the odd numbers, with \\(P(O) = \\frac{1}{3}\\)) followed by rolling a 6 (which is one of the even numbers, with \\(P(E) = \\frac{2}{3}\\)), we multiply the probabilities of each independent event:\n\n\\[P(\\text{rolling a 5}) \\times P(\\text{rolling a 6}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9}\\]\n\nThis result isn't directly among the options provided, indicating a need to re-examine our approach or the options. Given the corrected understanding, the probability of rolling a specific odd number (5) followed by a specific even number (6) under the given conditions should indeed be calculated based on their individual probabilities without considering the initial misinterpretation in calculating the total probabilities directly.\n\nGiven the corrected calculation, let's clarify the final step:\n\nThe probability of rolling a 5 is \\(P(5) = \\frac{1}{3}\\) since there's only one 5 out of three odd numbers, and similarly, the probability of rolling a 6 is \\(P(6) = \\frac{1}{3}\\) since there's only one 6 out of three even numbers.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a 5 followed by a 6 is:\n\n\\[P(5) \\times P(6) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. 1/9."
