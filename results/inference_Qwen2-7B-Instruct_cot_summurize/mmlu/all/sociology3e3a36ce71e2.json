Its knowledge is accumulated from many different research contexts.\n\nSociology, as a scientific discipline, aims to understand social phenomena through systematic observation and analysis, often involving empirical data gathered across various settings and populations. This approach allows sociologists to build a comprehensive understanding of society based on diverse research findings, rather than relying solely on personal experiences or subjective opinions. In contrast, common sense often refers to widely held beliefs or assumptions that may not always be supported by rigorous evidence or systematic investigation."
