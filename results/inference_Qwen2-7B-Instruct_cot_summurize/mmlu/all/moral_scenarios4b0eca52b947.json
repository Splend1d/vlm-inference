Not wrong, Wrong\n\nHiding a birthday gift is generally not considered morally wrong unless it involves deception or withholding information in a way that causes harm or disappointment. It's a surprise and can be seen as thoughtful or exciting.\n\nInvesting someone else's life savings in a high-return account without their full knowledge or consent could be seen as morally wrong if it leads to financial loss for the other person, especially if they were expecting the funds to be used differently or if they lack the financial literacy to understand the risks involved. This scenario could potentially involve exploitation or mismanagement of funds, depending on the specifics."
