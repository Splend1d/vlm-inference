The most accurate answer to your question would be:\n\nC. based on comparative advantage.\n\nThis principle suggests that TNCs will locate their operations in places where they can take advantage of lower costs or more favorable conditions compared to other locations. This could include cheaper labor, resources, or less stringent regulations. However, it's important to note that TNCs might also consider other factors such as proximity to markets, access to technology, skilled labor, and infrastructure when deciding where to distribute their operations.\n\nOptions A and B are not generally how TNCs operate because they typically seek to minimize costs and maximize profits rather than locating where production costs are inherently the highest. \n\nOption D is not accurate either, as while some TNCs might have their headquarters in a less developed country (LDC) for certain reasons (such as tax benefits or strategic positioning in a specific market - this is not a general rule for all TNCs. Many TNCs are headquartered in developed countries."
