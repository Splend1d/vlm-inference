The diagonal of a square splits it into two congruent right-angled triangles, so we can use the distance formula to calculate the length of this diagonal.\n\nThe distance \\(d\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) on the Cartesian plane is given by:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + ( (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\]\n\nGiven the points \\((1,2)\\) and \\((7,4)\\), we substitute these into the distance formula:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(7 - 1)^2 + ( (4 - 2)^2}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(6)^2 + ( (2)^2}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{36}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{36} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 9} = 2\\sqrt{9} = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\sqrt{1} = 6\\]\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal is \\(6\\sqrt{1} = 6\\) units.\n\nNow, in a square, the relationship between the side length \\(s\\) and the diagonal \\(d\\) is given by:\n\n\\[d = s\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nWe know \\(d = 6\\), so:\n\n\\[6 = s\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(s\\), we get:\n\n\\[s = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of a square is given by \\(A = s^2\\). Substituting the value of \\(s\\) we found:\n\n\\[A = ( (3\\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 \\cdot 2 = 18\\]\n\nHowever, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation process leading to the area directly from the side length without the correct application of the diagonal's relationship to the side in a square. Let's correct this oversight:\n\nGiven \\(d = 6\\) ( as the length of the diagonal, and knowing the relationship between the diagonal (\\(d\\)) and the side (\\(s\\)) in a square, \\(d = s\\sqrt{2}\\), we should solve for \\(s\\) correctly:\n\n\\[6 = s\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\n\\[s = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}}\\]\n\nTo rationalize the denominator:\n\n\\[s = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nNow calculating the area correctly using the side length:\n\n\\[A = s^2 = (3\\sqrt{2)^2 = 9 \\cdot 2 = 18\\]\n\nThis step was incorrectly applied in the initial explanation. Let's correct the final reasoning:\n\nGiven the correct understanding, when you have the diagonal \\(d = 6\\sqrt{1} = 6\\) units, and knowing the relationship \\(d = s\\sqrt{2}\\), solving for \\(s\\) gives \\(s = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThe correct area calculation using \\(s = 3\\sqrt{2}\\) should actually reflect the direct relationship between the diagonal and the area without the intermediate step that led to confusion:\n\nGiven \\(d = 6\\) and the relationship \\(d = s\\sqrt{2}\\), finding \\(s\\) directly:\n\n\\[s = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}}\\]\n\nTo avoid confusion and ensure clarity, let's directly calculate the area based on the diagonal's length and the correct relationship between diagonal and area:\n\nGiven \\(d = 6\\) and knowing that \\(d = s\\sqrt{2}\\),\n\n\\[s = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}}\\]\n\nBut for the area calculation, it's more straightforward to use the direct relationship between the diagonal and the area without explicitly solving for \\(s\\) in terms of \\(d\\):\n\nGiven \\(d = 6\\) and the relationship \\(d = s\\sqrt{2}\\), the area \\(A\\) of the square can also be calculated directly from the diagonal using the formula \\(A = \\frac{d^2}{2}\\), because \\(d^2 = 2s^2\\), and thus \\(A = \\frac{2s^2}{2} = s^"
