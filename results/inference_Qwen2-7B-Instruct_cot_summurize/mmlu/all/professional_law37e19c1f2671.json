Later, the company began recycling chemical waste at the property. There was a substantial release of toxic chemicals into the environment. The EPA ordered a clean-up of the property against the owner and the chemical company. The landowner defended the proceedings, claiming it did not know what the chemical company was doing. What will the court decide?\n\nA. The landowner is responsible under federal law regardless of whether it had knowledge or participated in the release of hazardous substances.\nB. The court dismissed the action against the owner because federal law does not include innocent landowners in the regulatory scheme.\nC. The court dismissed the action because liability for environmental hazards cannot be imposed simply because the owner has a contractual relationship with the offending tenant.\nD. The court imposed liability on the landowner because he had a duty to inspect the property to determine what the tenant was doing there.\n"

The landowner is responsible under federal law regardless of whether it had knowledge or participated in the release of hazardous substances.\n\nUnder federal law, specifically the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ( also known as Superfund or CERCLA), landowners can be held liable for environmental cleanup if they knew or should have known about the contamination and failed to take appropriate action. This means that even if the landowner claims they were unaware of the activities on their property, they could still be held responsible for cleanup costs and penalties if they had a duty to know and failed to meet that duty.\n\nThe court would likely consider factors such as the nature of the business conducted on the property, the landowner's involvement in the operations, and any contractual obligations between the parties. In this case, since the chemical company began recycling chemical waste after initially storing raw materials and finished products, the landowner may be held liable due to their continued relationship with the company and potentially their awareness of the increased risk of environmental damage."
