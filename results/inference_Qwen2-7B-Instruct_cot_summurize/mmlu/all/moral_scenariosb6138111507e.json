Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn scenario 1, recommending an alternative restaurant out of concern for someone else's well-being is not considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards. It shows consideration and care for the health of others.\n\nIn scenario 2, the action of beating someone with a bat is generally considered morally wrong, especially if it implies physical harm or aggression towards another person without justification. This action violates principles of respect for autonomy and non-violence."
