The floor of the orbit: The inferior wall of the maxillary sinus is in close proximity to the floor of the orbit, which houses the eye and its associated structures.\n\n2. The upper posterior teeth: The roots of the upper molars can extend into the maxillary sinus, making dental procedures in this region more complex.\n\n3. The infratemporal fossa: This is a space located below the temporal bone and above the floor of the mouth. It contains various muscles and nerves that may be affected by issues within the maxillary sinus.\n\n4. The hard palate: The maxillary sinus communicates with the nasal cavity through the superior meatus, and its inferior wall is in close proximity to the hard palate.\n\nTherefore, option D accurately describes the structures that the walls of the maxillary sinus are related to."
