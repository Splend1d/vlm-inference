                    "text": "The correct answer is A. anaerobic contribution progressively increases.\n\nWhen you engage in physical activities, your body uses different types of metabolism to produce energy depending on the intensity and duration of the exercise. During short bursts of intense activity, such as sprinting, the anaerobic metabolism becomes more prominent because it can rapidly provide energy without the need for oxygen. As you increase the number of sprints, the body becomes more efficient at using this anaerobic pathway, leading to an increased anaerobic contribution over time.\n\nThe other options are not accurate under most circumstances:\nB. The pH of the muscle typically does not fall below 6.0 during normal physical activity. Instead, lactic acid production ( (which is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism) can lead to a decrease in pH, but this usually remains within physiological limits.\nC. Blood glucose levels do not necessarily fall below 3 mmol/L during moderate to high-intensity exercise. However, if exercise continues for several hours or the individual has diabetes, blood glucose levels might indeed drop below this threshold.\nD. The relative contribution of aerobic metabolism would likely increase with sustained, long-duration exercise rather than with repeated short sprints, which predominantly utilize anaerobic pathways."
