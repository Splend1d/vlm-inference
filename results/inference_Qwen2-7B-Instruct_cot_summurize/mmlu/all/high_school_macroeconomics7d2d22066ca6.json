Your father's firm makes computers and exports them to China.\n\nThis option will affect GDP because it involves the production of goods (computers) and the export, which adds value to the economy. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period.\n\nA. Losing money in a bet does not contribute to the creation of new goods or services, so it does not impact GDP.\n\nB. Fixing your brother's car without buying new parts is considered a service, but since you're doing it for free, it doesn't add to the market transactions that GDP counts.\n\nD. Buying stocks does not involve the production of new goods or services, nor does it directly contribute to the economic output measured by GDP. It is more related to financial transactions in the capital market."
