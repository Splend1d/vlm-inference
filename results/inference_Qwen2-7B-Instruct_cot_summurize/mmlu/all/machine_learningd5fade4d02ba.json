While BERT was pre-trained on the BooksCorpus ( which has about 800 million words) and English Wikipedia v1 ( which has about 2 billion words), RoBERTa's pretraining corpus is significantly larger, approximately 10 times larger.\n- Statement 2 is false. In 2018, when ResNeXts were popular, they typically used the rectified linear unit (ReLU) as their activation function rather than the hyperbolic tangent (tanh). ReLU is more commonly associated with these architectures because of its computational efficiency and effectiveness in addressing the vanishing gradient problem."
