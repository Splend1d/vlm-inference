                    "text": "The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is:\n\nA. A secondary growth cartilage: This statement is correct. The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is a type of secondary growth cartilage that plays a role in the development and growth of the skull during childhood.\n\nB. Influences the position of the viscerocranium: This statement is not entirely accurate. The spheno-occipital synchondrosis does not directly influence the position of the viscerocranium, which refers to the region of the skull containing the brain and cranial nerves. Instead, it contributes to the overall shape and size of the cranium.\n\nC. Ceases activity at 7 years of age: This statement is generally incorrect. The spheno-occipital synchondrosis typically closes (or fuses) by the end of adolescence or early adulthood, but this can vary significantly between individuals. There is no specific age given as \"7 years\" for closure.\n\nD. Can be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly: This statement is correct. Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder caused by excessive production of growth hormone (GH), usually due to a non-cancerous tumor on the pituitary gland. In patients with acromegaly, the growth plates (secondary growth cartilages like the spheno-occipital synchondrosis - may partially or completely re-open, leading to continued bone growth and enlargement of the skull and face beyond normal adult dimensions."
