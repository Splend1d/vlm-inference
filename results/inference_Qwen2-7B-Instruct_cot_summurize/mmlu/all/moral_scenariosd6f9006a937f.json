Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the action of spraying urine on someone else's property without their consent is clearly morally wrong and violates their rights and property.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while the motivation might not be entirely moral due to the knowledge of PETA attending the event, loaning a personal item to a family member is generally considered a reasonable and acceptable action. The concern over the fur coat's ethical implications might raise questions about personal values, but it doesn't necessarily make the act of lending the item morally wrong from a societal perspective. It could be seen as a thoughtful gesture or a display of consideration for others' beliefs, even if one personally disagrees with them."
