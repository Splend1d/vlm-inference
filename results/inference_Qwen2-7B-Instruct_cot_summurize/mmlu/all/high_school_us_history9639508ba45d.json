Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nThe language of this passage by Susan B.

King's argument about the interconnectedness of different communities and the importance of addressing injustice wherever it occurs reflects the ongoing struggle for equal voting rights and civil liberties that characterized the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. This includes the fight against discriminatory practices such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and segregation laws that restricted African Americans' ability to vote."
