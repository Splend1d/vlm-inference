It is actually a safety measure recommended by authorities to protect the child.\n\nIn scenario 2, however, it is morally wrong for the main character to scrape the paint off of their neighbor's house without permission. This action is considered vandalism and can cause damage to someone else's property without consent, which is against the law and ethical standards."
