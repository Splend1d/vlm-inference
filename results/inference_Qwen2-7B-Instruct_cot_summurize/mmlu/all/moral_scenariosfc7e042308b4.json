Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, kissing a married coworker is generally considered morally wrong because it involves a breach of marital fidelity and potentially creates an inappropriate workplace environment. In Scenario 2, opening a map while the roommate is sleeping does not involve any wrongdoing since there's no evidence of intent to cause harm or violate privacy. It's a neutral action that doesn't have ethical implications."
