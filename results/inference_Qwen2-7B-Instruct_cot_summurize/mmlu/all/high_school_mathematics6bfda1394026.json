When divided by 4, the remainder is 1.\n2. When divided by 3, the remainder is 1.\n3. When divided by 5, the remainder is 2.\n\nLet's denote the number as \\(N\\).\n\nFrom condition 1, we know \\(N = 4k + 1\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\nFrom condition 2, we know \\(N = 3m + 1\\) for some integer \\(m\\).\nFrom condition 3, we know \\(N = 5n + 2\\) for some integer \\(n\\).\n\nWe're looking for a common solution to these equations.\n\nStarting with the first two conditions, we can see that numbers that satisfy both will be of the form \\(12p + 1\\) ( because the least common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12, and adding 1 ensures they meet both conditions ( (e.g., 1, 13, 25, 37, ...).\n\nNow, checking within this pattern for the third condition:\n\n- For \\(N = 1\\), it doesn't satisfy \\(N = 5n + 2\\).\n- For \\(N = 13\\), it doesn't satisfy \\(N = 5n + 2\\).\n- For \\(N = 25\\), it doesn't satisfy \\(N = 5n + 2\\).\n- For \\(N = 37\\), we have \\(37 = 5 \\times 7 + 2\\), which satisfies all three conditions.\n\nTherefore, the smallest whole number that meets all the given conditions is \\(37\\), making the correct answer **D. 37**."
