This distinction is relevant to ethical egoism, which asserts that one should act solely in their own self-interest. Feinberg argues that ethical egoists often fail to account for the value of intrinsic pleasures, which can be enjoyed without any ulterior motives, suggesting they do not align perfectly with the strict self-interested actions that ethical egoism prescribes.\n\nRegarding A. psychological egoism, which posits that all human actions are motivated by self-interest, Feinberg's distinction does not directly refute this view. Psychological egoism could potentially accommodate both intrinsic and instrumental pleasures, depending on how one interprets the motivations behind them. However, it might challenge the idea that all pleasures are self-interested, as it leaves open the possibility that some actions might be motivated by concern for others' well-being.\n\nFeinberg's distinction is less directly applicable to B. psychological egoistic hedonism, which is a specific form of psychological egoism that holds that people always act to maximize their own pleasure. While this theory would likely resonate with the instrumental pleasures, it might struggle with intrinsic pleasures, which do not necessarily serve as means to greater pleasure.\n\nIn summary, while Feinberg's distinction does not directly target psychological egoism, it does challenge ethical egoism by highlighting the complexity and diversity of pleasures, suggesting that not all pleasures can be neatly categorized under the self-interested action framework of ethical egoism."
