In 1994, thelandowner delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000,a deed signed by the landowner, naming the son andhis heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the landowner-to-son deed, sought out the landowner and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the vineyard from the landowner to the farmer and his heirs. The landowner executed such a deed, and the farmer promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the vineyard by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the vineyard. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the vineyard to an investor and, for $15,000, paid by the investor, signed and delivered a deed of the vineyard in favor of the investor and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the investor made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a vintner paid the farmer $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the vintner a deed of the vineyard in favor of the vintner and his heirs. The vintner had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior landowner-to-son instrument. Although the vintner did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the vineyard twice a week. The vintner recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a farmer, the investor signed and delivered a deed of the vineyard naming the farmer and his heirs as grantees. Before the farmer had paid the investor and taken his deed, the farmer visited the vineyard and observed the fence. However, the vintner was not present when the farmer visited the property, and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094if anyone \u0080\u0094was using it. In any case, the farmer did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. The farmer then recorded the deed.

In a race-notice jurisdiction, the vintner, as a subsequent bona fide purchaser without notice of the prior landowner-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he recorded his deed first in time.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe question presents a scenario involving several transactions over time involving different parties acquiring interests in a vineyard. In this jurisdiction, every conveyance of real estate that is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.\n\nLet's analyze each party's claim to the vineyard:\n\n1. **Landowner (1993**: The landowner initially holds good record title to the vineyard in fee simple absolute.\n\n2. **Landowner to Son (1994**: The landowner delivers a deed to his son, but the son neglects to record the deed. The landowner still holds the record title.\n\n3. **Farmer to Landowner 1998**: The farmer buys the vineyard from the landowner, records the deed, constructs a fence, and acquires color of title. He is a bona fide purchaser for value and records first in time.\n\n4. **Landowner to Investor 11999**: The landowner sells the vineyard to an investor, who records the deed but does not search the title or examine the property.\n\n5. **Vintner to Farmer 2003**: The vintner purchases the vineyard from the farmer, records his deed, and regularly visits the vineyard, indicating possession. He is also a bona fide purchaser for value and records first in time.\n\n6. **Investor to Farmer 2007**: The investor sells the vineyard to the farmer again, who records the deed, but does not search the title before purchasing.\n\n**Jurisdiction's Recording Act**: \"Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.\"\n\nGiven this act and the facts provided:\n\n- **Farmer (2003**: The farmer is the first to record his deed and is a bona fide purchaser for value, so he acquires record title.\n- **Vintner 2003**: The vintner is also a bona fide purchaser for value, but records first in time than he also acquires record title.\n\nIn a race-notice jurisdiction, both the farmer and the vintner have met the requirements for acquiring title. However, since the farmer acquired title before the vintner under the facts presented, the farmer would be considered the owner based on the priority of recording.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the vintner, as a subsequent bona fide purchaser without notice of the prior landowner-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he recorded his deed first in time. \n\nThis choice seems incorrect given the analysis, pointing to a potential error in the options provided. Based on the typical understanding of race-notice jurisdictions and the fact that the farmer acquired title before the vintner, the most accurate answer considering the options given would align with the farmer's status as the last in time to record, making option A (\"In a race-notice jurisdiction, the farmer, as a subsequent bona fide purchaser, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he was the last in time to record.\") the closest match to reality under these circumstances."
