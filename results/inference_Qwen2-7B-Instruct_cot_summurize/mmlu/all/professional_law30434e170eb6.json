As part of his scheme, the boyfriend enlisted his girlfriend, who agreed to drive the getaway car. On the day of the robbery, the girlfriend and the boyfriend drove to the bank. After the girlfriend parked outside and the boyfriend went into the bank, she saw a security guard in the bank and changed her mind and fled on foot, leaving the keys in the car with the motor running. A few minutes later, the boyfriend went into the bank, robbed it, and then ran back to the car. He drove off and was speeding away from the bank when he looked behind to see if he was being followed. As he took his eye off the road, the boyfriend's vehicle struck a pedestrian who was crossing the street, killing her. For the pedestrian's death, the girlfriend should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Murder.\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\nC. Voluntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

However, under certain legal theories, she could potentially be held criminally liable for the pedestrian's death due to her role in setting up the circumstances that led to the accident.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the concept of \"felony murder\" or \"crime causation\" might apply. This theory holds that if a death occurs during the commission of a felony (in this case, the bank robbery - and the defendant's actions ( in this case, fleeing and leaving the vehicle running - contribute to the death, they can be charged with murder or manslaughter. \n\nGiven the scenario described:\n\n1. The girlfriend left the car running and unlocked, which facilitated the quick departure of the boyfriend after the robbery. \n2. The boyfriend was speeding away from the bank, which increased the risk of an accident.\n3. The boyfriend was distracted by looking behind him, which contributed to the accident.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it could be argued that the girlfriend's actions, even if they were not direct causes of the pedestrian's death, facilitated the conditions leading to the accident and therefore contributed to the death indirectly. Therefore, she could potentially be charged with:\n\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\n\nThis charge is based on the notion that the defendant's actions created an unreasonable risk of harm, and despite that risk, the defendant acts with reckless disregard for human life, resulting in someone's death.\n\nHowever, the specifics of the law vary significantly by jurisdiction, and the application of felony murder or related doctrines would need to be evaluated within the context of local laws and court precedents. It's also important to note that the guilt or innocence would depend on the evidence presented at trial, including the specific intentions and actions of both the boyfriend and the girlfriend."
