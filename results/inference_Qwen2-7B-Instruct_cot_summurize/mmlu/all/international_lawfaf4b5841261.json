This type of immunity applies regardless of the location where the act was committed or the nationality of the person affected.\n\nThe correct answer would be:\n\nB. Functional immunity covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act\n\nThis means that if an act is performed by an individual in their official capacity, they are protected under functional immunity, which shields them from personal liability for that act. However, it's important to note that while the individual may be immune from personal liability, the entity they represent (like a government or state organization, might still be liable for the act. \n\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification or assistance with any other topic!"
