                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principles of interference and how they apply to a Michelson interferometer. When a gas cell is placed in one arm of a Michelson interferometer, the path difference between the two arms lengths affects the interference pattern observed.\n\nThe formula for the fringe width (\\(\\Delta\\lambda\\)) in an interferometer is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda}{m} \\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the order of the fringe ( and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the light used. In this case, \\(m = 100\\) fringes have been counted.\n\nGiven that the path difference is due to the gas cell's presence, the total path difference can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\Delta d = n_d - d \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(n\\) is the index of refraction of the gas,\n- \\(d\\) is the physical length of the gas cell ( (10 cm or 0.1 m),\n- and \\(nd\\) is the optical path length through the gas cell.\n\nSince the light travels twice the path difference in the interferometer (once down each arm), the total path difference becomes \\(2\\Delta d\\).\n\nWe know the wavelength \\(\\lambda = 632.2 \\text{ nm}\\) and the number of fringes \\(m = 100\\). The fringe width \\(\\Delta\\lambda\\) can also be related to the path difference through the interferometer and the wavelength as:\n\n\\[ \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{2\\Delta d}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\(\\Delta d\\) into this equation gives:\n\n\\[ \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{2(n-1)d}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\(n\\):\n\n\\[ n = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda \\lambda}{2d} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ n = 1 + \\frac{(632.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}) \\times 100}{2 \\times 0.1 \\text{ m}} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 1 + \\frac{63220}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 1 + 316.1 \\]\n\nThis calculation is incorrect because it assumes that the fringe width is directly proportional to the path difference, which is not the case. Instead, we should use the fact that the fringe width is given by \\(\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda}{m}\\), where \\(m = 100\\) in this case. Thus,\n\n\\[ \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{632.2 \\times 10^{-9}}{100} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta\\lambda = 6.322 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nUsing the correct relationship:\n\n\\[ n = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda \\lambda}{2d} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 1 + \\frac{(6.322 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}) \\times (632.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times 0.1 \\text{ m}} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 1 + \\frac{4.016 \\times 10^{-19}}{0.2} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 1 + 2.008 \\times 10^{-17} \\]\n\nThis result is clearly incorrect due to a misunderstanding in the approach to solving the problem. Let's correct the approach:\n\nGiven the correct interpretation, the total path difference \\(2\\Delta d\\) should lead us to the correct calculation of the index of refraction. The correct formula relating the fringe width to the index of refraction and the path difference is actually derived from the condition that the fringe width \\(\\Delta\\lambda\\) is equal to the path difference divided by the wavelength times the number of fringes:\n\n\\[ \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{2\\Delta d}{m\\lambda} \\]\n\nGiven that the fringe width is directly related to the change in optical path length due to the index of refraction, we can rearrange the formula for fringe width to find the index of refraction \\(n\\):\n\n\\[ n = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda/m} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda \\cdot m}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[ n = 1 + \\frac{632.2 \\times 1^{-9} \\cdot 100}{632.2 \\times 10^{-9}} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 1 + \\frac{63220}{"
