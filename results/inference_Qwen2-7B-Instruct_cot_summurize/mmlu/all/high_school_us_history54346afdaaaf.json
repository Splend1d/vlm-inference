Many of us began maturing in complacency.\n\"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . .\"\n\u2014Port Huron Statement, 1962\nThrough the remainder of the 1960s, the growth of the organization that published the Port Huron Statement can best be understood in the context of\n\nA. rapid industrialization, urban growth and congestion, and corporate consolidation.\nB. the baby boom, economic growth, and a rapid expansion of higher education.\nC. economic polarization, supply-side economic policies, and the disappearance of the middle class.\nD. the proliferation of personal computer technologies, the rise of Christian fundamentalism, and an increase in student apathy.\n"

The baby boom, which refers to the large number of children born after World War II, contributed to a surge in enrollment in schools and universities, leading to a rapid expansion of higher education institutions and the development of new academic programs. This not only increased the number of students seeking knowledge and engagement with social issues but also provided a broader intellectual and cultural context within which the SDS could grow and advocate for political change.\n\nEconomic growth during this era, particularly in the post-war period, led to prosperity for many Americans, yet it also exacerbated income inequality and created tensions between the growing middle class and those who felt left behind. This economic polarization fueled discontent and motivated young people to seek more equitable systems and to challenge existing power structures.\n\nThe proliferation of personal computer technologies, although not explicitly mentioned in the original context, became increasingly relevant later in the 1960s and beyond, contributing to the development of new forms of communication and organization that could facilitate the growth of social movements like the SDS.\n\nChristian fundamentalism's rise and the increase in student apathy, while factors that may have influenced the landscape of American society and politics, do not directly explain the context in which the SDS and the Port Huron Statement emerged. Instead, they reflect broader societal shifts that occurred after the initial period of the 1960s when the SDS was most active."
