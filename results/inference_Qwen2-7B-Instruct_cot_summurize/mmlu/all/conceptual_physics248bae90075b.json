This is encapsulated in the Second Law of Thermodynamics which states that the total entropy ( a measure of disorder or randomness - of an isolated system can never decrease over time. It will either remain constant or increase.\n\nSo, while the options might seem contradictory, the correct interpretation would be that natural processes tend to move from higher order or more organized states towards lower order or disordered states, which aligns with both option A and C."
