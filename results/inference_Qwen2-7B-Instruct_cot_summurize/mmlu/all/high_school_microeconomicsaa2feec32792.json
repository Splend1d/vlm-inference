It will be located below the equilibrium price.\n\nA price ceiling is a maximum legal price that can be charged for a good or service, and it's usually set below the equilibrium price. The purpose of a price ceiling is typically to make goods more affordable for consumers, especially in cases of essential items like rent or utilities. However, if the price ceiling is set too low, it can lead to shortages as the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at that price level."
