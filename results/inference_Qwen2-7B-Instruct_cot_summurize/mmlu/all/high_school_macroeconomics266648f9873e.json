Expansionary policy greatly increases aggregate demand if investment is sensitive to changes in the interest rate.\n\nDuring a deep recession, the economy typically experiences low levels of aggregate demand, which can lead to high unemployment and deflationary pressures. Monetary policy, which is managed by central banks, plays a crucial role in stimulating the economy during such times. An expansionary monetary policy involves actions like decreasing interest rates or increasing the money supply, which can encourage borrowing, spending, and investment, thereby increasing aggregate demand.\n\nIf investment is sensitive to changes in the interest rate ( i.e., when lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper and thus encourage more investment, then expansionary monetary policy can indeed greatly increase aggregate demand. This is because lower interest rates can stimulate both business investment and consumer spending, as it becomes cheaper for businesses to invest in new projects and for consumers to finance purchases.\n\nTherefore, option B accurately describes how an expansionary monetary policy could be effective in stimulating the economy during a deep recession, provided that investments are responsive to interest rate changes."
