True, True\n\nExplanation:\n\nStatement 1: If \\(K\\) is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then \\(K\\) is free abelian.\n\nThis statement is true. Any subgroup of a free abelian group is itself a free abelian group. This is because the property of being free abelian ( meaning it has a basis and every element can be uniquely written as a linear combination of the basis elements with integer coefficients - is preserved under subgroups.\n\nStatement 2: If \\(K\\) is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then \\(G / K\\) is free abelian.\n\nThis statement is also true. The quotient of a free abelian group by any subgroup is again a free abelian group. This follows from the fact that the quotient inherits a basis from the original group. Specifically, if \\(G\\) has a basis \\(\\{b_1, b_2, ..., b_n\\}\\), then the cosets of \\(K\\) in \\(G\\) can be described using this basis, showing that \\(G/K\\) is free abelian with the same rank as \\(G\\).\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, making the correct answer A. True, True."
