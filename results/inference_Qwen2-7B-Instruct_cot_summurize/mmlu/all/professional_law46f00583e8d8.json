They each had a separate bedroom and used the fifth bedroom as a laboratory to manufacture the illegal drug methamphetamine. One of the men was the so-called money man; he provided the funds to make the rental payments and to purchase the laboratory equipment. One of the other men was the chemist; he had both an undergraduate and graduate degree in chemistry and knew the formula and procedure for producing methamphetamine. Another of the men had sold drugs in the past and knew potential buyers of the methamphetamine. Finally, the fourth man was the enforcer; his role in the scheme was to make sure that no unauthorized persons entered onto the premises of the house. The four men had been involved in this drug venture for seven months when they were finally arrested and charged with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, and distribution and manufacture of methamphetamine. During the trial, the prosecution wishes to introduce as evidence against the money man, a statement made by the enforcer to the landlord at the time of the signing of the lease, in which the enforcer said, \"No matter what you charge us for rent, you better O. K. it with the money man, because he's the one who will really be paying it. \" The money man's attorney objects. The judge's ruling on admissibility will depend on\n\nA. whether the enforcer actually paid all of the rent.\nB. whether the enforcer had a legal obligation to pay the rent under the terms of the lease.\nC. whether the landlord may be considered a party opponent.\nD. whether the statement was made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n"

These conditions include that the conspiracy existed, the defendant was part of the conspiracy, and the statement was made during the course of the conspiracy. The statement must also be relevant to proving the conspiracy or the defendant's involvement in it.\n\nIn this scenario, the prosecution wishes to use the statement as evidence against the money man, who is one of the defendants. For the statement to be admissible, the judge would need to determine that:\n\n1. A conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine existed among the four men.\n2. The money man was part of this conspiracy.\n3. The statement was made during the course of the conspiracy, i.e., while the four men were actively engaged in planning, organizing, executing, or concealinging their drug manufacturing and distribution activities.\n4. The statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy, meaning that it was related to the conspiracy's objectives, such as securing the financial resources necessary for the operation.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are not directly relevant to the admissibility of the statement under Federal Rules of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E), which governs the admissibility of co-conspirator statements. While the facts regarding the payment of rent (option A) and the landlord's potential status as a party opponent (option C) might be relevant to the broader case, they do not directly address whether the statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy, which is crucial for its admissibility under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\n\nTherefore, the key consideration for the judge's ruling would be whether the statement was made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy, as outlined above."
