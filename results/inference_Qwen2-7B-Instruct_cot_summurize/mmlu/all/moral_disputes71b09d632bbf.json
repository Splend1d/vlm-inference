The idea is that by placing individuals behind a \"veil of ignorance,\" they will be unable to know their own place in society (including their talents, social status, abilities, etc.). This ensures that any principles chosen are are fair and unbiased, aiming to protect the interests of those least advantaged in society.\n\nTherefore, within the original position, occupants do not have access to personal information like talents, social status, or abilities. The focus is on choosing principles that would apply equally to all, regardless of such factors."
