The quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied of good X. \n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, equilibrium occurs when the quantity of the product demanded by consumers is equal to the quantity supplied by producers at a specific price. At this point, there is no shortage or surplus of the product in the market. If the price is above equilibrium, there will be a surplus, and if it's below, there will be a shortage. However, in perfect competition, the market forces naturally adjust the price until equilibrium is reached."
