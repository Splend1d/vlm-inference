The total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.\n\nThis is based on the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in a spontaneous process, the total entropy (disorder or randomness) of the system and its surroundings will always increase over time. This does not necessarily mean the process is exothermic (heat-releasing), nor does it imply that no work is involved, nor does it guarantee an increase in entropy within the system itself, just that the overall system plus surroundings will have increased disorder."
