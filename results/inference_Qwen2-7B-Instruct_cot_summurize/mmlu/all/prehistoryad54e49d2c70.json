The other options listed ( freeing the hands to carry things, allowing for braincase expansion, and expending less energy than quadrupedalism for going long distances, are are indeed proposed hypotheses for why bipedalism developed. These hypotheses suggest that the ability to walk upright on two legs provided significant benefits, such as the ability to carry tools or infants, potentially supporting more complex cognitive functions, and possibly reducing energy expenditure over long distances compared to crawling on all fours."
