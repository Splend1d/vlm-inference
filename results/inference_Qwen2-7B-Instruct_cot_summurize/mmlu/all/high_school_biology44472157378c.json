Centrioles within centrosomes.\n\nAnimal cells typically do not have a cell wall made of cellulose (like plant cells do (or a large vacuole that stores water, as this is more commonly found in plant and some protist cells. Instead, they have structures called centrioles, which are are part of the centrosome complex. Centrioles play a key role in cell division, helping to organize the formation of the mitotic spindle during cell division. \n\nLysosomes, on the other hand, are present in both animal and plant cells. They are organelles that contain digestive enzymes used for breaking down various substances within the cell."
