There are jobs for most rural-to-urban migrants.\n\nThis is because many African cities experience significant migration from rural areas in search of better economic opportunities. However, the availability of jobs to accommodate these migrants can be limited, leading to high unemployment rates and informal economies.\n\nIt's important to note that the quality and development of infrastructure, cleanliness of residential areas, and the presence of distinct business districts vary widely across different African cities and their stages of urban development. Some cities might boast well-developed infrastructure, while others may struggle with basic services and sanitation."
