But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nPresident Jackson's policy was later altered by the\n\nA. Homestead Act of 1862.\nB. Immigration Act of 1921.\nC. Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson.\nD. Dawes Act of 1887.\n"

The Tariff of 1832, also known as the \"Tariff of Abominations,\" was particularly contentious because it imposed high tariffs on imported goods, which Southern states argued would hurt their economy by increasing prices on goods they needed from the North.\n\nJackson's policy was altered in response to this opposition, leading to his veto of the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States in 1832. This decision, among others, contributed to the Nullification Crisis, where South Carolina threatened to secede from the Union due to perceived federal overreach. Jackson\u2019s stance on nullification reinforced his belief in states' rights but also highlighted the tensions between central government power and state autonomy, which are are not directly addressed by any of the options A, B, C, or D.\n\nGiven the information and context provided, none of the choices listed seem to directly answer the question about how President Jackson's policy was later altered, as none of them pertain specifically to issues of taxation, representation, or the \"no taxation without representation\" principle as discussed in the quote by Benjamin Franklin. Therefore, there might be some confusion in the phrasing of the question or the options provided. \n\nFor educational purposes, it would be more accurate to discuss how Jackson's stance on states' rights and federalism influenced his presidency, including his veto of the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and his support for the Indian Removal Act, rather than linking these actions directly to the specific options given."
