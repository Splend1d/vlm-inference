The success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas; the failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. After it, nothing remained but the idea of Force, and this idea stood at the helm of German history from then on. For the first time since 1521, the German people stepped on to the centre of the German stage only to miss their cue once more. German history reached its turning-point and failed to turn. This was the fateful essence of 1848.\nA. J. P. Taylor, The Course of German History, 1945\nWhy might it be important to note that Taylor was writing his analysis in 1945?\n\nA. A historian writing at the end of World War II might be inclined to look for, and find, the origins of perceived German belligerence.\nB.

Taylor wrote his analysis in 1945 was crucial because he was reflectinging on the historical events of 1848 within the broader framework of understanding the complexities and potential causes leading up to the devastation of World War II. The historical perspective of an event can be significantly influenced by the context in which it is observed. In Taylor's case, given the recent global conflict involving Germany, he might have been more likely to scrutinize the historical events of 1848 with an eye towards identifying underlying factors that could contribute to aggressive or destabilizing national behavior. This does not necessarily mean that his analysis is flawed or incorrect, but rather that it is shaped by the contemporary geopolitical climate."
