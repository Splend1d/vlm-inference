Compare AVC to MR.\n\nIn the short run, a competitive firm should continue operating as long as the market price (which equals marginal revenue, MR, in perfect competition) is greater than or equal to its average variable cost ( (AVC). If the price falls below the AVC, the firm would be losing money on each additional unit produced and it would be more profitable to shut down immediately to avoid these additional losses. At shutdown, the firm only incurs fixed costs (TFC), which are unavoidable in the short term. \n\nThe other options are not correct because:\nB. Comparing total revenue (TR) to total cost (TC) doesn't directly tell us whether the firm should continue operating or shut down. It's the comparison between price (or MR) and AVC that matters.\nC. Not producing simply because total fixed costs are not covered by revenue does not take into account whether the firm can cover its variable costs and contribute towards fixed costs through production.\nD. Producing the highest quantity demanded regardless of price ignores the fact that if the price is below the AVC, the firm will lose more by producing than by shutting down."
