The police were looking for evidence of the husband's suspected activities in a major drug trafficking plot. The wife gave her voluntary consent to the search. The police found a kilo of cocaine in a dresser drawer and various written notes that contained the names and phone numbers of co-conspirators. After the husband was arrested, he moved for suppression of all of the evidence seized in his bedroom. Will the court likely deny the motion due to the voluntary consent given by the wife?\n\nA. No, the search was unconstitutional because a wife cannot give consent for her husband.\nB. No, the search was unconstitutional because the items were under the husband's control and the wife therefore had no authority to give consent.\nC. Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\nD. The search was unconstitutional because the police did not have a search warrant.\n"

Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\n\nIn the United States, the doctrine of joint tenancy or joint occupancy allows individuals who share a space (like a married couple sharing a home) to consent to searches conducted by law enforcement without the need for a warrant, even if one of the occupants is absent. This is based on the principle that both parties have equal rights and responsibilities over the shared property. Therefore, the wife's voluntary consent to the search would likely be deemed sufficient by the court, especially since she was present and agreed to the search."
