One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. An electrician submitted a bid to do the electrical work to the contractor, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the owner. The contractor notified the electrician to that effect. Two weeks later, the contractor submitted his bid to the owner, in which he offered to perform the renovation work for $75,000. The next day, the electrician notified the contractor that he was unable to perform the electrical work on the owner's project. Two days later, the owner sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein she stated, \"I hereby accept your offer to perform the renovation work for the quoted cost of $75,000. \"Thereafter, the contractor hired another electrician to complete the electrical work at a cost of $5,000 above the first electrician's bid. The contractor explained the situation to the owner and informed her that the overall cost of the job would have to be increased to $80,000. The owner responded that she would hold the contractor to his original bid of $75,000 and would not be responsible for any additional costs. The contractor then performed the renovation work, but the owner has not yet paid him anything. In an action by the contractor against the owner for the services rendered, the contractor will probably be able to recover\n\nA. only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrifle of commercial frustration.\nB. only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $80,000 the contractor, in effect, repudiated his contract with the owner.\nC. $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.\nD. $80,000, because the contractor reasonably relied to his detriment on the electrician's bid in formulating his job estimate.\n"

The fact that the contractor had to pay more to another electrician due to the first electrician backing out does not affect the contract price between the contractor and the owner. \n\nThe doctrine of commercial frustration refers to situations where unforeseen events make performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was expected, thus excusing one or both parties from their contractual obligations. This scenario does not apply since the work could still be completed; it just became more expensive for the contractor.\n\nDemanding $80,000 after the initial agreement would be considered a breach of contract by the contractor if they had already accepted the $75,000 bid from the owner. However, in this context, it seems the contractor is merely explaining the situation rather than demanding a higher payment.\n\nQuantum meruit ( or \"as much as he is worth\" refers to a claim for reasonable compensation when no formal contract exists. Since there was an existing contract between the contractor and the owner, this principle does not apply here.\n\nTherefore, the contractor will likely be able to recover only the amount specified in the contract, which is $75,000."
