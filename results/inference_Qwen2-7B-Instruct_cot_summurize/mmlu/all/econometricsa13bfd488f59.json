As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While it's true that both the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics are used to test for the presence of autocorrelation in a time series, they do not have a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis as the sample size grows infinitely large. In fact, under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation, both tests should have a limiting distribution (which is typically a chi-squared distribution. This means that as the sample size increases, they will asymptotically follow their theoretical distributions, and thus, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis purely due to sampling variation decreases. Therefore, they don't tend to always reject the null hypothesis as the sample size approaches infinity."
