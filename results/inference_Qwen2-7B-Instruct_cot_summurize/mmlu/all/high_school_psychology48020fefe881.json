In general, when people engage in discussions with others who hold different views, they might be influenced by those views, which can lead to changes in their own beliefs or at least make them more aware of alternative perspectives. However, the extent to which this happens can vary based on factors such as the strength of initial beliefs, the quality of the arguments presented, and individual cognitive dissonance.\n\nGiven the scenario where one group (Group A) starts out uniformly opposed to the death penalty and another group (Group B) has a split opinion, it's plausible that:\n\n- **Option C** ( \"Group A would become more firmly entrenched, while Group B members would moderate their positions\" could be a reasonable expectation in some cases. Group A, already strongly opposed, might reinforce their stance through discussion with like-minded individuals. Meanwhile, Group B, having differing opinions, might experience a more dynamic exchange that could lead some to move closer to aligning with the majority view or become more moderate in their positions, considering both sides.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is not a guaranteed outcome and depends on various factors including the nature of the discussion, the presence of persuasive arguments from both sides, and individual characteristics of the participants.\n\nWithout specific empirical evidence for this exact scenario, it's difficult to definitively predict which option would occur. In real-world studies, outcomes could vary widely based on the specifics of the interaction and the individuals involved. Therefore, while option C might be a reasonable assumption given the setup, the actual outcome could potentially align with any of the options depending on how the discussion unfolds."
