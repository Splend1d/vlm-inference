None of the provided options exactly match this result. However, option C, which reads 17.0 mT, is closest to our calculated value. It's possible there was some rounding or approximation in the options provided or in the calculation. \n\nPlease note that the exact value of \\( B_1 \\) can vary depending on the specific values used for \\( f \\), \\( P \\), and \\( A \\), so it's crucial to use accurate values for your specific experimental setup."
