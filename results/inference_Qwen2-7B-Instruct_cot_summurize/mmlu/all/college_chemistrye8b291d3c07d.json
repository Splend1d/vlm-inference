Both 35Cl and 37Cl have I = 0.\n\nIn the context of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or proton NMR specifically, the term \"singlet\" refers to a situation where there is only one observable peak in the NMR spectrum for a given nucleus. This typically occurs when the nucleus being being observed (in this case, the 1H nucleus) is shielded equally by all its neighboring nuclei, leading to no splitting of the signal.\n\nIn 12CHCl3, the three chlorine atoms (each with atomic numbers 35 and 37) are the neighboring nuclei that can affect the 1H nucleus. Both 35Cl and 37Cl have nuclear spin quantum number (I = 0, meaning they do not have any magnetic moment to induce a chemical shift on the 1H nuclei. Therefore, the 1H nuclei are not affected by the neighboring chlorine nuclei, resulting in a singlet signal in the 1H NMR spectrum."
