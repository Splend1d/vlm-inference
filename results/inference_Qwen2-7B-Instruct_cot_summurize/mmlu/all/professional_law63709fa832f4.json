Her mother, who had always dreamed of having a child who was a lawyer, told the graduate, \"It would mean a lot to me if you at least gave the bar exam a try. Tell you what; if you will devote the next two months to studying for the bar exam and then take the exam, I'll give you $2,000. And if you pass I'll give you an additional$2,000. \" The graduate replied, \"You've got a deal! I'm going to get started studying today!\" The graduate's uncle was present when this conversation took place. After the mother had left the room, the uncle said to the graduate, \"I want you to know that if anything ever happens to your mother, I'll pay you as per your mother's promise. \"The graduate spent the next two months studying diligently for the bar exam. When the graduate returned home after taking the exam, she received the tragic news that her mother had died suddenly. At the mother's funeral, the uncle approached the graduate and told her that he did not believe that he was obligated to pay anything to the graduate. The graduate passed the bar exam and wishes to collect from the uncle. The uncle's promise to the graduate would constitute\n\nA. an enforceable promise, binding the uncle as a surety.\nB. an unenforceable promise, because the graduate's mother had a pre-existing duty to pay the graduate.\nC. a voidable promise as violative of the statute of frauds.\nD. a void promise at the time of inception.\n"

                    "text": "The uncle's promise to the graduate would most likely be considered an enforceable promise, binding the uncle as a surety (A. In this situation, the uncle made a clear and voluntary statement to the graduate that he would pay the promised amounts if the graduate passed the bar exam, independent of the mother's promise. This is akin to a contract between the uncle and the graduate, where the uncle agrees to fulfill the mother's promise upon the graduate passing the bar exam.\n\nThe key factors to consider here are the clarity of the uncle's intent to enter into a separate agreement with the graduate, his direct communication to the graduate about the promise, and the the lack of any indication that this promise was made in jest or without serious intention. Assuming there were no other elements such as consideration, legality, or capacity issues that would make the promise void, it would likely stand as an enforceable contract under the principle of promissory estoppel or a quasi-suretyship arrangement.\n\nThe other options do not apply:\n\nB. The uncle's promise is not unenforceable just because the mother had a duty to pay; the uncle's promise is distinct and separate.\n\nC. There is no violation of the statute of frauds since the uncle's promise can potentially be enforced based on the clear terms and the transaction does not necessarily involve the sale of goods or services exceeding $500 ( (the threshold in many jurisdictions).\n\nD. The promise is not void at inception because there was clear mutual understanding and agreement between the parties regarding the terms of the promise."
