                    "text": "The correct answer is C. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white.\n\nTo understand why, let's break down the genetics involved in this cross:\n\n- The tall (tall phenotype is determined by the dominant D allele over the recessive d allele. Therefore, any plant that inherits at least one D allele will be tall.\n- The violet flower color is determined by the dominant W allele over the recessive w allele. So, any plant that inherits at least one W allele will have violet flowers.\n- The dwarf phenotype is determined by the recessive d allele, and the white flower color is determined by the recessive w allele. Both traits are expressed only when an individual has two recessive alleles for each trait ( d and w.\n\nFor the cross between a tall violet plant (DDWw and a dwarf white plant ddww:\n\n- The tall violet parent can produce four types of gametes:\n  - D (W: 50%\n  - D w: 25%\n  - d W: 25%\n  - d w: 0% ( (This is not possible because the parent is homozygous recessive for dwarfism and cannot contribute the d allele.)\n\n- The dwarf white parent can only produce two types of gametes:\n  - d: 50%\n  - w: 50%\n\nWhen these gametes are combined, we get the following combinations for the offspring:\n\n1. Tall Violet (DDWw: 50% of D gametes from the tall parent times 50% of W gametes from the tall parent = 25% chance of producing a DDWw offspring.\n2. Tall White Dw/w: 25% of D gametes from the tall parent times 50% of w gametes from the dwarf parent = 12.5% chance of producing a Dw/w offspring. This happens twice since the dwarf parent can contribute either w or Dw, making it 25% + 25% = 50%.\n3. Dwarf Violet dw/w: 25% of d gametes from the dwarf parent times 50% of W gametes from the tall parent = 12.5% chance of producing a dw/W offspring. This also happens twice, making it 25% + 25% = 50%.\n4. Dwarf White ddww: 50% of d gametes from the dwarf parent times 50% of w gametes from the dwarf parent = 25% chance of producing a ddww offspring.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio of the progeny would be 1 tall violet : 1 tall white : 1 dwarf violet : 1 dwarf white."
