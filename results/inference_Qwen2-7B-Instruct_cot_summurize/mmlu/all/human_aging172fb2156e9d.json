Are more concerned with those closest to them\n\nSocioemotional selectivity theory suggests that as people age, they tend to prioritize forming and maintaining close, meaningful relationships over acquiring a larger number of superficial ones. This shift is partly driven by a desire to derive greater emotional benefits from their interactions, such as comfort, companionship, and support. As a result, older adults often have smaller social networks that consist of individuals who are emotionally significant to them."
