Investor optimism improves.\n\nExplanation:\nInvestment demand typically increases when investors feel more confident about the future performance of their investments. This increased optimism can lead to greater willingness to invest in capital equipment, real estate, or other assets, expecting higher returns. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nA. Real GDP decreases: While a decrease in real GDP might suggest economic downturns, it could also spur investment if the decrease is seen as temporary or if the investment is aimed at improving efficiency or capturing market share during the downturn.\n\nB. The cost of acquiring and maintaining capital equipment rises: This generally has the opposite effect on investment demand. Higher costs mean that potential returns must be even greater to justify the investment, which could deter some investors.\n\nD. The real rate of interest rises: Typically, an increase in the real rate of interest would discourage investment, as borrowing costs become more expensive, making new investments less attractive compared to the returns they promise."
