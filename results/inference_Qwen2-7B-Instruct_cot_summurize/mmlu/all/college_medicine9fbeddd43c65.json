They have stable conjugate bases\n\nStrong acids completely dissociate in aqueous solution to produce hydrogen ions (H+ and their conjugate base. The fact that the conjugate base remains stable indicates that the acid has fully donated its proton to form the H+ ion and the conjugate base in water. \n\nA. Ka is less than 1 - This statement is incorrect. The acid dissociation constant (Ka must be greater than 1 for an acid to be considered strong.\n\nB. They have an open electron spot on their outer valence rings - This is not necessarily true. The strength of an acid does not directly correlate with the presence or absence of an \"open\" electron spot on the molecule.\n\nD. They remain bound in the presence of water. - This statement is also incorrect. Strong acids dissociate readily in water, not remaining bound."
