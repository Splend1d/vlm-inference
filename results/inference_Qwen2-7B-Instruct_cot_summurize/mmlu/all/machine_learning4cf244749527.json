This means that there exists a set of 4 points that can be shattered by this set (i.e., for any possible labeling of these points as positive or negative, there is a rectangle that separates them accordingly. Since 5 points exceed this capacity, it follows that this set of rectangles cannot shatter a set of 5 points.\n\nStatement 2 is False. The VC-dimension of the k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classifier with k = 1 is not infinite; it is actually 1. The reason is that with k = 1, the classifier will always predict the label of the single nearest neighbour for any point. This classifier can only distinguish between two different labels based on whether they have at least one instance within their respective classes closer than any other class's instances. Thus, it can't shatter more than 2 points, and since it can distinguish between two points, its VC-dimension is 1. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False."
