In this case, enzyme K facilitates the conversion of reactants A and B into product C. \n\nWhen you add more enzyme K, you increase the number of enzyme molecules available to facilitate the conversion of A and B into C. This results in a higher rate of production of product C.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not necessarily lead to an increased production of product C:\n\nA. Removing some of reactant A reduces the amount of A available for conversion into C, decreasing the production of C.\nB. Removing some of reactant C does not directly affect the forward reaction (A + B \u2192 C, but might indirectly impact it if C is a feedback inhibitor of the reaction or if it affects the stability of the system.\nD. Increasing the temperature typically increases the reaction rate, but it doesn't specifically target the production of more product C; rather, it accelerates the overall reaction rate, including both forward and reverse reactions if present. If the reaction is at equilibrium, increasing the temperature could shift the equilibrium position depending on the specific values of \u0394H ( and \u0394S of the reaction, potentially reducing the amount of product C formed if the reaction is exothermic."
