His symptoms began during the first hour of full-contact football practice in full uniform. He reported feeling weak and faint but did not lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. On arrival, he is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. His temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (103.1\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Obtain a CT scan of the head\nB. Administer sodium chloride tablets\nC. Administer intravenous fluids\nD. Immerse the patient in an ice water bath\n"

Immersing the patient in an ice water bath\n\nThis situation sounds like a case of exertional heat stroke, which can occur during strenuous physical activity in hot weather. The symptoms described, including fever, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status, are consistent with heat stroke. Immediate cooling is crucial in managing this condition to prevent organ damage and death. Immersing the patient in an ice water bath is the quickest and most effective method to lower body temperature in such cases.\n\nAfter the initial cooling measures, it is essential to continue monitoring vital signs and neurological status. The patient should be transferred to a hospital for further evaluation and treatment, which may include intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement if needed. A CT scan of the head could be considered later to rule out any potential secondary injuries or complications from the heat stroke, but it is not the immediate priority. Administration of sodium chloride tablets would not address the core issue of overheating, and administering intravenous fluids without proper assessment might lead to complications if administered too aggressively or without sufficient monitoring."
