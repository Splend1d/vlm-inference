Confidential information may be revealed to others only with the consent of the client: This is generally true, as maintaining confidentiality is a core ethical principle in these professions. Information shared with the therapist should not be disclosed without the client's explicit permission, unless there are are legal requirements or exceptions (which we will discuss under D.\n\nB. In public lectures, it is unethical to relate vignettes about clients: This is also true. Vignettes, or stories, about clients should never be shared publicly without their explicit consent. Even anonymized cases can potentially lead to identification of the client, especially if they are well-known in the community or the setting where therapy took place.\n\nC. Case material may be discussed with colleagues concerned with the case only when a formal release of information has been obtained from the client: This statement is correct too. Sharing case material with colleagues for supervision or consultation purposes typically requires obtaining consent from the client. Exceptions might exist in certain circumstances ( again, which brings us to point D.\n\nD. There are exceptions to the obligation to maintain confidentiality: This is true as well. While confidentiality is a fundamental principle, professionals are often required by law or ethics codes to break confidentiality under specific circumstances, such as when there is an imminent risk of harm to the client or others, or when required by legal process ( like court orders or subpoenas. \n\nIn summary, while confidentiality is a key principle, there are indeed situations where it must be broken, and these exceptions are typically governed by professional ethical guidelines and laws."
