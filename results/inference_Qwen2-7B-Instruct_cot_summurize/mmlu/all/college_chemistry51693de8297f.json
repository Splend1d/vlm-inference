It states that the vapor pressure of a component in a mixture is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the mixture. This means:\n\nI. The partial pressure of each component at equilibrium is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid mixture. - **True**, as per Raoult's law.\n\nII. The volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of the volumes of each component before mixing. - **False**. Mixing liquids typically does not simply add their volumes due to volume changes from the interaction between different molecules, which can lead to a decrease in total volume ( a phenomenon known as negative volume change or reduction in volume upon mixing.\n\nIII. Intermolecular interactions in the mixture are identical to intermolecular interactions in the pure components. - **False**. When two different liquids mix, their intermolecular interactions can differ from those within the pure components, especially if they have different polarities or hydrogen bonding capabilities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. I only**."
