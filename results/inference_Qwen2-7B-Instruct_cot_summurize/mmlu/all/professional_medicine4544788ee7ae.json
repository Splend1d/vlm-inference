This is a significant concern for individuals with egg allergies, including infants and young children. Therefore, if a child has experienced an allergic reaction such as urticaria ( (hives), swelling of the lips, and difficulty breathing after consuming an egg, they might be at higher risk for an allergic reaction to vaccines that contain egg proteins, such as those used for pertussis vaccination. It's important to consult with healthcare professionals to ensure safe vaccination practices in such cases."
