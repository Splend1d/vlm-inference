When the customer complained to the restaurant's owner, the owner admitted that the chowder was not, in fact, homemade, but that it had been poured from a can of chowder purchased from a wholesale distributor of food products.

Strict liability applies when a product is found to be defective due to manufacturing or design flaws, and the consumer does not need to prove negligence on the part of the manufacturer or seller. The presence of a pebble in the chowder suggests that there was a manufacturing defect (likely during the preparation of the dish at the restaurant), as a reasonable inspection should have caught any foreign object.\n\nThe fact that the chowder was not homemade but instead came from a can does not directly affect the strict liability claim for the presence of the pebble. However, it could potentially impact other aspects of the case, such as whether the restaurant misrepresented the quality of the food to the customer, which might lead to additional claims like fraud or misrepresentation.\n\nThe other options either do not align with the principles of strict liability or do not address the presence of the pebble in the chowder adequately:\n\nB. The customer recovering would not necessarily depend on prior notice of the defective condition; rather, the presence of the defect itself is sufficient under strict liability.\n\nC. The customer may still recover if a reasonable inspection should have revealed the pebble, even if it was not immediately apparent.\n\nD. The product being served to the customer would indeed be considered unreasonably dangerous due to the presence of the pebble, making recovery more likely under strict liability standards."
