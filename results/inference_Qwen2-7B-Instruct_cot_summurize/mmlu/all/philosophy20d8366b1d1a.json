This is a central tenet in his work \"Confessions\" and his theological teachings. He posits that understanding the nature of God, His will, and our relationship with Him is essential for human flourishing and happiness.\n\nGiven this context, the answer to your question is not explicitly listed among the options provided. Augustine does delve into the understanding of good and evil (as part of his theological discussions, but the primary focus for achieving happiness in his philosophy revolves around knowledge of God rather than the causes of natural occurrences per se. Therefore, if we interpret the options to align more closely with Augustine's teachings, the closest match might be:\n\nC. both a and b.\n\nHowever, this option incorrectly includes 'the causes of natural occurrences,' which Augustine does not emphasize as crucial for happiness. Instead, he would likely argue for a deeper understanding of God (which could encompass the understanding of good and evil in the context of divine will and purpose. \n\nFor the sake of providing an answer that best fits the available choices, I would suggest interpreting Augustine's views as most closely aligned with a focus on understanding the causes of good and evil in relation to divine will (option B. Yet, it's important to note that Augustine's actual teachings do not neatly fit within these modernized options, and his emphasis is more on the relationship with God than on philosophical causality."
