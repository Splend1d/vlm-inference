Sawtooth wave.\n\nThe exact waveform generated by an RVCO depends on the charging and discharging characteristics of the circuit components, such as capacitors. For instance, if the charging and discharging rates are linear, it results in a sawtooth wave. If they follow a different pattern, it can produce a triangular wave.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be D. Both B and C."
