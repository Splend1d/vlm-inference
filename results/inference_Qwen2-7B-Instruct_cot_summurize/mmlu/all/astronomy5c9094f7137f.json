The Moon's umbra must touch the area where you are located.\n\nDuring a total solar eclipse, the Moon completely blocks the Sun's disk as viewed from Earth, revealing the Sun's outer atmosphere, the corona. This occurs when the alignment of the Earth, Moon, and Sun is such that the Moon is directly between them, and the Moon is close enough to Earth to cover the Sun entirely. The umbra is the central, darkest part of the shadow cast by the Moon on the Earth, and it is during this time that a total solar eclipse can be observed from within the umbra's path on Earth."
