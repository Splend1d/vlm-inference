Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the \"stick\" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.\nB. Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.\nC. In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.\nD. Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.\n"

                    "text": "Defining the success of coercive diplomacy is problematic due to several factors, each of which addresses a different aspect of the complex process involved:\n\nA. **Isolation of the Effect**: This issue pertains to the difficulty in isolating the specific impact of the threat or use of force in a given case. The success of coercive diplomacy can often be attributed to multiple factors, including economic conditions, domestic politics, international alliances, and more. It's challenging to determine how much of the outcome is due to the threat of force versus other influencing factors.\n\nB. **Independence of Success from Coercion Level**: The notion that success is not necessarily tied to the level of coercion required suggests that diplomatic efforts can achieve desired outcomes regardless of the intensity of the pressure applied. However, this overlooks the potential for diminishing returns where higher levels of coercion might lead to greater compliance but also increased risk of escalation or backlash. The optimal level of coercion is often unclear and context-specific.\n\nC. **Evaluation of Protracted Affairs**: In scenarios where diplomatic efforts involve a series of negotiations and temporary successes, the challenge lies in assessing the overall effectiveness. Tactical wins do not automatically translate into long-term compliance. The dynamic nature of these situations requires careful consideration of whether short-term gains lead to sustainable peace or merely postpone conflict.\n\nD. **Classification of Success Based on Means**: The differentiation between \"cheap\" and \"costly\" successes based on the means used (threats vs. inducements vs. limited force - implies that some forms of coercion are inherently more or less desirable. This classification can oversimplify the strategic considerations involved. The appropriateness of the response depends on the context, including the severity of the offense, the relationship dynamics, and the potential consequences of different responses. Success must also consider the durability of compliance and the broader strategic implications, rather than just the immediate tactical outcome.\n\nEach of these points highlights the complexity and nuance involved in evaluating the success of coercive diplomacy, underscoring the need for a multifaceted and context-sensitive approach to assessing outcomes."
