This also doesn't make sense in this context as it implies you start with 3 baskets and need to reach a total of 24 apples, rather than the other way around.\n\nC. 24 \u00f7 b = 3: This equation suggests that dividing the total number of apples (24 by the number of baskets (b gives you 3 apples per basket, which is true, but it doesn't give you the total number of baskets you can make, just the number of apples per basket."
