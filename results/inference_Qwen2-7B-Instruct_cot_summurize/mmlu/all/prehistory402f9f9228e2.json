The scientific consensus is that humans share a more recent common ancestor with chimpanzees than they do with gorillas. This common ancestor lived millions of years ago. Over time, as populations of this species split into different groups, they evolved into the various primate species we see today, including humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans."
