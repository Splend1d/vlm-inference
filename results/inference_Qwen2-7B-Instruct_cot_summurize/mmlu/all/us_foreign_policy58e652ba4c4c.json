This concept implies that the empire does not force its will upon another country but rather enters into a partnership or alliance, often in exchange for protection, trade benefits, or other forms of support.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. Voluntary reliance on an external power for security\n\nThis option captures the essence of entering into a relationship where both parties agree to the terms, as opposed to one party imposing its rule on the other through conquest or coercion."
