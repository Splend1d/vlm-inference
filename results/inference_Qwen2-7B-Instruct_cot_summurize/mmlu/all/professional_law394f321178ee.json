Since he did not fulfill the university residency requirement, the student was required to pay $1,800 tuition each semester, which was $400 more than the tuition of state resident-students. In an action by the student challenging the constitutionality of the provision governing the determination of residency for the purpose of fixing a fee differential for out-of-state students in public college, the court will most likely declare the provision\n\nA. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\nC. constitutional, because the fee differential promotes a compelling state interest.\nD. constitutional, because the provision does not trigger strict scrutiny.\n"

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. If the university's residency requirement and resulting tuition differential discriminates against non-residents without a rational basis or serves a compelling state interest, it may violate this clause. The court would need to review the law to determine if it serves a legitimate state interest and if the means chosen are are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. If not, the court might find the provision unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause."
