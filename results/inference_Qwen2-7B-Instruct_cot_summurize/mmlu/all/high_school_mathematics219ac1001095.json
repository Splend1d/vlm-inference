So, for the prime factor 2, the highest power is \\(2^4\\) (from 16; for the prime factor 3, it's \\(3^1\\) from both 15 and 12; and for the prime factor 5, it's \\(5^1\\) from 15.\n\nThus, the LCM is \\(2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 16 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 240\\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that has factors of 16, 15, and 12 is \\(240\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 240**."
