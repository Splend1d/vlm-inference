It may be proved to impeach him as a witness.\n\nThe fact that the witness has a mental illness that affects his perception of reality can potentially be used to challenge the reliability of his testimony. This is part of the process of \"impeaching\" a witness, which means questioning their credibility. The jury would consider this information in determining how much weight to give the witness's account. However, the mere fact of the mental illness does not automatically disqualify the witness from testifying ( nor does it necessarily have no bearing on his competence or credibility. The impact depends on the specifics of the case and the nature of the witness's condition."
