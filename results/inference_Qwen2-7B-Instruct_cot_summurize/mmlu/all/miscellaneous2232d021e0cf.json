An increase in United States exports\n\nWhen the real interest rate in the United States increases compared to its trading partners, it makes US assets more attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns. This increased demand for US dollars leads to an appreciation of the US dollar against other currencies. An appreciatinging dollar makes US exports cheaper and more competitive in international markets, thus increasing the volume of exports. Conversely, US imports become more expensive, potentially reducing import volumes. Therefore, an increase in the real interest rate typically results in an increase in US exports."
