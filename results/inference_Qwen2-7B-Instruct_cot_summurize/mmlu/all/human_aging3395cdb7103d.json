Exposure to bright light signals to your brain that it should be awake and active, making it harder for you to fall asleep when you want to at night. This is why using electronic devices before bed or being in bright light close to bedtime can make it more difficult to get quality sleep. \n\nA. While bright light exposure can help restore your circadian rhythm if you're experiencing jet lag or other disruptions, it's not typically used for this purpose during the later parts of the day.\nC. Bright light exposure does not directly restore deep sleep; rather, it affects your overall sleep cycle by potentially delaying or disrupting the onset of sleep.\nD. It is generally known that exposure to bright light can have an influence on sleep, though it may not always lead to insomnia in everyone. The effect depends on various factors such as the intensity and duration of exposure, individual sensitivity, and time of day."
