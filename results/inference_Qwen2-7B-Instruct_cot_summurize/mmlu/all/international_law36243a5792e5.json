Yes, Article 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms. Jus cogens norms, or peremptory norms, are international law principles that are universally binding and cannot be set aside by treaty or custom. These norms include prohibitions on genocide, slavery, and aggression, among others. If a state's obligations under a treaty conflict with these jus cogens norms, Article 103 does not apply, and the state must comply with the jus cogens norm instead.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C."
