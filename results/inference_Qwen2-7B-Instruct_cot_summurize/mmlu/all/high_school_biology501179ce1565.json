These are fundamental features that define them as prokaryotes ( and eukaryotes respectively.\n\nBacteria are prokaryotes, lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They can be unicellular or multicellular, but in the context of this question, it's the structure and components they share with fungi that is important.\n\nFungi, on the other hand, are eukaryotes, have a nucleus and various membrane-bound organelles. However, they do not typically exhibit unicellularity; most fungi are multicellular.\n\nC. Plasma membrane, multicellularity, and Golgi apparatus\n\nThe plasma membrane is common to both bacteria and fungi. However, fungi have a more complex cellular organization and often exhibit multicellularity. The presence of a Golgi apparatus is specific to eukaryotic cells, which includes fungi but not bacteria.\n\nD. Cell wall, unicellularity, and mitochondria\n\nWhile bacteria and fungi both have cell walls, they do not typically exhibit the same type of cell wall material (peptidoglycan for bacteria and chitin for fungi. Neither are they necessarily unicellular; fungi are multicellular by nature. Mitochondria are found in eukaryotic cells, including fungi, but not in bacteria.\n\nTherefore, only option A accurately describes characteristics shared by both bacteria and fungi."
