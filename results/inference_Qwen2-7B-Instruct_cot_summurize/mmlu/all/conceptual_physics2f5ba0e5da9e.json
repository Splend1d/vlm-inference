This force is determined by the nature of their charges:\n\n- If both particles have the same type of charge ( either both positive or both negative), they will experience a repulsive force. This repulsive force acts as an acceleration force on each particle, causing them to accelerate away from each other.\n  \n- If the particles have opposite charges, they will experience an attractive force. However, this question focuses on the scenario where both particles increase in acceleration immediately after being released, which implies a repulsive force. Therefore, both particles must have the same type of charge ( either both positive or both negative) for this to occur.\n\nThus, the correct answer is that the charges must be the same."
