Perceived illegitimacy: Low voter turnout can lead to the perception that the government is illegitimate, as it might not accurately reflect the will of the majority.\n- B. Lack of true democracy: When many citizens do not participate in voting, it can be argued that the decisions made by elected officials may not fully represent the will of the people, thus undermining democratic principles.\n- C. Lack of minority representation: Low voter turnout among minority groups can result in their interests and perspectives being underrepresented in government policies and decision-making processes.\n- D. Imposition of a fine on non-voters: This is not a consequence of low voter turnout in the United States. Voting is generally considered a civic duty, but there is no legal imposition of fines for not voting."
