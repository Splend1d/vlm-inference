When the leg continued to bother the patient six months later, she consulted a second orthopedist in the same town. The second orthopedist surgically inserted a pin to facilitate healing. The patient brought a malpractice action against the first orthopedist, claiming that he should have surgically inserted a pin at the time of initial treatment. The only evidence that the patient offered in support of her malpractice claim was the testimony of the second orthopedist, as follows: In response to the question \"Would you have inserted a pin initially?\" the second orthopedist testified, \"I personally would not have been satisfied that the leg would heal properly without a pin.\" At the close of the patient's evidence, the first orthopedist moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the motion be granted?\n\nA. No, because the patient has introduced evidence that the first orthopedist failed to give the care that the second orthopedist would have provided.\nB. No, because the second orthopedist practices in the same town and field of specialty as the first orthopedist.\nC. Yes, because the patient has failed to introduce evidence that the first orthopedist's care fell below the professional standard of care.\nD. Yes, because the second orthopedist also treated the patient and is thus not sufficiently objective to offer expert testimony.\n"

Yes, because the patient has failed to introduce evidence that the first orthopedist's care fell below the professional standard of care.\n\nIn a medical malpractice case, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant's actions (or lack thereof) were outside the accepted standard of care for their profession. This is typically done through expert testimony from a qualified professional in the same or similar field who can opine on what a reasonable professional would have done under similar circumstances. The testimony of the second orthopedist, while potentially relevant to the standard of care, does not necessarily establish that the first orthopedist's care was substandard without more context or evidence comparing the two orthopedists' approaches and outcomes.\n\nThe motion for judgment as a matter of law (often referred to as a directed verdict or a summary judgment motion) should be granted if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In this scenario, since the patient's case relies solely on the testimony of another orthopedist without showing how that testimony relates specifically to a deviation from the standard of care established by the first orthopedist, the motion for judgment as a matter of law could likely be granted."
