Increasing interest rates from expansionary monetary policy.\n\nCrowding out occurs when government spending increases, financed by borrowing, leads to higher interest rates. This makes it more expensive for private businesses and consumers to borrow money, potentially reducing private investment and consumption. Expansionary monetary policy, which involves the central bank lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy, can have the opposite effect, potentially reducing crowding out."
