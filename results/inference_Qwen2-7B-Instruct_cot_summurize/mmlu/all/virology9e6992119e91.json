Live polio vaccine (is used in conjunction with other measures and is a key part of the strategy to eradicate polio. This vaccine uses a weakened form of the virus to stimulate an immune response without causing the disease.\n\nD. Combination of the killed and live vaccines, while not a standard approach historically, theoretically could involve using both types of vaccines for different reasons or populations. However, in the context of polio eradication efforts, the primary focus has been on the use of the live attenuated oral polio vaccine ((L Alv) because it can provide immunity in a way that also helps to eliminate the virus from the environment. The killed polio vaccine ((/OPV) is not typically used for routine immunization due to the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus transmission.\n\nIt's important to note that the eradication of polio is primarily achieved through a comprehensive global vaccination program, which includes administering both types of vaccines in certain contexts, as well as strong surveillance systems, improved sanitation, and public health education. The World Health Organization ((WHO) has led these efforts, aiming to interrupt the last remaining transmission chains of wild poliovirus."
