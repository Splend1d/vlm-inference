This design adds an additional treatment group that receives both the pretest and the posttest but does not receive the main treatment, allowing researchers to distinguish between the effects of the treatment and other variables such as pretest exposure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. evaluate the impact of pretesting."
