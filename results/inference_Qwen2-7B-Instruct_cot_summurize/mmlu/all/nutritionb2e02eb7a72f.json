Infants and children need the most protein dense food\n\nInfants and children, especially during growth spurts, require more protein relative to their energy intake compared to other age groups. This is because their bodies are rapidly developing and need the building blocks (such as proteins - for growth and repair. However, it's important to note that all stages of life have specific dietary needs, and it's crucial to ensure a balanced diet that meets the individual's requirements, not just focusing on protein density."
