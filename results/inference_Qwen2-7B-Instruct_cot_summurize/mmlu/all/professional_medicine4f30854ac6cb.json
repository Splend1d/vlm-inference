The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia.\n\nGiven that the patient's father had classic hemophilia, which is a sex-linked recessive disorder, and assuming the patient is not a carrier ( since she does not exhibit symptoms of hemophilia herself, the fetus would inherit the X chromosome from her. Since males have only one X chromosome, if they receive the faulty X chromosome from their mother, they will express the disease (in this case, hemophilia. Therefore, there is a 50% chance that the male fetus will inherit the faulty X chromosome and thus have hemophilia. If the fetus is female, she would receive an X chromosome from both parents, but since females have two X chromosomes, one normal and one with the mutation, they typically do not express the disease, although they can be carriers. However, in this scenario, since the fetus is XY, we're focusing on the male offspring."
