The owner of a publication company was prosecuted and convicted of violating the state obscenity law by mailing adults sexual literature that appealed to their prurient interests. During the owner's trial, the judge instructed the jury that determining if the mailed materials were obscene depended in part on whether they were offensive to the average or normal person under contemporary community standards, and that the community standards test must be considered in light of the fact that many children reside in the community. Furthermore, the judge instructed the jury that in determining whether the materials were obscene, it could also consider evidence of pandering, or whether the materials were marketed purposely to appeal to the recipients' prurient interest in sex. The owner appealed her conviction, alleging a denial of her First Amendment rights. Which of the following is the strongest argument why the appellate court should reverse the owner's conviction?\n\nA. The method by which materials are marketed or advertised is not probative of whether they are obscene.\nB. It is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy for the government to interfere with the content of closed mailings intended for the private use by consenting adults.\nC. Under the First Amendment, the community's standards for children may not be applied in determining what constitutes obscenity for adults.\nD. Obscenity is to be determined by applying national standards, not contemporary community standards.\n"

                    "text": "C. Under the First Amendment, the community's standards for children may not be applied in determining what constitutes obscenity for adults.\n\nThis is the strongest argument because the First Amendment protects the freedom of speech and press, and it provides that \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" When it comes to obscenity, the Supreme Court has held that the government can restrict the distribution of obscene material, but this restriction must be narrowly tailored and must serve a compelling governmental interest. In order to determine if material is obscene, courts have traditionally used the three-pronged Miller test: the material must (1) depict or describe, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by Congress as\u8bf2\u8272\u60c5 material, 2) taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex, and 3) lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\n\nThe argument here focuses on the second prong of the Miller test, which requires that the material must appeal to the prurient interest in sex. The court should consider whether the community standards for children should be applied when determining if the material appeals to the prurient interest of adults. This is because the First Amendment protects the rights of adults to receive information and ideas, even if those ideas might be considered offensive or immoral by some. Therefore, using community standards for children to determine if material appeals to the prurient interest of adults would violate the First Amendment's protection of adult speech rights."
