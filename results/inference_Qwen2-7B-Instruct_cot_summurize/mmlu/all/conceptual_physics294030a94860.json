Both of these\n\nMutual induction is the phenomenon where a changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a conductor, and conversely, a changing electric field can induce a magnetic field. This principle underlies many technologies, including transformers and generators.\n\nWhen a changing magnetic field induces an electric current, it can manifest as light if the current flows through a material capable of emitting light when excited by an electric current, such as a fluorescent bulb or a laser. So, light can be produced as a result of mutual induction.\n\nAdditionally, any process involving the conversion of one form of energy to another ( like the electrical energy used to create the changing magnetic field, or the kinetic energy of moving charges, is considered energy production. Therefore, mutual induction also involves the generation of energy.\n\nSo, both light and energy can indeed be produced via the mutual induction of electric and magnetic fields."
