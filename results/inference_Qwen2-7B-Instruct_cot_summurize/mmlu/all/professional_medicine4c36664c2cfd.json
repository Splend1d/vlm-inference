Over the past 9 days, she has had nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. She does not smoke. Her husband and children have had no recent illness. Her temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F). Examination shows congested nasal mucosa and purulent discharge on the left. There is tenderness to palpation over the left cheek and no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus. The tympanic membranes are normal, and there is no erythema of the throat. Examination shows no cervical adenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?\n\nA. Haemophilus influenzae type b\nB. Moraxella catarrhalis\nC. Staphylococcus aureus\nD. Streptococcus pneumoniae\n"

The presence of purulent nasal discharge and tenderness over the left cheek, along with no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus, points towards an infection in the maxillary sinus.\n\nGiven these symptoms and examination findings, the most probable answer from the options provided would be:\n\nC. Staphylococcus aureus\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is a common cause of acute rhinosinusitis, especially when there are signs of inflammation or infection in the sinuses. It's important to note that without further testing such as a nasal swab or imaging studies, definitive identification of the causative organism cannot be made. A physician would likely order additional tests to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy."
