The friend was angry with the young man and decided to use the opportunity to get even with him by having him arrested. The friend said he would help, and that night, he drove the young man to the neighbor\u00d5s house. The young man broke in while the friend remained out-side. The friend called the police on his cell phone and then drove away. Police officers arrived at the scene just as the young man was carrying the TV out the back door. The jurisdiction defines crimes as at common law. Of what crime, if any, can the friend properly be convicted?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Conspiracy.\nC. Burglary.\nD. Conspiracy and larceny.\n"

Conspiracy.\n\nThe friend can properly be convicted of conspiracy because he agreed with the young man to commit theft (theft being grand larceny in this case, and facilitated the commission of the crime by driving the young man to the neighbor's house. However, since the friend did not actually enter the house or attempt to take the TV himself, he may not be guilty of burglary or larceny. He could potentially be charged with aiding and abetting the crime of larceny, but the most direct charge given the circumstances would likely be conspiracy."
