When drugs are withdrawn from a sealed vial, fragments of the rubber bung can be cut out by the needle.\n\nThis process is commonly referred to as \"coring.\" It occurs when you use a syringe to draw up medication from a vial that has a rubber stopper or septum. The needle pierces the rubber and creates a small piece (or core) that gets pulled into the syringe along with the medication. This can potentially contaminate the medication or lead to inconsistent dosing if not properly addressed. To prevent coring, some methods include using a coring needle, which is designed to minimize this issue, or using a syringe with a larger gauge needle."
