Heartaid is more expensive than the currently used medication. The analysis will include a significance test with H0: Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective at preventing heart disease and HA: Heartaid is more effective than the current medication at preventing heart disease. Which of these would be a potential consequence of a Type II error?\n\nA. Patients will spend more money on Heartaid, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.\nB. Doctors will begin to prescribe Heartaid to patients, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.\nC. Patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.\nD. Researchers will calculate the wrong P-value, making their advice to doctors invalid.\n"

In the context of the Heartaid study, this means that the researchers fail to reject H0 (when in fact HA (Heartaid is more effective than the current medication at preventing heart disease) is true.\n\nGiven this scenario, the correct answer for the potential consequence of a Type II error would be:\n\nC. Patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.\n\nThis is because a Type II error leads to failing to detect a true effect, in this case, the superiority of Heartaid over the current medication. As a result, the more effective medication might not be utilized by patients despite its benefits."
