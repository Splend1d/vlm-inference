                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Almost immediately, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons minus the work function of the metal.\n\nIn the photoelectric effect, when light (or electromagnetic radiation) shines on a metal surface, electrons can be ejected from the metal. The minimum energy required to eject an electron is determined by the work function of the metal, which is the energy needed to remove an electron from its surface. The excess energy over the work function becomes the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.\n\nThe intensity of light refers to the amount of light per unit area and does not directly affect whether or not the photoelectric effect occurs. What matters is the frequency (or wavelength, since they are inversely proportional) of the light and whether its energy is above the work function of the metal. Once this condition is met, increasing the intensity (i.e., increasing the number of photons hitting the metal per second) will increase the number of photoelectrons emitted, but it won't change their kinetic energy. Each photon that meets the criteria will impart the same amount of energy (equal to \\(h\\nu\\) where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant and \\(\\nu\\) is the frequency of the light), and thus the same kinetic energy, to the ejected electron, provided there is enough excess energy above the work function."
