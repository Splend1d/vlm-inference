Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character is intentionally filling a pinata with razors, which is clearly morally wrong and dangerous, especially considering it's for a birthday party where children are expected to participate. This action puts others at risk and involves deceit and harm, both of which are violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is using a syringe to treat cancer with radioactive polonium. While the use of radioactive materials carries significant risks and requires proper safety protocols, the intent here is therapeutic rather than harmful. Treating cancer is generally considered an ethical medical practice, even if the method has inherent dangers. Therefore, this action, while risky, is not morally wrong under the ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
