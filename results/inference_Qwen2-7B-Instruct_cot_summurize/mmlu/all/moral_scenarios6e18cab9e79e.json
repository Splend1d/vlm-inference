This is generally viewed negatively by societal norms in the US as of 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, ironing your son's clothes for his school dance is typically seen as a helpful and supportive action, not morally wrong. It falls under the category of caring for one's family and ensuring they look presentable for important events."
