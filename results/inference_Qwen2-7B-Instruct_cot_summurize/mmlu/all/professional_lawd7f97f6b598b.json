This is not a statement of fact and cannot be proven or disproven with evidence of the judge's actions. Convictions or other factual allegations about the judge's past behavior, such as bribery, embezzlement, or a felony assault, would be relevant to the case if they were part of the statement or if they directly relate to the issue at hand. However, simply stating an opinion about the judge's ability to be bought does not provide a basis for introducing evidence of convictions or other past behaviors unrelated to the statement itself."
