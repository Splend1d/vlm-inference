Field resistance.\n\nThis is because the field resistance limits the current that can flow through the magnetic circuit when the system is trying to operate at very low speeds or under load conditions. As speed decreases, the effective reluctance of the magnetic path increases, making it harder for the system to generate sufficient torque. The field resistance helps regulate this process by limiting the field current and thus preventing excessive demagnetization or over-speeding of the generator."
