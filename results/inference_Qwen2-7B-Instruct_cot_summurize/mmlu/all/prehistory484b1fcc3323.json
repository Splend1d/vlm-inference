These ancient societies, which flourished in Mesoamerica from about 1200 BCE to 400 BCE, constructed impressive structures such as colossal heads, pyramids, and large ceremonial complexes that suggest a centralized authority and complex social organization. These features indicate that the Olmec likely had regal or hierarchical leadership and engaged in significant ritual activities, making option D the most accurate characterization."
