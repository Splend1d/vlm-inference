The electrons from FADH2 and NADH+H+ pass through the electron transport chain during cellular respiration, generating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation. Each molecule of NADH or FADH2 can generate, on average, 2.5 to 3 ATP molecules, depending on the position it starts at in the electron transport chain. Therefore, together, they can generate approximately 3 ATP."
