While insulin does play a crucial role in promoting glucose uptake into most tissues of the body, particularly muscle and fat cells, it's not universally true for all tissues. For example, the liver and kidney can also take up glucose without the need for insulin, especially when insulin levels are low or when insulin resistance is present. This is because these organs have other mechanisms for glucose uptake that do not solely rely on insulin."
