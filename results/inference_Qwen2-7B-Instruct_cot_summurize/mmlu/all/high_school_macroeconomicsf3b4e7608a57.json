It suggests that during economic downturns, the government should increase spending or reduce taxes to stimulate demand and boost economic activity. Conversely, during periods of economic overheating, the government should decrease spending or raise taxes to cool down the economy and prevent inflation.\n\nMonetary policy, managed by central banks like the Federal Reserve ( influences the money supply and interest rates, but Keynesian theory argues that fiscal policy is more effective for short-term economic stabilization because it can be implemented more quickly than adjusting monetary policy.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. The statement \"the FED should not conduct monetary policy\" contradicts Keynesian theory, which does acknowledge the importance of central bank actions in managing economic cycles.\n\nB. This option suggests that changes in the money supply have significant effects, which alignss with Monetarist theory rather than Keynesian theory.\n\nD. The idea that the FED should allow the money supply to grow at a constant rate is consistent with monetarist thought, not Keynesian economics. Keynesians believe that the money supply should be adjusted based on economic conditions to achieve stability, not necessarily at a fixed rate."
