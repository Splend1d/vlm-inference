Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, shooting a rat in a hotel lobby is likely considered morally wrong because it is unnecessary and potentially harmful to other people in the vicinity, as well as potentially damaging to property. In Scenario 2, wearing a short skirt and tank top to a funeral is not considered morally wrong; it may be inappropriate or disrespectful depending on cultural norms, but it is not inherently wrong from a moral standpoint."
