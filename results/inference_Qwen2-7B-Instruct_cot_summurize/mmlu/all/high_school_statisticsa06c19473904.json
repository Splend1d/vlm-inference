HA: \u03bc1\u2212 \u03bc2\u2260 0\n\nThis is because the null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no difference between the two groups ( i.e., the mean \"proper behavior\" rating for children receiving positive rewards (\u03bc1, and the mean \"proper behavior\" rating for children receiving punishment, \u03bc2, are equal ( (\u03bc1-\u03bc2=0). The alternative hypothesis (HA), then, should state that there is some difference, not specifying whether one group is higher or lower than the other. Hence, the most appropriate alternative hypothesis would be that the difference between the means is not zero, which is represented by HA: \u03bc1\u2212 \u03bc2\u2260 0.\n\nOptions A and B specify the direction of the difference, suggesting that one group has a higher mean than the other, which is not consistent with the given null hypothesis. Option D is incorrect because it suggests any of the above is acceptable, which isn't true given the context of the null hypothesis."
