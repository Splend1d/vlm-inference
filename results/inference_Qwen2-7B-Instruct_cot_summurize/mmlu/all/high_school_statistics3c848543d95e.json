For a one-tailed test with the alternative hypothesis \\(HA: p > 0.3\\), we look up this z-score in the standard normal distribution table to find the area to the right of this z-score, which corresponds to the P-value.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, the area to the left of \\(z = 1.064\\) is about 0.8554. Since this is a one-tailed test to the right, the P-value is the area to the right, which is \\(1 - 0.8554 = 0.1446\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.1446"
