Two months later, the woman was entertaining a friend at her home. As they talked, they noticed that the dishwasher was operating strangely, repeatedly stopping and starting. They saw sparks start flying out from underneath the dishwasher. The friend said, \"It must have a short circuit or something. Don't touch it or you might get electrocuted. \" The woman asked if she should go down to the fuse box in her basement to cut off the electricity. The friend decided that he would take a look inside the dishwasher first. When he touched the metal handle on the dishwasher's door, he received a violent electric shock. The dishwasher had an internal wiring defect that caused it to malfunction. The contractor who installed the dishwasher failed to adequately ground the machine; if he had done so, the electric current would have been led harmlessly away. The machine carried instructions for proper grounding, but the contractor did not follow them. All of the relevant events occurred in a jurisdiction that follows traditional contributory negligence and assumption of risk rules. If the friend brings a strict tort liability claim against the manufacturer of the dishwasher for his injuries, the probable result is that the friend will\n\nA. recover, because the dishwasher was defectively made.\nB. recover, because the manufacturer is vicariously liable for the improper installation.\nC. not recover, because the friend assumed the risk by trying to open the dishwasher.\nD. not recover, because the friend was not the purchaser of the dishwasher.\n"

                    "text": "In this scenario, the friend would likely not recover damages under traditional contributory negligence and assumption of risk rules, given the context provided. Here's why:\n\n**Contributory Negligence Rule**: This rule prevents a plaintiff from recovering any damages if they are found to be even slightly at fault for their own injury. However, many jurisdictions have moved away from pure contributory negligence and adopted modified versions such as comparative negligence, which allows recovery based on the percentage of fault attributed to each party.\n\n**Assumption of Risk**: This defense argues that the plaintiff knew of the danger and voluntarily chose to encounter it. It suggests that the injured party cannot claim damages if they knew about the risks involved and still proceeded with caution.\n\nGiven the facts:\n1. The friend was not the original purchaser of the dishwasher.\n2. The contractor who installed the dishwasher failed to properly ground it, leading to a safety hazard.\n3. The friend received a violent electric shock when attempting to investigate the malfunctioning dishwasher.\n\nThe key issue here is the failure of the contractor to install the dishwasher correctly, which led to the dangerous condition. The friend's actions of opening the dishwasher were not unreasonable given the circumstances and the obvious malfunction. Moreover, the friend's actions can be seen as reasonable attempts to understand the cause of the malfunction, rather than an assumption of risk in the traditional sense, especially considering the direct and avoidable risk posed by the faulty installation.\n\nThus, **Option C. not recover, because the friend assumed the risk by trying to open the dishwasher**, would not necessarily apply in this case, as the friend's actions were not an unreasonable assumption of risk given the circumstances. Instead, the focus would likely be on whether the manufacturer or the installer is liable for the defective condition of the dishwasher.\n\nUnder most modern legal systems, the friend could potentially recover damages from either the manufacturer (if it can be proven the product was defectively designed or manufactured) or the installer, depending on the evidence regarding who breached the duty of care to ensure safe installation. The friend's actions might be considered a reasonable attempt to address a known issue, which does not preclude recovery under principles of negligence law.\n\nTherefore, without specific details about the applicable jurisdiction's laws and the nuances of the legal arguments presented, it's challenging to definitively state the outcome. However, given the context, the friend might have grounds for recovery against either the manufacturer or the installer, depending on the evidence presented."
