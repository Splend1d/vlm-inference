This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because something is observed to happen in the natural world, it must also apply or be true in human contexts, without sufficient evidence for such an extension.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of why the other options do not represent the natural law fallacy:\n\nA. Arguing that something is necessarily bad because it doesn't cost very much is an example of an appeal to cost or an ad\u7ecf\u6d4emum argument. It focuses on the financial aspect rather than making a claim based on what must be true in nature.\n\nB. Substituting individual stories for a larger sample when supporting a generalization is known as hasty generalization or the fallacy of accident. It involves drawing broad conclusions from a small or unrepresentative sample, which is different from assuming natural laws apply to humans.\n\nD. The post hoc fallacy, also known as \"after this, therefore because of this,\" involves assuming that because one event followed another, the first event caused the second. It does not involve making assumptions about the applicability of natural laws to humans."
