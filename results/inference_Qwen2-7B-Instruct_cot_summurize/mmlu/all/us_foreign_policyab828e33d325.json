How nuclear attacks are identified and responded to; who controls the weapons\n\nBureaucratic politics theory emphasizes the role of bureaucratic institutions, power struggles within these institutions, and the distribution of resources in influencing policy outcomes. In the context of nuclear weapons, this could mean that bureaucratic processes and politics play a significant role in how decisions are made regarding the use of nuclear weapons, including how they are are identified as necessary to use, who has the authority to authorize their use, and how the response to an attack is coordinated. This can lead to complex decision-making processes and potential delays or miscommunications that could have serious consequences."
