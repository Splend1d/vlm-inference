It does not increase as a motivator in the sense of becoming more significant; instead, it becomes a baseline requirement to avoid any negative feelings related to financial insecurity. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. changes to a maintenance factor, increasing as a motivator\n\nThis alignss with the concept proposed by Douglas McGregor's Theory Y, which suggests that once basic needs are are satisfied, individuals are motivated by personal growth and achievement rather than by external rewards like money. However, it's important to note that while money may no longer be seen as a primary motivator for achievement, it remains crucial for maintaining one's standard of living and preventing dissatisfaction."
