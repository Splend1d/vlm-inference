Compiling the program with address sanitizer (asan) will make the source of a memory error easier to find\n\nAddress sanitizer tools like Address Sanitizer (ASan is designed to help detect memory errors such as use-after-free, out-of-bounds access, and null pointer dereferences. When you compile your program with asan, the tool injects instrumentation that checks for these kinds of errors during runtime.\n\nWhen a memory error occurs, asan can provide more detailed information about the location and context where the error happened, making it easier to pinpoint the source of the issue. This can be very helpful when using fuzzing techniques, as it narrows down the search space for finding the input that triggers the error.\n\nUsing a grammar-based fuzzer (option A) could potentially find memory errors, but it might not be as effective or efficient as using a tool like asan, especially in terms of providing clear error locations.\n\nFuzzing does indeed help find crashes and hangs, but it's also used to discover other kinds of bugs, including those related to memory management, so option D is incorrect."
