This means that regardless of the client's race or ethnicity, the outcomes of psychotherapy tend to be similar when the therapeutic relationship is strong and the treatment is well-suited to the individual's needs. However, it's important to note that while the effectiveness may be similar, there can still be differences in the experience of therapy based on cultural factors, access to care, and societal influences. Therefore, culturally informed therapy is crucial to ensure that the therapeutic approach is sensitive and respectful to each client's unique background and experiences."
