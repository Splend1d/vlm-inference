All of the above statements (I, II, and III correctly describe aspects of the Central Limit Theorem.\n\n1. **The mean of the sampling distribution of x** (is indeed the same as the mean of the population. This means that if you were to take many samples from a population and calculate the mean of each sample, the average of these sample means would be very close to the population mean.\n\n2. **The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of x** (is the standard deviation of the population (divided by the square root of the sample size. This is also known as the standard error. It describes how much variability you can expect in the sample means around the population mean.\n\n3. **If the sample size is large**, the shape of the sampling distribution of x tends to be approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This is a key aspect of the Central Limit Theorem, which essentially states that given a sufficiently large sample size, the distribution of sample means will approximate a normal distribution.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be an option that includes all three statements, but since none of the provided options does, there might have been a misunderstanding in the formulation of the question or the options."
