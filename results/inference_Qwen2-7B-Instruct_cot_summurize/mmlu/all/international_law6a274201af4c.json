This is because treaties, by definition, are formal agreements between states or other international actors. They are expected to follow certain conventions in their formulation and presentation to ensure clarity, legal standing, and mutual understanding. Typically, treaties include elements such as a preamble, recitals, articles detailing the obligations and rights of each party, and a final clause. These forms help in creating a structured document that is easier to interpret and enforce."
