Therefore, **Option A** is not true.\n\n### B. \\((ax)^M = xa)^M\\)\n\nTo verify this, let's apply the recursive definition:\n\n\\[\n(ax)^M = ax^Ma\n\\]\n\nBy symmetry of multiplication in strings (i.e., \\(ab = ba\\) when considering concatenation as an operation, we have:\n\n\\[\nax^Ma = ax^M a = xa^Mx\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the order of \\(a\\) and \\(x\\) changes after applying \\(^M\\), which is consistent with the property of string reversal or commutativity under certain operations (though it doesn't directly match the form of \\(xa)^M\\) as stated, due to the extra \\(x\\) on the right side. The correct interpretation aligning with the definition is more about understanding how the operation affects the structure rather than a direct equality as stated. However, the essence of the transformation aligns with the idea of reversing the order of elements in a sequence, which is a characteristic of \\(^M\\)'s effect. Thus, **Option B** could be interpreted as partially true in terms of the operation's effect on the order, but the exact formulation suggests a misunderstanding in the question's phrasing for the purpose of matching exactly to the provided answer choices.\n\n### C. \\((xy)^M = y^Mx^M\\)\n\nApplying the recursive definition:\n\n\\[\n(xy)^M = xy^My\n\\]\n\nThis directly follows from the given definition, where we first concatenate \\(y\\) to \\(x\\) and then apply \\(^M\\) to \\(y\\) followed by \\(x\\). This matches the structure of **Option C**, showing that applying \\(^M\\) to a product of two strings results in the product of the individual \\(^M\\) applications, albeit in reverse order. Therefore, **Option C** is true based on the given definition.\n\n### D. **None of the above**\n\nGiven that **Option C** is proven to be true, **Option D** cannot be the correct choice.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is **C**. \\((xy)^M = y^Mx^M\\)."
