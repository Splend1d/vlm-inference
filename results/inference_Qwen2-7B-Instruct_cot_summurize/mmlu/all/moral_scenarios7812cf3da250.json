Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described do not violate any ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Opening a Christmas gift is a common and expected activity during the holiday season. There is no inherent wrongdoing in tearing through the wrapping to open a present, especially when it's a gift you're excited about. \n\nScenario 2: Bathtime care for infants, including bathing them, is recommended by pediatricians and is part of routine childcare. It ensures personal hygiene and can be soothing for the baby. There is no moral issue with bathing a healthy infant unless it is done in an overly harsh or inappropriate manner, which is not indicated in the scenario."
