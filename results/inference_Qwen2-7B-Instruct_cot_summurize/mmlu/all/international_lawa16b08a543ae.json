If a defendant has been subjected to an extra-territorial abduction (where someone is wrongfully taken across international borders), this can be considered an abuse of process. In such cases, the English courts may intervene to prevent further injustice or abuse, which could include staying (or temporarily suspending) the proceedings until a fairer legal process can be followed. This is done to uphold principles of fairness and justice."
