After the attorney terminated the woman's employment, she sent a job application and r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 to another attorney. In the r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 she sent to the second attorney, the woman listed her former employment with the first attorney. After receiving the woman's r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9, the second attorney telephoned the first attorney for his opinion of her qualifications. The first attorney replied that he dismissed the woman \"because she was unprofessional and incompetent. \" The first attorney's assessment was based on one malpractice incident for which he blamed the woman, but which, in fact, was attributable to another secretary in his law firm. Although the first attorney reasonably believed that his low rating of the woman was a fair reflection of her performance, he wrongfully held her responsible for the malpractice incident. Based on the first attorney's poor recommendation, the second attorney did not hire the woman. In a defamation action by the woman against the first attorney, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the first attorney's statement reflected adversely on the woman's professional competence.\nB. prevail, because the first attorney was mistaken in the facts upon which he based his opinion of the woman's performance.\nC. not prevail, because the first attorney had reasonable grounds for his belief that the woman was incompetent.\nD. not prevail, because the woman listed her former employment with the first attorney in her r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 to the second attorney.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. not prevail, because the first attorney had reasonable grounds for his belief that the woman was incompetent.\n\nIn order to prevail in a defamation lawsuit, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false statement about them, that the defendant knew it was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth, and that the false statement caused harm to the plaintiff's reputation. In this case, the first attorney's statement that the woman was \"unprofessional and incompetent\" was based on a reasonable belief that she was responsible for a malpractice incident. Even though the attorney was later found to be mistaken in attributing the incident to the wrong person, the initial belief was based on reasonable grounds. Therefore, the woman would likely not prevail in her defamation action against the first attorney.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The statement reflected adversely on the woman's professional competence, but without additional evidence showing the statement was false and made with reckless disregard for the truth, the plaintiff cannot prevail solely on this basis.\n\nB. The attorney being mistaken in the facts upon which he based his opinion does not automatically mean the statement is not defamatory. The question is whether the statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth, and if it caused harm to the plaintiff's reputation.\n\nD. The fact that the woman listed her former employment in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to the second attorney does not absolve the first attorney from liability for defamation. It is still incumbent on the first attorney to ensure the information shared is accurate and truthful."
