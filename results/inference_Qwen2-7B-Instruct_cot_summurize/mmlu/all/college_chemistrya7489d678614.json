The standard reduction potentials for some common elements can be found in tables of standard electrode potentials. For simplicity, let's assume that we have access to these values and use them as follows:\n\n1. **Option A**: This option involves no direct reduction or oxidation involving the elements mentioned, so it doesn't fit the typical definition of an oxidation-reduction reaction.\n2. **Option B**: Here, \\(Zn\\) is oxidized and \\(Ag\\) is reduced.\n3. **Option C**: In this case, \\(Pb\\) is oxidized and \\(Ca\\) is reduced.\n4. **Option D**: Similarly, \\(Pb\\) is oxidized and \\(Li\\) is reduced.\n\nTo compare which reaction is most likely, we would typically compare the reduction potentials of the species involved in the reduction half-reactions. However, since we're comparing based on the given options and not specific reduction potentials, we can infer that reactions where the reduction potential of the reducing agent (in this context, the metal being oxidized) is lower than that of the oxidizing agent (the metal being reduced) are more likely to occur because they are energetically favorable.\n\nGiven this logic:\n- **Option B** involves \\(Zn\\) being oxidized and \\(Ag\\) being reduced. Since \\(Ag\\) has a higher reduction potential than \\(Zn\\), this reaction is energetically favorable and thus more likely to occur compared to the other options presented, which involve metals being reduced by less reactive reducing agents.\n\nTherefore, based on the criteria provided and assuming typical reduction potentials for the metals involved, **Option B (Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO3)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)** is the most likely to occur."
