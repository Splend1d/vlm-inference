The area of contact does not directly affect the coefficient of friction or the normal force in this context.\n\nGiven that both blocks are made of the same material, their coefficients of friction will be the same. The only factors that change are the dimensions of the blocks, but these do not influence the frictional force according to the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the frictional force experienced by the block with half the height and twice the length would be the same as the original block, assuming the surface and the applied forces remain constant.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. f"
