Borrowers at fixed interest rates would typically benefit from inflation, as the real value of their debt decreases over time.\nII. Individuals on fixed incomes would be negatively impacted by inflation, as the purchasing power of their income decreases.\nIII. Those with savings earning fixed interest rates would also be negatively impacted by inflation, as the real value of their savings decreases.\nIV. Restaurant owners might benefit from inflation if their costs (like ingredients and labor) increase more slowly than their prices, but this depends on various factors such as competition, market conditions, and pricing strategies. Therefore, it's not universally true that all restaurant owners would be hurt by inflation."
