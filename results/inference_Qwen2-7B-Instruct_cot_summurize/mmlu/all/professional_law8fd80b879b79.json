The pedestrian sued the occupants of all the rooms from which the chair might have been thrown. At trial, the pedestrian has been unable to offer any evidence as to the exact room from which the chair was thrown. The defendants have filed a motion for a directed verdict. Should the court grant the motion?\n\nA. No, because it is unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which of the defendants caused the harm.\nB. No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\nC. Yes, because a plaintiff always has the burden to prove that a particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause of the plaintiff's physical harm.\nD. Yes, because the pedestrian has failed to offer evidence that the defendants jointly engaged in tortious conduct.\n"

This legal principle holds multiple parties responsible for the same harm if they can be reasonably presumed to have acted negligently or with intent to cause harm and if there is no way to determine which party actually caused the harm. Since the pedestrian cannot pinpoint the exact room from which the chair was thrown, the court may rule that the defendants are liable collectively under the doctrine of alternative liability, without requiring the pedestrian to prove that each individual defendant was at fault. \n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they misinterpret the standard of proof in these types of cases. Option D is also incorrect because the joint engagement of tortious conduct is not the requirement here; rather, the focus is on the inability to identify the specific party that caused the harm."
