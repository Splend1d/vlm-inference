This rule, established by a landmark 1804 English case, essentially validates an invalid remainder interest in the original grantor's estate, turning it into a reversionary interest back to the grantor or their heirs. This principle is particularly relevant in situations where a property's ownership structure becomes unclear due to invalid dispositions in the chain of title."
