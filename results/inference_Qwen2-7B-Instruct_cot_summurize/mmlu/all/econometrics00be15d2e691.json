(ii) and (iv) only.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\ni) This statement is incorrect because for two variables to be cointegrated, they do not need to be stationary individually. They need to share a common stochastic trend, meaning that although each might be non-stationary, a linear combination of them is stationary. This allows for a long-run equilibrium relationship between them even if they are individually integrated of order 1 (i.e., I(1).\n\nii) This statement is correct. In cointegration, there exists at least one linear combination of the non-stationary variables that is stationary. This linear combination represents their long-run equilibrium relationship.\n\niii) This statement is incorrect. The cointegrating equation does indeed describe the long-run relationship between the variables but it doesn't specify whether this relationship is a short-run or a long-run concept. It could be either depending on the context.\n\niv) This statement is correct. The residuals from a regression where one variable is regressed on another in the context of cointegration must be stationary. This implies that any long-term relationship captured by the regression has been accounted for, leaving only short-term fluctuations that revert to the mean.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. ( (ii) and (iv) only."
