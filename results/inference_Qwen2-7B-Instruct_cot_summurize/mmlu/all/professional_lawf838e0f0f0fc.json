The boyfriend asked his girlfriend to drive the getaway car, to which she agreed, on the condition that no loaded weapons were used during the robbery. On the day of the robbery, the boyfriend and his girlfriend drove to the grocery store. Unknown to the girlfriend, the boyfriend entered the store with a loaded gun. The boyfriend approached one of the cashiers and told him to fill a bag with all the money from the register. When the cashier refused, the boyfriend shot and killed him. He then turned to the next cashier and pointed his gun at her. The cashier suffered a heart attack and died. The boyfriend then took the money from the registers himself and exited the store. One of the customers had called the police, and they were waiting outside. A shootout ensued, and the boyfriend was killed by the police. If this jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder, the girlfriend is guilty if how many counts of murder?\n\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. None.\n"

However, the specific charges depend on the laws of the jurisdiction and the exact circumstances of the case.\n\nIn this scenario, the girlfriend agreed to participate in the getaway but stipulated that no loaded weapons would be used. The boyfriend, however, entered the store with a loaded gun, leading to the deaths of two people (the cashier who was shot and the one who had a heart attack upon seeing the gun. \n\nIf the jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder:\n\n- The boyfriend's actions (specifically the use of a loaded gun during the robbery and resulting deaths - could lead to felony murder charges for both the shooter and those who aided or abetted the crime, even if the girlfriend did not directly cause any deaths.\n- The girlfriend's role in agreeing to drive the getaway car under certain conditions might not directly correlate to the use of lethal force by the boyfriend. Her actions are most closely align with aiding and abetting the felony, which is typically charged as an accessory before the fact, not as direct participation in felony murder.\n\nGiven the information provided and assuming the agency theory applies, it's challenging to definitively state the number of murder counts without more detailed legal context about how jurisdictions apply this theory specifically. However, considering the girlfriend's involvement in driving the getaway car under conditions that excluded lethal force, it's less likely she would be charged with multiple counts of murder directly related to the deaths caused by the boyfriend's actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer might lean towards:\n\n**D. None.**\n\nThis is speculative, though, as the specifics of the jurisdiction's laws and how they interpret the agency theory could vary significantly. In practice, the girlfriend's potential charges would likely focus on her role in aiding the felony, not on the direct causation of the murders."
