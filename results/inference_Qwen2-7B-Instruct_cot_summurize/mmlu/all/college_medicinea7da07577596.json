Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\n\\[ P_1 \\times V_1 = P_2 \\times V_2 \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(P_1 = 200 \\, \\text{atm}\\)\n- \\(V_1 = 0.1 \\, \\text{L}\\)\n- \\(P_2 = 1 \\, \\text{atm}\\)\n\nWe need to find \\(V_2\\):\n\n\\[200 \\times 0.1 = 1 \\times V_2\\]\n\n\\[V_2 = 20 \\, \\text{L}\\]\n\nHowever, since the initial pressure is much higher (200 atm compared to the final pressure 1 atm, the volume would increase significantly. But because the question specifies \"slightly less than 20L,\" it likely implies a slight rounding or conceptual nuance not fully captured by direct calculation. The actual scenario would show a significant increase in volume due to the pressure drop, making the volume much larger than 0.1L, but the wording suggests considering the options closely and recognizing the volume will be notably larger than 20L due to the pressure change, hence \"slightly less than 20L\" might refer to a conceptual or rounding consideration rather than a literal calculation result. The precise interpretation depends on the exact context or intended answer choice, but based on Boyle's Law and common understanding, the volume would indeed increase substantially, making option A the closest conceptual fit given the provided choices."
