There is a sign warning \"this elevator is not available at this time, please do not ride it.\" A passenger sees the signs, but tries to ride the elevator anyway, and is injured when she falls into the shaft. When the passenger sues the city for negligence, the city states that she assumed the risk. Is that a valid and accurate defense under the circumstances?\n\nA. Yes, because she was fully informed and should have known that the elevator was unsafe based upon the signs.\nB. Yes, because the signs make her contributorily negligent and a legal cause of her own injury.\nC. No, because the sign did not explain the danger and only told her that it was not available, and she therefore did not know what she was encountering.\nD. No, because the city has strict liability when everyone is depending on the subway.\n"

No, because the sign did not explain the danger and only told her that it was not available, and she therefore did not know what she was encountering.\n\nIn this scenario, the city's defense of \"assumption of risk\" may not hold up if the sign did not adequately communicate the potential danger or severity of the situation. The sign merely indicated that the elevator was unavailable, but did not provide sufficient information about why it was not available ( such as being in the process of being rebuilt with potential hazards. Therefore, the passenger likely could not have reasonably assumed the risk without further information."
