The amino acid score is calculated by comparing the amino acid pattern of the protein to that of egg protein.\n\nThis is because the amino acid score, also known as the Protein Quality Score (PQS), is typically compared against the amino acid profile of egg protein because it is considered to have a complete and high-quality amino acid composition. This provides a standard against which other proteins can be measured. \n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because they suggest comparing to milk or using a single reference pattern for all ages, which is not how the amino acid score is calculated. Option D is partially correct but not entirely accurate; while amino acid scores may consider the nutritional needs of different age groups, this does not necessarily mean different \"patterns\" are used; rather, it might involve adjusting for specific amino acid requirements that vary with age."
