This type of testimony is generally admissible under the rules of evidence as it pertains to authentication of documents, rather than being an opinion or requiring expert testimony specifically for handwriting analysis. The fact that the handwriting matches the defendant's is a factual assertion, not an opinion, and does not require the testimony of an expert in handwriting analysis. Therefore, the trial judge should overrule the objection based on the grounds that the former girlfriend qualifies as an authenticating witness."
