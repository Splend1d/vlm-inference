The more distantly related two organisms are, the fewer homologous structures they will likely have. This is because homologous structures accumulate over time as evolution proceeds, so the less recent the common ancestor, the less chance there was for these similarities to develop.\n\nA. They don't necessarily have to live in very different habitats. Distantly related organisms can inhabit similar or even identical environments.\nC. Their chromosomes may not be very similar. While they would share some similarities due to their evolutionary history, the specific arrangement and sequences of genes can vary greatly between distantly related species.\nD. They didn't necessarily share a common ancestor recently. The timing of when they shared a common ancestor depends on their exact evolutionary relationships and how far back their divergence occurred."
