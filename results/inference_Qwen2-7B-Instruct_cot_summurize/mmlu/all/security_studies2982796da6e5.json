The responsibility to remain sovereign. \n\nThe Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a principle adopted by the United Nations in 2005 that states that a state has a responsibility to protect its population from four categories of mass atrocity crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. It also recognizes that if a state is manifestly failing to protect its population, the international community may have a responsibility to intervene with the consent of the state or through a United Nations Security Council resolution. However, the R2P does not imply that states have a right or obligation to remain sovereign. On the contrary, it recognizes that the sovereignty of a state is conditional on its compliance with its obligations under international law, including the duty to protect its population."
