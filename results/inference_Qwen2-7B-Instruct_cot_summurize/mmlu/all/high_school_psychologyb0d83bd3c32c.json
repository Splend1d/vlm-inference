Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Jerome grabbing water during a race to quench his thirst alignss with drive reduction theory. His body is in a state of dehydration (causing discomfort, and drinking water reduces this state.\n\nB. Ernest gobbling cookies on his way to class because he didn't have time for lunch also fits into drive reduction theory. His body is likely experiencing hunger due to lack of food intake, and eating cookies helps to satisfy that need and reduce the discomfort of hunger.\n\nC. Tish deciding to skip lunch because she is still full from eating a very large breakfast doesn't fit into drive reduction theory as well. This action isn't about reducing an internal state of discomfort but rather avoiding it. She's already satisfied, so there's no physiological drive that needs reducing.\n\nD. Kezia being full after dinner but deciding to order strawberry cheesecake might seem counterintuitive to drive reduction theory at first glance, but if we consider that her body has already met its basic nutritional needs and she's engaging in behavior more related to taste preference or reward, then it could be seen as an exception. However, strictly speaking, if she were motivated by the desire to eat again without any other underlying physiological need, it would fit better under the category of higher-order motivations rather than a direct drive-reduction response.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most straightforward example where drive-reduction theories would not provide a reasonable explanation is:\n\nC. Tish decides to skip lunch because she is still full from eating a very large breakfast."
