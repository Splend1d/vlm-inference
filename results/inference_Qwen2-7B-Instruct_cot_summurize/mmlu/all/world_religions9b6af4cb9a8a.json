This movement saw a significant departure from earlier Greek conceptions of the gods as having human-like qualities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Fourth and Third Century BCE\n\nThis time frame encompasses the development of Stoicism, Epicureanism, and other philosophies that sought to understand the universe through rational thought rather than mythological personifications, thus moving away from anthropomorphism in their depictions of the divine."
