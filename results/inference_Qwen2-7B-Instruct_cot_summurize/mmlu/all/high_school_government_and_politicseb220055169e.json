Increasing concentration of ownership in the news media\n\nThe consolidation of media ownership has led to fewer companies controlling a larger share of the media landscape, including network news. This can result in less diversity because these larger corporations may have similar editorial policies or leanings, which can influence the types of stories covered and the perspectives presented. It's important to note that this trend is not necessarily driven by a desire to be less diverse but rather by business decisions related to economies of scale, profit margins, and strategic alignment.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that while media consolidation might contribute to a perception of less diversity, it doesn't automatically mean that the content will be less diverse in terms of political viewpoints. Media outlets might still cover a wide range of political perspectives, but the sheer number of voices and viewpoints represented could be lower due to the reduced number of independent sources.\n\nThe other options listed do not directly address the issue of decreased diversity in network news coverage:\n\nA. Decreasing liberal bias in the news media: While there might be shifts in political leanings among media outlets, the question focuses on diversity rather than bias.\nB. Increasing visibility for individual candidates on TV: This might suggest more coverage for certain candidates, but it does not necessarily equate to less diversity in the overall content or viewpoints presented.\nD. Decreasing cost of political ads on TV: This factor could potentially lead to more political content being aired, but it doesn't inherently affect the diversity of the news coverage beyond that context."
