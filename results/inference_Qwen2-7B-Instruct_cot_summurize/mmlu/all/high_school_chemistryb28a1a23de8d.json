Mg(NO3)2(aq)\n\nThis is because Mg(NO3)2 contains magnesium ions (Mg\u00b2\u207a, which are identical to the cation in MgCl2. When dissolved in water, the Mg\u00b2\u207a ions from Mg(NO3)2 will form a common ion with the Mg\u00b2\u207a ions in MgCl2, leading to the dissolution of MgCl2 according to Le Chatelier's principle. The presence of nitrate ions (NO3\u207b does not interfere with the dissolution process.\n\nThe other options do not contain magnesium ions or do not form a common ion with Mg\u00b2\u207a, so they would not effectively dissolve MgCl2. \n\nA. LiOH(aq) contains lithium hydroxide, which may react with Mg\u00b2\u207a to form a precipitate of Mg(OH)2.\nB. CBr4(aq) is simply carbon tetrabromide in aqueous solution, which is an organic molecule and likely insoluble in water.\nD. AlCl3(aq) contains aluminum chloride, which will not form a common ion with Mg\u00b2\u207a, and may even precipitate out with Mg\u00b2\u207a under certain conditions."
