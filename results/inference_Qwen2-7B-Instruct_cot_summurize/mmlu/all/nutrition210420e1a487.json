This concept encompasses several key components:\n\n1. **Availability**: There is enough food produced and distributed in the market to meet the needs of the population.\n2. **Access**: Individuals or households have the means to acquire food through purchasing, growing, or being provided with it through social programs.\n3. **Utilization**: People have the ability to use food effectively, meaning they have the knowledge, resources, and health status necessary to consume food that meets their nutritional requirements.\n4. **Stability**: Food security is not only about having enough food but also about the consistency of this availability over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer that most closely align with these definitions is C. Its component elements include availability, utilization, and stability, as well as access. \n\nOption A is incorrect because food security does not specifically relate to preventing terrorist attacks on food supplies. While ensuring food safety is important, the primary focus is on access and availability of food for consumption.\n\nOption B is partially correct but does not encompass the full range of aspects that make up food security.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while addressing micronutrient deficiencies is part of broader food security efforts, the focus is not exclusively on ending micronutrient malnutrition; it includes ensuring access to adequate quantities of food that are nutritious and safe for consumption."
