Instead, it facilitates the exchange of substances between the mother's and the fetus's circulatory systems. The umbilical cord carries blood from the fetus to the placenta and brings it back to the fetus after the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste products.\n\nHere is a brief overview of what each option describes:\n\nA. Supplies oxygen to the fetus - Correct. The placenta facilitates the transfer of oxygen from the mother's blood to the fetal blood.\n\nB. Supplies nutrients to the fetus - Correct. The placenta allows for the transfer of essential nutrients from the mother's blood to the fetal blood.\n\nD. Secretes hormones - Correct. The placenta produces various hormones that help support pregnancy and coordinate the body's responses to pregnancy."
