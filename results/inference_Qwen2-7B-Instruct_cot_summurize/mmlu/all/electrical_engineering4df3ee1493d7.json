The firing angle ranges from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nThe load voltage \\(V_L\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[V_L = E \\cdot \\cos(\\alpha)\\]\nwhere \\(E\\) is the peak value of the source voltage (in this case, 200 V.\n\nGiven that the source voltage is \\(400\\sin(314t)\\), its peak value is indeed 400 V. However, since we're considering the load voltage \\(V_L\\) with respect to the 200 V counter electromotive force (counter emf (and not the peak value of the source voltage directly), the calculation for the range of the firing angle based on the load voltage becomes relevant when determining how the firing angle affects the output voltage under these conditions.\n\nFor a load counter emf of 200 V:\n\n- When the firing angle \\(\\alpha = 0\u00b0\\), the thyristor conducts immediately, resulting in \\(V_L = 200 V\\) ( (since \\(\\cos(0\u00b0) = 1\\)).\n- When \\(\\alpha = 180\u00b0\\), the thyristor conducts throughout the entire cycle, also resulting in \\(V_L = 200 V\\) ( (since \\(\\cos(180\u00b0) = -1\\), but we consider the absolute value for voltage).\n\nThus, the range of the firing angle where the load counter emf is effectively 200 V is from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0**. \n\nPlease note that option B might be misleading because it suggests a wider range than actually possible based on the given conditions (it should be more accurately described as \"from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0\" without implying an incorrect numerical range."
