Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no urticaria. Bilateral wheezing is heard on auscultation of the chest. Which of the following types of drugs is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?\n\nA. \u03b11-Adrenergic agonist\nB. \u03b12-Adrenergic agonist\nC. \u03b11-Adrenergic antagonist\nD. \u03b22-Adrenergic agonist\n"

In such cases, a \u03b22-Adrenergic agonist would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. These drugs are typically used to relieve bronchospasm and are effective in treating symptoms like wheezing associated with asthma or allergic reactions.\n\nOptions A, C, and B refer to different classes of drugs:\n- A) \u03b11-Adrenergic agonists: Typically used for vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure, not commonly used for allergic reactions.\n- C) \u03b11-Adrenergic antagonists: Also known as alpha blockers, they usually widen blood vessels and can lower blood pressure. They're not the first choice for allergic reactions.\n- B) \u03b12-Adrenergic agonists: Primarily used for their vasoconstrictive effects and sedative properties, they are not the primary treatment for asthma or allergic reactions. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, a \u03b22-Adrenergic agonist, which would help to relieve the patient's wheezing and manage her asthma-like symptoms."
