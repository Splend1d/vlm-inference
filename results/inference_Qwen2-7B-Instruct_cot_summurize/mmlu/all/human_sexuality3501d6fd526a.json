This is where they might start exploring their feelings, thoughts, and attractions more deeply.\n\nIt's important to note that this is just one way of categorizing stages someone might go through as they explore their sexuality. The specific stages can vary depending on different theories or models. For example, some might use a model that includes stages like \"curiosity,\" \"rejection of heterosexuality,\" \"exploration,\" and \"acceptance.\"\n\nIf you're feeling confused or unsure about your sexual orientation, it's important to remember that there's no rush to figure things out. It's okay to take time for yourself to explore your feelings and desires, and it's also okay to seek support from friends, family, or professionals if you feel the need. Remember, understanding your own identity is a personal process and there's no \"right\" timeline for it."
