A derogation allows a state party to temporarily suspend certain obligations under a human rights treaty when facing a public emergency threatening the life of the nation. This concept is most famously embodied in Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which states that \"in time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the measures taken as a result of such emergency are strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, the States Parties to the present Covenant may take measures derogating from their obligations under the present Covenant provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obligations under international law.\""
