To prevent the securitization of irrelevant threats and to challenge the legitimacy of currently securitized threats.\n\nDesecuritization is a process that aims to de-legitimize and reframe issues from the perspective of security into a more normative domain. It's important because it helps prevent the overreach of security policies that might erode civil liberties, become stagnant due to focusing too narrowly on existing threats, or unjustly label and prioritize threats that are not truly existential or relevant. By challenging the legitimacy of securitized threats, desecuritization promotes a more balanced approach to addressing societal challenges."
