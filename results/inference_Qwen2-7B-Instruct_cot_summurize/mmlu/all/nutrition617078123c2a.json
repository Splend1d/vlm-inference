All of the options given is not correct.\n\nIn fact, all of the options listed are correct mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes:\n\nA. Increased glucose production by the liver: In type 2 diabetes, the liver produces more glucose than necessary due to decreased insulin sensitivity.\n\nB. Impaired insulin secretion: The pancreas may produce less insulin or have impaired ability to secrete insulin when needed, which can lead to higher blood sugar levels.\n\nC. Decreased glucose uptake from the skeletal muscle: Insulin resistance in muscle cells reduces their ability to take up glucose from the bloodstream, contributing to high blood sugar levels."
