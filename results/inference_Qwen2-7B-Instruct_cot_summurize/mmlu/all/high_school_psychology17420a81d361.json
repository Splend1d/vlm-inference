This type of intelligence tends to increase with age as people gain more life experiences and learn new things. Fluid intelligence, on the other hand, involves the ability to reason, solve new problems, think logically, and identify patterns, which tends to decline with age. \"g\" typically refers to general intelligence, which is often stable or slightly declining with age. Speededness ( or reaction time, generally increases with age due to declines in processing speed."
