No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself.\nB. Yes, the fact that a person sees that action is needed for another's aid or protection does impose a legal duty to act.\nC. No, a failure to act does not and cannot result in liability under any circumstances.\nD. Yes, the shopper must take action under the \"last clear chance\" doctrine.\n"

Yes, the fact that a person sees that action is needed for another's aid or protection does impose a legal duty to act.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, individuals may indeed be legally obligated to take reasonable steps to prevent harm when they are aware of an impending danger and are in a position to do so without significant risk to themselves. This concept can vary significantly depending on local laws and specific circumstances. For instance, some areas might apply the \"duty to rescue\" law, which requires certain individuals (like lifeguards or doctors) to help in emergency situations, while others might interpret common law principles such as the \"last clear chance\" doctrine, which suggests that a person may be held liable if they had the opportunity to avoid an accident but chose not to.\n\nHowever, the specifics can be complex and depend heavily on the context, including the relationship between the individuals involved, the foreseeability of harm, and the availability of other options for preventing the harm. In the given scenario, if the shopper could have taken action without significant risk to herself and that action would likely have prevented injury to the second shopper, she may indeed have a legal duty to act, depending on local laws."
