This concept aims to hold individuals accountable for serious international crimes such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and piracy, which are violate fundamental principles of human dignity and international peace.\n\nTherefore, the correct options that best capture the essence of universal jurisdiction are:\n\nB. Its aim is to deter the commission of certain international crimes.\nC. Its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of particular crimes.\n\nWhile it's important to note that universal jurisdiction doesn't necessarily mean all states have jurisdiction over all international crimes ( (which would be a broad interpretation), it does allow states to claim jurisdiction over specific crimes based on their severity and the need for international justice. The exact scope and application of universal jurisdiction can vary by country and international agreement."
