Divine inspiration\n\nIslamic jurisprudence, or fiqh, includes various methods and principles for deriving legal rulings from the sources of Islamic law, which include the Quran, Hadith, Ijma (consensus), Qiyas (analogical reasoning), and Istihsan (a preference for the more merciful interpretation). While divine revelation is considered to be the ultimate source of Islamic law, it is not directly involved in the process of deriving legal rulings within the framework of jurisprudence itself. The process involves human reasoning and interpretation of divine texts."
