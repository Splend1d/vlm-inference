This results in consumers paying more for goods or services than they would under competitive market conditions. Additionally, the lack of competition might reduce incentives for innovation and quality improvements, further impacting consumer welfare. The government often regulates monopolies activities to prevent these negative outcomes and promote fairer markets."
