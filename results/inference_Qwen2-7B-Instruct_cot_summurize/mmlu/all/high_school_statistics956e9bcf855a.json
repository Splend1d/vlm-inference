We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nA confidence interval provides an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated range being calculated from a given set of sample data. In this case, we're talking about the average cost of running for a congressional seat.\n\n- A) This option incorrectly suggests that 90% of individual politicians spend within the specified range. It confuses the concept of a confidence interval for the mean (with the distribution of individual observations.\n- B) This option also incorrectly focuses on the individual spending rather than the mean spending. It does not convey that the confidence is in the mean amount spent by all politicians running for office, not just one.\n- C) This option is incorrect because it incorrectly implies that there is a 90% probability that any individual politician spends within the interval. In fact, the confidence interval pertains to the mean, not individual observations.\n- D) This option correctly interprets the confidence interval. It states that based on the sample data, we are 90% confident that the true mean cost of running for a congressional seat lies between $117,500 and $132,500. This is the proper way to describe a 90% confidence interval for the mean."
