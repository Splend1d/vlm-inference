                    "text": "To address these statements, let's clarify the concepts involved:\n\n- **Free Abelian Group**: A free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a set of elements (its generators), where every element can be uniquely written as a linear combination of these generators with integer coefficients. The group operation is addition.\n\n- **Rank of a Free Abelian Group**: The rank of a free abelian group is the minimum cardinality of its generating set. If a free abelian group is generated by \\(n\\) elements, it is said to have rank \\(n\\).\n\n### Statement 1\n**Every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.**\n\nThis statement is generally true. In fact, for any nonzero free abelian group, there exists at least one basis (a minimal generating set). Moreover, given any basis, you can create infinitely many other bases by applying permutations to the elements of the original basis. For example, if you have a basis \\(\\{b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n\\}\\), any rearrangement of these elements, such as \\(\\{b_2, b_1, b_3, \\ldots, b_n\\}\\), or any cyclic permutation like \\(\\{b_2, b_3, \\ldots, b_n, b_1\\}\\), still forms a valid basis. Thus, there are indeed infinitely many bases.\n\n### Statement 2\n**Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.**\n\nThis statement is also true. When a free abelian group has a rank of at least 2, it means there are at least two generators in any of its bases. Similar to the reasoning above, given any basis, you can generate infinitely many other bases by permuting the order of the generators. Since the rank is at least 2, there are enough \"freedom\" in choosing the order of the generators to create an infinite number of distinct bases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis, both statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
