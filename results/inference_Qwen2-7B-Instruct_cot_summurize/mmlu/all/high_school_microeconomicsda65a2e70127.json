Wage differentials can be based on factors such as higher risk jobs ( (which often require more safety precautions and compensation), investment in human capital ( (like education or skills that enhance job performance), and racial discrimination ( (which unfortunately is still a factor in some workplaces). However, an increase in the production of SUVs would generally affect employment levels and job types within the automotive industry, but it wouldn't directly determine wage differences between workers, unless it affected their roles or responsibilities."
