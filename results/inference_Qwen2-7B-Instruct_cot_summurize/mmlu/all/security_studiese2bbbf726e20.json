Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system.\nB. Peace research, in contrast to university IR, was under a great deal of pressure to deal with relevant issues with a high expectation of immediate delivery of policy answers.\nC. There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.\nD. The setting was simultaneously informed by political theory as the dominant discipline and isolated from developments in theory in the different disciplines.\n"

                    "text": "The importance of peace research during the 1980s can be understood through several key aspects:\n\n**A. Inter-disciplinary and Politically Oriented**: Peace research during this era was indeed characterized by an interdisciplinary approach, integrating insights from various fields such as sociology, psychology, economics, and political science. This approach was crucial because it allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the complex factors that contribute to conflict and peace. Moreover, its political orientation meant that it aimed to inform and influence policy-making, particularly in relation to nuclear disarmament, arms control, and broader strategies for reducing global tensions.\n\n**B. Immediate Policy Responsibility and Expectations**: In contrast to more academic or theoretical approaches within university International Relations (IR), peace research was often under significant pressure to provide practical solutions and recommendations that could address pressing global issues immediately. This was particularly true given the Cold War context, where the stakes were high and the need for concrete steps to prevent nuclear war and promote international stability was paramount. The expectations for delivering actionable policy answers reflected the urgency of the times and the direct impact that research outcomes could have on global security.\n\n**C. Distance from Policy Responsibility and European Security Studies**: While some might argue that there was a distance from direct policy responsibility, it is also true that peace research during the 1980s played a pivotal role in shaping European security studies. The heightened awareness of security issues, driven by the peace movement and the backdrop of the Cold War, led to a greater focus on non-military dimensions of security, such as environmental degradation, economic development, and human rights. This shift was partly due to the recognition that traditional military strategies were insufficient to address the multifaceted challenges facing Europe and the world.\n\n**D. Influence of Political Theory and Disciplinary Isolation**: The setting of peace research was indeed influenced by political theory, reflectinging a deep interest in the philosophical underpinnings of international relations and the ethical considerations of peace and conflict. However, it was not isolated from developments in other disciplines. In fact, the interdisciplinary nature of peace research facilitated a cross-pollination of ideas, enriching both theoretical and practical aspects of the field. This integration helped to refine methodologies and expand the scope of inquiry into what constitutes peace and how it could be achieved.\n\nIn summary, the 1980s saw peace research as a dynamic and influential field that bridged academic rigor with practical policy implications, particularly in the context of the Cold War and the growing global consciousness around disarmament and security. Its interdisciplinary approach and political orientation made it a critical force in shaping policies and discourse around global peace and security."
