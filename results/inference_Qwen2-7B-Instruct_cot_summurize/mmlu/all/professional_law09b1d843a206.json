An undivided one-half interest with right of survivorship.\n\nIn the case of a marriage where the couple owns property as tenants by the entirety, both spouses must agree to any transfer of the property. The right of survivorship means that upon the death of one spouse, the surviving spouse automatically becomes the owner of the entire property. However, when only one spouse (the wife in this case) transfers her interest in the property without the other spouse's (husband's) consent, it typically does not affect the tenancy by the entirety status unless specifically provided for in the law or the deed. \n\nThe deed from the wife to her aunt would create a separate interest in the aunt, subject to the rights and obligations under state property laws. In many jurisdictions, a quitclaim deed conveys whatever interest the grantor has in the property. Since the wife was a tenant by the entirety, she likely transferred an undivided one-half interest in the property to her aunt, which is not subject to the right of survivorship because it was not part of the tenancy by the entirety relationship.\n\nTherefore, the aunt would generally acquire an undivided one-half interest in the property with the right of survivorship attached to her interest, as the right of survivorship is not affected by the transfer to the aunt but rather by the tenancy by the entirety agreement between the husband and wife."
