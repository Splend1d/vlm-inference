The effectiveness of hypnosis is seen in the mutual agreement and the role-playing dynamics between the hypnotist and the subject.\n\n**Dissociation Theory**: This theory focuses on the idea that hypnosis allows for the temporary disconnection between different parts of the mind and body. It posits that during hypnosis, individuals can experience a state where their conscious awareness is temporarily separated from their emotional or physical responses. This separation enables deeper access to unconscious processes and memories, facilitating therapeutic change.\n\nThese two theories provide different perspectives on how hypnosis works, with role theory emphasizing the interpersonal dynamic and dissociation theory focusing on the psychological mechanism of separating conscious awareness from other mental states."
