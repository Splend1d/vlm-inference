There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.\nWe do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality \u2026 but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.\u2026\nWe will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.\n\u2014Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana, Radio Address, February 23, 1934\nSenator Long's \"Share the Wealth Society\" attracted many followers in 1934 because\n\nA. the New Deal had not ended the Great Depression.\nB. a flourishing economy and a baby boom had led people to desire greater incomes.\nC. the Second World War encouraged an egalitarian ethos.\nD. Socialistic ideas were becoming popular in the United States.\n"

Long's proposal for the \"Share Our Wealth Society\" resonated with many Americans in 1934 because they were still struggling during the depths of the Great Depression, which began in 1929. The New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's series of programs and policies initiatives, had been underway since 1933, but the economic recovery was slow, and many Americans remained unemployed or underemployed. Long's promise to limit wealth and provide a guaranteed minimum income of $5,000 per family ( and a maximum of $50 million for individuals struck a chord with those who were seeking relief from the economic hardships of the time. It offered a vision of a more equitable distribution of wealth, which appealed to the widespread desire for relief and reform during the Depression era."
