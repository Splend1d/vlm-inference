Additionally, it incorrectly states that China promoting human rights is equivalent to South Africa not supplying diamonds.\n\nB. (~E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 S): This option incorrectly suggests that if England does not import beef, then France subsidizes agriculture.

It also correctly states that China promoting human rights is equivalent to South Africa supplying diamonds.\n\nD. ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C): This option incorrectly suggests that it is not the case that if France subsidizes agriculture, then England imports beef.
