State law, however, prohibits use of this state funding for surgery for any person who has resided in the state for less than one year, except in emergency situations. A woman moved to the state two months ago seeking permanent employment. Her physician recommends non-emergency surgery to treat a medical condition. The surgery would qualify for state funding if the woman had resided in the state for a year. The woman has sued to invalidate the state law that prohibits state funding of her surgery. Should the woman prevail in her action?\n\nA. No, because the law reasonably conserves the state's limited resources.\nB. No, because the law reasonably prevents the expenditure of state funds on transient nonresidents.\nC. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to health care.\nD. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel.\n"

                    "text": "C. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to health care.\n\nIn constitutional law, particularly under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution which guarantees due process and equal protection, laws that burden fundamental rights are subject to strict scrutiny. This means that the state must show that the law serves a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nThe right to health care is often considered a fundamental right, especially when it comes to access to necessary medical procedures. In this case, the state's law prohibits the use of state funding for non-emergency surgery for someone who has lived in the state for less than one year, except in emergency situations. This directly impacts the woman's ability to access healthcare, which is a fundamental right.\n\nThe state's interest in conserving its limited resources (option A) or preventing the expenditure of funds on transient non-residents ( option B) does not necessarily justify such a restriction on the fundamental right to health care. While these are legitimate interests, they do not meet the standard required for a law that burdens a fundamental right under strict scrutiny.\n\nOption D, the right to travel, is not as clearly applicable here since the issue is about access to healthcare rather than the right to move freely between states. However, the right to health care can be seen as related to the right to travel indirectly, as it affects one's ability to live and work in a state.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C, as the law likely infringes upon the woman's fundamental right to health care, and she should prevail in her action unless the state can demonstrate a compelling interest and that the law is narrowly tailored to serve that interest."
