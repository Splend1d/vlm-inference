Piracy jure gentium is subject to universal jurisdiction\n\nUnder international law, piracy as a crime is recognized by the \"lex mercatoria\" or \"jus gentium,\" which refers to the body of rules and principles applicable to all states regardless of their internal legal systems. The most prominent treaty concerning piracy is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which defines piracy and outlines that it is subject to universal jurisdiction. This means any state can prosecute a person for piracy, regardless of where the act was committed or the nationality of the individuals involved."
