Events that are more vivid, recent, or emotionally charged are often perceived as more probable than they actually are. This can lead to exaggerated perceptions of certain risks, such as air travel disasters, nuclear power accidents, or terrorist violence, because these events may be more memorable due to their severity or media coverage, even though statistically, they might be less likely to occur."
