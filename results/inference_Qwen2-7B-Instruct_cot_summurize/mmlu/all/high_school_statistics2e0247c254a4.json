The airport authorities decide to increase the rent charged for a kiosk by 5 percent. To make up for the increased rent, the kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50 cents. As a result, which of the following will happen?\n\nA. The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nB. The mean price will remain the same, but the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nC. The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nD.

However, it impacts the cost structure for the kiosk owner.\n\n**Second change: Increase in prices by 50 cents:**\n- **Mean price:** The mean increases by 50 cents, making the new mean price $14.75 + $0.50 = $15.25.\n- **Range:** The range increases by 50 cents as well. To calculate this:\n    - New max price = $29.99 + $0.50 = $30.49\n    - New min price = $3.99 + $0.50 = $4.49\n    - New range = $30.49 - $4.49 = $26.00\n    - This is an increase of $22 - $26 = -$2 ( (This calculation was seems to have gone wrong because I should have added the 50 cents increase to both ends of the range, not calculated it directly from the increase. Let's correct that.)\n\n**Corrected range calculation:**\n- **New max price = $29.99 + $0.50 = $30.49**\n- **New min price = $3.99 + $0.50 = $4.49**\n- **New range = $30.49 - $4.49 = $26.00**\n    - This calculation correctly reflects an increase in the range by adding 50 cents to both the minimum and maximum prices.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA. The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The mean price and the range of prices will each increase by 50 cents due to the uniform increase in prices across all items."
