Real GDP will decrease.\n\nExplanation:\n\nReal GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period, adjusted for inflation. If technology makes production less expensive, this typically leads to an increase in output, potentially increasing Real GDP. However, if exports decrease despite the reduction in production costs, it suggests that there might be other factors affecting international trade, such as changes in global demand, trade policies, or currency fluctuations.\n\nGiven that exports are a component of GDP (specifically, they contribute positively to a country's GDP when they exceed imports, a decrease in exports would likely offset some of the gains from increased domestic production efficiency. This could lead to a situation where the overall increase in production (which would normally boost GDP due to lower costs - is not fully realized because of the decrease in exports.\n\nTherefore, considering these effects, the most certain outcome would be that Real GDP will decrease, assuming the decrease in exports outweighs the benefits of lower production costs domestically. The exact impact on the price level would depend on various economic factors and cannot be conclusively determined just from this information. It's possible that lower costs could lead to decreased prices (option D), but without additional context, we cannot definitively state that the price level will decrease with certainty."
