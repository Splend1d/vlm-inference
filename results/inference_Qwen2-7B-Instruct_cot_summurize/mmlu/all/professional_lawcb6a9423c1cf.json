In an inseverable portion of that same law, the entire proceeds of the tax are appropriated on a continuing basis for direct payments to an education fund. The education fund is dedicated to educating people about the importance of mass transportation as an alternative to automobiles, which the fund considers a major source of pollution. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following statements concerning the continuing federal appropriation to the education fund is most accurate?\n\nA. It is constitutional because Congress could reasonably believe that such a subsidy to this particular museum will benefit the cultural life of the nation as a whole.\nB. It is constitutional because Congress can demonstrate that such a subsidy is rationally related to a legitimate public interest.\nC. It is unconstitutional because it is not apportioned among the several states on an equitable basis.\nD. It is unconstitutional because it advances the welfare only of thosepersons who are interested in cleanair.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would be C. It is unconstitutional because it is not apportioned among the several states on an equitable basis.\n\nThis question involves the concept of apportionment under the U.S. Constitution. Article I, Section 9, Clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution states that \"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\" Additionally, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that state laws must treat similarly situated individuals equally. \n\nIn this case, since the education fund's purpose is to promote mass transportation as an alternative to automobiles, which are are considered a major source of pollution, this could potentially lead to an argument that the appropriation is not equitably distributed among the states. This is because it may disproportionately benefit states with higher rates of automobile usage or pollution. Therefore, the statement that the continuing federal appropriation to the education fund is unconstitutional because it is not apportioned among the several states on an equitable basis is the most accurate. \n\nStatements A, B, and D are incorrect because they either suggest the appropriation is constitutional based on different reasons ( cultural benefits, rational relation to a legitimate public interest, or promoting clean air respectively, which are not supported by constitutional principles."
