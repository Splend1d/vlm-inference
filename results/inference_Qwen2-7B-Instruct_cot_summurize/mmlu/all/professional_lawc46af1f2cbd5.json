Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the investor sold all 100 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following: \"No lot shall be used except for residential purposes. \" By 2009, the area surrounding the subdivision was rezoned for commercial and business uses. One of the lot owners now decides to operate a small beauty parlor in the basement of her home. In an action by the homeowners in the subdivision to prevent such commercial use, the court will most likely hold that\n\nA. the residency restriction is no longer enforceable because of the change in the character of the neighborhood surrounding the development.\nB. the residency restriction is no longer enforceable because the area surrounding the development was rezoned for commercial use.\nC. the residency restriction is enforceable, thus preventing any commercial use.\nD. the operation of a beauty parlor would not constitute a violation of the residency restriction.\n"

These covenants run with the land and bind subsequent owners, even if the property was purchased after the deed restrictions were established. When the area around the development changed from residential zoning to commercial zoning, it does not automatically invalidate the original deed restrictions that were specifically attached to the property. \n\nTherefore, even though the broader area may now permit commercial use, the individual homeowner is still bound by the original deed restrictions that stipulate residential use only for their specific lot. This means that operating a beauty parlor in the basement of her home would likely violate the terms of the deed restrictions, making option C the correct choice.\n\nOptions A and B incorrectly suggest that the rezoning of the broader area or the change in the character of the neighborhood would make the original deed restrictions unenforceable. Option D misunderstands the nature of deed restrictions; the operation of a business could indeed be in violation of the deed restrictions, regardless of whether it is allowed under the broader zoning laws."
