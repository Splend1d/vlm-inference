Hypothetical-deductive reasoning\u2014formal operational stage.\n\nAccording to Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, the formal operational stage occurs during adolescence and extends into adulthood. During this stage, individuals develop the ability to think abstractly, reason hypothetically, and engage in systematic planning. They can perform operations on abstract symbols, such as numbers, words, or concepts, and understand complex ideas. This includes the ability for hypothetical-deductive reasoning, which involves forming hypotheses, testing them through logical deductions, and evaluating the outcomes.\n\nLet's briefly go over the other options:\n\nA. Centration\u2014concrete operational stage: Centration refers to the inability to consider multiple aspects of a problem simultaneously, which is more characteristic of the concrete operational stage, occurring after the preoperational stage but before adolescence.\n\nB. Egocentrism\u2014sensorimotor stage: Egocentrism, where children cannot see things from another person's perspective, is a characteristic of the preoperational stage, not the sensorimotor stage.\n\nD. Object permanence\u2014preoperational stage: Object permanence is a concept that develops around 8 months of age, which is a key milestone in the sensorimotor stage, not the preoperational stage. In the preoperational stage, children begin to develop symbolic thought, but they still struggle with understanding object permanence in a more abstract way."
