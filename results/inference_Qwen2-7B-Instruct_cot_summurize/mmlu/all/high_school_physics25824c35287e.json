Moving the boy to half his original distance from the fulcrum (\\(d/2\\)):\n\n\\[2m \\cdot \\frac{d}{2} = mgd\\]\n\n\\[md = mgd\\]\n\nThis would unbalance the see-saw in favor of the girl because the moment on the boy's side would be less than the girl's moment.\n\nB. Moving the girl to double her original distance from the fulcrum (\\(2d\\)):\n\n\\[2m \\cdot d = mg(2d\\]\n\n\\[2md = 2mgd\\]\n\nThis keeps the see-saw balanced because the moments on both sides are still equal.\n\nC. Allowing a second girl of mass \\(m\\) to join the first:\n\n\\[mg + mg = 2mgd\\]\n\n\\[2mg = 2mgd\\]\n\nThis keeps the see-saw balanced because adding another girl of equal mass to the girl's side does not change the balance.\n\nD. Moving the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy (\\(d/2\\)):\n\nSince the fulcrum moves closer to the boy, effectively increasing his distance from the fulcrum and decreasing the girl's effective distance ( (as the fulcrum acts as a lever arm in the opposite direction) the equation becomes:\n\n\\[mg(d+d/2) = 2m \\cdot \\frac{d}{2}\\]\n\n\\[mg \\cdot \\frac{3d}{2} = mmd\\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{3mg}{2} = mgd\\]\n\nThis would keep the see-saw balanced because the increase in the boy's moment due to the closer fulcrum is offset by the increased moment of the girl due to the longer effective lever arm.\n\nThe only option that would not be a possible method to balance the see-saw, given the conditions, is **A. Move the boy to half his original distance from the fulcrum**. This action would cause the see-saw to tilt further in favor of the girl, thus unbalancing it."
