The judicial power of the United States is defined in Article III, Section 2, which states that it extends to \"all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; \u2014 Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; \u2014 Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; \u2014 Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; \u2014 Cases between two or more States; \u2014 Cases between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects; \u2014 Cases between Citizens of different States; \u2014 between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and private Persons not residents in any State.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above, as these categories cover various types of cases that the federal judiciary has jurisdiction over according to Article III."
