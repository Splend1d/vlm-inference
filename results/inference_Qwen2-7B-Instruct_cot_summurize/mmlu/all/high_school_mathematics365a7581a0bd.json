This means that for every point \\((x, y)\\) on the graph of \\(f\\), there will be a corresponding point \\((-x, y)\\) on the graph of \\(g\\).\n\nGiven that the point \\((3, 2)\\) lies on the graph of \\(g\\), this implies that the reflection of this point across the y-axis would be on the graph of \\(f\\). Reflecting \\((3, 2)\\) across the y-axis changes the sign of the x-coordinate but leaves the y-coordinate unchanged. Therefore, the point that must be on the graph of \\(f\\) when given that \\((3, 2)\\) is on the graph of \\(g\\) is:\n\nC. \\((-3, 2)\\)\n\nSo, the correct answer is C."
