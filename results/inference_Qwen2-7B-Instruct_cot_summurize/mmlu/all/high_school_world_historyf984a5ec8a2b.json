Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nMost classical empires shared which of the following traits?\n\nA. They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.\nB. They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.\nC.

                    "text": "The text excerpt from Edward Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" discusses the decline of the Roman Empire and suggests that the \"victory\" of the legions, who acquired vices and became less disciplined over time, led to internal strife and the weakening of the empire. This process eventually allowed barbarian invasions to overwhelm the Roman world.\n\nConsidering the traits of classical empires mentioned in the options:\n\nA. Cultural assimilation of conquered peoples: This trait is not necessarily a shared characteristic among all classical empires. While some empires did attempt to assimilate conquered peoples, others maintained a more diverse set of cultures within their territories.\n\nB. State support of foreign religions: This option does not directly relate to the common traits among classical empires. While some empires might have supported foreign religions to gain favor or maintain peace, it is not a universally applicable trait.\n\nC. Widespread public works projects: This trait could be considered a common characteristic among many classical empires. Public works projects were often used to integrate empires by improving infrastructure, creating jobs, and integrating local populations into the broader empire.\n\nD. Government bureaucracies based on the merit principle: While some classical empires did have merit-based systems in their bureaucracy, this is not a universal trait. Many classical empires were characterized by nepotism, patronage, and other forms of favoritism in their governance structures.\n\nGiven the context of the text excerpt, which focuses on the decline of the Roman Empire and the consequences of internal decay, the most fitting answer would be:\n\nC. They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.\n\nThis choice aligns best with the idea that the Roman Empire, like many other classical empires, invested in large-scale public projects as a means to unify and manage vast territories."
