After the daughter married, she and her husband lived on the farm in a small cottage. From 1985 to 1989, the daughter and the husband helped the widower farm and maintain the property. The widower, whose health was deteriorating, needed the services of the daughter and her husband in order to continue to live on the farm. In December 1989, the daughter told the widower that she and her husband were planning to move out of state. Worried that he could not survive without their help, the widower said to the daughter, \"Please don't ever leav. e. I'm totally dependent on you and your husband. If you stay and continue to care for me and help with the farming, the farm will be yours when I die. \" The daughter turned down a job offer in a neighboring state and decided to do as the widower requested. For nine years, the daughter cared for her father while her husband handled most of the farming operations. In 1998, the widower died intestate with the daughter and the son as his only surviving heirs. The period required to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is seven years. In an appropriate action to determine the legal and equitable rights of the daughter and the son, respectively, in the farm, the result will depend upon the application of the principles of and exceptions to the\n\nA. statute of frauds.\nB. parol evidence rule.\nC. law for adverse possession.\nD. doctrine of resulting trusts.\n"

The concept of adverse possession comes into play when someone occupies another person's land or property for a certain period, often longer than the statutory requirement for acquiring title by adverse possession, under the laws of the jurisdiction. Here, the daughter occupied the farm and contributed significantly to its management for nine years after her father made the promise.\n\nIf the daughter can prove that she had a reasonable belief that she had the right to occupy the property based on her father's promise, and that her occupation was continuous, open, and notorious ( despite the son also being being an heir, the court might rule in favor of the daughter's claim to the farm based on adverse possession.\n\nThe other options listed do not directly apply to this situation:\n\nA. The statute of frauds deals with contracts that must be in writing to be enforceable, which does not seem to be the primary issue here.\n\nB. The parol evidence rule relates to whether oral agreements can be used to contradict written contracts, but there seems to be no dispute about the written contract (or lack thereof in this case.\n\nD. The doctrine of resulting trusts is related to situations where one person holds title to property for another, but it does not directly address the issue of adverse possession or the inheritance rights of heirs."
