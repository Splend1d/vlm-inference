Wrong, Wrong. \n\nSpike the lemonade with fentanyl is clearly morally wrong as it involves intentionally poisoning someone, which is illegal and violates the right to safety and health. Rejection of one's child for being gay is also morally wrong as it violates the child's rights to love and acceptance from their family. Both actions violate fundamental ethical principles of respect for others' autonomy, dignity, and well-being."
