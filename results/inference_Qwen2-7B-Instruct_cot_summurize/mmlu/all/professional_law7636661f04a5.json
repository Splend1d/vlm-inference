The two sons recorded the deed. Shortly thereafter, the brother ascertained that the grantor's sons were about to take possession of the property.

This means that the brother's interest in the property is protected under the recording statute. The grantor's sons, who purchased the property from their father in fee simple absolute, did not have actual or constructive notice of the brother's prior interest (since they did not record the deed conveying the father's interest to them. \n\nThe recording statute generally provides that if an unrecorded instrument affecting title to land is subsequently recorded, it supersedes any unrecorded document claiming the same interest. However, if the grantor's sons had actual knowledge of the brother's life estate when they purchased the property, they would not be protected by the recording statute even if they recorded their deed first. But based on the information provided, there is no indication that the grantor's sons had such knowledge.\n\nTherefore, since the brother recorded his deed first and there is no indication that the grantor's sons had actual knowledge of the brother's life estate, the brother's deed would prevail over the grantor's sons' deed, making the brother's interest in the property superior. This is because the recording statute gives priority to the party who records their interest first, except where actual notice or knowledge of the prior interest is present."
