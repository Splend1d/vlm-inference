Drug prohibition would be done for the benefit of others, not the benefit of those who wish to produce/sell drugs, so it is not paternalistic in an objectionable sense.\nB. Drug prohibition would be paternalistic, but its consequences would be good enough to outweigh considerations about paternalism.\nC. Drug prohibition would be targeted to adults, and one can only be paternalistic toward children.\nD. Paternalism is always justified when the paternalistic practices truly are in the best interest of those affected.\n"

Drug prohibition would be done for the benefit of others, not the benefit of those who wish to produce/sell drugs, so it is not paternalistic in an objectionable sense. \n\nThis response addresses the objection that drug prohibition is paternalistic by arguing that it is not directed towards the interests of those who wish to produce or sell drugs, but rather aims to protect society as a whole. The focus is on the broader societal benefits rather than individual choices or desires."
