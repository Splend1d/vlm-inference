The leasehold agreement between the landlord and tenant provided that the latter was not permitted \"to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an \u0080\u0098A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. \" On February 1 of the following year, the tenant leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The tenant \u0080\u0094corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the tenant. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide \"by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the landlord and the tenant. \"One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a health club for the balance of the term of the corporation \u0080\u0094tenant lease. The health club owner took possession of the said premises on February 1, the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation \u0080\u0094health club leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The health club has a \u0080\u0098B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company. For one year, the health club paid $17,500, each month directly to the corporation. During that same period, the corporation continued to pay $15,000 each month to the tenant, while the latter paid $10,000 (each month) to the landlord. The landlord knew about the leases to the corporation and the health club and protested promptly, but took no further action, apparently satisfied as long as he received his $10,000 per month from the tenant. Thereafter, the health club abandoned the premises and stopped paying rent to the corporation. After the health club discontinued paying rent, the corporation stopped paying rent to the tenant. When the tenant failed to receive his rent, he, too, stopped paying rent to the landlord. If the landlord brings suit to recover for past rent due, which of the following is most accurate?\n\nA. The landlord may recover against the tenant for past rent due.\nB. The landlord may recover against the corporation for past rent due.\nC. The landlord may recover against the health club for past rent due.\nD. The landlord may recover against the corporation and the health club, jointly and severally,for past rent due.\n"

The landlord may recover against the tenant for past rent due.\n\nThe landlord's lease agreement with the initial tenant explicitly states that the tenant cannot assign the lease without the landlord's permission. The tenant violated this condition by leasing the premises to a corporation without the required credit rating. Although the subsequent leases to the corporation and then the health club were not directly with the landlord, the tenant remains liable for the lease payments under the original agreement. Therefore, the landlord can seek payment from the tenant for the past rent due.\n\nThe corporation and health club are not directly liable to the landlord under the terms of their respective leases, since they were not the original lessee with the landlord. However, the corporation might be liable to the tenant for breach of contract if it fails to pay rent as per the terms of its lease with the tenant. The health club, in turn, would be liable to the corporation for the same reason. These relationships do not directly create liability to the landlord unless there is a specific clause in the leases allowing it or if the landlord has agreed to it in some other way."
