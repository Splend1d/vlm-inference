However, there is an inherent incentive for each firm to cheat on the agreed-upon terms (such as producing more than their allocated quota or lowering prices to attract customers from other cartel members. This is because each firm would benefit individually at the expense of the others. This incentive often leads to instability in cartels and challenges in maintaining cooperation among member firms."
