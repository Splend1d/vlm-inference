Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids\n\nHaemorrhoids, also known as piles, are often exacerbated during pregnancy due to increased venous pressure and the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. While all options have some truth to them in different contexts, option B specifically addresses a common cause of haemorrhoids.\n\nA. Bleeding haemorrhoids can lead to per rectal bleeding, but not necessarily melaena. Melaena refers to black, tarry stools which are indicative of bleeding higher up in the gastrointestinal tract, usually involving the stomach or duodenum.\n\nC. Bleeding from first-degree haemorrhoids is typically not associated with pain. The pain associated with haemorrhoids is more commonly related to second-degree or third-degree haemorrhoids where the hemorrhoidal tissue extends beyond the anal verge.\n\nD. Second-degree haemorrhoids can indeed be returned to the anal canal. They are are characterized by prolapsed hemorrhoidal tissue that can be pushed back into place manually."
