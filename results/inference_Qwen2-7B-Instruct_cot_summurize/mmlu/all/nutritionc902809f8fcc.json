Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, normal serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin\n\nIn a person with both iron deficiency and a severe infection, we would expect:\n\n- Low hemoglobin: This is indicative of anemia which is often associated with iron deficiency.\n- Low ferritin: Ferritin is an iron storage protein, and its levels typically decrease in cases of iron deficiency.\n- Normal serum transferrin receptors ( (TFR): Transferrin receptors are the cellular receptors for transferrin-bound iron. In the early stages of iron deficiency, when the body is still trying to maintain iron homeostasis, TFR levels may remain normal or even increase as the body tries to absorb more iron from the diet.\n- High hepcidin: Hepcidin is a hormone that regulates iron metabolism. It increases in response to inflammation (as seen in severe infections), leading to decreased intestinal absorption of iron and increased iron sequestration.\n\nThus, option C best fits the scenario described."
