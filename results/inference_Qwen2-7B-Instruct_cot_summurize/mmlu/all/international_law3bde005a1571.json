This term is often used in international law to distinguish between actions taken by a state as a sovereign entity and those taken in a private capacity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity\n\nThis statement is not accurate as it suggests that acts jure gestionis are undertaken in a private capacity, which contradicts the nature of the term. The correct understanding is that these acts are undertaken in an official, sovereign capacity.\n\nThe precise definition might vary depending on the legal context, but generally, acts jure gestionis refer to official acts performed by states or their agents within the framework of their sovereign duties."
