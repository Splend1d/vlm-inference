The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?\nI. The amount the subjects were compensated.\nII. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.\nIII.

In this case, the independent variables are the compensation ($10 vs. $20), the time given to learn the facts (15 minutes vs. 30 minutes), and the location for recalling the facts (same room vs. unfamiliar setting). The dependent variable is what changes in response to these independent variables.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. The amount the subjects were compensated: This is not a dependent variable because it does not change based on the experimental manipulation; it's a condition set by the experimenter.\n\nII. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts: This is also not a dependent variable; it's another independent variable.\n\nIII. The number of facts the subjects can recall: This is a dependent variable because it is the outcome that is expected to change in response to the independent variables ( compensation, time, and location.\n\nIV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts: This is an independent variable, not a dependent variable.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. III only** because \"the number of facts the subjects can recall\" is the only dependent variable listed among the options provided."
