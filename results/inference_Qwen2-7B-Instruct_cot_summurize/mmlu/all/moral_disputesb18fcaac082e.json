When such conflicts arise, Ross argues that individuals must engage in moral reasoning and judgment to weigh the relative importance and urgency of the conflicting duties in order to decide which one(s) to prioritize in a given situation. This process involves considering the nature of each duty, the specific circumstances of the case, and potentially weighing the interests involved."
