                    "text": "The expected value (E[W] of the total weight of the four randomly selected NFL players is given as 992 pounds. Since each player's weight is an independent random variable with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 248 pounds and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 47 pounds, we can calculate the expected value and the standard deviation of the total weight of the four players using the properties of expectation and variance for sums of independent random variables.\n\n### Expected Value Calculation:\nThe expected value of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of their individual expected values. Therefore, if \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4\\) represent the weights of the four players, then:\n\n\\[E[W] = E[X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + E[X_3] + E[X_4]\\]\n\nGiven that each player's weight has an expected value of 248 pounds:\n\n\\[E[W] = 248 + 248 + 248 + 248 = 4 \\times 248 = 992\\]\n\nThis matches the given information.\n\n### Standard Deviation Calculation:\nThe variance of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of their individual variances. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Given that the standard deviation of each player's weight is 47 pounds, we have:\n\n\\[Var(X_i) = \\sigma^2 = 47^2\\]\n\nThe variance of the total weight \\(W\\) is:\n\n\\[Var(W) = Var(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4) = Var(X_1) + Var(X_2) + Var(X_3) + Var(X_4)\\]\n\n\\[Var(W) = 4 \\times Var(X_i) = 4 \\times 47^2\\]\n\n\\[Var(W) = 4 \\times 2209 = 8836\\]\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of \\(W\\), denoted as \\(\\sigma_W\\), is:\n\n\\[\\sigma_W = \\sqrt{Var(W)} = \\sqrt{8836} \\approx 94\\]\n\nThus, the standard deviation of the random variable \\(W\\), which represents the total combined weight of the four players, is approximately **94 pounds**. This corresponds to answer choice **C. 94 pounds**."
