Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves drinking four glasses of wine before driving to work, which is considered morally wrong because it involves operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, potentially endangering oneself and others on the road. This action violates laws and safety standards regarding drunk driving.\n\nScenario 2 involves throwing a loaf of bread at a bird with the intention of feeding it. While this might not be the most efficient or considerate way to feed a bird, it is not necessarily morally wrong. The action is misguided but does not involve any direct harm to another person or significant negative consequences for society."
