They often increase our awareness of risks that affect the entire planet, such as climate change, deforestation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. These issues transcend national borders and require international cooperation to address effectively.\n\nB. Many environmental movements appeal to universal values and human rights, emphasizing that protecting the environment is not just about preserving nature but also ensuring the well-being and survival of all living beings, including future generations. This appeal to common humanity and shared values helps in garnering support from diverse communities around the world.\n\nC. With the advent of modern communication technologies, these movements can leverage global media platforms to generate widespread awareness, mobilize public opinion, and influence policy decisions. Social media, in particular, has become a powerful tool for environmental activists to connect with supporters, share information, and coordinate actions across continents.\n\nThus, environmentalist social movements exhibit a global nature through their focus on planetary-scale issues, appeal to universal values, and strategic use of global media."
