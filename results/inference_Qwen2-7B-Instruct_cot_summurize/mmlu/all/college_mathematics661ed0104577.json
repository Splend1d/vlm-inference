So now, the first player has another chance to win, but this time, they must win on their second toss.\n\nSo the probability of the first player winning after both players have failed their first attempt is:\n\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\nThis pattern continues, where the first player wins on their third, fourth, fifth... tosses, which corresponds to the sequence of probabilities:\n\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\times \\frac{1}{2}, \\text{for } n = 1, 2, 3, ...\\]\n\nTherefore, the total probability of the first player winninging the game is the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + ... \\]\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term \\(a = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and common ratio \\(r = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\). The sum \\(S\\) of an infinite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\]\n\nPlugging in our values:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nSo the probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nThe correct answer is D. 2/3."
