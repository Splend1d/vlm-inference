The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Instead of opposing the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the action and filed a new action, alleging the same claims but also addressing the pleading defects outlined in the defendant's motion to dismiss. The defendant then moved to dismiss the second action, and the plaintiff again voluntarily dismissed the second action instead of filing opposition papers. The plaintiff then filed a third action, alleging the same claims but also including additional allegations that were responsive to the defendant's second motion. The defendant has moved to dismiss the third action; the plaintiff opposes the motion. Is the court likely to grant the defendant's motion?\n\nA. No, because the plaintiff has promptly and diligently attempted to address the pleading defects.\nB. No, because the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed each previous action before the defendant filed an answer or moved for summary judgment.\nC. Yes, because the plaintiff failed to seek a court order dismissing the second action.\nD. Yes, because the plaintiff's previously dismissed actions asserting the same claims dismissed actions asserting the same claims operate as an adjudication on the merits.\n"

Yes, because the plaintiff's previously dismissed actions asserting the same claims dismissed actions asserting the same claims operate as an adjudication on the merits.\n\nUnder the doctrine of collateral estoppel ( also known as issue preclusion, once a party has been conclusively determined by a final judgment in a prior proceeding, that party is barred from relitigating the same issue in a subsequent proceeding. In this case, since the plaintiff has previously dismissed two actions that asserted the same claims as the current one, the dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits for those claims. Therefore, the court would likely consider these dismissals as affirming that the plaintiff failed to state a claim, and it could grant the defendant's motion to dismiss the third action based on the principle of collateral estoppel."
