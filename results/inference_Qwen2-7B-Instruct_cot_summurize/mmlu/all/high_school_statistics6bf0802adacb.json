The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?\n\nA. This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.\nB. This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.\nC. This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.\nD. This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n"

This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n\nIn this scenario, the population (the school principals in the state) is first divided into subgroups or strata (in this case, the 125 school districts). Then, a random sample is drawn from each subgroup (district). Stratified sampling ensures that specific subgroups of the population are represented in the sample, which can provide more accurate and reliable results compared to a simple random sample if there are significant differences between the subgroups (districts). This method allows for a more detailed analysis within each subgroup, potentially offering comparative insights that might be lost in a simple random sample if the subgroup differences are not considered."
