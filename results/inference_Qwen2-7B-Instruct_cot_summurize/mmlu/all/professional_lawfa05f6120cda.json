The group was traversing a mountainous path when a mountain lion suddenly appeared. The defendant, who was carrying a loaded gun, knew that mountain lions and coyotes were in the area. The defendant saw that the mountain lion was about to attack one of the hikers. Although the defendant could have easily shot and killed it, he did nothing. The wild animal pounced on the hiker. As she was being savaged, the defendant and the other members of the group ran to safety.\nB. A defendant, a registered nurse, asked her friend out to lunch. While eating, the friend suddenly began choking on a chicken bone. The defendant did nothing to help her friend. The friend choked to death.\nC. A defendant, a physician, was walking home from his office one afternoon when he saw a car hit a man who was trying to cross the street. The victim was knocked to the ground and seriously injured, while the car sped away. The defendant, who could have saved the man's life if he had treated him, continued walking home without rendering assistance. The man died from loss of blood.\nD. A defendant took his four-year-old daughter out in the yard to play. As they were playing catch, the telephone began to ring. The defendant ran into the house to answer the phone. While he was inside, the daughter's ball rolled into the street. As she went to retrieve it, the daughter was struck and killed by a car.\n"

It can be charged in cases where there is criminal negligence, such as failing to provide reasonable care or assistance when it was clearly required.\n\nIn situation C, the physician (the defendant) had a duty to assist the injured man after witnessing the accident. By choosing not to render aid and continuing on his way, the physician failed to meet this legal obligation, which could be considered a breach of duty leading to manslaughter. \n\nIn contrast, situations A, B, and D involve different circumstances:\n\n- In A, the defendant chose not to shoot the mountain lion despite being having the ability to do so, which might lead to a discussion of recklessness but does not directly implicate the defendant in the victim's death due to the natural predatory behavior of the mountain lion.\n  \n- In B, the defendant, a nurse, did not intervene when her friend was choking, potentially resulting in manslaughter if the failure to act was deemed criminally negligent under the circumstances.\n  \n- In D, the defendant left his daughter unattended in a potentially dangerous situation, which could lead to discussions of criminal negligence or manslaughter, but the specific details regarding the defendant's actions and state of mind at the time of the incident would need to be considered for a proper determination."
