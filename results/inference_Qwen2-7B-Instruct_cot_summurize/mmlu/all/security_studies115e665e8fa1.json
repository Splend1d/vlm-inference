A more critical approach to military security studies will allow the inclusion or adoption of non-realist paradigms, such as social constructivism.\nB. Critical analysis of military security will draw attention back to traditional conceptions of the state-centric paradigm which have been neglected in recent years, with states favouring human security and other non-traditional approaches instead.\nC. By implementing a critical analysis we can recognise that traditional conceptions of military security are no longer always salient and may need to be reconsidered.\nD. A critical approach would recognise the changing ontology of security in the real world. Such changes are evident in the new ways in which war has been conducted in the 20th and 21st century.\n"

Instead, it reflects a potential shift in focus rather than a unique advantage of the critical approach itself. The other options all directly point to benefits of adopting a critical approach:\n\nA. It allows for the inclusion of non-realist paradigms, broadening the scope of inquiry beyond traditional realism.\n\nC. It enables recognition of the evolving nature of security concerns and challenges the status quo, encouraging reevaluation of established paradigms.\n\nD. It acknowledges the changing nature of security threats and how these changes impact military strategies and considerations."
