In 2000, the railroad decided to discontinue operating its trains over the strip conveyed in 1955. By 2004, the growth of a nearby town had made the 300-acre cattle ranch valuable as a potential site for homes or for an industrial park. However, as of January 1, 2005, the governing body of the county (in which the ranch sits) took appropriate action, in accordance with Texas statutes, to zone the 300-acre cattle ranch as single-family residential property with a minimum lot size of one acre. The ordinance provided that the exclusion of ranching operations and industrial development was necessary to protect the health of county residents by limiting the extent of waste disposal and preventing pollution of air and the nearby river, the county's major water supply. The state's power authority has now taken appropriate action to condemn half of the 300-acre cattle ranch, which will be flooded as a result of construction of a dam for a proposed hydroelectric facility. The 150 acres taken includes the 20-acre strip described in the deed to the railroad. Is the railroad entitled to any compensation from the state's power authority?\n\nA. Yes, because if all the leased land is condemned for the full balance of the lease term, the lessee is entitled to compensation for the taking of the leasehold estate.\nB. Yes, because the holder of an easement benefit is entitled to compensation for the value lost.\nC. No, because by discontinuing its operation of trains, the railroad's determinable, feeterminated.\nD. No, because the holder of an easement is not entitled to compensation when the servient tenement is extinguished by condemnation.\n"

No, because by discontinuing its operation of trains, the railroad's determinable fee terminated.\n\nExplanation:\nAn easement is a right to use someone else's property for a specific purpose. In this case, the railroad holds an easement to use a 20-acre strip on the ranch for railroad purposes. This easement is described as a \"determinable fee,\" which means it can terminate under certain conditions, such as when the purpose for which the easement was granted no longer exists.\n\nWhen the railroad decided to discontinue operating its trains over the strip, it essentially ended the purpose for which the easement was granted. As a result, the easement terminated. Since the easement has ended, there is no longer a legal obligation for the state's power authority to provide compensation to the railroad for the 20-acre strip when it is taken through condemnation for the hydroelectric facility. Therefore, the railroad is not entitled to any compensation from the state's power authority in this scenario."
