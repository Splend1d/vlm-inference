As a result, the father always lived in fear. One night, the father heard his son on the front stoop making loud obscene remarks. The father was certain that his son was drunk and was terrified that he would be physically beaten again. In his fear, he bolted the front door and took out a revolver. When the son discovered that the door was bolted, he kicked it down. As the son burst through the front door, his father shot him four times in the chest, killing him. In fact, the son was not under the influence of alcohol or any drug and did not intend to harm his father. At trial, the father presented the above facts and asked the judge to instruct the jury on self-defense. How should the judge instruct the jury with respect to self-defense?\n\nA. Give the self-defense instruction, because it expresses the defense\u00d5s theory of the case.\nB. Give the self-defense instruction, because the evi-dence is sufficient to raise the defense.\nC. Deny the self-defense instruction, because the father was not in imminent danger from his son.\nD. Deny the self-defense instruction, because the father used excessive force.\n"

Give the self-defense instruction, because the evidence is sufficient to raise the defense.\n\nIn a criminal trial, the judge's role is to instruct the jury on the applicable law based on the evidence presented at trial. If the evidence is sufficient to raise the defense of self-defense, the judge should give the instruction related to self-defense. In this case, the father's testimony and the circumstances described ( such as the son's violent behavior in the past and the father's fear for his life when he heard his son making loud obscene remarks while the door was bolted, provide enough evidence to support the defense of self-defense. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the jury would ultimately decide whether the father acted reasonably in using deadly force based on the totality of the circumstances. The self-defense instruction should only be given if the evidence supports the possibility of a self-defense claim. The judge cannot direct the jury's verdict but can guide them on how to apply the law to the facts they find credible."
