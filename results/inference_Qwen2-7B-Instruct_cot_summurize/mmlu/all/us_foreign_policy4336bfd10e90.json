Increased spending during wars, with demobilization bringing spending down but not back to prewar levels.\n\nThe U.S. defense spending has historically shown a pattern of significant increases during times of war or heightened national security threats. For example, spending surged dramatically during World War II and the Korean War. After these conflicts, spending did decrease but often did not return to the levels seen before the conflict. This is because post-war periods can involve substantial military reforms, technology upgrades, and strategic planning that require funding, even if direct combat operations have ceased.\n\nDuring peacetime, defense spending may fluctuate based on geopolitical tensions, technological advancements, and strategic priorities. There have been periods where defense spending has been relatively stable or decreased, particularly when there was no direct threat requiring massive mobilization.\n\nIn recent decades, the U.S. has maintained a relatively high level of defense spending, influenced by global events such as the Cold War, the War on Terror, and ongoing concerns about regional security, which have led to sustained or increased military budgets."
