This behavior endangers not only the pedestrian but also other drivers and could result in severe harm or death.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the action of noticing a small hole in a military submarine's interior and running to inform one's superior is not morally wrong. In fact, this action is expected to ensure the safety of the crew and the mission. Using a temporary fix like a band aid might not be ideal, but the primary concern should be to report the issue immediately and address it appropriately, rather than attempting an immediate and potentially dangerous repair.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Scenario 1 is wrong, while Scenario 2 is not wrong."
