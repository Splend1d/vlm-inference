However, studies have also shown that there might be an optimal number of bystanders that could encourage more people to help. \n\nIn general, the answer that is often cited from research is:\n\nC. three\n\nWhen there are are three bystanders present during an emergency situation, it's thought that this number can facilitate helping behavior because each person is less likely to assume that someone else will take action. This is based on the diffusion of responsibility theory, which suggests that the more people involved in a situation, the less responsible any single individual feels to act.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these findings are based on averages and can vary depending on specific context, urgency, and other factors. The best course of action is always to directly assist or call for help if you witness an emergency, regardless of the number of bystanders."
