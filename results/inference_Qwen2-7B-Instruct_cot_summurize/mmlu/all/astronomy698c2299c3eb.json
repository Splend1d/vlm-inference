This means that the Moon rotates on its axis in exactly the same time it takes to complete one orbit around the Earth. As a result, the same side of the Moon always faces us. This is also why we don't see any variation in the amount of sunlight hitting the visible face of the Moon, which results in the phases of the Moon that we observe."
