Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character engineered a bridge to withstand a hurricane, which is an action that promotes safety and well-being, and therefore, it is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is cheering during a game. This action is typically seen as supportive and positive behavior, not morally wrong unless there is some context suggesting otherwise, such as cheating or unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
