The stages progress from understanding basic concepts about oneself (gender identity) to more complex understandings involving societal roles and expectations. However, it's important to note that Kohlberg primarily focused on moral development rather than gender development. Gender development is typically discussed within theories by psychologists like LeVine or Chodorow, among others."
