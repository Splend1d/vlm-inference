The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.\nOf Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone\u2014it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\n*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.\nWhich of the following best describes the origins of epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh?\n\nA.

The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems\n\nEpic poetry, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, often emerged during periods when societies developed systems of writing and literacy. This allowed stories, myths, and heroic tales to be recorded and passed down through generations. In the case of the Epic of Gilgamesh, it was likely composed and preserved by a literate class, such as scribes, who worked in ancient Mesopotamian cities. These individuals would have been responsible for documenting various aspects of society, including religious beliefs, legal codes, and heroic deeds, which often formed the basis of epic narratives."
