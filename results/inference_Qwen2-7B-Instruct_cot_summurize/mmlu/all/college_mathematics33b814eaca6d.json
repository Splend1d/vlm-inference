                    "text": "To find the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 randomly selected suitcases are damaged, we can use combinations to calculate this.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to select 3 suitcases out of 25. This can be done using the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to select any 3 suitcases out of 25 is:\n\\[C(25, 3) = \\frac{25!}{3!(25-3)!} = \\frac{25!}{3!22!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 25 \\times 8 \\times 23 = 25 \\times 184 = 4600\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways to select exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of the 5 damaged ones and 1 non-damaged suitcase out of the 20 non-damaged ones. This can also be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nNumber of ways to select 2 damaged out of 5: \\(C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\\)\n\nNumber of ways to select 1 non-damaged out of 20: \\(C(20, 1) = \\frac{20!}{1!(20-1)!} = 20\\)\n\nSo, the number of ways to select exactly 2 damaged and 1 non-damaged suitcase is the product of these two combinations: \\(10 \\times 20 = 200\\).\n\nFinally, the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 selected suitcases are damaged is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (to selecting exactly 2 damaged and 1 non-damaged suitcase) to the total number of outcomes (to selecting any 3 suitcases):\n\n\\[P(\\text{exactly 2 damaged}) = \\frac{200}{4600} = \\frac{1}{23}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among your options A, B, C, D. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or error in the provided choices. The correct probability is \\(\\frac{1}{23}\\)."
