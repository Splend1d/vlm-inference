Therapist self-disclosure can be a tool for this by helping to create a more equal and collaborative therapeutic relationship. By sharing personal experiences, therapists can model vulnerability, authenticity, and mutual respect, which can help clients feel more comfortable sharing their own thoughts and feelings. This approach contrasts with more traditional forms of therapy that might rely on a therapist maintaining a strictly professional distance."
