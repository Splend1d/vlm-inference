The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the racetrack was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. After the racetrack was built and in operation for two years, the state legislature passed a bill requiring the racetrack to admit all senior citizens over the age of 65 for the discounted admission fee of 50 cents. This law is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\nB. unconstitutional, because it denies citizens under the age of 65 the equal protection of the law.\nC. unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\nD. unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\n\nWhen the state issued bonds to finance the construction of the racetrack, it entered into a contractual agreement with the bondholders. As part of this agreement, the state committed to using a portion of the racetrack's revenue ( specifically, at least $2 from each admission charge during the first five years and potentially $1 from each admission charge for the following five years if necessary to repay the bond debt. The passage of the law requiring the racetrack to offer discounted admission fees to senior citizens could reduce the amount of revenue available to pay back the bondholders, thus impairing the terms of the original contract.\n\nWhile the other options may have merit in different contexts, they do not directly address the specific issue raised by the question:\n\n- A. Constitutional: This option is incorrect because the question focuses on the impact of the new law on the bond contract rather than the general police power of the state.\n- B. Unconstitutional: While the argument about denying equal protection might apply if the law disproportionately affects a certain group, the question specifically addresses the contract between the state and the bondholders, making this option less relevant to the immediate concern.\n- D. Unconstitutional: An ex post facto law typically refers to a law that retroactively changes the punishment for a crime, which does not seem to be the case here, as the law in question affects future actions (admission prices) rather than past crimes or actions.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer based on the information provided is C, as it directly addresses the potential impairment of the bond contract due to the change in revenue-generating practices."
