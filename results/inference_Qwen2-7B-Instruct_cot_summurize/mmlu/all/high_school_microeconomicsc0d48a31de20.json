Provide more complete information about the relevant goods.\n\nBy providing clear and comprehensive information about the benefits and importance of a particular good or service, the government can help educate the public on why it's important to contribute to its funding. This increased understanding can motivate individuals to voluntarily contribute their fair share, rather than relying solely on others to pay for the benefit they receive.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this approach alone may not completely solve the free rider problem. Other methods such as taxation (option C, which involves funding public goods through general taxation, can also be effective. For example, when the government directly funds a public good like national defense, it ensures that all citizens contribute their fair share, regardless of whether they have access to the information about its importance.\n\nOptions A and D address different issues. A) Enacting stricter antitrust legislation targets market failures caused by monopolies or unfair competition, while D) taxing those creating negative externalities addresses the problem of individuals or companies imposing costs on society without compensating for them. Neither of these options specifically targets the free rider problem."
