                    "text": "Countermeasures, as a concept in international law, are actions taken by a state in response to what it perceives as a wrong committed by another state. These actions aim to compensate for the injury caused by the wrongful act. However, countermeasures can be illegal under certain circumstances:\n\nA. Countermeasures are illegal when inter alia are disproportionate or in violation of a peremptory norm of international law \u2013 such as the use of force or human rights. This is based on the principle that countermeasures must be reasonable and necessary to address the wrong. They cannot exacerbate the situation or violate fundamental principles of international law.\n\nB. Countermeasures are illegal when they are taken in the course of an armed conflict. During armed conflicts, the rules of international humanitarian law (also known as the laws of war) often limit the types of countermeasures that states can take. For example, the use of weapons or tactics that may cause excessive harm to civilians or civilian objects is prohibited.\n\nC. Countermeasures are illegal when they violate bilateral treaties. If a countermeasure goes against the terms of a treaty that both states have signed, it would be considered illegal. Bilateral treaties establish specific obligations between the parties, and any action that breaches these obligations would violate international law.\n\nD. Countermeasures are illegal when the responsible State does not consent to them. Consent from the state against which countermeasures are directed is generally required for the countermeasures to be lawful. Without this consent, the countermeasures could be seen as an unlawful use of force or an infringement of sovereignty.\n\nIn summary, countermeasures are illegal when they are disproportionate, violate peremptory norms of international law, are taken during an armed conflict in ways that contravene the laws of war, or when they violate bilateral treaties or go against the consent of the affected state."
