The sudden demise of the dinosaurs, and various other groups, by the impact of a large extraterrestrial body with Earth\n\nCatastrophism is a theory in geology that suggests that the Earth's surface has been shaped by a series of sudden, brief, and large-scale natural events, such as meteorite impacts or volcanic eruptions. This contrasts with uniformitarianism, which holds that geological processes have occurred slowly over long periods of time. Option D aligns with this theory because it describes a rapid and catastrophic event leading to significant changes in the Earth's biodiversity."
