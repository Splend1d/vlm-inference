They are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.\n\nThe Solar Nebular Theory describes how the solar system formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust called a solar nebula. According to this theory, asteroids and comets are remnants from the early stages of our solar system's formation. These objects, known as planetesimals, were too small to grow into full-fledged planets but have survived in the outer reaches of the solar system where conditions were less conducive to their growth. Asteroids typically reside in the inner asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, while comets usually orbit far beyond Neptune, often coming close to the Sun at times."
