When a tenant sublets the property to another party (in this case, the cousin, the original lease agreement between the landlord and the first tenant remains in effect. The landlord does not have a direct legal relationship with the subtenant (the cousin), meaning that the landlord cannot directly enforce the terms of the lease against the cousin. Therefore, the landlord would not be able to recover past due rent from the cousin under the principle of privity of estate.\n\nHowever, the landlord may still have rights under the original lease agreement with the initial tenant, who has now defaulted on the payments. The landlord could potentially sue the initial tenant for the unpaid rent."
