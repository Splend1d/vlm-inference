However, this should only happen when it's not clinically contraindicated (meaning it won't negatively impact the therapy process or the therapeutic relationship. It also must not be exploitative, which means one party cannot take advantage of the other in terms of power dynamics or resources. The specifics may vary by jurisdiction and professional guidelines, but generally, bartering should be carefully considered and ethically managed."
