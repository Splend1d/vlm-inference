                    "text": "B. contractionary monetary policy.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a central bank implements contractionary monetary policy, it typically involves raising interest rates or reducing the money supply in the economy. This makes borrowing more expensive and can lead to reduced spending and investment. In the context of Treasury bonds, higher interest rates make newly issued government debt more attractive to investors due to the higher yields they offer compared to existing bonds with lower coupon rates. As a result, demand for existing Treasury bonds decreases, leading to their prices falling (or \"selling off\") on the secondary market.\n\nThe other options are not as directly linked to falling Treasury bond prices:\n\nA. Expansionary monetary policy tends to decrease interest rates, making existing bonds less attractive relative to new issues, which could lead to selling pressure on existing bonds but would likely increase their prices rather than decrease them.\n\nC. A depreciating dollar can have various effects on Treasury bond prices depending on the global economic conditions. If the U.S. economy is seen as relatively stronger compared to others, a depreciating dollar might lead to capital inflows, increasing demand for U.S. assets like Treasury bonds, potentially raising their prices.\n\nD. Fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit, if it includes increased government spending, might stimulate the economy and lead to higher inflation expectations, which could push up interest rates and thus decrease the value of existing Treasury bonds. However, this outcome is contingent upon how the fiscal policy is implemented and the overall economic response."
