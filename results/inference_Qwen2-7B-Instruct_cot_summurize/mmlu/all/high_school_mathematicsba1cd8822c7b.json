However, since $x < y$, we must choose the pair where $x$ is the smaller number. This means our pair is $(x, y) = (1, 56$.\n\nWe're also given that $7 \\times \\frac{1}{x} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{y} = 4$.\n\nSubstituting the values of $x$ and $y$ into this equation:\n\n\\[7 \\times \\frac{1}{1} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{56} = 7 + \\frac{14}{56} = 7 + \\frac{1}{4} = 7.25\\]\n\nThis does not match the given condition that the expression equals $4$. \n\nLet's check the other possible pair $(x, y) = (4, 14$:\n\n\\[7 \\times \\frac{1}{4} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{14} = \\frac{7}{4} + 1 = 1.75 + 1 = 2.75\\]\n\nThis also doesn't match the given condition.\n\nThe error in our initial approach was in directly substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ without considering the condition given in the problem. The correct approach should involve setting up the equation based on the condition given:\n\n\\[7 \\times \\frac{1}{x} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{y} = 4\\]\n\nSince $x < y$ and their product is $56$, let's correctly apply the condition to find $x$:\n\nGiven $xy = 56$, and knowing $x$ and $y$ are factors of $56$, we can express the equation as:\n\n\\[7/x + 14/y = 4\\]\n\nGiven $x$ and $y$ are factors of $56$ and $x < y$, we substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 14$ into the equation:\n\n\\[7/4 + 14/14 = 1.75 + 1 = 2.75\\]\n\nThis does not match the given condition, indicating an oversight in directly substituting values without verifying they satisfy the original equation. \n\nTo solve it correctly, let's approach it differently:\n\nGiven:\n\\[7 \\times \\frac{1}{x} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{y} = 4\\]\n\nSince $xy = 56$, and we need to find a combination where $x < y$ and satisfies the equation. We know that $x$ and $y$ must be factors of $56$. The factors of $55$ are $1, 2, 4, 14, 28, 56$. Given $x < y$, the only valid pair from these factors is $x=4$ and $y=14$ because these numbers satisfy both conditions: they are factors of $55$ and $x < y$.\n\nSubstituting $x=4$ and $y=14$ into the given equation:\n\n\\[7 \\times \\frac{1}{4} + 14 \\times \\frac{1}{14} = \\frac{7}{4} + 1 = 1.75 + 1 = 2.75\\]\n\nThis calculation shows an incorrect interpretation of the final step due to a misunderstanding in the application of the condition. The correct approach should verify the solution fits the original condition accurately.\n\nGiven the clarification and reevaluation, the correct interpretation should focus on identifying the pair $(x, y)$ that satisfies both $xy = 56$ and the given equation without direct calculation errors. Given the options provided and the context:\n\n- Option A (13 cannot be correct since it would imply $x=13$ and $y=\\frac{56}{13}$, which does not meet the criteria for positive integers with a product of 56.\n- Option B 14 suggests $x=14$ and $y=\\frac{56}{14}=4$, which aligns with the factor pairs but still needs verification against the given equation.\n- Option C 1 1 suggests $x=1$ and $y=\\frac{56}{1}$, which is impossible given the constraints.\n- Option D 2 suggests $x=2$ and $y=\\frac{56}{2}=28$, which again does not meet the criteria for distinct factors.\n\nGiven the direct calculation errors in"
