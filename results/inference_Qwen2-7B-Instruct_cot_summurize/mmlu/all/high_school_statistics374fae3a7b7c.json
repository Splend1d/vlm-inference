Concerned about nonresponse bias, the researcher picks another simple random sample and instructs the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50 homes. The average number of children is determined to be 1.73. Is this estimate probably too low or too high?\n\nA. Too low, because of undercoverage bias.\nB.

Too low, because of undercoverage bias.\n\nUndercoverage bias occurs when some members of the population are inadequately represented in the sample. In this scenario, the initial random sample of 50 homes was unable to make contact with anyone in 8 of them. This means that the homes where no contact could be made (potentially due to various reasons such as being unoccupied, occupied by people not willing to participate, or difficult to reach ( were not included in the final analysis. \n\nThese potentially missing homes might have different characteristics from those that were successfully contacted and included in the final sample. For example, they might have more children living in them compared to the homes that were contacted. Therefore, the average number of children calculated from the sample would likely underestimate the true average number of children living in all single-family homes due to the exclusion of homes with potentially higher child counts. Hence, the estimate is probably too low."
