This tension is a central concern in discussions around global ethics, particularly in the context of international aid, development policies, and humanitarian interventions.\n\nAshford might argue for a more nuanced approach that seeks to balance these two crucial aspects of moral action, suggesting strategies that not only provide relief in the short term but also work towards dismantling the underlying structures that cause ongoing harm. The piece could explore how understanding the interconnectedness of individual and systemic issues can inform more effective interventions and inspire a more holistic approach to addressing global challenges."
