This is done through the commutator's ability to reverse the direction of current flow in the armature windings at the appropriate time as the magnetic field changes direction. This allows the current to be continuously supplied in one direction, thus creating DC output.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. convert AC armature current in to DC"
