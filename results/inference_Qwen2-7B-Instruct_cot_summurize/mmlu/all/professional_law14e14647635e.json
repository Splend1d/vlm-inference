A congressional report revealed that in the certain parts of the country, only 42% of minorities eligible to vote were, in fact, registered. The report also indicated that certain states had residency laws restricting a person's right to vote. As a consequence, Congress enacted a statute that makes any law denying minorities the right to vote shall be deemed unconstitutional. This federal statute will most likely be upheld under which of the following constitutional provisions?\n\nA. Thirteenth Amendment.\nB. Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. Fifteenth Amendment.\nD. Twentieth Amendment.\n"
