By including a separate paragraph in the accountant's report that discloses this departure and its effect on the financial statements, the accountant is providing transparency and informing users of the financial statements about the non-compliance with GAAP. This disclosure allows users to understand the impact of the departure on the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows presented in the financial statements.\n\nOption A ( Issuing an adverse or qualified opinion is not appropriate in this case because the accountant is engaged in a compilation service, not an audit or review. Compilations do not involve the same level of assurance as audits or reviews, and the accountant does not express an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements.\n\nOption B, adding a restriction on distribution, is not the correct course of action because it does not address the issue of non-compliance with GAAP. This type of restriction might be relevant for other purposes, such as confidentiality, but it does not resolve the accounting principle issue.\n\nOption D, explaining the purpose of recording assets at historical cost, is not sufficient because it does not address the specific issue of the departure from GAAP and its effect on the financial statements. The accountant needs to disclose the discrepancy and its consequences rather than merely explain the standard practice."
