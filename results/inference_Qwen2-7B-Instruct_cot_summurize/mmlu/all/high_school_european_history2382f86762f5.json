And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him.

The sudden influx of gold into the region, coupled with the high demand for goods and services, could cause prices to rise rapidly. This is a common historical phenomenon following the discovery of precious metals in new territories, as seen in other instances such as the Spanish colonization of the Americas or the Portuguese discovery of silver in Brazil.\n\nDecentralized political states, strengthened agricultural sectors, and less tolerance for certain religious groups are not directly implied by the consequences of Cort\u00e9s's actions based on the information provided in the memoir. The focus of the passage is on the distribution of wealth and the treatment of indigenous people, rather than broader economic or political impacts."
