This activity is generally not considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is allowing their kids to have ice cream for every meal. This could be seen as morally wrong if it leads to unhealthy eating habits or nutritional deficiencies for the children, especially if it becomes a consistent and perhaps excessive practice that ignores the importance of a balanced diet. However, it's important to note that this scenario might also depend on cultural norms and personal beliefs about dietary practices, which can vary widely. In many contexts, providing children with treats occasionally is not necessarily viewed as morally wrong. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and assuming a general understanding of moral standards, the answer would be C: Not wrong, Wrong."
