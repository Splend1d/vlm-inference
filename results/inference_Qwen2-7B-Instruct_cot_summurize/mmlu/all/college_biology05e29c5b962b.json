Genes are exchanged with other populations. \n\nExplanation: The Hardy-Weinberg law assumes that a population is not exchanging genes with other populations ( meaning there is no gene flow or migration. Therefore, option A is the exception among the choices provided. The other options ( B ( large population size, C natural selection does not occur, and D matings are random - are all conditions that must be met for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to hold true in a population."
