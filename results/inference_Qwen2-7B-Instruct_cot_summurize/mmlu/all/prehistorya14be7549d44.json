The presence of stone tools with cut marks on the bones indicates that Neandertals were the cause of the animals' deaths. The absence of teeth marks suggests that the animals did not die from predation by other species after being killed by Neandertals. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while Neandertal canine teeth show wear indicative of a diet rich in meat, this does not necessarily mean they relied solely on hunting. They could have also scavenged meat from carcasses left by other predators or obtained food through scavenging, fishing, or gathering.\n\nOption C is incorrect because finding bones of large animals in caves could be due to a variety of reasons, including natural causes (like cave-in burying the remains or animals seeking shelter in caves, which would not necessarily indicate hunting behavior. However, when combined with option B, it provides additional circumstantial evidence that supports Neandertal hunting activities."
