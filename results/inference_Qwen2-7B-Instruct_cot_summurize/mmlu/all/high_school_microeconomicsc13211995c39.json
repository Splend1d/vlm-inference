Quantity demanded of pears falls.\n\nWhen the price of pears increases, according to the law of demand, the quantity demanded for pears will fall as consumers will buy less of it due to its higher cost. \n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they suggest an increase in the quantity demanded or a decrease in demand itself, which contradicts the law of demand. \n\nOption B is not directly about the quantity supplied but rather reflects the law of supply, which states that as prices rise, the quantity supplied by producers increases, not decreases."
