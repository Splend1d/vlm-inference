                    "text": "Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs contracts for the sale of goods in many jurisdictions, the formation of a contract occurs when there is a meeting of minds between the parties involved. This typically happens when an offer is made and unambiguously accepted.\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- Day 1: Jackson offers to sell 500 electric fans at $10 each.\n- Day 3: Sands receives the offer. Since the offer did not specify an expiration date, under the UCC, it is generally considered to remain open for a reasonable time. However, it's important to note that if Sands acts promptly, it could treat the offer as accepted even without a specified expiration date.\n- Day 4: Jackson sends a revocation of the offer. If this revocation reaches Sands before Sands accepts the offer, it would prevent the contract from forming because the offer would no longer be available for acceptance.\n- Day 6: Sands receives the revocation. This is crucial because it determines whether the offer could still be accepted or if it has been revoked.\n- Day 7: Sands sends an acceptance of the offer. If the revocation was received before this point, then the acceptance would not form a contract.\n- Day 9: Jackson receives the acceptance. If the revocation reached Sands before they sent their acceptance, then Jackson would not be bound by the offer, and no contract would have formed.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because the offer does not necessarily fail to state an expiration date. It could be considered open for a reasonable time.\n- **Option B** seems to suggest that a contract cannot form if the revocation is received before the acceptance. This is correct if the revocation reached Sands before they accepted the offer.\n- **Option C** suggests that a contract was formed on the day Jackson received Sands\u2019 acceptance. This would only be true if the revocation never reached Sands before they accepted the offer.\n- **Option D** correctly identifies that a contract was formed on the day Sands mailed the acceptance to Jackson, assuming the revocation did not reach Sands before their acceptance was sent.\n\nAssuming the revocation did not reach Sands before their acceptance was sent, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. A contract was formed on the day Sands mailed the acceptance to Jackson.**"
