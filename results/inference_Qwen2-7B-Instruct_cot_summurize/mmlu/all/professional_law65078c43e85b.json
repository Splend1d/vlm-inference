Her friends warned her against wearing such valuable jewelry because they feared she would be an easy target for muggers. In order to persuade the woman not to wear her expensive jewelry in the park, her friend decided to play a practical joke. One morning, the friend dressed like a man and hid in an area of the park that she knew the woman customarily walked through. As the woman was strolling through the park with her dog that morning, the friend jumped out from behind the bush brandishing a toy pistol and grabbed the woman's diamond necklace from her neck. Startled, the woman became hysterical and began to plead for her life. The friend then removed her male garb, handed the necklace back to the woman and said, \"I just wanted to frighten you to teach you a lesson. \"If the friend is subsequently prosecuted, she should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Battery.\nB. Assault.\nC. Robbery.\nD. No crime.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Assault.\n\nAssault is a criminal offense that involves intentionally causing someone to fear imminent harmful or offensive contact. In this scenario, the friend frightened the woman by pretending to threaten her with a toy gun, causing the woman to become hysterical and plead for her life. This action meets the legal criteria for assault, as it created a reasonable fear of immediate harm in the victim.\n\nBattery is an unlawful physical contact, but there was no actual physical harm done to the woman in this case. Robbery typically involves the use of force or fear to take property directly from someone, but the friend did not take anything during the incident. Therefore, the friend should be found guilty of assault, but not battery or robbery."
