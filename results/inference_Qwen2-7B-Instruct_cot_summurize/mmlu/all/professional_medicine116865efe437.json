The presence of eosinophils in the blood suggests an allergic or parasitic etiology. The most likely test to yield an accurate diagnosis based on these symptoms would be:\n\nD. Microscopic examination of the stool\n\nThis test is particularly useful for detecting the presence of parasitic eggs or cysts that may not be visible to the naked eye in stool samples. It can help identify specific types of parasites that cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as those described.\n\nWhile a blood smear (A could potentially show parasites or their components, it's not typically used as the first line of testing for gastrointestinal parasites due to its limited sensitivity compared to stool analysis.\n\nA bone marrow biopsy (B is usually reserved for conditions affecting hematopoietic cells and is unlikely to be necessary in this case.\n\nA KOH preparation (C involves treating the sample with potassium hydroxide to dissolve non-parasitic material, making it easier to visualize parasites. While it can be useful for some fungal infections, it is less commonly used for diagnosing parasitic infections compared to direct microscopic examination of stool."
