As children develop and become more proficient in their native language, they may find it increasingly difficult to distinguish between sounds that are not present in their native language. This is due to the fact that their brains have become more specialized for processing the sounds in their native language, making it harder to perceive and process foreign sounds.\n\nThe other options are either incorrect or do not capture the essence of the changes occurring in children's language learning during this period:\n\nB. Children do become sensitive to rhythms in speech patterns as they grow, but this is not a change specifically to the latter part of their first year; rather, it's part of their ongoing development.\n\nC. The systematic progression determined by selective reinforcement of babbling is actually a process that happens earlier in infancy, particularly during the babbling stage, which typically occurs around 6 months of age.\n\nD. Children generally do not begin producing more language than they can comprehend at any point in their first year. In fact, during this time, their understanding of language far outpaces their ability to produce new words and sentences."
