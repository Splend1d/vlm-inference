The mean and standard deviation from 35 observations turned out to be approximately the same as those from 15 observations. Is there any advantage in using 35 observations instead of 15 observations?\n\nA. There is no advantage.

Because the mean and the standard deviation are about the same, the confidence interval computed using 35 observations should be approximately the same as that computed using 15 observations.\n\nThe reason for this is rooted in statistical theory, specifically the Central Limit Theorem ( which states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution. This theorem implies that larger samples tend to provide more precise estimates of the population parameters, such as the mean.\n\nHowever, when comparing two sample sizes with the same mean and standard deviation, the precision of the confidence interval is not solely determined by the sample size but also by the variability within the samples and the level of confidence desired. The width of the confidence interval is typically calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = \\bar{x} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean,\n- \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired level of confidence,\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the sample, and\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nSince both the mean and the standard deviation are the same for the two sample sizes, increasing the sample size from 15 to 35 would indeed make the standard error (\\(\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}\\)) smaller, potentially leading to a narrower confidence interval. However, in the scenario described where the mean and standard deviation are \"approximately the same,\" it suggests that the additional observations did not significantly change these measures. Therefore, under the condition that the mean and standard deviation remain unchanged, the confidence intervals based on both sample sizes would indeed be approximately the same, making option A the correct choice.\n\nOptions B and C suggest that taking more observations would increase the likelihood of error or make the confidence interval wider, which contradicts the principles of statistical inference. Option D incorrectly assumes that the confidence interval would necessarily be narrower due to the larger sample size, without considering that the means and standard deviations were not affected by the increased sample size."
