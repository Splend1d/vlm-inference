                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The block, because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, but the sphere does.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhen the sphere rolls down the inclined plane, it experiences both translational and rotational motion. The sphere gains rotational kinetic energy in addition to its translational kinetic energy. This means that as the sphere rolls, some of its potential energy is converted into rotational kinetic energy. Since the total mechanical energy ( (which includes both translational and rotational kinetic energy) is conserved in the absence of non-conservative forces ( like friction, the sphere will have less potential energy to convert into translational kinetic energy compared to if it were sliding without rolling.\n\nOn the other hand, the block slides down the plane without friction. Since there is no friction, there is no force acting to convert translational kinetic energy into rotational kinetic energy. Therefore, all the potential energy is converted into translational kinetic energy as it descends. As a result, the block will reach the bottom of the ramp with more kinetic energy than the sphere, making it reach the bottom first.\n\nOptions A, B, and C either incorrectly state that one object gains mechanical energy or loses mechanical energy in a way that doesn't align with the physics principles involved. Option A incorrectly suggests that the sphere gains rotational kinetic energy while the block does not, ignoring the fact that both objects experience a change in kinetic energy due to their descent. Option B conflates the concepts of torque and rotational kinetic energy with the energy conversion process, which is not directly relevant to the comparison between the two objects' speeds. Option C inaccurately implies that the block does not lose mechanical energy, overlooking the fact that it converts all its potential energy into kinetic energy, whereas the sphere has additional rotational kinetic energy."
