The man said out loud, \"Oh God, look what that truck driver did. The man driving that truck was racing and going about 100 mph.! Someone call 911!!\" A woman, who was sitting on the beach nearby, but facing the other way, heard the man's outcry. When the case comes to trial, will the court allow both the man and the woman to testify about the man's utterances?\n\nA. Yes, both the woman and the man can testify because it is an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule that goes to the material issue of the case.\nB. Yes, because this is not hearsay and it is not being entered for the truth of the statement by either witness so that they can both testify.\nC. No, neither of them can testify because the man was impaired due to being too relaxed from his meditation, and the woman cannot repeat the utterances of an impaired witness.\nD. No, neither can testify because the utterances do not fit any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n"

Yes, both the woman and the man can testify because it is an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule that goes to the material issue of the case.\n\nExplanation: In legal terms, an excited utterance is an exception to the hearsay rule. It refers to statements made under the stress or excitement caused by an event or condition. These statements are often spontaneous and made without time for reflection, making them more reliable than typical hearsay statements. If the man's outcry was genuine and immediate in response to the traumatic event he witnessed, it could qualify as an excited utterance, allowing him to testify about what he observed. Similarly, if the woman, despite facing away, heard the man's outcry and understood its urgency, she might also be allowed to testify about what she heard, assuming her testimony meets other relevant criteria ( such as clarity, coherence, and reliability. Both witnesses' statements would likely be admissible because they pertain directly to the material issue of the case, which involves the incident itself and the potential criminal actions of the truck driver."
