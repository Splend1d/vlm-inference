                    "text": "The ratio of the equilibrium polarizations for an electron (pe) and a proton (pH can be calculated using their gyromagnetic ratios. The gyromagnetic ratio, \u03b3, describes how much a particle's magnetic moment is affected by an external magnetic field. For an electron, \u03b3e is approximately 1.761 x 10^11 T^-1 s^-1, and for a proton, \u03b3p is about 2.755 x 10^10 T^-1 s^-1.\n\nGiven these values, the ratio of the equilibrium polarizations is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{pe}{pH} = \\frac{\\gamma_e}{\\gamma_p} \\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{pe}{pH} = \\frac{1.761 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{T}^{-1} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}}{2.755 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\text{T}^{-1} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{pe}{pH} = 6.41 \\times 10 \\]\n\nThis result isn't directly listed among your options, but it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the question or the provided answer choices. Based on standard physics knowledge, the calculation would lead to a value close to 64.1, not matching any of the provided options exactly. Given the closest option to our calculation would be:\n\nC. 658\n\nIt seems there could have been a misunderstanding in the question or the provided choices. The correct interpretation should align more closely with standard values for gyromagnetic ratios and the calculation process described."
