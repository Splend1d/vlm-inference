By applying this correction, you can estimate what the correlation would be if there were no measurement error and the full range of values was observed for each variable.\n\nWhile option A is related to the concept of predictive validity, it does not specifically describe the function of correcting for attenuation. Options B and C also refer to aspects of psychometrics but do not accurately capture the primary purpose of the correction for attenuation as described in the question."
