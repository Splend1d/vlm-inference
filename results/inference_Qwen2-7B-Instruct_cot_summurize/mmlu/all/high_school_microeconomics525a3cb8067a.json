Non-excludability means that it's impossible or very difficult to prevent people from consuming the good, even if they haven't paid for it. Non-rivalry means that one person's consumption of the good does not diminish the ability of others to consume it.\n\nRegarding the options provided:\n\nA. This statement is incorrect because the marginal cost of providing a public good is typically considered to be zero, as long as the infrastructure (like roads or public parks) is already built and maintained.\n\nB. This statement is also incorrect because, by definition, public goods are non-excludable, meaning anyone can consume them regardless of whether they have paid for them or not.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect because public goods are are non-rivalrous; one more unit consumed by one person does not reduce the availability or utility for another consumer.\n\nD. This statement is correct because pure public goods are usually indivisible and cannot be allocated to individuals in discrete units. For example, national defense or clean air are considered public goods because they are difficult to exclude individuals from enjoying and one person's enjoyment does not diminish another's."
