Whales fit this description as they are large aquatic mammals capable of independent movement through swimming. \n\nBarnacles, Cyanobacteria, and Protists do not belong to the nekton category as they either don't move actively (like barnacles), are unicellular organisms (like protists), or are photosynthetic bacteria (like cyanobacteria)."
