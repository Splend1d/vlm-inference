This means that when we include the sixth time in our set and reorder them, the new median should be \\(92\\) seconds.\n\nSince the median of an even number of data points is the average of the two middle numbers, and we want the median to be \\(92\\), the sixth time must place the set such that the average of the third and fourth values is \\(92\\).\n\nLet's denote the sixth time as \\(x\\). To make \\(92\\) the new median, we need:\n\n\\[ \\frac{94 + x}{2} = 92 \\]\n\nSoving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ 94 + x = 184 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 184 - 94 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sarah's time for her sixth attempt was \\(90\\) seconds, which corresponds to option B."
