The record of a proceeding for a support order shows that the businessman was adjudged to be father of the man. However, the man can establish his status as heir of the businessman only if he was legitimated by the marriage of his mother and the businessman subsequent to his birth. Thus, the man must prove that this marriage occurred. The man's attorney has not been able to discover any marriage license or certificate. However, the attorney does have a photograph that shows a couple dressed in wedding clothes. The scene is the front of a church. Bystanders are seen to be throwing rice at the couple and they seem to be responding by smiling and bowing down. The attorney was given the photograph by the man. He found it in his mother's effects following her death. The man believes that the bride in the picture is his mother. He cannot identify the groom. The attorney was informed by a former acquaintance of the businessman who has seen the snapshot that he thinks the groom is the businessman. If the attorney seeks to introduce the photograph as proof that the mother and the businessman were married, the trial judge should rule the photograph\n\nA. admissible, only if the photographer is available to testify concerning the circumstances under which the photograph was taken.\nB. admissible, only if a witness verifies that it is a correct and accurate representation of the relevant facts.\nC. inadmissible as non-verbal hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible as not the best evidence.\n"

A photograph itself does not carry any inherent meaning without accompanying testimony or other evidence to explain its context and relevance.\n\nThe photograph might be relevant because it could potentially show the couple in question getting married, but there are several issues with using it as direct evidence:\n\n1. **Authenticity**: Without any clear way to confirm that the photo is indeed of the man's mother and the businessman, the authenticity of the image becomes questionable. This lack of certainty can undermine the reliability of the evidence.\n\n2. **Non-verbal Hearsay**: The photograph itself is an unverifiable statement about the events depicted, which can be seen as hearsay. Hearsay is generally inadmissible in court because it lacks the opportunity for cross-examination of the declarant, which is crucial for assessing the truthfulness of the statement.\n\n3. **Lack of Chain of Custody**: There is no clear documentation showing how the photograph came into the attorney's possession or how it has been preserved since then. The chain of custody is important to ensure that the photograph has not been tampered with or altered.\n\n4. **Identification of the individuals**: The man identifies the woman in the photo as his mother, but he cannot identify the groom. Without positive identification of both parties, the photograph's evidentiary value is severely limited.\n\n5. **Lack of Context**: The attorney's anecdotal information about the snapshot being seen by a former acquaintance of the businessman is not enough to establish the photograph's authenticity or relevance. \n\nGiven these concerns, the photograph would likely be ruled inadmissible as non-verbal hearsay not within any recognized exception. The attorney may need to seek other forms of evidence, such as witness testimony or documents, to corroborate the claim of marriage."
