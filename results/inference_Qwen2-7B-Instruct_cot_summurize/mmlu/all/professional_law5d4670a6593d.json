The imposition of a tax on the sale of goods, such as a set of fish tackle, falls under this power, especially when the tax is aimed at generating revenue for the federal government.\n\nThe fact that the product is sold in interstate commerce does not make the tax unconstitutional. The Commerce Clause ( (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. This power allows Congress to impose taxes that affect interstate commerce if the tax is part of a regulatory scheme that serves a legitimate public purpose, such as raising revenue.\n\nOptions A and B incorrectly suggest that the tax would be unconstitutional based on where the product is sold or who might be engaged in commerce. While these factors could potentially be relevant in other contexts, the imposition of a tax for revenue-raising purposes is generally considered constitutional under the framework provided by the Constitution's grant of taxing authority to Congress.\n\nOption C, while true that the Supremacy Clause validates laws enacted by Congress, does not directly address why the tax in question would be constitutional. The Supremacy Clause ensures that federal laws, including those involving taxation, take precedence over conflicting state laws, but it does not automatically validate any tax imposed by Congress. The validity of a specific tax depends on whether it aligns with Congress's enumerated powers, such as the power to tax and spend for the general welfare."
