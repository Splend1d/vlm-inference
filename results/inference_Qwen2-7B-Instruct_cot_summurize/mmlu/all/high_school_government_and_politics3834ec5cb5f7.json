Popular third-party movements often face challenges in maintaining their identity and support base when their ideas and policies proposals gain traction within the established political parties. As major parties incorporate elements of their platform, the distinct identity and appeal of the third party may diminish, leading to its eventual weakening or dissolution. This dynamic reflects the complex interplay between different political forces and the evolving nature of policy landscapes within democratic systems."
