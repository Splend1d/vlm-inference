No duty for natural conditions.\n\nIn general, land possessors owe a duty to take reasonable care to protect against dangers on their property, including natural conditions that could pose risks to trespassers. However, this does not mean they have no duty at all. The specific obligations can vary based on factors such as the foreseeability of harm and the relationship between the possessor and the trespasser. For example, a landowner might have a higher duty to warn or protect against dangers if they are aware of the trespasser's presence or if there are are active operations on the premises that could cause harm. Therefore, while there is typically some duty, it's not accurate to say that there is \"no duty\" for natural conditions in all contexts."
