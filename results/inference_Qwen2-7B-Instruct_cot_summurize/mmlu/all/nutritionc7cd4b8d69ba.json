While dietary choices such as red meat and dietary fat may contribute to overall health risks, obesity specifically has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer due to higher levels of estrogen associated with excess body fat. Fish, on the other hand, typically contains healthy fats and omega-3s which can have potential benefits for health including possibly reducing the risk of some cancers."
