The symptoms are more severe when she is preparing for examinations but improve after bowel movements. She takes no medications. She does not smoke or use illicit drugs. She drinks alcoholic beverages occasionally. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 100/72 mm Hg. Physical examination, including digital rectal examination, shows no other abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A urease breath test result is negative. Upper and lower endoscopies show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?\n\nA. Azathioprine\nB. Infliximab\nC. Lubiprostone\nD. Mesalamine\n"

The patient's BMI, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and endoscopic examinations all suggest no evidence of an organic cause for her symptoms.\n\nGiven the lack of specific diagnostic information and the fact that the patient does not have any signs of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be a medication commonly used to treat IBS, which is often associated with constipation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Lubiprostone\n\nLubiprostone is a chloride ion channel activator that increases colonic fluid secretion, leading to increased bowel movement frequency. It is often prescribed for the treatment of constipation-predominant IBS."
