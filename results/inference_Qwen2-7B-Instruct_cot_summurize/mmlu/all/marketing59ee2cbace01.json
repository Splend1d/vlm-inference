While ownership is certainly a legal and ethical consideration in many contexts, it is not typically a direct concern for marketers when using digital resources for marketing activities. Instead, issues such as jurisdiction, disclosure, and permissions are often more pertinent to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations related to digital marketing. Ownership may come into play when determining rights over content or assets created or used in marketing campaigns, but it's not usually framed as a primary concern in the context of digital marketing practices."
