Reduces the overall gain: In a closed-loop system, the feedback mechanism can sometimes lead to a reduction in the overall gain of the system. This means that the system might not amplify the input signal as much as an open-loop system would, which could result in slower response times or less aggressive behavior. This reduction in gain is often compensated for by adjusting other parameters of the system, but it introduces complexity.\n\nB. Complex and costly: Closed-loop systems typically require additional components such as sensors to measure the actual output, controllers to compare the desired output with the actual output, and actuators to adjust the system based on the error signal. These components add to the complexity and cost of the system compared to simpler open-loop systems.\n\nC. Oscillatory response: A common issue with closed-loop systems is that they can exhibit oscillatory behavior, especially if the system is not properly tuned. The feedback mechanism can cause the system to overshoot its target, then correct itself, leading to repeated oscillations around the desired value. This can be problematic, as it may not achieve the desired steady-state performance and can potentially wear out components over time.\n\nTherefore, all three options (A, B, and C\u2014are indeed disadvantages of a closed-loop control system."
