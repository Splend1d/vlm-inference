Total urinary nitrogen excretion alone\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe total urinary nitrogen excretion is used to determine the amount of protein oxidation in the body because nitrogen is an essential component of proteins. When proteins are oxidised ( broken down for energy, the nitrogen they contain is released into the body and is then eliminated in the urine. Therefore, by measuring the amount of nitrogen in the urine over a certain period, one can calculate the amount of protein that was oxidised during that time. This method is known as the \"nitrogen balance\" or \"protein oxidation\" method.\n\nO2 consumption and CO2 production can give some information about energy expenditure, but not specifically about the amount of protein oxidation. Breath collection could provide data on metabolic gases, but again, it would not specifically quantify protein oxidation."
