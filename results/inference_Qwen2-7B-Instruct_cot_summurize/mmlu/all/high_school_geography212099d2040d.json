Containment theory\n\nThe theory that was used as justification for U.S. involvement in Vietnam during the 1960s and 1970s was the \"Containment theory.\" This theory, originally developed during the Cold War by the Truman administration, aimed to prevent the spread of communism globally. The U.S. feared that if Vietnam fell to communism, it would encourage other countries in the region to follow suit, thus expanding the influence of communist ideology and the Soviet Union. Therefore, supporting South Vietnam against North Vietnamese aggression and communist insurgents was seen as a way to contain the spread of communism.\n\nThe other options listed do not fit the historical context of U.S. involvement in Vietnam:\n\nA. Devolution: This refers to the process of transferring power or responsibilities from a central authority to local governments or communities.\n\nB. Colonialism: Although the U.S. has engaged in colonial activities historically, this term is more commonly associated with European powers' expansion into territories outside Europe during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nC. Heartland theory: This theory, proposed by Halford Mackinder, suggests that control over the Eurasian landmass ( often referred to as the \"Heartland\" - is key to global dominance. While it influenced geopolitical thinking, it was not directly invoked as a rationale for U.S. involvement in Vietnam."
