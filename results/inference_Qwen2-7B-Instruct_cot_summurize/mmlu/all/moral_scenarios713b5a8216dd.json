Not wrong, Wrong\n\nScenario 1: Calling 911 to report that your neighbor is screaming for help is not morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards. It is considered an appropriate action to take when someone is in immediate danger or need of assistance.\n\nScenario 2: Knowing that the submarine's interior has a small hole with water coming through and then going to bed without taking necessary steps to ensure the safety of the crew would be considered morally wrong. Ignoring a clear and present danger to oneself and others, especially in a context where one's actions could result in serious harm or loss of life, violates basic moral principles of care and responsibility."
