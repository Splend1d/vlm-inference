This theorem states that for any linear transformation \\(T: V \\rightarrow W\\) between finite-dimensional vector spaces, the dimensions of the domain, the range (or image, and the kernel add up as follows:\n\n\\[ \\dim(V) = \\dim(\\ker(T)) + \\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) \\]\n\nIn this case, \\(V\\) is the vector space of all real \\(2 \\times 3\\) matrices, which has a dimension equal to the number of entries in each matrix times the number of matrices considered as a whole, so \\(\\dim(V) = 2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n\n\\(W\\) is the vector space of all real \\(4 \\times 1\\) column vectors, so \\(\\dim(W) = 4\\).\n\nGiven that \\(T\\) is a linear transformation from \\(V\\) onto \\(W\\), it means that \\(T\\) is surjective (onto), implying that \\(\\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) = \\dim(W) = 4\\).\n\nUsing the Rank-Nullity Theorem,\n\n\\[ \\dim(V) = \\dim(\\ker(T)) + \\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) \\]\n\n\\[ 6 = \\dim(\\ker(T)) + 4 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\dim(\\ker(T))\\),\n\n\\[ \\dim(\\ker(T)) = 6 - 4 = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the subspace kernel of \\(T\\) is **2**.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. 2**."
