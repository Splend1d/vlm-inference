They use symbols, colors, and patterns to represent different categories or quantities of data, making it easier to visualize where these resources are most concentrated or distributed globally. \n\nA reference map ( (A) provides a general overview of geographical features and locations, but it does not specifically highlight data about resources or distributions. \n\nA topographic map ( (B) focuses on showing physical features of the landscape, such as elevation, landforms, and terrain, rather than resource distribution.\n\nA location map ( (D) simply indicates where something is located without providing any additional information about the nature or extent of that location's resource."
