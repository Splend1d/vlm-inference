The bar was crowded because a championship boxing match was being shown on the television sets in the bar, and many people had gone to the bar to watch it. During the second round of the boxing match, someone bumped into the customer, causing him to spill a drink on his pants. \"Hey, watch what you're doing, jerk!\" the customer said. The person who had bumped the customer was an employee of the bar hired as a bouncer to deal with unruly customers. Angered by the customer's statement, the employee immediately turned around and punched the customer in the mouth. If the customer asserts a battery claim against the owner of the bar, the customer will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because it was reasonably foreseeable that fights would occur in a crowd of people who were drinking a lot of alcohol.\nB. prevail, because the person who punched the customer was employed as a bouncer.\nC. not prevail, because the owner did not touch the customer.\nD. not prevail, because the owner should not be responsible for the intentional acts of the employee.\n"

The bar owner did not directly cause the injury; instead, the injury resulted from the actions of their employee, the bouncer. \n\nUnder the principle of vicarious liability, an employer may be held liable for the actions of their employees if the actions fall within the scope of employment. However, the bar owner might argue that the punch was not within the scope of the bouncer's duties, especially if the purpose of the bouncer was to prevent disturbances rather than to physically confront customers. Additionally, the owner could potentially assert that they took reasonable steps to ensure safety in the bar, such as hiring security personnel, which might mitigate their responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the customer's claim against the bar owner would likely fail based on the lack of direct involvement and potential defenses regarding the scope of the bouncer's employment and the reasonableness of the owner's actions."
