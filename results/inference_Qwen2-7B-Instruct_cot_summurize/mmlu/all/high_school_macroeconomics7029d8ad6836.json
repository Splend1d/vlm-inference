                    "text": "The correct answer is D. When the Federal Reserve (Fed) lowers the discount rate, it aims to encourage borrowing by depository institutions such as banks and thrifts so that the money supply may expand. The discount rate is the interest rate charged by the Fed when commercial banks borrow from it. By lowering this rate, the Fed makes it cheaper for banks to borrow, which can lead them to lend more to businesses and consumers. This increased lending activity helps stimulate economic growth by increasing the amount of money circulating in the economy.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. Giving depository institutions a break on their borrowings: This is indeed one of the effects of lowering the discount rate, but it's not the primary intention. The main goal is to encourage lending, not necessarily to provide a break on borrowing costs.\n\nB. Signaling participants in financial markets that a recession is coming: Lowering the discount rate is generally a response to stimulate the economy, not to signal an impending recession. Central banks typically lower rates during periods of economic weakness or to combat deflation.\n\nC. Signal participants in financial markets that an inflationary period is coming: While monetary policy decisions can influence inflation, the primary purpose of lowering the discount rate is not to signal an imminent inflationary period. The Fed typically raises rates to combat inflation, not to lower them.\n\nTherefore, option D accurately describes the primary intention of the Fed when it lowers the discount rate."
