Refuse to testify unless you get written permission from your clients.\n\nThis choice respects the principle of client confidentiality and the sanctity of the therapeutic relationship, which are fundamental to professional ethics in psychology. It also alignss with the legal requirement for privilege, which generally protects communications between a client and a mental health professional from being disclosed without the client's consent.\n\nHowever, the specifics may vary depending on local laws and professional guidelines. It's crucial to consult relevant legal resources, professional codes of conduct, and potentially seek guidance from a legal advisor who specializes in both psychology and family law to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and ethical standards."
