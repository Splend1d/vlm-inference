The electrons in metals form a degenerate Fermi gas.\n\nIn metals, the conduction electrons are in a sea-like state where they move freely through the material without being bound to specific atomic positions. This system can be described using quantum mechanics, particularly Fermi-Dirac statistics, which is used for systems with a large number of particles that occupy discrete energy levels.\n\nAt low temperatures, the distribution of these electrons follows the Fermi-Dirac distribution, and due to the Pauli exclusion principle (which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously), most of the available energy levels below the Fermi level (are occupied by electrons. As a result, the electrons tend to occupy the lowest possible energy states, leading to a high density of electrons in the lower energy levels. This results in a situation called electron degeneracy, where the kinetic energy of the electrons is significantly higher than what would be expected from the classical Boltzmann distribution (kT (where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature). \n\nThus, the mean kinetic energy of the conduction electrons in metals is generally much higher than kT because of this degenerate Fermi gas behavior."
