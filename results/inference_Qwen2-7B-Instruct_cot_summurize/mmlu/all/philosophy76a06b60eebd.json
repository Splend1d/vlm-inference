Reflecting on what we really think.\n\nRoss's ethical theory, often referred to as \"practical idealism\" or \"separable ethics,\" is based on the idea that certain prima facie moral duties are self-evident and do not depend on other moral rules or consequences. He argues that one should reflect on one's own moral intuitions and consider what actions seem right in themselves, regardless of their consequences or alignment with other moral principles. Therefore, according to Ross, constructing a moral theory involves reflecting deeply on our own moral beliefs and intuitions."
