Buy Treasury securities.\n\nIn a recessionary gap, there's an economic downturn where the actual output is below the potential output of an economy. To close this gap and stimulate growth, both fiscal and monetary policies can be used. \n\nFiscal Policy involves government actions such as taxation and government spending:\n- Decreasing taxes encourages more disposable income for households, which could lead to increased consumer spending, thus stimulating the economy.\n- Buying Treasury securities by the central bank increases the money supply in the economy, making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow and spend.\n\nMonetary Policy involves actions taken by the central bank, such as the Federal Reserve in the US, to influence the money supply and interest rates:\n- Buying Treasury securities increases the demand for these securities, which drives down their yields ( or interest rates, making borrowing cheaper and encouraging investment and consumption.\n\nTherefore, decreasing taxes and buying Treasury securities would both increase aggregate demand and stimulate the economy, helping to close the recessionary gap."
