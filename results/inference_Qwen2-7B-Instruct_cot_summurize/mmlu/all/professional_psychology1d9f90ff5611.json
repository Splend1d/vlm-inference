Specifically, the relationship between the number of errors and the percentage correct follows an inverse proportionality, which is characteristic of a nonlinear transformation. As the number of errors increases, the percentage correct decreases in a way that is not directly proportional; rather, it decreases at an increasing rate, making the relationship nonlinear."
