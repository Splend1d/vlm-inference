He sent it in response to an ad for new ideas in an industry publication. He discussed it with the producer's assistant in a phone call, and mentioned his expectation of compensation. She said, \"Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work.\" She said she would go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Several months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series. The plot and characters were nearly identical to those described in his synopsis. He sued the producer for breach of contract. The producer defended by arguing that there was no contract. What is the likely ruling of the court?\n\nA. The court will rule that there is an express contract because there was a meeting of the mind and mutual assent to the basic terms.\nB. The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.\nC. The court will rule that there was no consideration specifically mentioned and under those circumstances, the law viewed the synopsis as a gift to the producer.\nD. There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.\n"

However, considering the elements of a contract - offer, acceptance, and consideration - it seems that the scenario could potentially support a claim for breach of contract.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- The offer: The writer's submission of the synopsis could be seen as an offer, given his expectation of compensation.\n- Acceptance: The producer's assistant's response affirming payment for the writer's work can be interpreted as acceptance of the offer.\n- Consideration: While not explicitly stated, the exchange of the synopsis (a valuable piece of intellectual property for the producer, for the expectation of compensation, could be considered sufficient consideration.\n\nGiven these elements, option B, \"The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested,\" is the most plausible choice. This implies that even if there wasn't a formal written agreement or explicit mention of all contractual terms, the court may find that a contract existed based on the actions and intentions of both parties.\n\nHowever, without further details such as whether there was a specific timeline for payment or other conditions attached to the offer, the court might lean towards finding that the contract was not sufficiently definite to enforce, which would align with option D, \"There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.\"\n\nUltimately, the court's decision would likely hinge on the specifics of the case, including any additional evidence presented, such as emails, contracts, or other communications between the writer and the producer's office."
