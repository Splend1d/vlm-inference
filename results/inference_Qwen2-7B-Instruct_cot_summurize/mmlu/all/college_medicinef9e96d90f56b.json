Meiosis is a type of cell division that results in four non-identical daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.\n\nLet's examine the phases mentioned:\n\nI. G0: Cells in this phase have exited the cell cycle but can re-enter it under certain conditions. Both mitosis and meiosis involve cells exiting G0 ( for example, during development or in response to certain stimuli.\n\nII. Phase G2: This is the second gap phase of interphase in both mitosis and meiosis. During this phase, the cell prepares for cell division by synthesizing proteins and ensuring that all necessary components are in place for DNA replication and cell division.\n\nIII. Phase S: This stands for synthesis phase and refers to the period when DNA replication occurs. This phase is crucial in both mitosis and meiosis, where the DNA in the cell must be duplicated before the cell can divide.\n\nGiven the above information, the correct answer would be D. I, II, and III, as these phases are common to both cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis."
