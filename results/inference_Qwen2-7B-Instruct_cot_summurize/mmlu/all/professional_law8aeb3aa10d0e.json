The prosecutor served a trial subpoena directing the mayor's attorney to produce private bank records that the mayor delivered to the attorney. The attorney refused the request. The prosecutor in a hearing then sought to compel compliance with the subpoena.

This privilege protects communications between an attorney and their client from being disclosed in court without the client's consent. It serves to ensure that clients can communicate freely with their attorneys without fear of the information being used against them. Therefore, the court should respect the attorney-client privilege and not order the attorney to produce the requested documents."
