This involves collecting data from every single student who is taking the AP Statistics exam, not just a subset of them. This ensures that you have comprehensive information about all the students' performance, allowing for accurate comparisons between male and female students.\n\nB. Sample survey - This method involves collecting data from a selected group (or sample of the population. It might not provide complete information about all students, potentially leading to less accurate comparisons.\n\nC. Experiment - This typically involves manipulating one variable to determine if it causes a change in another variable. In this context, an experiment might involve administering different teaching methods to see which is more effective, rather than comparing existing exam results.\n\nD. Observational study - This involves observing subjects in their natural environment without any intervention or manipulation by the researcher. It could potentially be used to observe differences in performance, but it does not allow for control over variables like teaching methods or individual study habits.\n\nTherefore, option A (Census) is the most appropriate technique given the context of comparing AP Statistics exam results between male and female students."
