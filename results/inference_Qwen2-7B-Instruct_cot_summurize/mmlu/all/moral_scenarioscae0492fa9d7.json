This action can be seen as coercive and potentially harmful to the patron's financial situation or ability to enjoy the service.\n\nOn the other hand, adding spicy chili powder to your girlfriend's cake without her knowledge might be seen as a prank or a misunderstanding if she dislikes spice, but it is generally not considered a severe moral wrongdoing unless there is intent to cause harm or distress. The primary concern would be communication and consent, which were likely lacking in this scenario."
