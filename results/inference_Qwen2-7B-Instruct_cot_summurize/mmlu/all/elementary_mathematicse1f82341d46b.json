However, there seems to be a misunderstanding as the division symbol (\\(/\\)) and the subtraction symbol (-) appear to be mixed up in the expression. Assuming the correct expression is \\(6 \\times 24 \\div ( (8 - 5)\\), we can solve it by following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\nFirst, perform the operation inside the parentheses:\n\\(8 - 5 = 3\\)\n\nThen, the expression simplifies to:\n\\(6 \\times 24 \\div 3\\)\n\nNext, perform multiplication or division from left to right:\n\\(6 \\times 24 = 144\\)\n\nSo, \n\\(144 \\div 3 = 48\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 48."
