Therefore, any t-value between 1.771 and 2.110 ( (the approximate t-value for a right-tail probability of 0.05) would yield a p-value around 0.075.\n\nSo, the correct range for t-values that would give a p-value of 0.075 is approximately 1.771 < t < 2.110, which falls within option C ( 1.771 < t< 2.160."
