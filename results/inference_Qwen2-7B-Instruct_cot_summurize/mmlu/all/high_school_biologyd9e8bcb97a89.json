Lamarck.\n\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck was a French naturalist who proposed the theory of \"acquired characteristics,\" which is the idea that organisms can adapt and change during their lifetimes by acquiring characteristics through use or disuse, and then pass those changes on to their offspring. This concept directly relates to Lysenko's belief that exposure to colder temperatures could lead to the development of more cold-tolerant wheat plants over generations. \n\nA. Cuvier - He was a French paleontologist and zoologist who opposed the idea of evolution and supported the idea of catastrophism, which is the theory that the Earth has been shaped by sudden, short-term geological events.\n\nB. Hutton - He was a Scottish geologist who proposed the theory of uniformitarianism, suggesting that geological processes we see today have always operated at essentially the same rate as they have throughout history.\n\nD. Darwin - He was an English naturalist who proposed the theory of evolution through natural selection, which is fundamentally different from Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics."
