Since the number is 12345.6789, rounding to the nearest ten-thousand will give her 10000 ( because the number is closer to 10000 than to 20000.\n  \n- **Bob** rounds to the nearest thousand. Rounding 12345.6789 to the nearest thousand gives him 12000, as it is closer to 12000 than to 13000.\n  \n- **Carol** rounds to the nearest hundred. Rounding to the nearest hundred gives 12300, since the number is closer to 12300 than to 12400.\n  \n- **Devon** rounds to the nearest ten. Rounding 12345.6789 to the nearest ten gives 12350, as it is closer to 12350 than to 12340.\n  \n- **Eugene** rounds to the nearest whole number. Rounding 12345.6789 to the nearest whole number gives 12345.\n  \n- **Felicity** rounds to the nearest tenth. Rounding to the nearest tenth gives 12345.7, since the number is closer to 12345.7 than to 12345.6.\n  \n- **Gerald** rounds to the nearest hundredth. Rounding to the nearest hundredth gives 12345.68, as it is closer to 12345.68 than to 12345.67 or 12345.69.\n  \n- **Harry** rounds to the nearest thousandth. Rounding to the nearest thousandth gives 12345.679, as it is closer to 12345.679 than to 12345.678 or 12345.680.\n  \n- **Irene** rounds to the nearest ten-thousandth. Rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth gives 12345.6789, as it is already at that precision.\n\nAmong these options, the highest rounded number is 12350, which is achieved by **Devon**. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**B. Devon**"
