If Sandy is Danny's supervisor, this situation can be considered harassment because of the power dynamic between the supervisor and the subordinate. In an employer-employee relationship, supervisors have authority over their subordinates, which can lead to unequal power dynamics that may result in exploitation or abuse.\n\nB. If Danny has previously told Sandy that he does not appreciate her advances, this indicates that there is already a clear indication from Danny that he is uncomfortable with Sandy's behavior. Continuing to engage in unwanted advances under these circumstances can be seen as harassment, as it disregards Danny's boundaries and continued objections.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Both A and B. This implies that the behavior described could be considered harassment regardless of whether it occurs in a professional setting where power dynamics play a role (as in option A, or when there are are explicit indications of discomfort from the recipient, as in option B."
