This means each patient's case is an independent event.\n\nThe probability that all four patients do not develop side effects is the product of the individual probabilities for each patient not developing side effects:\n\n\\[P(\\text{No side effect for all 4}) = P(\\text{No side effect for 1st}) \\times P(\\text{No side effect for 2nd}) \\times P(\\text{No side effect for 3rd}) \\times P(\\text{No side effect for 4th})\\]\n\n\\[P(\\text{No side effect for all 4}) = 0.8 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.8 = 0.8^4\\]\n\n\\[P(\\text{No side effect for all 4}) = 0.4096\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 0.4096**."
