No, all States are considered equal as sovereign States\u2014the principle of sovereign equality, enshrined in article 2, para 1 UN Charter.\n\nUnder international law, all states are considered equal, regardless of their size, economic power, or historical significance. This principle of sovereign equality means that no state has inherent superiority over another. Each state is sovereign within its own territory and enjoys the right to conduct its affairs without external interference.\n\nWhile certain states may hold special positions or privileges within specific international organizations (such as being part of the United Nations Security Council or having been founding members of the United Nations), these do not confer any inherent hierarchy or superiority among states. The decisions and actions of international organizations are based on consensus or majority rule, not on the inherent power or status of individual member states.\n\nIn summary, under international law, all states are sovereign equals, and any hierarchy or priority among states is determined by the rules and procedures of specific international organizations rather than by an inherent ranking of states themselves."
