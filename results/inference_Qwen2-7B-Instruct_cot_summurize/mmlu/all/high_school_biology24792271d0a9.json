Therefore, none of these choices directly answer the question as stated. However, if we interpret the question to mean \"a unique feature of amino acids not typically found in the same form or quantity in carbohydrates,\" the closest answer would be:\n\nC. nitrogen atoms\n\nWhile both amino acids and carbohydrates contain carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms, amino acids have at least one nitrogen atom in their structure, which is not a typical component of carbohydrate molecules. Carbohydrates are generally composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen but do not contain nitrogen atoms in their basic structure."
