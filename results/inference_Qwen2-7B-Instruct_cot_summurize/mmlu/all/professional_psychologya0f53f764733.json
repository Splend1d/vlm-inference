The children should not be included in the study\n\nIt is crucial to respect the autonomy and wishes of all participants in a research study, especially children who may not fully understand the implications of their involvement. If a child expresses a desire not to participate, it is important to honor their decision and exclude them from the study without any further attempts to persuade them to change their minds. The informed consent provided by the parents does not override the child's right to decide whether they wish to participate."
