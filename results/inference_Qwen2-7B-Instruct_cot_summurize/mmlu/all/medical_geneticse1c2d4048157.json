For each child, there is a 1 in 4 (or 25%) chance of inheriting the condition if each parent passes on the mutated gene to the child. This is because each parent has two copies of the gene, and for an autosomal recessive disorder, both copies need to have the mutation for the child to express the condition. Given both parents are affected, they presumably each carry one normal copy and one mutated copy of the gene. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1 in 4"
