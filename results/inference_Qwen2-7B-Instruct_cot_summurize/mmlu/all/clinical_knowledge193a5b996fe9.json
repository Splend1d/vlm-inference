                    "text": "C. may impair high intensity exercise performance.\n\nCarbohydrates, especially in the form of glucose, play a crucial role in providing quick energy to the muscles. They are primarily used as fuel during high-intensity and short-duration exercises, such as sprinting or heavy lifting, which typically last less than 10 minutes. When carbohydrate intake is low, the body has to rely more heavily on fat as an energy source, which can be less efficient and lead to quicker fatigue during high-intensity activities. This can potentially impair performance and endurance in such scenarios. \n\nOptions A and D are not necessarily incorrect but require clarification:\n- A. While it's true that carbohydrate intake doesn't directly influence performance in very short bursts (less than 10 minutes, because the body can quickly break down and use stored phosphocreatine and lactic acid for energy, the statement might not fully capture the context of carbohydrate's role in energy metabolism. Carbohydrates are still important for maintaining steady energy levels throughout the activity, not just in ultra-short duration events.\n- D. Relying more on muscle glycogen during exercise isn't inherently problematic; it depends on the availability of other energy sources. Inadequate carbohydrate intake could limit the rate at which glycogen is replenished, impacting subsequent exercise sessions if not properly recovered with carbohydrates post-exercise.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the resting muscle pH is not directly influenced by carbohydrate intake. Muscle pH is primarily affected by metabolic processes within the muscle cells themselves, not by dietary carbohydrate intake."
