The distance covered can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nGiven that the speed is 24 m/s and the time is 1 second,\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 24 \\times 1 = 24 \\, \\text{meters} \\]\n\nSince the body starts at the origin, its position at \\(t = 1\\) second is 24 meters in the positive x-direction.\n\n### Part 2: Motion from \\(t = 1\\) second onwards\n\nFrom \\(t = 1\\) second onwards, the body accelerates in the negative x-direction at a rate of \\(a = -6\\) m/s\\(^2\\). To find its position at \\(t = 11\\) seconds, we first calculate how much time has passed since \\(t = 1\\) second, which is \\(11 - 1 = 10\\) seconds.\n\nThe position due to uniform acceleration is given by:\n\\[ x = x_0 + v_0t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(x_0\\) is the initial position ( (which is 24 meters at \\(t = 1\\) second),\n- \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity at \\(t = 1\\) second, which was 24 m/s ( (since the body was already moving at this speed when the acceleration started),\n- \\(a\\) is the acceleration (-6 m/s\\(^2\\)),\n- \\(t\\) is the time ( (which is 10 seconds).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ x = 24 + 24(10) + \\frac{1}{2}(-6)(10)^2 \\]\n\\[ x = 24 + 240 - 300 \\]\n\\[ x = 264 - 300 \\]\n\\[ x = -36 \\, \\text{meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the position of the body at \\(t = 11\\) seconds is \\(-36\\) meters, which corresponds to option **C**."
