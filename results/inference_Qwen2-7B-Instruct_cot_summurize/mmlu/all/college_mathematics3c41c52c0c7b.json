An abelian group of order \\(n\\) exists for every positive integer \\(n\\), but the question asks about when there are exactly two non-isomorphic (or distinct) abelian groups of that order.\n\n- **Option A**: \\(n = 4\\). The prime factorization is \\(2^2\\). There are exactly two abelian groups of this order: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\). So, option A is not correct.\n  \n- **Option B**: \\(n = 7\\). Since 7 is a prime number, there is only one abelian group of this order, which is \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\). Therefore, there cannot be exactly two abelian groups of this order, making option B incorrect.\n\n- **Option C**: \\(n = 8\\). The prime factorization is \\(2^3\\). There are exactly two non-isomorphic abelian groups of this order: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4\\). This matches the condition specified in the question, making option C correct.\n\n- **Option D**: \\(n = 12\\). The prime factorization is \\(2^2 \\times 3\\). There are three non-isomorphic abelian groups of this order: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{12}\\), \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_6\\), and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3\\). Thus, option D does not satisfy the condition of having exactly two abelian groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 8**."
