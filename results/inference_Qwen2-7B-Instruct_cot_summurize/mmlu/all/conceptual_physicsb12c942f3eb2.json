In this case, you hear three beats per second, which means that the difference between the frequency of the tuning fork (1134 Hz and the piano note is 3 Hz.\n\nGiven that the tuning fork's frequency is higher than the piano note's frequency ( (1134 Hz), we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tuning Fork Frequency} - \\text{Piano Note Frequency} = \\text{Beat Frequency} \\]\n\n\\[ 1134 \\, \\text{Hz} - \\text{Piano Note Frequency} = 3 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nSolving for the Piano Note Frequency:\n\n\\[ \\text{Piano Note Frequency} = 1134 \\, \\text{Hz} - 3 \\, \\text{Hz} = 1131 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 1131 Hz."
