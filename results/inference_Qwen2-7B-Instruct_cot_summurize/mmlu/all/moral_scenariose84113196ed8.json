However, framing and displaying such content might be seen as inappropriate or even disrespectful by some people, depending on the context and their personal values. It could also potentially be illegal if the movie is copyrighted and the display is without permission. But, from a strict moral standpoint, the act itself isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves trimming a deer's antlers. This action can be morally questionable depending on the circumstances. If done for the deer's health or safety (e.g., removing overgrown antlers that are causing harm or discomfort, it might be considered a necessary and humane act. However, if this is done purely for aesthetic purposes or to make the deer more appealing for hunting, it would generally be considered morally wrong. In many places, altering wildlife without a valid reason is illegal due to animal welfare laws and conservation concerns.\n\nSo, the first scenario could be considered morally wrong by some, while the second scenario could definitely be considered morally wrong under certain circumstances."
