The particular native language in a child\u2019s environment\n\nExplanation: While the particular native language in a child's environment influences their vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation within that specific linguistic system, it does not fundamentally alter their ability to develop vocal language skills. The capacity to learn and use language is generally considered universal among humans. Factors like genetic predispositions, hearing acuity, the quality of interaction and educational support, and exposure to language all play significant roles in the development of vocal language skills. Hearing loss can indeed hinder the development of language skills because it impacts the ability to hear speech sounds clearly, which is crucial for learning to produce and understand language. Similarly, the quality of nonparental early care and education experiences can greatly affect how effectively a child learns and practices language skills. Therefore, options A, B, and C are all contributors to individual differences in the development of vocal language skills, whereas option D does not directly influence these differences in the same way the other options do."
