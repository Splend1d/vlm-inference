To enter into a contract with a third party without the consent of the other partners.\n\nIn a general partnership, all partners typically have the authority to bind the partnership by entering into contracts on its behalf. Therefore, a partner cannot enter into a contract with a third party without the consent of the other partners. \n\nA. To participate in management: Partners in a general partnership generally have the right to participate in the management of the business.\n\nB. To review accounting records: Partners usually have access to and the right to review the financial records of the partnership.\n\nD. To be liable only for personal negligence: While partners may have limited liability for the actions of other partners (depending on the specific legal structure and jurisdiction), they are still typically liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership as a whole. The exact nature of this liability can vary significantly based on local laws and the partnership agreement."
