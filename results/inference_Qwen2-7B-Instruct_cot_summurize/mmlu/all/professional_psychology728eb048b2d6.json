The initiative vs. guilt stage occurs during the preschool years ( approximately ages 3 to 6. During this stage, children begin to take initiative in their activities, such as organizing games or starting projects with their peers. If they receive encouragement and support, they develop a sense of purpose and confidence. However, if their attempts at independence is consistently criticized or punished, they may develop feelings of guilt and self-doubt.\n\nFreud's phallic stage, on the other hand, is one of five psychosexual stages and takes place between the ages of 3 and 6. It involves the conflict between the ego and the sexual drive centered around the phallus. Children at this stage develop a sense of sexuality and gender identity."
