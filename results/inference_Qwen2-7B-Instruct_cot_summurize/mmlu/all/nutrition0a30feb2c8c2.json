Acetaldehyde, acetate. \n\nWhen alcohol (ethanol is consumed, it's first converted into acetaldehyde in the liver by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH. Acetaldehyde is a highly toxic substance and is responsible for many of the immediate effects of alcohol consumption such as flushing, dizziness, and nausea. \n\nAcetaldehyde then gets further metabolized into acetate by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2. Acetate can then be used by the body as an energy source or converted into other molecules.\n\nIt's worth noting that the metabolism of alcohol can vary widely between individuals due to differences in their genetic makeup, particularly in the enzymes involved in the process. Some people have a faster metabolism of alcohol due to certain genetic variants, which can lead to quicker intoxication but also quicker recovery from its effects."
