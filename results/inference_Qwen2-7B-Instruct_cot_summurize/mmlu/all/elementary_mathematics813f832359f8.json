So, if \\(p\\) is the number of pies baked for each fundraiser, then for 4 fundraisers, it would be \\(4p\\).\n\nSo, the equation representing the total pies baked is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Pies} = \\text{Pies for Family} + \\text{Pies for Fundraisers} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ 18 = 6 + 4p \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. \\(6 + 4 \\times p = 18\\)."
