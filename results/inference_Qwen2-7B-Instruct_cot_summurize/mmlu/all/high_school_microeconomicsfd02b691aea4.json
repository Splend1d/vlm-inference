These barriers prevent new firms from easily entering the market, thus allowing existing firms to maintain their market position and potentially earn economic profits. \n\n- Patents give the holder the exclusive right to make, use, or sell an invention for a certain period of time, preventing others from competing with this innovation.\n- Control of essential resources means that a firm has access to necessary inputs that other firms cannot easily obtain, creating a barrier to entry.\n- Economies of scale refer to cost advantages gained by a firm when it increases its scale of production. Larger firms may have lower average costs, making it difficult for smaller firms to compete on price.\n- Exclusive licenses allow a company to grant another entity the right to produce or sell a product or service under specific terms, often limiting competition.\n\nPrice discrimination and elastic demand are not necessarily barriers to entry but rather strategies that firms might use within a market structure to maximize profits. Similarly, these do not automatically lead to short-run profits for a firm ( hence eliminating option B. Elastic demand refers to the sensitivity of quantity demanded to changes in price, which is not inherently tied to barriers to entry."
