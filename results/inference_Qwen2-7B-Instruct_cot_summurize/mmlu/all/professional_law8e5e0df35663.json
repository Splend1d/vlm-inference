He also knew that the tenant's actions had led to some violent confrontations in the past, including one where a gun was discharged in the hallway outside the tenant's apartment. Because the tenant regularly paid his rent on time, the owner didn't take any action to try to evict the tenant. One day, a rival drug dealer drove by the tenant's apartment and fired his gun at the tenant's front window. One of the bullets passed through the tenant's living room and went through the wall into the apartment next door. The bullet struck and injured a neighbor who occupied the adjoining apartment. If the neighbor asserts a claim against the owner to recover damages for his injury, he should\n\nA. recover, because the owner knew that the tenant was dealing drugs from his apartment.\nB. recover, because the owner was aware that such danger existed because of the tenant's drug-dealing activities.\nC. not recover, because the owner is not liable for the criminal acts of third persons.\nD. not recover, because the neighbor is outside the zone of foreseeable danger.\n"

The owner may be held liable for the injuries suffered by the neighbor due to the foreseeability of harm resulting from the tenant's drug-dealing activities. In this scenario, given the owner's knowledge of the tenant's illegal activities leading to violent confrontations and the discharge of a gun, it can be argued that the owner had reason to foresee that these activities could potentially lead to harm beyond the tenant's immediate surroundings, such as affecting neighboring apartments.\n\nUnder premises liability law, property owners have a duty to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition and to protect individuals from foreseeable risks of harm. In cases involving criminal activity, the standard of foreseeability is crucial in determining liability. If the owner knew or should have known about the risks posed by the tenant's illegal activities, they may be held responsible for any injuries that result from those risks.\n\nHowever, the specific laws and legal precedents in different jurisdictions may vary, and the outcome would depend on the detailed circumstances and how they align with applicable law."
