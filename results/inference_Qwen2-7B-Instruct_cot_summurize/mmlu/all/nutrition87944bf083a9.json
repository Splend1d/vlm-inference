They play a central role as producers of food, managers of natural resources, income earners, and caretakers of household nutrition.\n\nWomen's contributions to food security are multifaceted and critical. They often take on significant responsibilities in agriculture, including land management, crop cultivation, and animal husbandry. Women may also play key roles in processing, preservation, and distribution of food within their communities. Additionally, they frequently manage household budgets and allocate resources to ensure that family members have adequate nutrition. Women's economic activities can contribute to household food security by providing income for food purchases or other necessities. However, gender disparities in access to resources, education, and decision-making can hinder their ability to fully participate in these roles effectively."
