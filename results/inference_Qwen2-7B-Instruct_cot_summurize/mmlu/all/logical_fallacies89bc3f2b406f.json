False Dilemma, C. Inconsistency, or D. Appeal to Authority. \n\nAn \"Appeal to Ignorance\" is a type of logical fallacy in which someone argues that a claim must be true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. In this case, Tan Ah Tiat suggests that his opium habit does no harm because he's too old to work and lives off his grandmother's earnings, implying that since he has not faced any negative consequences from his actions, they must not be harmful. This reasoning is flawed because it doesn't take into account potential long-term health impacts of opium use, nor does it address the legal ramifications of possessing illegal substances."
