                    "text": "To solve this problem, we first need to balance the chemical equation for the reaction between ethane (C2H6) and oxygen (O2) that produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The balanced chemical equation is:\n\n\\[ \\text{C}_2\\text{H}_6 + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{CO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that one molecule of ethane (C2H6) reacts to produce two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nNext, we calculate the molar mass of ethane (C2H6). The molar mass of carbon (C) is 12 amu, and the molar mass of hydrogen (H) is 1 amu. Therefore, the molar mass of ethane is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 \\, \\text{amu} + 6 \\times 1 \\, \\text{amu} = 24 \\, \\text{amu} + 6 \\, \\text{amu} = 30 \\, \\text{amu} \\]\n\nNow, we find out how many moles of ethane are present in 84 g. The molar mass of ethane is 30 amu, so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{84 \\, \\text{g}}{30 \\, \\text{amu}} = 2.8 \\, \\text{moles} \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we know that 1 mole of ethane produces 2 moles of carbon dioxide (CO2). So, 2.8 moles of ethane will produce:\n\n\\[ 2.8 \\, \\text{moles} \\times 2 = 5.6 \\, \\text{moles of CO}_2 \\]\n\nThe molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) is:\n\n\\[ 12 \\, \\text{amu} + 16 \\times 2 \\, \\text{amu} = 12 \\, \\text{amu} + 32 \\, \\text{amu} = 44 \\, \\text{amu} \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of 5.6 moles of carbon dioxide is:\n\n\\[ 5.6 \\, \\text{moles} \\times 44 \\, \\text{amu} = 246.8 \\, \\text{amu} \\]\n\nSince 1 amu is equivalent to \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) g/mol, the mass of carbon dioxide is:\n\n\\[ 246.8 \\, \\text{amu} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{g}}{12 \\, \\text{amu}} = 20.6 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to be off from the provided answer choices because it should yield a value closer to what is given. The correct approach considering the options should be based on stoichiometry directly without converting amu to g/mol at the end, which was an error in the explanation.\n\nGiven the correct interpretation and calculation, let's correct it:\n\nSince the balanced equation shows that 1 mole of ethane (C2H6) produces 2 moles of CO2, and we have 2.8 moles of ethane, we can directly calculate the moles of CO2 produced:\n\n\\[ 2.8 \\, \\text{moles of C}_2\\text{H}_6 \\times 2 \\, \\text{(mole CO}_2/\\text{mole C}_2\\text{H}_6 = 5.6 \\, \\text{moles of CO}_2 \\]\n\nGiven the molar mass of CO2 is 44 g/mol:\n\n\\[ 5.6 \\, \\text{moles} \\times 44 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 246.8 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nThis value seems to be slightly off from the closest option due to rounding or interpretation errors in the explanation. However, considering the options provided:\n\nA. 78g\nB. 528g\nC. 224g\nD. 156g\n\nThe correct choice considering the calculation should be either B or C based on the calculation method used here. However, there was a discrepancy in the final step's explanation leading to a misunderstanding. Given the correct calculation process:\n\n\\[ 5.6 \\, \\text{moles of CO}_2 \\times 44 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 246.4 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nThis value does not exactly match any of the options provided due to rounding and precision differences in the"
