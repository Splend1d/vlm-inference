We can calculate this using the formula:\n\n\\[P(H|P) = \\frac{P(P|H) \\cdot P(H)}{P(P|H) \\cdot P(H) + P(P|H') \\cdot P(H')}\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(P(P|H')\\) is the probability of testing positive given that the dog does not have heartworm, which can be calculated as \\(1 - P(N|H') = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02\\).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[P(H|P) = \\frac{0.96 \\cdot 0.10}{0.96 \\cdot 0.10 + 0.02 \\cdot 0.90}\\]\n\n\\[P(H|P) = \\frac{0.096}{0.096 + 0.018}\\]\n\n\\[P(H|P) = \\frac{0.096}{0.114}\\]\n\n\\[P(H|P) \u2248 0.8421\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected dog that tested positive for heartworm actually has heartworm is approximately 84.21%.\n\nThe closest answer choice is C. 84%."
