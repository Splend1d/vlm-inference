Austin, known for his legal philosophy, might be described as a 'naive empiricist' if his views align with this concept in several ways:\n\nC. Because he conceives of laws in a pragmatic rather than a conceptual manner.\n\nThis choice seems to fit best because John Austin, in his theory of jurisprudence, focused on the commands of sovereigns as the basis of law, emphasizing their practical effects and the commands they issue rather than their conceptual or theoretical underpinnings. This pragmatic view might be seen as naive empiricism in the sense that it directly connects observable actions (the commands) to the existence of laws without necessarily delving deeply into the conceptual structure behind them. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Austin's approach was more sophisticated than the naive empiricism might suggest at first glance, as he did engage in philosophical analysis of language and meaning, which goes beyond mere pragmatism. Still, his emphasis on observable actions and their legal implications could align with the idea of a naive empiricist perspective. The other options do not directly relate to Austin's approach in the same way: moral considerations, legal systems, and economic relations are all part of his discussions, but they don't define him primarily as a naive empiricist."
