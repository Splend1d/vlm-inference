                    "text": "A businessman living was an avid baseball fan who frequently traveled to a casino and placed wagers on baseball games. One October, his beloved baseball team was playing in the playoffs and he wanted to place a large bet on his team. He told one of his employees that he wanted to bet $10,000 on his team to win the championship, but that he did not have the time to travel to the casino to place the bet. He then told his employee that he wanted the employee to travel to the casino and place the bet for him. The businessman and the employee agreed that the employee would travel to the casino, place a $10,000 bet for the businessman and then immediately return. In exchange, the employee would be paid $500. The parties reduced this agreement to writing. After the agreement was signed, the businessman handed the employee $10,000 and a round-trip airline ticket. The businessman then told the employee that he would be paid $500 after the employee returned. The employee arrived the next day and immediately went to the casino. There he noticed that the marquis in the parking lot was unlit and covered in a banner that read, \"Casino Temporarily Closed Due to Renovations. \" Unable to reach the businessman by telephone, the employee placed the bet at another gaming establishment located next door to the casino. The following morning, the employee flew back and gave the betting receipt to the businessman. When the businessman saw that the bet had been made at another gaming establishment, he angrily told the employee, \"I purposely directed you to wager that $10,000 at the casino. Since you failed to follow my instructions, the deal's off. \" As a result, the businessman refused to pay the employee the $500. If the employee initiates suit for breach of contract, the court will most likely determine that placing the $10,000 wager at the other gaming establishment, rather than at the casino, constituted a\n\nA. breach of contract.\nB. modification.\nC. constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.\nD. discharge by impossibility.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.\n\nIn this scenario, the agreement between the businessman and his employee can be seen as having a condition precedent, which is a condition that must be fulfilled before the main obligations under the contract come into effect. The condition precedent here could be the placement of the bet at the specified casino. However, due to unforeseen circumstances (the casino being closed), the employee was unable to fulfill this exact condition. Instead, he substantially performed the condition by placing the bet at another gaming establishment next door, which could be considered a similar venue given the context.\n\nA breach of contract occurs when one party fails to fulfill their obligations under the agreement, while a modification involves changes to the original terms of the contract. Discharge by impossibility refers to a situation where performance of the contract becomes impossible due to external factors, which doesn't seem to apply here since the employee still managed to place a bet, albeit not at the originally specified location.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to find that the employee substantially performed the condition precedent despite not doing so exactly as instructed, leading to no breach of contract but potentially justifying the payment of the $500 reward based on the performance of the task, albeit not in the manner initially agreed upon."
