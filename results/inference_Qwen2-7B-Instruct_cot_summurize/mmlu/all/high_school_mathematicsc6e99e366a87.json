However, since those details aren't provided, I'll provide a general approach on how to handle such problems involving parametric equations and arc length.\n\nThe arc length \\( L \\) of a curve defined parametrically by \\( x = x(t) \\) and \\( y = y(t) \\) from \\( t = a \\) to \\( t = b \\) can be found using the integral:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^2} dt \\]\n\nIf you have the parametric equations for your curve, you would first find the derivatives \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\) and \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\), then plug them into the formula above to compute the integral.\n\nGiven that none of the options A through D correspond directly to an integral or a description of a curve's parameter range, it seems likely that there might be a misunderstanding or lack of context. \n\nIf you're looking at a situation where you need to determine the period ( like in trigonometric functions which often appear in parametric equations, recall that:\n- For sine and cosine functions, the period is \\(2\\pi\\).\n- For tangent and cotangent functions, the period is \\(\\pi\\).\n\nOptions A through D could potentially relate to periods if they are related to trigonometric functions within the parametric equations, but without more context, it's hard to give a definitive answer.\n\nIf the question pertains to finding the period of a trigonometric function within the parametric equations, then:\n\n- Option D ( \\(2\\pi\\) is the period for sine and cosine functions.\n- Option B \\(\\pi\\) is the period for tangent and cotangent functions.\n\nPlease provide more context or check if there are any additional details or conditions specified in the problem statement."
