They have increased cognitive flexibility.\n\nChildren learning a second language often show enhanced cognitive abilities, including better problem-solving skills, greater cognitive flexibility (the ability to switch between different tasks or concepts, and improved attention control. This is thought to be due to the demands of managing two linguistic systems simultaneously, which can enhance executive functions.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. Their cognitive development is delayed - There is no evidence to suggest that learning a second language delays cognitive development. In fact, the opposite seems to be true for many children.\n\nB. They have better articulation than children who are not bilingual - While bilingualism may lead to some differences in speech production, such as more varied phonological inventories, it does not necessarily mean that bilingual children have inherently better articulation compared to monolinguals.\n\nC. Their native language proficiency has no effect on the rate of acquiring the second language - While there can be individual differences, studies suggest that proficiency in the first language can influence the process of acquiring a second language. For example, children with strong first language skills may adapt more quickly to new grammatical structures in a second language."
