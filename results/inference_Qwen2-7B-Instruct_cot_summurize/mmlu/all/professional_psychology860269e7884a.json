Having a past sexual relationship with a client can create conflicts of interest and impair the therapist's ability to provide objective, unbiased care. Therefore, the best course of action would be for Dr. Ryan to refer the man to another colleague who does not have this conflict of interest. This ensures that the man receives appropriate therapy while minimizing any potential ethical concerns."
