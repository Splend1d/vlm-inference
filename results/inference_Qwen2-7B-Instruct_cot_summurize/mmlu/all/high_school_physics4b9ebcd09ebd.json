This process is called charge neutralization.\n\nGiven that we start with one sphere having a net charge of +5e (and e represents the elementary charge (approximately \\(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\) Coulombs), and another sphere with a net charge of -6e, when they touch, they will exchange their charges equally until they both end up with the same amount of charge.\n\nSo, if we take half of each initial charge:\n\n- Half of +5e is +2.5e\n- Half of -6 is -3e\n\nAfter touching and exchanging charges equally, each sphere would then have:\n\n- One sphere ends up with a net charge of +2.5e\n- The other sphere ends up with a net charge of -3e\n\nThis matches option B (+1.5e and -2.5e), but there seems to be a discrepancy in the provided options since none directly match the calculated outcome. Given the options as presented:\n\nA. +3e and -4e\nB. +1.5e and -2.5e\nC. Both of the above\nD. None of the above\n\nThe correct answer based on the calculation would actually not be listed among the options, suggesting an error in either the question or the options. However, if we strictly follow the options provided:\n\nSince our calculation shows neither A nor B exactly matches the scenario (but rather suggests a different distribution of charges than any of the options given, the closest correct answer based on the options provided would be:\n\nB. +1.5e and -2.5e\n\nThis is because it's the only option that could potentially represent the scenario after the spheres have exchanged charges to reach equilibrium, considering the likely typographical errors in the options. However, it's important to note that the direct result of the described scenario doesn't align perfectly with the provided choices."
