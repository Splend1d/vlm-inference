The state's attorney had served long enough to become fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. The state's attorney retired and immediately started receiving monthly pension checks. Subsequently, the governor signed into law a statute which provided in part:\"Section 8. Any member of the state attorneys staff who is convicted of. . . bribery . . . shall not beentitled to receive any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind from the state . Such conviction shall be considered a breach of the staff member's employment contract. \"Following the enactment of the statute, the state's attorney received a letter from the state which stated they are immediately discontinuing pension benefit payments to him on account of his bribery conviction. The state's attorney contacted an attorney, who challenged the discontinuance of benefits on the grounds that the new law was unconstitutional. In order to reinstate the state attorney's pension on the grounds that the statute is unconstitutional, the attorney's strongest argument would be that\n\nA. the state attorney was retroactively punished.\nB. the statute is an ex post facto law\nC. the supremacy clause invalidates the state law, because there is federal legislation regulating pension and profit sharing plans.\nD. the statute has a chilling effecton legislators' rights to freely discuss pending bills with members of their staff.\n"

This type of law is generally prohibited by the Constitution. The attorney's strongest argument in this case would likely be that the statute creates an ex post facto law because it applies to the state's attorney's past actions (his conviction for bribery) and changes the terms of his retirement benefits retroactively. \n\nThe other options do not directly relate to the constitutional concerns raised by the situation:\n\nA. The issue is not necessarily about retroactive punishment, but rather whether the law is an ex post facto law that changes the terms of a retirement benefit after the fact.\n\nC. The Supremacy Clause does not automatically invalidate a state law; it states that federal laws take precedence over conflicting state laws, but does not necessarily invalidate a state law just because there is no federal legislation specifically regulating the issue.\n\nD. While the attorney might argue that the statute has a chilling effect on certain speech, the primary constitutional concern here seems to be related to ex post facto laws, rather than restrictions on speech."
