When a country opens its market to international trade, the costs of this change might be borne by specific sectors or industries (such as domestic producers who face increased competition from foreign firms. These costs can be significant and affect a relatively small number of people negatively.\n\nOn the other hand, the benefits of free trade tend to be more diffuse and spread across a larger population. Consumers may enjoy lower prices and a wider variety of goods and services, which benefits them directly. Additionally, businesses that can successfully compete in the global market often experience growth and job creation, benefiting workers and the economy as a whole. \n\nGiven that the negative impacts of free trade tend to be more concentrated and visible to policymakers and the public, while the positive effects are more subtle and widespread, it becomes politically challenging for governments to fully embrace free trade policies without some form of protectionism. This is particularly true when there are no clear mechanisms in place to redistribute the gains from trade to those who suffer losses."
