Lower variance\n\nWhen the number of training examples approaches infinity, a well-designed model should ideally converge to learning the underlying distribution of the data rather than the noise present in any finite sample. This means that as the model is exposed to more and more data, its predictions should become more consistent across different samples of data, leading to lower variance. However, it's important to note that other factors such as model complexity and overfitting can still influence variance."
