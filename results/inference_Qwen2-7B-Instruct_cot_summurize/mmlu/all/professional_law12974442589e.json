In order to practice each day, she had to travel to a school of performing arts to use its musical facilities. Finally, the pianist decided to move out of her apartment and buy a more spacious home, where she could have her own piano. As she was house hunting, the pianist found a quaint home in the county that she wanted. She put a bid down on the home with the seller's broker. She was informed that the owner was in Europe on a business trip and would not be entertaining any offers until he returned. While she was awaiting word on the county property, the pianist's friend orally agreed to sell his piano to her for $8,000. The pianist explained that she wanted the piano only if she should succeed in her efforts to buy the county home. For this reason, the parties agreed that the piano sale would not take effect unless the pianist bought the county home. The next day, the parties reduced their oral agreement to a signed writing, but did not include in the writing any mention that the sale would not take effect unless the pianist bought the county home. Two weeks later, the owner of the county property returned from a trip and rejected the pianist's offer. The friend now brings an action against the pianist for breach of contract to buy the piano. How should the court rule on the pianist's offer to prove, over the friend's objection, that she has not been able to buy the county home?\n\nA. The evidence is admissible, to show that the written agreement did not become a contract.\nB. The evidence is admissible, to show frustration of the purpose of the contract.\nC. The evidence is barred, because the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds.\nD. The evidence is barred, because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.\n"

The evidence is admissible, to show frustration of the purpose of the contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the pianist and her friend entered into an oral agreement regarding the sale of the piano, with the condition that the sale would only be effective if the pianist successfully purchased the county home. This condition was meant to protect the friend by ensuring that the sale of the piano was contingent upon the pianist obtaining the desired property.\n\nWhen the pianist's offer to purchase the county home was rejected, she was unable to fulfill the condition of the oral agreement. The court may consider this evidence to demonstrate that the purpose of the contract\u2014namely, the sale of the piano under the specified condition\u2014was frustrated due to circumstances beyond the control of both parties (in this case, the rejection of the offer for the county home.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not accurately reflect the legal principles applicable to this situation. Option A incorrectly suggests that the evidence is admissible solely to show that the written agreement did not become a contract, when in fact the focus is on the condition of the oral agreement. Option C incorrectly states that the oral agreement is barred by the statute of frauds, which typically applies to contracts that cannot be performed within one year and require a written document. Since the written agreement does not exist, the statute of frauds is not directly relevant here. Option D incorrectly assumes that the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, when in fact, there is no written agreement to potentially contradict; the issue revolves around the conditionality of the oral agreement.\n\nTherefore, the court should rule that the evidence of the pianist's inability to buy the county home is admissible to demonstrate frustration of the purpose of the contract."
