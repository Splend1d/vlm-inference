Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements\n\nWhen a practitioner is engaged to express an opinion on management's assertion regarding the accuracy of financial or other data, they typically follow guidelines provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ( AICPA). Among the options given, the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements ( (SSAE) would be the most appropriate source of professional guidance in this scenario. These standards provide detailed procedures and requirements for conducting engagements that involve the examination or review of assertions made by others about subject matter and the application of agreed-upon procedures to specified subject matter.\n\nOption A, Statements on Auditing Standards, is focused more on audit engagements rather than attestation engagements. Option C, Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services, deals with the preparation and review of financial statements, not the verification of non-financial assertions. Option D, Statements on Standards for Consulting Services, is not relevant as it pertains to providing advisory services rather than expressing an opinion on assertions."
