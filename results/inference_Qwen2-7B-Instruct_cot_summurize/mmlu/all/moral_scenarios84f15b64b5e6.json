This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves causing harm and distress to living creatures, and it goes against the laws and ethical guidelines set for zoos, which aim to provide a safe and humane environment for animals. It also infringes on the property rights of the zoo and its operators.\n\nScenario 2 involves whispering to a friend during a movie in a public theater. This action might be considered impolite or disruptive, depending on the context and the volume of the whisper, but it is not inherently morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. It may violate social norms or expectations in certain settings, but it does not cause direct harm to others or violate any legal rights."
