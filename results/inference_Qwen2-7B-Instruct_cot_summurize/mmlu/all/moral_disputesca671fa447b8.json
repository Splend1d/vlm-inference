However, it's important to note that \"mercy killing\" is not recognized as a legal defense in most countries and is generally considered murder.\n\n- **Physician-Assisted Suicide ( (PAS)**: This refers to a situation where a patient with a terminal illness requests assistance in ending their life, and the doctor provides them with the means or information to do so legally. This practice is controversial and varies by jurisdiction.\n\n- **Involuntary Euthanasia**: Also known as \"passive euthanasia,\" this occurs when a person's life is intentionally ended without their consent, typically due to their inability to make decisions or express their wishes. It can be seen as a form of mercy killing or assisted suicide when the intention is to alleviate unbearable suffering.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that laws surrounding these practices vary significantly by country and region, and the ethical implications and legality of such actions are subject to ongoing debate and discussion."
