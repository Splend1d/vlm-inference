The difference in the dipole moments between DCl and HCl arises from the difference in the masses of the nuclei (deuterium (D) and hydrogen (H). Deuterium has a larger mass than hydrogen, which affects the vibrational frequencies of the molecule. Since the infrared spectroscopy measures the vibration of bonds, the shift in the absorption frequency reflects the difference in their dipole moments."
