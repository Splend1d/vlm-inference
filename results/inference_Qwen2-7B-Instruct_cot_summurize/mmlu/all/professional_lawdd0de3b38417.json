The woman readily agreed and delivered the microwave to the handyman, who promised to have it ready in two weeks. One week later, the handyman realized that he had so much work to do that he would not be able to repair the microwave on time. He then took the microwave to a repair store. The repair store agreed to repair the microwave for $80 within one week. The owner of the repair store that contracted with the handyman was unaware that the woman actually owned the microwave. If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.\nB. The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.\nC. The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.\nD. The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.\n"

The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe woman had an agreement with the handyman for the repair of her microwave. When the handyman failed to fulfill his part of the agreement, he took the responsibility to deliver the microwave to the repair store. By doing so, he created a contractual relationship between the repair store and the woman through him. This means that if the repair store fails to repair the microwave, the woman can hold both the handyman and the repair store responsible for the failure to meet the repair obligations.\n\nTherefore, the woman has a cause of action against both parties."
