He claims to have offered an account of just such a property. \n\nIn \"The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp\" and other works, Stevenson argues that morality is largely a matter of personal preference and societal norms rather than absolute truths. However, in discussions of ethics and aesthetics, Stevenson has also acknowledged the existence of objective standards of value that can be known a priori through reason. In his essay \"The Ego and the Id,\" Stevenson discusses the role of reason in discerning these objective values, suggesting that they are grounded in our rational nature and can be understood independently of empirical experience."
