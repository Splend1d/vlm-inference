The demand curve is of one continuous function.\n\nThe kinked demand curve model suggests that the demand curve for a firm in an oligopoly has a kink or discontinuity at the current price. This implies that the demand curve is not a smooth, continuous function but rather has a sharp change in slope at the prevailing price. \n\nHere's why the other options are correct:\nA. There is no price leader: In a kinked demand curve scenario, firms do not have the power to set prices as they would in a monopoly. Instead, they must consider the likely reactions of their competitors when setting their own prices.\nB. There are relatively equal shares of the market: This is often true in oligopolistic markets where firms have similar products and can anticipate each other's actions, leading to relatively equal market shares.\nC. Price is greater than marginal costs: In the short run, firms may charge a price above marginal cost to earn profits, especially if they believe competitors will not aggressively lower their prices in response. However, in the long run, the price tends to fall towards marginal cost due to competitive pressures."
