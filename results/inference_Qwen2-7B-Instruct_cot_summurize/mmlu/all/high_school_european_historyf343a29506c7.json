All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter; Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police spies.\nTwo things result from this fact.\nI. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\"\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nTo modern historians, the publication of this pamphlet is remembered for coinciding with which of the following events?\n\nA. A series of revolutions that gripped Europe in the same year\nB. The Ottoman Empire's increasing pressure upon the Greek Peninsula\nC. A new system of underground pamphlet distribution\nD. The re-emergence of anti-Semitism as a potent European force\n"

A series of revolutions that gripped Europe in the same year\n\nThe publication of \"The Communist Manifesto\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in February 1848 was indeed closely associated with a wave of revolutionary upheavals across Europe, often referred to as the Revolutions of 1848 or the Spring of Nations. These revolutions were sparked by various social, economic, and political grievances among the working classes and peasantry, and they sought reforms such as democratic constitutions, land reforms, and national unification. The timing of the manifesto's release contributed to its impact on the revolutionary fervor of the period."
