Let's calculate this second discount on the new price:\n\n- The price after the first discount is $260.00.\n- A 10% discount on $260.00 is calculated as \\(260 \\times 0.10 = 26\\) dollars.\n- So, after the second discount, the final price is \\(260 - 22 = 238\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among your options (A, B, C, D. The actual amount a shopper would pay for the coat in December is $238.00."
