One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Who has what interest in the land?\n\nA. The friend has a fee simple absolute, because his life estate merged with the remainder conveyed to him by the daughter.\nB. The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.\nC. The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.\nD. The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion, because the neighbor's remainder was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen the woman conveyed the land to her friend for life, she created a life estate in the friend. This means that the friend owns the land during her lifetime. When the friend dies, the land is supposed to pass to the woman's neighbor and her heirs.\n\nHowever, the neighbor's will devises her entire estate to a local charity, which means that the neighbor's interest in the land (the remainder interest, passes to the charity upon her death. This interest is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities, so it does not terminate before the required time period.\n\nThe Rule Against Perpetuities is a common law doctrine that generally prohibits interests in property from being held indefinitely without vesting or terminating before a certain point in time ( typically measured from the creation of the interest. In this case, the interest in the land that was to pass to the neighbor and her heirs was not subject to this rule, as it was to vest immediately upon the death of the friend.\n\nWhen the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. However, since the daughter had no interest in the land as per the terms of the conveyance, this deed did not affect the outcome.\n\nThus, the friend retains their life estate in the land, and the woman retains her right to receive the land upon the expiration of the friend's life estate, which is now the woman's reversionary interest. The charity receives the remainder interest, which vests immediately upon the friend's death."
