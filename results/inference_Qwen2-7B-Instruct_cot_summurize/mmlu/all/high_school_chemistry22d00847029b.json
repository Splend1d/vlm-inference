                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The \u2013O\u2013H bonds in nitric acid are much weaker than in nitrous acid due to the electron withdrawing character of the additional oxygen atoms in nitric acid. This electron withdrawing effect increases the positive charge density on the hydrogen atom, making it easier for the hydrogen to be donated as a proton, which is the basis for the acidity of a compound. \n\nIn nitrous acid (HNO2, the oxygen is bonded to nitrogen through a single bond. The nitrogen atom in nitrous acid is less electronegative than the oxygen atoms in nitric acid, and it does not have the additional electron-withdrawing effect of another oxygen atom.\n\nIn nitric acid HNO3, the presence of two oxygen atoms attached to the nitrogen increases the overall negative charge density around the oxygen atoms. This makes it easier for the oxygen atom to donate its lone pair of electrons, stabilizing the resulting H+ ion. The additional oxygen atoms also increase the polarity of the molecule, further contributing to the strength of the acid by increasing the separation of charges and the ability of the molecule to attract and retain a proton.\n\nTherefore, the increased electron-withdrawing effect from the additional oxygen atoms in nitric acid contributes to its greater acidity compared to nitrous acid."
