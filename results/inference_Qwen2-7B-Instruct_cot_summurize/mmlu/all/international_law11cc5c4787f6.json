This means that practices, beliefs, or behaviors are understood and evaluated based on the norms and values of the culture in which they occur, rather than judged against a universal set of standards. It suggests that what is considered acceptable or right in one culture might not be so in another, due to differing societal norms, values, and historical contexts. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Cultural relativism posits that the application of human rights is relative to the laws in each nation."
