The following day, the card shop sent the following fax to the printing company: \"Be advised that your shipment is rejected. Order stipulated Christmas cards, not Thanksgiving cards. \"On October 15, the printing company sent the following fax to the card shop: \"Will ship 100 dozen assorted Christmas cards by November 1. Please ship the Thanksgiving cards back to our warehouse and bill us for the shipping charges. \" This fax was received by the card shop, but the card shop did not respond to it or ship the Thanksgiving cards back to the printing company. On October 25, the printing company attempted to deliver 100 dozen assorted Christmas cards to the card shop, but the latter refused to accept. Did the card shop properly reject the October 25 delivery?\n\nA. No, because under the UCC a contract for the sale of goods can be modified without consideration.\nB. No, because the printing company cured the October 10 defective shipment by its tender of conforming goods on October 25.\nC. Yes, because the printing company's shipping of the Thanksgiving cards on October 10 constituted an anticipatory breach.\nD. Yes, because the printing company's shipping of the Thanksgiving cards on October 10 constituted a present breach of contract.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Yes, because the printing company's shipping of the Thanksgiving cards on October 10 constituted a present breach of contract.\n\nWhen the card shop ordered Christmas cards and received a shipment of Thanksgiving cards instead, this constituted a breach of contract by the printing company. A breach occurs when one party fails to fulfill their contractual obligations as agreed upon. In this case, the printing company delivered the wrong product, which is a direct violation of the agreement to deliver 100 dozen assorted Christmas cards.\n\nThe card shop then rightfully rejected the shipment of Thanksgiving cards. When the printing company subsequently sent the Christmas cards, the card shop refused to accept them, as they had already been informed of the breach by receiving the incorrect order. This refusal to accept the Christmas cards after the breach was committed by the printing company is consistent with the card shop's rights under the Uniform Commercial Code ( (UCC), which governs contracts for the sale of goods in many jurisdictions.\n\nTherefore, the card shop's refusal to accept the October 25 delivery of Christmas cards, following the breach by receiving the wrong order, is justified and proper under the principles of contract law and the UCC."
