This action can be seen as unfair and manipulative, which goes against ethical principles of fairness and honesty. In Scenario 2, turning up the radio volume to maintain your own experience does not necessarily harm others unless it's loud enough to cause disturbance or annoyance, which is not specified here. However, if the volume is already high enough to potentially disturb neighbors, this could be considered thoughtless or inconsiderate, but not necessarily morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards."
