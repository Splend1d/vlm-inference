Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets\n\nDevolution refers to the transfer of power and responsibilities from central governments to sub-national units, such as states or provinces. In this context, allowing states to determine how they will meet a federally mandated goal, such as greenhouse gas emissions targets, is an example of devolution because it gives states more autonomy in implementing policies. \n\nThe other options do not represent devolution:\n\nB. \"A race to the bottom\" describes a situation where states lower their standards to attract businesses or residents, which is often seen as a negative consequence of devolution rather than an example of it.\n\nC. A state legalizing marijuana possession in conflict with federal law represents a situation where state and federal laws clash, but it does not necessarily demonstrate devolution.\n\nD. A state being prevented from implementing a more stringent fuel efficiency standard than the federal government's represents a limitation on state power, not an example of devolution."
