Certain medications, such as diuretics and some types of cancer chemotherapy drugs, can increase the risk of developing gout.\n\nB. A history of diarrhoea is not relevant - This statement is false. The relevance of a history of diarrhoea would depend on the context. For example, ifout, which is associated with uric acid crystals in the joints, could be exacerbated by dehydration that often accompanies diarrhea.\n\nC. Difficulty rising from a chair is diagnostic of polymyalgia rheumatica - This statement is false. Difficulty rising from a chair could be indicative of many conditions including arthritis, but it's not specific enough to diagnose polymyalgia rheumatica. Polymyalgia rheumatica is typically diagnosed based on symptoms such as widespread muscle pain and stiffness, particularly in the shoulders, neck, hips, and thighs, usually affecting people over 50 years of age.\n\nD. Joint stiffness of 5 minutes duration suggest an arthropathy - This statement is false. Joint stiffness lasting only 5 minutes does not necessarily indicate an arthropathy ( or joint disease. Typically, stiffness associated with arthritis lasts longer and improves with activity, rather than resolving quickly. \n\nSo, the correct answer would be A."
