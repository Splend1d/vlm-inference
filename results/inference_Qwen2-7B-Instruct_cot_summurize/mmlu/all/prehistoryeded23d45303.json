Emphasis on Flakes Over Blades: The Upper Paleolithic saw a shift in tool production techniques, with a greater emphasis on flake tools technology. This includes tools like scrapers, points, and blades that were produced by striking flakes off a core stone.\n\nB. Rapid Changes: The Upper Paleolithic period was characterized by rapid technological innovation and change. New tools designs, such as the bladelet industry, burins, and the Levallois technique, emerged and were adopted at a faster rate than during previous periods.\n\nC. Elaborate Preparation of Core Tools: The Upper Paleolithic also saw more sophisticated methods for preparing core tools stones. Techniques like the Levallois method allowed for the production of consistent, high-quality cores from which a variety of flake tools types could be derived. This was a significant advancement in the precision and efficiency of tool production."
