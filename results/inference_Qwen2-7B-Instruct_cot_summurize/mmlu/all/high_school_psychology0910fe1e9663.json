Be able to take another person's perspective: This means they can empathize with others and consider different viewpoints, which is crucial for understanding complex ethical dilemmas and making decisions that are not solely self-serving.\n\nWhile the other options ( A. being generous, B. believing in God, and D. having had a successful resolution of the integrity versus despair stage, may contribute to an individual's overall ethical development, they do not specifically define the ability to reason at the postconventional level according to Kohlberg's theory."
