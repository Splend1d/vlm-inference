This method involved shaping a stone core into a block with a uniform thickness, then removing a prepared flake that could be shaped into various tools.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. producing core tools to produce flakes. Levallois technology shifted the emphasis from producing large core tools blanks to producing standardized, ready-to-shape flakes which could then be further modified into various tools such as scrapers, points, etc."
