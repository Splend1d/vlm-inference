According to Rawls, an unjust society is one where inequalities exist that do not contribute to the overall benefit or well-being of all members of the society. This means that certain inequalities may be tolerable if they improve the situation for the least advantaged members of society, but if these inequalities harm or disadvantage the least advantaged, they would be considered unjust under Rawls' principles of justice."
