Archaeologists use the scientific method to formulate hypotheses, test theories, and interpret data based on empirical evidence. This approach helps ensure that their conclusions are grounded in verifiable facts rather than speculation or conjecture. In contrast, pseudoscientific speculation often involves claims that lack supporting evidence, rely on anecdotal information, or incorporate fantastical elements such as the involvement of ancient extraterrestrials."
