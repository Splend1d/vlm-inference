This action is generally not considered morally wrong; in fact, it can be seen as kind and helpful, depending on the circumstances. The squirrel is likely benefiting from being freed from a potentially dangerous or uncomfortable situation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character saves a child who is about to fall into a hole. This action is clearly morally right. It involves preventing harm to another person, which is a fundamental ethical duty under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Saving someone's life or preventing serious injury is generally viewed as a morally positive act."
