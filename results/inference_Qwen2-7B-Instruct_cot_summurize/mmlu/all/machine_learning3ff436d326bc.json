This means that all features will remain in the model, but their impact on the prediction will be reduced if their coefficients are shrunk sufficiently.\n\nLasso Regression, on the other hand, adds a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This method can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features from the model.\n\nTherefore, depending on whether you want to keep all features with reduced impact (Ridge) or remove less relevant features entirely (Lasso), both methods can be appropriately used for feature selection."
