                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation from special relativity. Time dilation tells us that time appears to move slower for an object in motion when viewed from a stationary frame of reference. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{t}{\\gamma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( t' \\) is the time measured in the moving frame of reference ( \n- \\( t \\) is the proper time ( which is the time measured in the rest frame of the object ( \n- \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, given by \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\)\n\nIn this case, the object is a meter stick moving at a speed \\( v = 0.8c \\), where \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.8c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.98} \\approx 1.0204 \\]\n\nThe proper length of the meter stick (which is the length of the meter stick as measured in its own frame of reference ( is 1 meter or 1 meter * (3.33564 x 10^8 cm/s = 3.33564 x 10^8 cm.\n\nThe proper time ( \\( t \\) is the time it would take for the stick to pass the observer if it were not moving. Since the stick is a meter long and the speed of light is about 3.33564 x 10^8 cm/s, the proper time \\( t \\) is:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\text{length of the stick}}{\\text{speed of light}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ m}}{3.33564 \\times 10^8 \\text{ cm/s}} \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s} = 3.00 \\text{ ns} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the time \\( t' \\) measured by the observer:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{t}{\\gamma} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}}{1.0204} \\approx 2.94 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s} \\approx 2.94 \\text{ ns} \\]\n\nSo, the closest answer is B. 2.5 ns, but based on our calculation, the correct value should be around 2.94 ns, which is not listed among the options provided. It seems there might have been a slight rounding discrepancy or a misprint in the choices."
