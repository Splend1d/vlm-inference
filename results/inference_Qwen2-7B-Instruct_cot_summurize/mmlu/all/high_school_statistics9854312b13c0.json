Mathematically, this means:\n\\[P(E \\cap F) = P(E) \\cdot P(F)\\]\n\n**Mutual Exclusivity**: Two events \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. This implies:\n\\[P(E \\cap F) = 0\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(P(E) = 0.32\\)\n- \\(P(F) = 0.15\\)\n- \\(P(E \\cap F) = 0.048\\)\n\nLet's check independence:\n\\[P(E) \\cdot P(F) = 0.32 \\cdot 0.15 = 0.048\\]\n\nSince \\(P(E \\cap F) = 0.048\\) exactly matches \\(P(E) \\cdot P(F)\\), it confirms that events \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are independent.\n\nNow, let's check mutual exclusivity:\nGiven \\(P(E \\cap F) = 0.048\\), this value is not equal to 0, indicating that \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are not mutually exclusive because they can occur together (as evidenced by the non-zero intersection probability.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**D.
