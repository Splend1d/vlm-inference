In the context of relationships, this can lead to a situation where one partner feels compelled to comply with the other's demands, even if those demands include engaging in sexual activities they do not want to participate in. This lack of freedom and control over one's own decisions infringes upon the individual's autonomy, which is a fundamental aspect of personal agency and self-determination."
