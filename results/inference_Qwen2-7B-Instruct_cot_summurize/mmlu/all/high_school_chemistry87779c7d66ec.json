We can plug these values into the combined gas law equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\left(\\frac{875}{760}\\right)atm \\times 5.00L}{400K} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{875}{760}\\right)atm \\times 10.00L}{T_2} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( T_2 \\):\n\n\\[ T_2 = \\frac{10.00L \\times 400K}{5.00L} = 800K \\]\n\nNow we convert \\( T_2 \\) back to degrees Celsius:\n\n\\[ T_2 = 800K - 273 = 527\u00b0C \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 527\u00b0C**."
