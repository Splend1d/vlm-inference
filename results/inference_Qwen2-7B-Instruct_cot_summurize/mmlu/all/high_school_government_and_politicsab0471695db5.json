Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. places his or her department's priorities above the president's\n\nThis choice implies that the cabinet member is prioritizing the interests and operations of their department over the broader goals and directives of the president. This can lead to a disconnect between the cabinet member's actions and the administration's overall strategy."
