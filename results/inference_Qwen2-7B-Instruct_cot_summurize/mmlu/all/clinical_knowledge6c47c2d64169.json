Normal saline.\n\nWhen dealing with a blocked catheter in the context of post-transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), it is common practice to use normal saline for bladder washouts. This is because saline helps to flush out any residual tissue or debris that may have been left behind during the procedure, and it does not cause irritation to the urinary tract. It's also isotonic to the body fluids, which minimizes the risk of osmotic damage to the bladder lining.\n\nThe other options, \"Solution R\" and \"Solution G\", without further context, are ambiguous and likely refer to specific solutions that might be used in certain clinical settings but would not be universally applicable or specified in standard medical procedures. Therefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is B: Normal saline."
