This can result in lower sales for U.S. companies that export products, leading to reduced production, employment, and overall economic activity. As a result, real GDP ( which measures the total value of goods and services produced by an economy after adjusting for inflation - might fall. \n\nThe other options typically have positive effects on GDP:\n\nA. Tariffs and quotas often protect domestic industries from foreign competition, potentially increasing production and employment within those industries, thus contributing positively to GDP.\n\nB. High investment in human capital can improve the productivity and skills of the workforce, boosting economic output.\n\nC. An increase in the money supply can stimulate economic growth by making it cheaper to borrow and invest, but this effect is usually temporary and depends on how the additional money is spent or invested. If it leads to inflation without corresponding increases in production, GDP may not rise."
