A man took possession of the land in 1978 as an adverse possessor and remained on the land from 1978 to 1988; he then left the property to care for his sick mother for one year, returning the following year, 1990. Meanwhile, during the man's possession, the rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994. The man remained on the property until2010. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years.

However, the time period for adverse possession (in this case, 20 years - does not run against a remainderman, which is someone who will inherit the property upon a specified event, like the death of the current owner.\n\nIn this scenario, when the rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994, the son became the remainderman. Therefore, the 20-year statutory period for adverse possession would not have started running against him until the rancher died and the title passed to the son. Since the man had been in possession of the land until 2010, after the rancher's death in 2010, the son could argue that the adverse possession claim was invalid because the possession did not occur during the statutory period that would have run against the son as the remainderman.\n\nGiven that the man remained on the property until 2010, which was after the rancher's death and the title transfer to the son, the son can most likely win the ejectment suit based on the principle that the statutory period for adverse possession does not apply to the remainderman until their interest becomes possessory."
