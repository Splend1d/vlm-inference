Wrong, Not wrong\n\nEncouraging criminals to counteract the police force is considered morally wrong because it involves supporting illegal activities that can harm others and undermine law enforcement, which is meant to protect society. On the other hand, singing a romantic song for one's wife at a father's funeral might be seen as inappropriate or insensitive by some, depending on cultural norms and the specific context of the situation. However, it is not universally considered morally wrong. In many cases, such an action could be seen as thoughtful or caring, even though it might not be the most common practice at funerals. Therefore, while the first scenario is clearly morally wrong, the second is not necessarily so, hence option B."
