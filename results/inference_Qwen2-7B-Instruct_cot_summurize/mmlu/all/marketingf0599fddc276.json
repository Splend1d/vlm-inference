Classical conditioning. \n\nThis is because classical conditioning involves pairing two stimuli together so that the second stimulus elicits a response usually only associated with the first. In this case, the magazine (neutral stimulus) is paired with the perfume sample (unconditioned stimulus), leading to the reader developing a conditioned response to the perfume when they see the magazine in the future."
