This requirement is part of the statute of frauds, which is designed to prevent disputes over the existence, content, and terms of an agreement. When a contract is required to be in writing under the statute of frauds, any changes or modifications to the original written agreement must also be in writing to be enforceable.\n\nIn this scenario, since the original agreement was in writing, the modification to the quantity term from 1,000 to 800 gidgets would need to be documented in writing to be enforceable. The fact that the modification occurred via a telephone conversation does not meet the requirement for a written contract, thus making the modification potentially unenforceable."
