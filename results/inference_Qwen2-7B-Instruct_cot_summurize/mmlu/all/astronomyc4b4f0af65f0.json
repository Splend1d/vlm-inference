                    "text": "Meteorites provide valuable insights into the composition, history, and formation of the solar system. Here's how each of your options relates to what meteorites can tell us:\n\nA. They reveal that the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium gas: This statement is partially correct. The solar nebula theory, which describes the formation of the solar system, suggests that it started as a cloud of gas and dust primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. However, this does not specifically refer to meteorites. Meteorites themselves are contain a variety of materials including rock, ice, and organic compounds.\n\nB. They reveal that meteorites are much older than the comets and planets: This statement is incorrect. The ages of meteorites, comets, and planets are all comparable in terms of the age of the solar system, which is estimated to be around 4.6 to 4.65 billion years. There is no evidence to suggest that meteorites are significantly older than the other bodies in the solar system.\n\nC. They reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years: This statement is correct. The age of meteorites, like those found on Earth, is consistent with the age of the solar system. The oldest known meteorite, the NWA 7034 meteorite, is dated to be around 4.56 billion years old, which is close to the age of the solar system.\n\nD. They reveal that the solar system once contained 10 planets: This statement is incorrect. The number of planets in our solar system has changed over time. Historically, it was thought there were 9 planets ( Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. However, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union, reducing the number of recognized planets in the solar system to 8.\n\nIn summary, meteorites can indeed reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years ( (option C), but they do not specifically reveal that the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium gas, that meteorites are much older than comets and planets, or that the solar system once contained 10 planets."
