Cross-sequential**.\n\nCross-sequential research involves studying multiple cohorts at different points in time, allowing for comparisons across both time and groups. This approach can help understand how variables change within and between groups over time.\n\nHere's a brief overview of each option:\n\nA. Quasi-experimental - This approach involves situations where random assignment is not possible (e.g., comparing an intervention group to a control group when randomization would be unethical or impractical.\n\nB. Longitudinal - This involves observing the same individuals over long periods of time to study changes and developments. It focuses on tracking the same subjects through time but does not necessarily involve multiple groups.\n\nC. Correlational - This type of research looks at relationships between variables without manipulating them. It does not aim to establish causality but rather to find patterns or associations between variables.\n\nSo, while all these approaches have their uses, cross-sequential research seems to be the most suitable for the scenario described, as it specifically deals with both groups and time periods."
