Simultaneously, the increased metabolic activity leads to an accumulation of hydrogen ions (H+ which can lead to acidosis if not properly managed.\n\nLactate and hydrogen ions are transported out of the muscle cells primarily through a protein transporter molecule known as monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1, among others. These transporters facilitate the movement of these molecules against their concentration gradients, effectively pumping them out of the cell. This process helps maintain the cellular pH balance and reduces the accumulation of lactate and hydrogen ions, which could otherwise impair muscle function."
