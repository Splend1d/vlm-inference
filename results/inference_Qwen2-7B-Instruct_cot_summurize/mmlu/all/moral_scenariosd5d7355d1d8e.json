Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, Mr. Johnson, being in a position of authority over Chloe, makes a comment about her appearance that could be seen as inappropriate and potentially harmful, especially if it creates an uncomfortable or intimidating environment for Chloe. This action can be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, not wiping the soap out of the tub is not inherently morally wrong. It is a neglectful act that may lead to a practical inconvenience or even an accident, but it does not involve any wrongdoing towards another person or any violation of rights or principles. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong."
