A senator, in his investigation of infiltration by antigovernment organizations of national labor unions, found a provision in a law passed by Congress that makes it a crime for a member of an antigovernment organization to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the president is dismissed from his position by the executive committee of the union. During a legislative hearing, the senator made derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization. In determining whether the president has a valid cause of action against the senator for defamation, which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of law?\n\nA. Congressional committees do not have the authority to violate a person's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.\nC. The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.\nD. It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.\n"

The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.\n\nIn the context of defamation law, the New York Times v. Sullivan ( case established that public officials and public figures must prove \"actual malice\" to win a defamation lawsuit. Actual malice means that the defendant knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. This standard was implemented to protect freedom of speech, particularly for those engaged in newsgathering and reporting, including members of legislative committees conducting investigations. Therefore, for the president to have a valid cause of action against the senator for defamation, he would need to demonstrate that the senator knew the statements were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth."
