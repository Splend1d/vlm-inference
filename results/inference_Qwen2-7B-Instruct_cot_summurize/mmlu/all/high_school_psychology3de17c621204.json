It is less affected by outliers than the mean ( and provides a better representation of the \"typical\" contribution when there are significant differences in contributions, as seen in your data where there are large gaps between the amounts contributed ($60, $1,000, $10,000).\n\n- **Mode**: The mode is the most frequently occurring value. In this case, it would be $60, which, while informative, doesn't necessarily represent the \"typical\" contribution because of the presence of much higher values.\n\n- **Histogram**: This is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. While it can provide a visual summary of the data distribution, it does not give a single measure of central tendency.\n\n- **ANOVA ( (Analysis of Variance)**: This is a statistical method used to test differences between two or more means. It's not directly a measure of central tendency but rather a tool to determine if there are statistically significant differences between group means. It's not the most appropriate choice here since we're looking for a single measure that represents the \"typical\" contribution.\n\nGiven the presence of outliers (the supporters who gave $1,000 and $10,000, the median is likely to be the most robust measure of central tendency that reflects the typical contribution without being skewed by these high values."
