Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content.\n\nWhile muscle ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and phosphocreatine stores are are crucial for short-duration, high-intensity efforts like sprints or weightlifting, they are not as critical for endurance events like marathons that require sustained energy output over longer periods. Marathons primarily rely on aerobic metabolism, which can sustain energy production with adequate oxygen supply, efficient carbohydrate utilization, and good regulation of body temperature. Therefore, the ability to supply oxygen to the exercising muscles and the availability of body stores of carbohydrate, along with the ability to regulate body temperature, are more important factors for success in endurance events such as the marathon."
