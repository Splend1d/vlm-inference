These acts were designed to promote trade within the British Empire and limit trade with other countries, particularly non-European ones.\n\nAmong the options provided, the Navigation Acts most directly conflict with the economic theories and beliefs of:\n\nC. Adam Smith\n\nAdam Smith is known for his advocacy of free trade and the invisible hand theory, which posits that individuals pursuing their own self-interest inadvertently contribute to societal prosperity. His ideas are in stark contrast to the protectionist policies of the Navigation Acts, which sought to restrict trade and protect domestic industries.\n\nThomas Malthus, Josiah Child, and Jean-Baptiste Colbert are not directly associated with the same economic philosophies that would lead them to oppose the Navigation Acts. While Colbert advocated for state intervention in the economy (\u2014a form of mercantilism\u2014his focus was more on national wealth accumulation through trade surpluses rather than the specific restrictions of the Navigation Acts. Malthus and Child are not primarily known for their contributions to economic theory in relation to trade policy."
