When there were marital problems, wife secretly conveyed her interest in the real estate to her youngest son from a prior marriage so that he would always have a place to live. Wife died and the husband filed to evict his stepson. According to the majority view among the states, can the stepson prevail by asserting his deed from his mother?\n\nA. Yes, the entireties ownership was severed by the valid deed from mother to her son, and son now owns one-half of the property as tenants in common with the husband.\nB. Yes, the son became a tenant by the entireties with his mother's husband upon his mother's death.\nC. No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\nD. No, a mother cannot convey a real estate interest to a son without getting the approval of all of her children.\n"

No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\n\nUnder the doctrine of tenancy by the entirety, which exists in many states in the United States, a married couple holds property jointly and has equal rights to use and dispose of it. However, this type of joint tenancy can be terminated upon the death of one spouse or by mutual agreement of both spouses. If neither of these conditions is met, the surviving spouse retains full ownership rights to the property.\n\nIn this scenario, when the wife conveyed her interest in the property to her youngest son without her husband's consent, the deed was considered invalid. The husband retained his ownership rights upon the wife's death, making him the sole owner of the property. Therefore, the stepson cannot claim any ownership interest in the land based on his mother's deed, as it was not legally binding due to the lack of the husband's consent."
