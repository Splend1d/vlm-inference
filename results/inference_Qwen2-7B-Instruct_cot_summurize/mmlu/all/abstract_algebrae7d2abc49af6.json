Recall that \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) and arithmetic is done modulo 7.\n\nLet's check each element of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\) to see if it is a root of the polynomial:\n\n1. For \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[0^3 + 2\\cdot0^2 + 2\\cdot0 + 1 = 1\\]\nThis is not a root.\n\n2. For \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[1^3 + 2\\cdot1^2 + 2\\cdot1 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6\\]\nThis is not a root.\n\n3. For \\(x = 2\\):\n\\[2^3 + 2\\cdot2^2 + 2\\cdot2 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 21 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\\]\nThis means \\(x = 2\\) is a root.\n\n4.

For \\(x = 5\\):\n\\[5^3 + 2\\cdot5^2 + 2\\cdot5 + 1 = 125 + 50 + 10 + 1 = 186 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}\\]\nThis is not a root.\n\n7.
