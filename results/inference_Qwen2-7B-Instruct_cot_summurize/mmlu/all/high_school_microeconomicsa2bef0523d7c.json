The price of tea rises.\n\nWhen the price of a substitute good (in this case, tea, increases, it makes the original good ( coffee, relatively more attractive to consumers. This leads to an increase in the demand for coffee, as consumers switch from tea to coffee due to its lower relative price. \n\nLet's briefly look at why the other options do not lead to an increase in the demand for coffee:\n\nA. If consumer income falls, the demand for coffee might decrease if it is considered a normal good, but since we're looking for an increase in demand, this option doesn't fit our criteria.\n\nC. A fall in the wage of coffee plantation workers could potentially lead to a decrease in the supply of coffee, but it does not directly affect the demand for coffee. Therefore, it is not the correct answer for increasing the demand for coffee.\n\nD. Improvements in technology that make the harvesting of coffee beans more efficient would typically lead to an increase in supply, which could potentially lower the price of coffee. However, this scenario does not specifically increase the demand for coffee; instead, it changes the supply side of the market."
