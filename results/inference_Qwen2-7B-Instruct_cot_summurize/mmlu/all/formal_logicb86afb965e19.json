A \u2283 (~B \u2228 C) - If A is true, then either B is false or C is true.\n2. C \u2283 D - If C is true, then D must also be true.\n3. A \u2228 (B \u00b7 ~D) - This proposition is a disjunction (A or (B AND NOT D).\n4. A \u2261 (B \u2283 D) - This proposition is a biconditional (A if and only if B implies D).\n\nNow let's construct the truth table:\n\n| A | B | C | D | ~B | ~D | ~B \u2228 C | B \u00b7 ~D | A \u2283 (~B \u2228 C) | C \u2283 D | A \u2228 (B \u00b7 ~D | A \u2261 (B \u2283 D |\n|---|---|---|---|----|----|--------|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|------------|\n| T | T | T | T | F  | F  | T      | F     |  T          |  T    |  T          |  T         |\n| T | T | T | F | F  | T  | T      | T     |  T          | F    |  T          |  F         |\n| ...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|\n| F | F | F | F | T  | T  | T      | F     |  T          | T    |  F          |  T         |\n\nAfter filling in all rows, we look for any row where all propositions are true. Let's examine the possibilities:\n\n- **Option B**: Consistent valuation when A and D are true and B and C are false. Let's check this row:\n  | A | B | C | D | ~B | ~D | ~B \u2228 C | B \u00b7 ~D | A \u2283 (~B \u2228 C) | C \u2283 D | A \u2228 (B \u00b7 ~D | A \u2261 (B \u2283 D |\n  |---|---|---|---|----|----|--------|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|------------|\n  | T | F | F | F | T  | T  | T      | F     |  T          | T    |  T          |  T         |\n\nThis row satisfies all propositions, so Option B is consistent.\n\n- For Options C and D, we would need to check every row to ensure no row satisfies all propositions. Without filling out the entire table, it's not immediately clear if these options lead to a consistent valuation across all rows. However, since we've found a consistent valuation for Option B, we don't need to check further.\n\n**Conclusion**: The set of propositions is consistent, and a consistent valuation exists when A, A and D are true, and B and C are false (Option B)."
