This could be seen as an invasion of privacy and potentially a violation of civil liberties, depending on how the cameras are used and if there is proper notification and consent from those being recorded. It's not universally considered morally wrong but can often be viewed as an overreach or inappropriate use of technology.\n\nScenario 2 involves listening to music while watching the kids at the playground. This action doesn't involve any wrongdoing; it's a common activity that most people engage in without causing harm to others.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the first scenario is morally wrong while the second one is not."
