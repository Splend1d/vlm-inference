The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin?\n\nA. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.\nB. Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\nC. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.\nD. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\n\nWhen two or more parties hold property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, they each have an undivided interest in the entire property. A judgment lien or a mortgage placed on one person's share of the property effectively creates a debt secured by that share. When one joint tenant dies, their share does not pass through the deceased's estate but instead passes directly to the surviving joint tenant(s) under the right of survivorship. However, if there is a lien on one of those shares during the lifetime of all joint tenants, this lien becomes part of the property held in joint tenancy and follows the surviving joint tenant upon the death of the decedent.\n\nIn the scenario provided, the first cousin had placed their interest in the joint tenancy as security for a loan, which resulted in a judgment lien being entered against that interest. Upon the first cousin's death, this lien did not automatically extinguish because it was attached to the joint tenancy as a whole, not solely to the first cousin's individual interest. Therefore, when the second cousin attempts to sell the property, the mortgagee can enforce their interest in the property to recover the amount owed on the loan, even though the first cousin is no longer alive.\n\nThis outcome respects the principles of joint tenancy law, which allows for liens on shared property interests while also preserving the right of survivorship. The lien remains valid until either the debt is paid off or the surviving joint tenant(s) settle the debt, either voluntarily or through legal proceedings."
