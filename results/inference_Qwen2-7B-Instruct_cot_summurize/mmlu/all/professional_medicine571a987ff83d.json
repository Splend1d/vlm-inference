She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly \"panicky.\" She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Recommend behavioral therapy\nB. Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy\nC. Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem\nD. Review the patient's sexual history\n"

Recommend behavioral therapy\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, which seem to be related to anxiety or stress, particularly before flying, behavioral therapy ( specifically exposure therapy, can be an effective approach. This type of therapy helps patients confront their fears in a controlled environment, thereby reducing the anxiety associated with them over time. It might involve gradually exposing the patient to situations that trigger her symptoms, such as preparing for flights, to help her overcome her anxiety. Other options might not directly address the root cause of her symptoms, which seems to be related to stress or anxiety."
