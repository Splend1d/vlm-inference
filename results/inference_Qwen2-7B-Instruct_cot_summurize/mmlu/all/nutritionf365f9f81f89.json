Parental anxiety\n\nWhile parental anxiety can create an environment that may contribute to stress and potential eating disorder development, it is not inherently considered a risk factor for eating disorders in the same way as the other options listed. The other choices\u2014perfectionism traits ( (A), female gender (B), and dieting during adolescence ( (C) \u2014are more directly linked with increased risk of developing eating disorders. \n\nIt's important to note that these are not the only risk factors and that eating disorders can affect people across genders, and those without perfectionist tendencies or dietary behaviors. Additionally, environmental, psychological, and biological factors all play roles in the development of eating disorders."
