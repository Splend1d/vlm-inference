Topics that are interesting for the students\n\nSelecting texts based on topics that interest the students is one of the most effective ways to encourage engagement in the classroom. When students find the material relevant or appealing to their personal interests, they are more likely to be actively engaged and motivated to learn. This approach can also help to foster a love for reading and learning, as well as improve comprehension and retention of the content. While other factors like instructional objectives, the culture of the local community, and the instructional reading level are important considerations, the topic's relevance and interest to the students ultimately drive engagement."
