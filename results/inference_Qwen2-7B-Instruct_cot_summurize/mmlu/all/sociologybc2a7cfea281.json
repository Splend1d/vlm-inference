However, I can explain each option you've listed:\n\nA. Schools prepare children for work by teaching them to be obedient: This statement reflects a traditional view of education that focuses on discipline and conformity. While obedience is one aspect of what schools teach, it's important to note that modern educational theories also emphasize critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.\n\nB. Teachers and parents tend to have similar attitudes to learning: This statement could be true in some cases, but it's not necessarily a universal rule. Teachers and parents may have different approaches, experiences, or values that influence their attitudes towards learning. The educational environment at home and school might also differ significantly, affecting individual attitudes.\n\nC. Children who write lots of letters develop a better grasp of language: This statement is generally true. Writing is an essential component of language development and helps children understand grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure more deeply. Regular writing practice can improve language skills significantly.\n\nD. Boys' and girls' educational achievements have recently become similar: This statement depends on the specific context and time period being considered. In many societies, there has been significant progress toward gender equality in education, with girls' and boys' achievements becoming more similar. However, disparities still exist in certain regions or subjects, and these trends can vary depending on cultural, social, and economic factors.\n\nThe correspondence principle itself refers to the idea that the social structures and norms learned in early childhood, such as cooperation, fairness, and altruism, correspond to those needed in adult society. It does not directly address the options you've listed."
