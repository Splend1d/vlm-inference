We can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly.\n\nCollins responds to the objection by suggesting that while it might seem that our attitudes are not under our voluntary control, we can still develop and cultivate caring attitudes through various means. This could involve reflectingively examining our values, practicing empathy, and engaging in activities that foster compassion and concern for others. While it may not always be easy or immediate, it is possible to work on cultivating the necessary caring attitudes.\n\nA. The statement \"caring attitudes are not moral attitudes at all\" is incorrect because care ethics emphasizes the importance of moral actions motivated by care and concern for others.\nC. The claim that failing to have attitudes of care means no caring attitudes were required is also incorrect. Care ethics argues that we have ongoing responsibilities to care for others, and it's not simply about having the right attitude but also acting on that attitude.\nD. If Collins agrees with the objection, then he would not be providing a response to counter it. Since the passage indicates that Collins provides a response, option D is not accurate."
