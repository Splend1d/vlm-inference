This means that actions are morally permissible only if they can be made into a law that everyone could follow without contradiction. \n\nSo, the closest answer to Kant's 'categorical imperative' would be:\n\nD. You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.\n\nThis principle emphasizes the importance of moral laws being applicable universally and not just based on personal desires or circumstances."
