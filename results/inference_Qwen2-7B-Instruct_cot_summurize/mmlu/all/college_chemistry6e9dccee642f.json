                    "text": "The hyperfine splitting in an EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectrum is determined by the number of unpaired electrons and the number of nuclear spins interacting with them. For a fully deuterated benzene radical anion, \\(C_6D_6^- \\cdot\\), we have one unpaired electron (as the anion state indicates one electron less than the neutral molecule, which has six delocalized electrons on the benzene ring). The deuterium nucleus has two nuclear spins (I = 1/2), leading to two hyperfine interactions per unpaired electron.\n\nThe general formula for the hyperfine coupling constant (\\(A_{hf}\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ A_{hf} = g \\mu_B \\sqrt{N \\times I} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(g\\) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron,\n- \\(\\mu_B\\) is the Bohr magneton,\n- \\(N\\) is the number of nuclei that can interact with the electron,\n- \\(I\\) is the nuclear spin quantum number.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n- \\(g \\approx 2.0023\\),\n- \\(\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{J/T}\\),\n- \\(N = 2\\) ( (since there are are two deuterium nuclei),\n- \\(I = 1/2\\).\n\n\\[ A_{hf} = 2.0023 \\times 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\times \\sqrt{2 \\times 1/2} \\]\n\n\\[ A_{hf} \\approx 3.75 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{T} \\]\n\nThis value is not directly comparable to the options provided because it's given in Tesla (T, while the options seem to be given in units of milliTesla (mT or Gauss G. To convert Tesla to milliTesla, multiply by 1000:\n\n\\[ A_{hf} \\approx 3.75 \\times 10^{-21} \\text{mT} \\]\n\nSo, the closest answer in the given options is **B. 3.75 G**, considering that 1 Gauss is approximately equal to 0.000987 T, thus 3.75 G corresponds to roughly 3.69 mT, which is the closest match among the options."
