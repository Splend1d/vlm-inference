The neighbor then moved into possession of the farm and used it openly and exclusively, paying the taxes for 23 years. He did not use his easement during that period. The woman returned and tried to evict the neighbor from the farm. The court held that the neighbor had acquired the farm by adverse possession. The neighbor then sold the farm back to the woman, who then put a chain across the easement. The neighbor has now brought an action to remove the chain. In most jurisdictions, the neighbor will\n\nA. lose, because he abandoned his easement.\nB. lose, because he did not use his easement for the statutory period of 20 years.\nC. lose, because, rather than using his easement, he used all of the farm.\nD. win, because mere non-use of an easement does not extinguish it.\n"

The key factors that typically determine whether an easement continues or is terminated include whether there was a clear intention to abandon the easement, whether the easement was used in a manner consistent with its intended purpose, and whether there were any affirmative acts that could be interpreted as relinquishing rights under the easement.\n\nThe fact that the neighbor did not use the easement for 23 years does not automatically mean he abandoned it. If the neighbor maintained his right to use the easement through a reasonable belief that he still had the right to do so, or if there were no evidence of intent to abandon, the easement might still be considered valid. \n\nIn the scenario described, the court likely determined that the neighbor had acquired ownership of the farm through adverse possession, but the easement remained intact. When the woman reacquired the farm and attempted to block the neighbor's use of the easement, the neighbor took legal action to have the chain removed, which they are likely to succeed in doing based on the principle that non-use of an easement does not automatically extinguish it."
