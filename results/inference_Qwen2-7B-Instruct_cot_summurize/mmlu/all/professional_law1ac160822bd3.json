The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions:\"(1) The tenant covenants to pay the rent of $750 per month on the first day of each month. \"After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to an attorney, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the attorney assigned his leasehold interest to a doctor. The doctor went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. After the doctor failed to make his rental payments for the first two months of his lease, the landlord brought suit against the tenant to recover for the unpaid rent. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.\nB. the landlord, because he did not object to the assignments.\nC. the tenant, because the doctor, as assignee, would only be held liable.\nD. the tenant, because his assignment to the attorney constituted a novation, thereby extinguishing his obligation to pay rent.\n"

The key point here is that the tenant's lease obligation to pay rent survived these assignments. Therefore, when the doctor failed to pay rent, the landlord could seek recovery from the original tenant (who had not discharged their obligations by assigning the lease. \n\nOptions B, C, and D do not accurately reflect the legal principles involved in this situation:\n\nB. While the landlord may not have formally objected to the assignments, the law does not automatically absolve the original tenant of their lease obligations upon an assignment.\n\nC. The doctor, as an assignee, would indeed be bound by the terms of the lease. However, since the doctor failed to pay rent, the focus of the question is on the landlord's ability to recover from the original tenant, not the assignee's liability.\n\nD. A novation would require the consent of all parties involved and would replace the old contract with a new one, potentially discharging the original party's obligations. Since there is no indication that the landlord agreed to a novation, the tenant's original obligation to pay rent remains intact."
