This means we're looking at the remaining students who either go to 4-year colleges, find employment, or search for a job.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the percentage of students who do not go to 2-year colleges:\n\n\\[100\\% - 20\\% = 80\\%\\]\n\nOut of this 80%, we want to know what proportion goes to 4-year colleges. The percentage of students going to 4-year colleges is 54%. Therefore, to find the probability that a student not going to a 2-year college will go to a 4-year college, we divide the percentage of students going to 4-year colleges by the total percentage of students not going to 2-year colleges:\n\n\\[\\frac{54\\%}{80\\%} = \\frac{54}{80} = 0.645 \\times 100\\% = 64.5\\%\\]\n\nThis value isn't exactly listed in your options, but it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in how the options were presented or interpreted. Given the calculation based on the provided information, the closest match to our result (64.5% when expressed as a decimal would be:\n\nA. 0.460\n\nHowever, this does not directly correspond to the precise calculation result. It appears there might have been an error in the options or in the interpretation of the question. Based on the standard mathematical operation applied, the correct answer aligning with the calculation process should be closer to 0.645, which is not directly represented in the provided options."
