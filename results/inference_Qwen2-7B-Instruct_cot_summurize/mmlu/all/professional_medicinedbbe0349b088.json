Clostridium perfringens - This bacterium can cause a variety of diseases such as gas gangrene, but it's not typically associated with meningitis.\n\nB. Haemophilus influenzae - This is a common cause of bacterial meningitis, especially in children. It could be a potential cause for an adult, but without more specific information about the patient's medical history and other clinical signs, it's not the most probable choice based on the information provided.\n\nC. Rhinovirus - This is the most common cause of the common cold, not typically associated with meningitis.\n\nD. Streptococcus pneumoniae - This bacterium is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis worldwide. It is a significant pathogen in adults, especially those over 65 years of age, who may have weakened immune systems.\n\nGiven the high protein level and pleocytosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae seems to be the most probable etiological organism based on the available information. However, definitive diagnosis would require further clinical assessment, imaging studies, and potentially blood cultures or additional CSF analysis to confirm the specific type of bacteria involved."
