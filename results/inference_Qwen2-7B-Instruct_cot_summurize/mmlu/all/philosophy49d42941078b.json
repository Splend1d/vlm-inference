In his philosophy, as presented in \"Leviathan,\" Hobbes argues that in the state of nature, where there is no government or social contract, life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" To escape this condition, individuals enter into a social contract with one another, agreeing to surrender some of their freedoms to a sovereign authority in exchange for peace, security, and protection of their remaining rights.\n\nUnder this social contract, laws of nature are established, which are essentially rules that govern human behavior and ensure mutual cooperation and survival within society. These laws include prohibitions against killing, stealing, and sexual immorality, among others. Violating these laws constitutes injustice because it disrupts the social order and infringes upon the rights and interests of others."
