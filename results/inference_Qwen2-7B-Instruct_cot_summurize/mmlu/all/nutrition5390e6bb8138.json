An additional 200 kCal throughout pregnancy\n\nThe recommended caloric intake increases throughout pregnancy to support the growing needs of both the mother and the baby. During the first trimester, the increase is typically around 340 calories per day, rising to about 450 calories per day in the second trimester, and finally, to an additional 500 calories per day in the third trimester. This means that while the daily increase might not be exactly 200 calories across all trimesters, the total additional calories needed throughout pregnancy can add up to more than 200 calories per day, especially in the later stages. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider or a dietitian to determine the best caloric intake based on individual health conditions, activity levels, and other factors."
