Not sufficiently similar in relevant ways.\n\nA faulty analogy occurs when two things being compared are not similar enough in the relevant aspects to make the comparison meaningful or valid. The similarity should be pertinent to the argument or point being made, not just any superficial or irrelevant similarities. \n\nFor example, comparing apples and oranges based on their color might lead to a faulty analogy because it doesn't consider their more relevant similarities (both being being fruits), nor does it take into account their differences which could be crucial for the argument being made."
