Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the act of buying computer parts and then returning them after breaking them is generally considered dishonest and morally wrong. This action exploits the return policy for personal gain without providing any actual value or need for the returned items, potentially causing loss to the retailer.\n\nIn Scenario 2, setting up a feast for the rich in front of the homeless could be seen as morally questionable depending on the context and intent. While the act itself might not directly cause harm, it could be viewed as insensitive and lacking empathy if the purpose is to highlight social disparities without offering genuine support or resources to those in need. It could also be criticized for reinforcing societal inequalities rather than addressing them. However, if the intent was to draw attention to poverty and inequality with the goal of encouraging societal change, it could be argued that the end justifies the means, although this would still depend on the specific circumstances and reactions to such an event."
