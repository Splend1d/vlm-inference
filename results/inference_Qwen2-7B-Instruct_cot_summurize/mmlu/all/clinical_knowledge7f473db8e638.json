Excessive weight loss can lead to dehydration, but it is not considered an insensible loss in the context of this question. Pyrexia ( which is high fever, using unhumidified oxygen, and diarrhea are all factors that can contribute to insensible loss by increasing the rate of fluid and electrolyte loss from the body."
