CO2 is a greenhouse gas, which means it traps heat from the sun and contributes to global warming. This is one of the primary causes of the current climate change crisis.\n\nWhile other factors like atomic warfare, dust clouds from volcanoes, and depletion of Earth's ozone layer can also affect the climate in various ways, they are not the main drivers of the recent increase in Earth's average surface temperature."
