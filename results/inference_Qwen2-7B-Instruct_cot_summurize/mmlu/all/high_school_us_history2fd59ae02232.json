It has announced that the South shall be excluded from the common territory, that the judicial tribunal shall be made sectional, and that a war must be waged against slavery until it shall cease throughout the United States. The guarantees of the Constitution will then no longer exist; the equal rights of the states will be lost. The slaveholding states will no longer have the power of self-government or self-protection, and the federal government will have become their enemy.\n\"We, therefore, the people of South Carolina, by our delegates in convention assembled, have solemnly declared that the Union heretofore existing between this state and the other states of North America is dissolved; and that the state of South Carolina has resumed her position among the nations of the world, as [a] separate and independent state, with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.\"\nSouth Carolina defines the causes of secession, 1860\nThe sentiments above are most consistent with which of the following ideologies?\n\nA. States' Rights\nB. Nullification\nC. Neutrality\nD. Civil disobedience\n"

Nullification**. \n\nNullification is the idea that a state has the right to nullify, or invalidate, a federal law within its borders if it deems that law unconstitutional or harmful to the state's interests. This concept was famously advocated by John C. Calhoun, who argued that states had the right to nullify federal laws that they believed exceeded the powers granted to the federal government under the Constitution. South Carolina's declaration of secession, based on the perceived threat to the rights and autonomy of the state by the Republican party's policies proposals, align with the principles of nullification."
