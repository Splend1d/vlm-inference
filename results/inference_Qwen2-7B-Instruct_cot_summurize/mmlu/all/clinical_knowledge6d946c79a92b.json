This binding helps in their transport throughout the body. \n\nOptions A and C are not accurate: \n- Red blood cells do not play a significant role in the transport of free fatty acids.\n- Free fatty acids are not commonly combined with glucose for transport.\n\nOption B is partially correct but less specific than option D. While it's true that free fatty acids can be part of lipoproteins, which are complex particles involved in lipid transport, they are more frequently bound to albumin in the bloodstream."
