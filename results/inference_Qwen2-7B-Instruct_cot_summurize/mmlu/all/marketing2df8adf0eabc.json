GAP 4-the gap between service delivery and external communications. \n\nThis scenario exemplifies Gap 4 in the Service Marketing Gap Model proposed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry. In this model, there are four primary gaps that can lead to dissatisfaction in service delivery:\n\n1. GAP 1: The gap between customer expectations and management perceptions.\n2. GAP 2: The gap between management perceptions and service-quality specifications.\n3. GAP 3: The gap between service-quality specifications and service delivery.\n4. GAP 4: The gap between service delivery and external communications.\n\nIn your example, the advertisement created high expectations (Gap 1) about the train's comfort and space based on its visual representation. However, when the customer boards the train, they experience poor service delivery (Gap 4), as the actual conditions differ significantly from what was advertised."
