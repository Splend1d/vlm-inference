In reality, even poorly adapted individuals can sometimes produce offspring due to random chance or other factors, such as environmental conditions or the presence of predators. The key point in natural selection is that individuals with traits better suited to their environment tend to have a higher survival rate and reproductive success compared to those with less advantageous traits. This leads to the propagation of beneficial traits over generations."
