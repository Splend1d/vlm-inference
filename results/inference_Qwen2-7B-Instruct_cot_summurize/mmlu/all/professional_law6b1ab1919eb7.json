In an accompanying letter, the owner instructed the newspaper to publish the ad in an upcoming edition. The ad was received by the newspaper's advertising editor. The next day the editor phoned the owner and told her that he would not permit the newspaper to run the ad. When the owner asked for an explanation, the editor replied, \"My daughter took your review course and scored low on her entrance exams to college and didn't get into the college of her choice. Because of your instructors, she's now working at the mall. That's why I'm prohibiting the newspaper from publishing your ad. \" The editor then forwarded a letter to the owner reiterating his newspaper's refusal to have the ad published. In an appropriate action, the owner brings suit against the editor and the newspaper seeking an order that would require the newspaper to publish the advertisement. In such action, who will prevail?\n\nA. The owner, because such advertising is protected by the First Amendment under the commercial speech doctrine.\nB. The owner, because there is a constitutional right of advertising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nC. The editor and newspaper, because Congress is empowered to prohibit untruthful advertising, even where it urges the purchase of a legal, validly offered item.\nD. The editor and newspaper, because there is no constitutional right of advertising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n"

The owner, because such advertising is protected by the First Amendment under the commercial speech doctrine.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the United States, commercial speech refers to communication that promotes the commercial interests of speakers, including advertisements. Commercial speech is generally subject to more regulation than other types of speech, but it still receives some level of protection under the First Amendment. This protection is especially strong when the speech concerns lawful activity and does not involve deception or fraud. In this scenario, if the advertisement is truthful and promoting a legal service (\u2014 the test prep review courses \u2014 it likely would be considered commercial speech protected under the First Amendment.\n\nThe editor's decision to refuse publication based on personal grievances rather than any legal reason (such as the content being deceptive or illegal) would be seen as a violation of the owner's constitutional rights. The editor's bias and personal opinion do not provide a valid basis for censoring the advertisement. Therefore, the owner would have a strong case for requiring the newspaper to publish the advertisement, given the protection afforded to commercial speech under the First Amendment."
