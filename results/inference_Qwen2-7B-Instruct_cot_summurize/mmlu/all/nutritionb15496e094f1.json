The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.\n\nThe nutritional needs of infants and young children differ significantly from those of adults due to their rapid growth and development. Their bodies require specific amounts of certain amino acids to support this growth, which can vary from the adult requirements. Breast milk and human tissue protein serve as models for these specific amino acid needs during early life stages. Therefore, understanding the amino acid profile of these sources helps in formulating appropriate diets and supplements for infants and young children."
