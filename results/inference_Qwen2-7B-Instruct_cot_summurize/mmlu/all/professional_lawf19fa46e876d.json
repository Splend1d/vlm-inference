The President's order allows an exception to the extent that emergency circumstances require different hours of operation (as in the case of federal hospitals). When Congress enacted the appropriations statute for operating all federal executive agencies, its members assumed that the offices of those agencies would be open five days per week, but Congress did not include such a requirement in its appropriations statute or in any other statute. Is the President's order constitutional?\n\nA. No, because the heads of the various executive agencies have final responsibility for the operation of those agencies' offices.\nB. No, because when they passed the statute appropriating monies for the operation of executive agencies, members of Congress assumed that those agencies' offices would be open five days per week.\nC. Yes, because the Constitution vests the President with plenary authority to direct the administration of all federal agencies in any manner the President deems expedient.\nD. Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.\n"

Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.\n\nThe Constitution grants the President broad authority to manage the executive branch. Article II, Section 2 states that \"The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the several State militias when called into the actual service of the United States; he may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officers in the executive department, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices, and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\" Additionally, the President is responsible for ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed, which includes managing the day-to-day operations of the executive agencies.\n\nIn this case, the President's order does not appear to conflict with any specific law or statute, and it seems to fall within the President's general duty to manage the executive branch efficiently. The fact that Congress assumed the agencies would operate five days a week when appropriating funds does not necessarily mean the President cannot change this due to unforeseen circumstances, especially if the change is aimed at addressing a pressing national issue like a sudden shortage of heating fuel. Therefore, option D is the most likely correct answer."
