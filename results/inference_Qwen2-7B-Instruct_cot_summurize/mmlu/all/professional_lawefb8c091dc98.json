This is generally allowed under rules related to impeachment by evidence of a criminal record. However, the defense can also question the witness about their prior convictions during cross-examination. The defense attorney's motion to exclude such questioning would typically not be granted automatically; rather, the court would consider factors such as the relevance of the conviction to the witness's credibility and whether the probative value of the information outweighs any potential for unfair prejudice."
