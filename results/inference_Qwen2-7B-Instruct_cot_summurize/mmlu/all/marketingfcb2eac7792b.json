They are designed to accommodate various types of products, often in large quantities, and can be found in different industries such as retail, manufacturing, and wholesale. These warehouses may have climate control, security measures, and efficient storage systems to ensure the safety and integrity of the stored items.\n\nDistribution centers, on the other hand, are primarily focused on processing, sorting, and redistributing goods from suppliers to retailers or directly to consumers. Haulage transport involves the physical movement of goods from one location to another but does not typically involve storage for extended periods. Electronic Data Interchange ( (EDI) is a system for exchanging business documents between companies using standardized electronic formats, which is not related to storing goods."
