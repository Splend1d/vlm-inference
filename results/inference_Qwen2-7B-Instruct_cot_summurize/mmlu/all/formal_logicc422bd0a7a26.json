Given the phrase \"Alexis is greeted by Ben\", we can interpret this as Ben (b) performing the action of greeting (Gxy) to Alexis (a). Therefore, the correct representation would be \"Ben greets Alexis\", which in the given notation translates to \"Gba\". \n\nOption A represents \"Ben is greeted by Alexis\", option B represents \"Ben does not greet Alexis\", and option C reverses the order incorrectly stating \"Alexis greets Ben\"."
