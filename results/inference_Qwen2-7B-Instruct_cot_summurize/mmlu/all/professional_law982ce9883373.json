In 2000, the man inherited his estate from his father, whose family had owned the property continuously since 1812. The woman purchased her estate in 2008. The man had a stable, which housed many valuable racing horses, on his property. The stable, built in 2002, stood on a portion of the man's land located only 10 feet from the border of the woman's property. Not infrequently, putrid stenches arose from the man's property, caused by large accumulations of horse manure, which were left unattended. The woman had often complained to the man of the noises and odors emanating from the stable. The woman brought an appropriate action to enjoin the man's use of the stables. Judgment is likely to be for whom?\n\nA. The man, because the woman moved onto her property after the stable had been built.\nB. The man, because a homeowner is entitled to make reasonable use of his property.\nC. The woman, because the noise, coupled with the odors, substantially interfered with the use and enjoyment of her land.\nD. The woman, because the man was negligent in permitting the manure to be left unattended.\n"

The woman, because the noise, coupled with the odors, substantially interfered with the use and enjoyment of her land.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman has brought an appropriate legal action to enjoin the man's use of the stables based on nuisance claims. Nuisances can be either private or public nuisances. In this case, it appears that the issue is more likely to be a private nuisance, as it pertains to interference with the enjoyment of one's own property.\n\nThe key factors that would likely influence the court's decision include:\n\n1. **Nature and extent of the interference**: The presence of putrid stenches caused by large accumulations of horse manure being left unattended could significantly impact the enjoyment of the woman's property, especially if the smell permeates her land.\n\n2. **Duration of the interference**: If the manure accumulations and resulting odors have persisted over time, this could further support the claim of nuisance.\n\n3. **Reasonableness of the use**: The fact that the stable was built close to the border of the woman's property (only 10 feet away, might suggest that the man's use of the property was not entirely reasonable, given its proximity to the neighboring land.\n\n4. **Attempts to resolve the issue**: The woman's complaints to the man about the noises and odors indicate that she has made efforts to address the issue amicably, which is also relevant in determining whether the man's actions constitute a nuisance.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that the woman's claim is more compelling, as the interference with the use and enjoyment of her property (due to the unpleasant odors and noises from the stable - would likely outweigh the man's defense options. Therefore, the judgment is likely to be in favor of the woman."
