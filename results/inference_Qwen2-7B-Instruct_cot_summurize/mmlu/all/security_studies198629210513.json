Both HM and realism are based on the notion that there exist within society certain discernable realities. This statement acknowledges that both theories consider the existence of objective realities within societies, albeit from different perspectives. Realism tends to focus on power dynamics and material interests in the international system, while HM examines similar dynamics within the context of class struggle and economic relations.\n\nB. HM has some aspects in common with realism, liberalism, and social constructivism, but it offers something distinctive in having class conflict within capitalism as its central focus. This statement highlights that while HM shares some conceptual elements with other theoretical frameworks, it uniquely centers on class conflict and the role of capitalism in shaping historical development. This focus on the material conditions and class dynamics sets HM apart from realism, which primarily concerns itself with state behavior and power politics.\n\nC. Whilst HM recognises the importance of the state as an actor within the international system, it also purports that states prioritize the interests of the ruling-class elite. This statement points out that within the framework of HM, the state is seen not merely as a neutral or autonomous actor, but rather as an instrument of the dominant class. This perspective contrasts with realism, where states are often depicted as rational actors pursuing their national interests, regardless of internal class dynamics. \n\nTherefore, all of these statements accurately capture different facets of the relationship between HM and realism, highlighting both shared and distinctive features of these theoretical approaches."
