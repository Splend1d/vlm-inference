It demonstrates the difference between the internal and the external aspect of a rule.\n\nHart introduced this distinction to clarify the structure of legal systems, particularly focusing on how rules operate within society. When one says they 'have an obligation', it refers to the external aspect of a rule - acknowledging the existence of a legal norm that one must follow. On the other hand, 'being obliged' refers to the internal aspect - the actual duty or moral compulsion felt by the individual to comply with the rule. This distinction helps to differentiate between the formal legal system and the personal or moral obligations individuals may feel towards following the law."
