At trial, the customer shows the court a printed statement from a printer's association defining the minimum standard of skill for the printing industry in the community. The customer asks the court to take judicial notice that the printed statement constitutes the applicable standard of care for printing companies in the area. The court should\n\nA. grant the request, because it promotes expeditious and economical disposition of the proceedings.\nB. grant the request, because the standard of care is amply supported by information supplied to the court.\nC. deny the request, because judicial notice cannot be taken of matters that are ultimate issues in the case.\nD. deny the request if the judge determines that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute.\n"

These typically include matters of common knowledge or historical fact, statutes and rules of law, and data from official publications. However, taking judicial notice of an expert definition or standard of care might be more contentious. If there is reason to believe that the standard defined by the printer's association could reasonably be disputed ( for instance, if it is not widely recognized or accepted within the industry, or if there is evidence suggesting the standard is outdated or incorrect - then the court would likely deny the request for judicial notice. In such cases, the matter might need to be presented through expert testimony or other forms of evidence."
