Developing performance reports emphasizing costs and revenues that managers can control.\n\nEssentially, responsibility accounting is a system used in managerial accounting to allocate costs and revenues to specific areas of responsibility within an organization. This helps managers understand and manage the financial aspects of their operations more effectively. The focus is on costs and revenues that managers can control, which aids in decision-making and performance evaluation. \n\nOption B is related to a part of responsibility accounting - cost allocation, but it does not encompass the full essence of the concept.\n\nOption C refers to a common practice in responsibility accounting where managers are held accountable for the variances between actual and budgeted performance, but this is not the fundamental essence of responsibility accounting.\n\nOption D suggests investigating all variances without distinction, which might be a part of variance analysis under responsibility accounting, but again, it does not fully capture the essence of the concept. Responsibility accounting aims at identifying and holding managers accountable for controllable costs and revenues, not just investigating variances."
