The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis.\n\nThis is the best explanation because net primary productivity (which is the amount of energy converted into biomass by plants through photosynthesis - is greatly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and moisture. Warm temperatures and abundant water are crucial for efficient photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Higher temperatures can increase the rate of photosynthesis up to a point, and water availability ensures that plants do not suffer from water stress, which can limit growth. \n\nThe other options do not accurately explain the increase in net primary productivity towards the tropics:\n\nA. Species diversity does not necessarily lead to increased productivity. In fact, some studies suggest that high biodiversity can lead to decreased productivity due to competitive interactions among species.\n\nB. Metabolic costs are not significantly lower in the tropics; rather, the high temperatures and ample water availability enable more efficient metabolic processes in plants.\n\nD. While there might be more predators in the tropics that could potentially reduce herbivory, the overall effect on net primary productivity is not necessarily an increase due to predator presence. In fact, some studies suggest that higher biodiversity can lead to more stable ecosystems with less need for top-down control by predators."
