They ordered him out of the car and saw a cellophane package protruding from under the seat. The package contained a white powdery substance, which the officers suspected to be cocaine. The officers placed the driver under arrest and put him in the rear of their patrol car. They then proceeded to search the rest of the driver's car. In the trunk they found an assault rifle that was later determined to be the weapon used in a liquor store robbery. Charged with that robbery, the driver moved to suppress the assault rifle as evidence on the grounds that the police did not have a warrant to search the trunk. The best theory that the prosecution can use in support of the admissibility of the assault rifle as evidence is that\n\nA. the police conducted an automobile search.\nB. the police conducted an inventory search.\nC. the search was incident to a lawful arrest.\nD. the search was made under exigent circumstances.\n"

California ( 395 U.S. 752 ( (1960), which holds that the police may search the area within a person's immediate control after making a lawful arrest, without requiring a separate warrant. This rationale is often referred to as the \"search incident to arrest\" exception to the warrant requirement.\n\nIn this case, the police had lawfully arrested the driver for suspicion of drug possession (after observing him make an illegal U-turn and then reaching under the driver's seat, where they found a suspicious package containing a white powdery substance. After arresting the driver, it was reasonable for the officers to conduct a search incident to that arrest, including the passenger compartment of the vehicle, as well as any areas within the driver's immediate control. The discovery of the assault rifle in the trunk falls within this scope, assuming that the driver had access or control over the trunk at the time of his arrest.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific circumstances and legal standards can vary depending on the jurisdiction and other details of the case. However, the general principle of allowing searches incident to a lawful arrest supports the admissibility of the assault rifle as evidence, provided that the officers' actions were reasonable and within the bounds of the law."
