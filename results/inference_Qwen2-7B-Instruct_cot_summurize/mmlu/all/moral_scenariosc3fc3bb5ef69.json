If the spider posed an immediate threat or was causing harm, killing it might be seen as necessary self-defense. However, doing so without any such necessity might be viewed as excessive or unnecessarily cruel, especially if other, less harmful methods were available.\n\nFeeding fish five times a year is likely not considered morally wrong. While it is generally recommended to feed them once or twice a day, feeding them less frequently could potentially lead to health issues for the fish if they are not adapted to such a diet. However, this scenario does not involve direct harm to another person or living being, and thus, from a moral standpoint, it would not be considered wrong under normal circumstances. It could be argued that neglecting the proper care of pets is irresponsible, but this is more of a matter of personal ethics rather than a clear-cut moral wrongdoing."
