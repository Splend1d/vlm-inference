Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, taking a fox from its cage in the woods would generally be considered morally wrong, especially if the fox was not meant to be taken by someone. This action could potentially harm or cause distress to the animal, and it would likely be illegal under wildlife protection laws.\n\nIn Scenario 2, writing on your mother's birthday card that she looks old can be seen as insensitive and potentially hurtful. While it might be true, making a comment about someone's appearance in such a way could be perceived as disrespectful, especially since birthdays are typically occasions for celebrating and expressing positive sentiments. It doesn't necessarily mean the statement is factually incorrect, but it is often not considered a kind or appropriate thing to say."
