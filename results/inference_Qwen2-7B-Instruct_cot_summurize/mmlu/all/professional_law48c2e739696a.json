As they were playing catch outside, the defendant threw the ball over his nephew's head, and it rolled into the street. Instinctively, the nephew ran after the ball but tripped over the gutter and fell in the street. When he tripped, the nephew severely sprained his ankle and couldn't stand up. Moments later, a large garbage truck was backing up and ran over the nephew, killing him. Although the defendant saw his nephew's predicament, he made no effort to rescue him. Subsequently, the defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter. At trial, the defendant testified that he was so shocked when he saw his nephew fall near the garbage truck that he froze and was unable to move until it was too late. Following the defendant's testimony, an expert witness testified for the defense that reactions of the sort described by the defendant are not unusual when a truly shocking event occurs. If the jury believes the testimony of the defendant and his expert witness, the defendant's best defense is which of the following?\n\nA. The defendant was suffering from temporary insanity.\nB. The defendant lacked the requisite mental state required for the commission of the crime.\nC. The defendant's failure to act was not voluntary.\nD. The defendant's criminal liability was superseded by that of the truck driver.\n"

                    "text": "If the jury believes the testimony of the defendant and his expert witness, the defendant's best defense would likely be option B: \"The defendant lacked the requisite mental state required for the commission of the crime.\"\n\nThe defense strategy should focus on demonstrating that the defendant did not have the necessary mens rea ( or guilty mind, to commit the crime of involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter typically requires that the defendant acted negligently, recklessly, or with a lack of due care, leading to someone's death.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendant claims he was so shocked by his nephew falling near the moving garbage truck that he was unable to move. If the jury accepts this testimony and the expert's opinion that such a reaction is not uncommon in response to a shocking event, it could suggest that the defendant lacked the intent or mental capacity to foresee the risk of harm or to exercise reasonable caution to prevent it.\n\nBy considering the mental health statute mentioned in the question, if the jury finds that the defendant lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law at the time of the incident, this could support the defense argument that the defendant did not have the requisite mental state for involuntary manslaughter.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not directly address the mental state required for the crime. Option A suggests temporary insanity, which is a specific type of insanity defense that might apply depending on the jurisdiction's laws and the facts of the case. However, it is not necessarily the best defense based solely on the information provided. Option C argues about the defendant's failure to act, which is relevant to the defense but does not directly address the mental state requirement. Option D suggests that the defendant's liability is superseded by that of the truck driver, which implies a different legal concept ( the doctrine of superseding cause, where the actions of another party completely negate the defendant's responsibility for the resulting harm.\n\nTherefore, option B appears to be the most directly applicable choice to the defendant's situation, as it focuses on the defendant's mental state at the time of the incident."
