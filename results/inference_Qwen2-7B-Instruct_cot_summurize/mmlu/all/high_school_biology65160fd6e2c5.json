                    "text": "The correct answer is C. In many cases, phenotype (the physical characteristics we see in an organism, like the arrangement of its limbs) is not merely determined by genotype (the genetic makeup of the organism). Instead, it's also influenced by the environment. This means that even if an organism has the potential for certain traits genetically, the environment can affect whether or not those traits are expressed. For example, if a horse lives in an environment where it doesn't need to swim, the structure of its forelimbs might not be optimized for swimming even though it's capable of it genetically.\n\nA. While it's true that natural selection may not have enough time to optimize every trait in every species, given the vast timescales involved in evolution, this isn't necessarily the reason why certain traits might not be optimally arranged in current species.\n  \nB. While natural selection can operate in complex and sometimes hard-to-understand ways, suggesting that it's beyond our comprehension is not accurate. It follows specific principles that we can understand and apply to various scenarios.\n\nD. Natural selection does indeed modify structures that were present in previous generations and in previous species. However, it doesn't just modify existing structures; it can lead to new structures evolving when necessary for survival or reproduction. So, while it may be limited in some aspects, it's not restricted solely to modifying pre-existing structures."
