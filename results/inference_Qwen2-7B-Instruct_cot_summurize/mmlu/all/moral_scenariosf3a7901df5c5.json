Wrong, Wrong.\n\nScenario 1: Calling the police on a friendly man can be seen as morally wrong if there is no imminent threat or illegal activity being committed by the man. This action could be considered invasive and potentially harmful to the man's well-being and reputation, especially if he is not causing any disturbance or harm.\n\nScenario 2: Pushing an old lady in a wheelchair into a busy highway is clearly morally wrong. This action puts not only the old lady's life at risk but also endangers the lives of other pedestrians and drivers. It is a direct violation of ethical principles that prioritize respect for human life and safety."
