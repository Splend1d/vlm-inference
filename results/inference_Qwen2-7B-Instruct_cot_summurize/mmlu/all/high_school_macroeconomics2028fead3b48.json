An increase in net exports.\n\nAn expansionary monetary policy, such as \"easy money\" policies by the Federal Reserve, typically leads to lower interest rates and increased liquidity in the financial markets. This can stimulate economic activity, leading to higher domestic spending and potentially attracting foreign investment due to the perceived lower risk of investing in a growing economy. As a result, demand for the country's currency might increase, making its exports relatively cheaper and imports more expensive, thus increasing net exports.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. A decrease in net exports - This is generally not the case because lowering interest rates makes a country's assets less attractive to foreign investors, potentially reducing demand for the country's currency and making its exports more expensive on the global market.\n\nC. An increase in the real interest rate - Expansionary monetary policy typically leads to lower real interest rates, as the Fed increases the money supply, which in turn reduces the value of the currency and decreases borrowing costs.\n\nD. An increase in the nominal interest rate - While nominal interest rates may initially decrease as part of an expansionary monetary policy, they would not necessarily increase; rather, they would likely remain low or even decrease further depending on the specific actions taken by the Fed."
