Some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in M1.\n\nM1 typically includes physical cash, demand deposits, and other highly liquid assets that can be easily converted to cash. M2, on the other hand, expands upon M1 by including less liquid assets such as savings deposits, small time deposits (under $100,000), and money market funds. These assets are not as liquid as those in M1 because they may have restrictions on withdrawals or require more time to convert into cash without penalty.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nB. M2 is not necessarily smaller than M1; it just includes additional components that make it larger.\nC. Neither M1 nor M2 is specifically backed by gold or silver; these monetary aggregates represent the total amount of money circulating in an economy, but their backing can vary based on the country's monetary policy and the composition of its financial system.\nD. While the biggest component of M1 is indeed currency ( and checkable deposits, this statement doesn't specify M1 correctly since it doesn't include all components of M1."
