Mary scored eight more points than Pam.\n\nWithout knowing the exact scores or the scoring scale, we cannot conclude that Mary scored exactly eight more points than Pam based solely on their percentile rankings. Percentiles only tell us where an individual's score stands relative to others; they do not provide information about the absolute difference in scores.\n\nB. Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's.\n\nAgain, without specific score values, we cannot confirm that Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's. Percentile ranking does not equate to a percentage difference in actual score points.\n\nC. Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.\n\nThis statement could be potentially true if the distribution of scores among the test-takers was uniform and if there were enough test-takers for the difference between the 64th and 56th percentiles to represent approximately 8% of the total population. However, without knowing the total number of test-takers or the exact distribution of scores, we cannot definitively say this is true.\n\nD. Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\n\nThis statement can be evaluated by understanding that the 64th percentile means that 64% of the test-takers scored lower than Mary, and similarly, the 56th percentile indicates that 55% scored lower than Pam. The overlap between these two groups (those scoring lower than both Mary and Pam combined) would correspond to \\(100\\% - 64\\% - 55\\% + \\text{(overlap)} = \\text{percentage scoring higher than both}\\). \n\nGiven the percentiles:\n- 36% scored between Pam and Mary ( (since \\(64\\% - 55\\% = 9\\%\\), but this includes the overlap, which needs to be accounted for once).\n- This implies \\(64\\% + 55\\% - 36\\% = 83\\%\\) scored lower than either Mary or Pam, leaving \\(17\\%\\) scored higher than both.\n\nIf we assume the question implies that the overlap is negligible in this context, then \\(17\\%\\) of the total test-takers scored higher than both Mary and Pam. If there were 1000 test-takers, for example, \\(17\\%\\) of them would be \\(170\\), not 36 as stated in the option. This discrepancy suggests there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the option directly. \n\nGiven the information provided and assuming standard interpretation:\n- Option C seems to align with a general statistical interpretation, assuming a large enough sample size where the difference between percentiles roughly corresponds to a percentage of the total population.\n\nHowever, without precise numbers or additional context about the distribution of scores and the total number of test-takers, none of the options can be definitively confirmed as true based solely on the information given. It's important to note that interpreting percentiles involves assumptions about the distribution of scores and the size of the group being analyzed, which are aren't provided here."
