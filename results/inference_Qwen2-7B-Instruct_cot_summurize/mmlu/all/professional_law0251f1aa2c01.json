The organization usually used leafleting and public speeches to advance this view, but it sometimes engaged in violent demonstrations against the embassies and consuls of those countries. Although the woman had never participated in a violent demonstration, she was criminally prosecuted for being a member of the organization. In her defense, the woman claimed that her association with the organization was protected by the First Amendment. Which of the following would the prosecution need to prove to overcome that defense?\n\nA. The woman joined the organization with the specific intent of furthering its illegal activities.\nB. The woman provided material aid to the organization through the payment of dues before the violent demonstrations.\nC. The woman continued to provide material aid to the organization through the payment of dues after the violent demonstrations.\nD. The woman expressed public support of the organization after the violent demonstrations.\n"

If the organization's advocacy led to illegal actions such as violent demonstrations, the prosecution might argue that the woman's continued financial support of the organization, post-violent demonstrations, could indicate her endorsement or support of the organization's unlawful objectives, thus undermining her defense under the First Amendment."
