Contractionary demand management policy.\n\nA contractionary demand management policy is designed to reduce the level of economic activity and is typically implemented by central banks or governments through measures such as raising interest rates, increasing taxes, or decreasing government spending. These actions can lead to a decrease in consumer and business spending, resulting in a shift of the aggregate demand curve to the left. \n\nA. An increase in the money supply could potentially cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right if it leads to lower interest rates and increased spending.\n\nC. Expansionary demand management policy would also tend to shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, as it involves measures that stimulate the economy, such as lowering interest rates, decrease taxes, or increase government spending.\n\nD. An increase in government spending would typically shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, as more spending directly increases the demand for goods and services."
