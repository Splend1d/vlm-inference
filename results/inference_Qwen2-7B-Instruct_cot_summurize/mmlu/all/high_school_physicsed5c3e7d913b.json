As an object is moved from far away towards a concave mirror, the image initially forms on the same side of the mirror as the object (virtual, upright, and magnified. However, as the object approaches the focal point, the size of the image increases, meaning it becomes taller, and the image moves closer to the mirror. When the object reaches the focal point, the image is at its largest and closest to the mirror. Beyond this point, if the object is moved further towards the mirror, the image starts to shrink in size and moves away from the mirror."
