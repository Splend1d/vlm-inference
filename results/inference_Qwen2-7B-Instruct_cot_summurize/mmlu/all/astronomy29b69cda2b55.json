Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.\n\nJovian planets, also known as gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, bulge at their equators due to their rapid rotation. As they spin, the centrifugal force caused by this rotation pushes material outward from the center of the planet, creating a wider equatorial diameter compared to the poles. This effect is similar to how a spinning figure skater pulls their arms in to increase their rotational speed, or how a spinning top wobbles and widens at its base."
