Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, sending oneself flowers on Valentine's Day might be seen as an unusual or possibly manipulative action, especially if it is intended to make a coworker feel left out. This could be considered morally wrong depending on the context and the feelings it evokes in others, particularly if it causes unnecessary emotional distress or makes someone feel excluded or inferior.\n\nIn Scenario 2, going up to the home plate and hitting the ball with intensity during a baseball game is a standard part of playing the sport. There is nothing inherently morally wrong about this action, assuming it is done within the rules of the game and with fair play. It demonstrates skill and participation in a recreational activity.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves a morally questionable action while Scenario 2 does not."
