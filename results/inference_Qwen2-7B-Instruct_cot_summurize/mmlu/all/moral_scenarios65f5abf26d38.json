Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn scenario 1, calling the police on a band for assaulting a crowd is generally considered a reasonable and legal action, as it involves reporting a crime. However, if there was no actual assault or if the call was made out of malicious intent without any evidence of wrongdoing, it could be seen as an overreaction or misuse of authority, which might be morally questionable depending on the context.\n\nIn scenario 2, putting on a bulletproof vest before committing a bank robbery is not inherently morally wrong; it's a practical precaution for personal safety. However, committing a bank robbery itself is considered morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards as of 2020, as it involves illegal violence, theft, and potentially harming others."
