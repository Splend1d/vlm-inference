Products that are considered luxury items or have many close substitutes tend to have more elastic demand, meaning that changes in price will result in larger changes in quantity demanded.\n\nWater and salt are considered necessities with relatively inelastic demand, as people need them regardless of price changes. Bread might be slightly more elastic than salt and water due to its necessity, but it still has some substitutes (like rice, pasta, and other types of bread.\n\nPork, on the other hand, is a food product that can be substituted by other meats such as chicken, beef, or vegetarian alternatives. As such, it is more likely to have a more elastic demand, where a change in price could lead to a significant shift in the quantity demanded. For example, if pork prices rise, consumers may choose to buy less pork and more chicken or beef, or even switch to plant-based protein alternatives, leading to a more substantial decrease in pork demand compared to a smaller decrease in demand for necessities like water or salt."
