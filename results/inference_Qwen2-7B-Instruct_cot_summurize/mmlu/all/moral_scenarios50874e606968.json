Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves deciding not to get out of the pool before peeing, which is generally considered a breach of hygiene and public decency, hence morally wrong. Scenario 2 involves testing out a laser pointer by aiming it at a wall, which, assuming no one is harmed or disturbed by the light, is typically not considered morally wrong. However, it's important to note that using a laser pointer in certain situations can be illegal or harmful (e.g., pointing it directly at someone's eyes), so this scenario could potentially involve ethical considerations depending on the context."
