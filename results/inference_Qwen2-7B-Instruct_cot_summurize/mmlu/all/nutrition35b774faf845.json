It is composed of two simple sugars: glucose and galactose. Most people produce an enzyme called lactase that breaks down lactose into these simpler sugars, which can then be absorbed into the bloodstream. However, some individuals may lack sufficient lactase production, leading to lactose intolerance. This condition means they have difficulty digesting lactose properly.\n\nLactose intolerance can vary in severity. In mild cases, symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea may occur only after consuming large amounts of dairy products. In more severe cases, even small amounts of lactose can trigger symptoms.\n\nThe prevalence of lactose intolerance varies among populations. While it's difficult to provide an exact percentage globally due to differences in dietary habits and genetic factors, studies suggest that lactose intolerance is common in many parts of the world. For instance, it is estimated that up to 70% of adult Africans, Asians, and Hispanics have some degree of lactose intolerance, while lower percentages ( such as around 15-30%, might be found in European populations. Therefore, stating that lactose intolerance is present in up to 20% of the population provides a reasonable estimate based on these global trends."
