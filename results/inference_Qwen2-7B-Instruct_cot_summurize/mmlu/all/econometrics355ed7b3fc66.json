(i) and (iii) only.\n\nExplanation:\nAntithetic variates are a variance reduction technique used in Monte Carlo simulations to improve the efficiency of the simulation process. The main idea behind antithetic variates is to generate pairs of random variables that are negatively correlated, aiming to reduce the variance of the estimate.\n\ni) This statement is correct. Antithetic variates do not necessarily reduce the number of replications required to cover the whole probability space; rather, they aim to achieve a more precise estimate with fewer replications by exploiting the correlation between pairs of random variables.\n\nii) This statement is incorrect. Antithetic variates do not involve employing a similar variable to that used in the simulation but whose properties are known analytically. Instead, they use pairs of random variables that are negatively correlated.\n\niii) This statement is correct. Antithetic variates often involve using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws. This helps in creating negatively correlated pairs, which can lead to a reduction in variance.\n\niv) This statement is incorrect. Taking one over each of the random draws would not typically form the basis of antithetic variates, as it does not align with the principle of generating negatively correlated pairs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, which includes statements i) and iii)."
