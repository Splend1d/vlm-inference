This usually happens when a good becomes cheaper relative to other goods as income rises. In Julia's case, after getting a raise, she buys more expensive ice cream cones (which could be seen as a normal good) and fewer popsicles, which might be considered a cheaper alternative or less preferred option given her increased purchasing power. This behavior aligns with the concept of inferior goods, where demand for popsicles decreases as Julia's income (and presumably, her purchasing power) increases."
