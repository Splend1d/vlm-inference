Has been properly voided in the normal course of business**.\n\nIn auditing, when dealing with internal controls and testing the proper approval of purchase orders, especially those involving significant transactions like ordering office equipment, it is important to maintain integrity in the testing process. Matching random numbers with purchase order numbers is a method used to select a sample for examination.\n\nIf a random number matches a voided purchase order, the auditor should consider the reason for the voiding. A voided purchase order that has been properly voided in the normal course of business typically indicates that there was a legitimate reason for not proceeding with the transaction (e.g., price changes, availability issues, or other business reasons. In such cases, replacing the voided purchase order with another as the audit sampling plan assumes that each purchase order represents a transaction that should be tested for proper authorization and control adherence.\n\nOptions A, C, and D describe scenarios where the purchase order might still have relevant information to test or investigate, depending on the specifics of the situation. However, since the question focuses on the general principle of how to handle a matched random number to a voided purchase order, option B correctly reflects the typical approach an auditor would take: replace the voided purchase order with another to ensure that the sample remains representative of the population being audited."
