Fragmentation of international law concerns the possibility of different legal regimes apply the same rules of international law\nB. It is possible for several legal regimes (ie foreign investment law and human rights law) to exist and develop in isolation of each other, ultimately culminating in the production of divergent rules of international law\nC. Fragmentation is when States assume different interpretations of the same rule of international law\nD. Fragmentation is when States disagree to abide by a certain rule of international law\n"

This fragmentation can occur when different areas of international law, such as foreign investment law and human rights law, evolve separately without a cohesive framework or clear integration. As a result, there might be inconsistencies in how international obligations are interpreted and applied, which can undermine predictability, coherence, and effectiveness in global governance. This issue has become more pronounced with the growth and specialization of international law over time, leading to calls for greater harmonization and cooperation among international legal systems."
