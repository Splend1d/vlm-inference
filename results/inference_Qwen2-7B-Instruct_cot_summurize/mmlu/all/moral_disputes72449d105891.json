This means that the person who is being punished must have committed the offense against legal rules for which they are being being punished. Options A and D are correct because legal punishment typically involves unpleasant consequences (and is intentionally administered by human beings other than the offender, such as government officials or law enforcement. Option B is also generally true, although the nature and severity of the consequences may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific offense."
