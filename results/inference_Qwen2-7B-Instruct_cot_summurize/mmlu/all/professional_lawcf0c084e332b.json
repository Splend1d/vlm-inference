Collateral matters: In some cases, if the matter at hand is not central to the dispute ( for example, if the document is being used to prove something tangential or not directly related to the main issue, the best evidence rule might not apply.\n\nB. Public records: Public records are typically not subject to the best evidence rule because they are considered authentic by their very nature and often cannot be changed once recorded.\n\nC. When it's not offered to prove the contents of the document: If the document is presented for a reason other than proving what was written on it, such as to show intent, the best evidence rule may not apply.\n\nSo, in all these situations, the best evidence rule generally does not apply."
