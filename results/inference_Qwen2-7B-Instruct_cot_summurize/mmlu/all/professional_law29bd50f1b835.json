A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a water park on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city's charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the commission rejected the developer's subsequent application for \"recreational area\" approval for the proposed water park on the grounds that the council's rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. Assume that while the action was pending in the state court, the proposed zoning change was defeated in a referendum. Which would be the most applicable rule of constitutional law with respect to the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance?\n\nA. The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of the democratic process does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The referendum procedure is arbitrary and capricious and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.\nC. The referendum procedure is violative of the due process clause of the FourteenthAmendment.\nD. The referendum procedure in this context is invalid as against publicpolicy.\n"

The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of the democratic process does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis choice suggests that the referendum procedure, being it a tool for democratic participation, would not inherently violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees certain fundamental rights and procedural fairness in legal proceedings. The fact that the referendum was initiated through a popular vote, in accordance with the state's constitution, would suggest that it serves as a legitimate method for the people to express their will on issues related to municipal governance.\n\nHowever, whether or not the specific implementation of the referendum in this case complies with the due process clause would depend on further analysis of the specific circumstances and application of other constitutional principles. For example, if the referendum process was manipulated or influenced in a way that violated the principle of fair and open elections (or if it resulted in an outcome that was irrational or not based on a reasonable interpretation of the law, it might be challenged on due process grounds. \n\nThe other options presented:\nB. The referendum procedure being arbitrary and capricious and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power, could apply if there were evidence that the referendum was improperly influencing or overriding legitimate legislative processes.\nC. The referendum procedure is violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, would only be true if the referendum process itself was found to be inherently unfair or unconstitutional, which seems less likely given its democratic nature.\nD. The referendum procedure in this context is invalid as against public policy, would apply if the referendum's outcome was found to be against the broader public interest or to have significant negative consequences that outweigh its benefits."
