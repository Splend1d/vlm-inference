However, since we're looking for an approximate answer among the options provided, we can estimate the solution by inspection or using a graphing tool.\n\nFor small positive values of \\(x\\), \\(\\cos(x) > x^2\\). As \\(x\\) increases, there will be a point where \\(\\cos(x) = x^2\\). This point will give us the upper limit of integration for finding the area between the curves.\n\nBy inspection or using a graphing calculator, you might find that the curves intersect approximately at \\(x = 0.739\\) ( (this value is close to the solution for \\(x\\) when \\(\\cos(x) = x^2\\), which is known to be around \\(0.739\\) based on numerical methods).\n\nNow, to find the area, we integrate the difference between the two functions from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 0.739\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\int_{0}^{0.739} (\\cos(x) - x^2) dx\n\\]\n\nEvaluating this integral:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area} &= \\left[ \\sin(x) - \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_0^{0.739} \\\\\n&= \\left( \\sin(0.739) - \\frac{(0.739)^3}{3} \\right) - \\left( \\sin(0) - \\frac{0^3}{3} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sin(0.739 - \\frac{0.739^3}{3} \\\\\n&\\approx \\sin(0.739 - \\frac{0.391}{3} \\\\\n&\\approx 0.692 - 0.130 \\\\\n&\\approx 0.562\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSo, the closest option to our calculated area is C. 0.547."
