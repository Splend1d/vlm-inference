His analysis suggests that these underdeveloped economies are not simply 'insufficiently involved' in the international capitalist economy (option A), nor are they inherently 'reluctant' to change their traditional ways (option B). While he does argue that there is exploitation involved (suggesting some level of agreement with option C), this is not the central point.\n\nFrank's main argument is that underdevelopment is a result of a systemic relationship where the core economies maintain their dominance through an unequal exchange system. This system exploits the periphery by paying less than the value of goods produced, thus maintaining the wealth in the core countries. He sees this as part of a historical process where industrialized nations have benefited at the expense of those who remained in pre-industrial stages.\n\nTherefore, Frank's perspective aligns more closely with option C: economically dependent on the wealthy countries that exploit them. However, it's important to note that Frank's theory is complex and multifaceted, emphasizing historical and structural inequalities rather than simple economic dependencies or cultural resistances."
