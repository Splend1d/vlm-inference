                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic.\n\nIn a competitive market, when an excise tax is imposed on the production of a good, the price paid by consumers and received by producers increases by the amount of the tax, assuming no change in supply or demand outside the tax effect. However, the distribution of this tax burden between consumers and producers depends on the elasticity of demand and supply.\n\n- **A** is incorrect because if the demand curve is perfectly elastic ( (which means that any increase in price leads to zero quantity demanded), the entire tax burden would fall on the producer, not necessarily on the amount of the tax. In reality, perfect elasticity is a theoretical concept and not commonly observed in real markets.\n  \n- **B** is incorrect because it suggests that the consumer's burden increases with the elasticity of demand, which contradicts economic principles. In fact, the more inelastic the demand, the larger the portion of the tax burden will be borne by consumers.\n  \n- **C** is incorrect because a tax generally reduces consumer surplus, not increases it. Consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. When a tax is imposed, the price consumers pay increases, thus reducing their surplus.\n\n- **D** is correct because it accurately describes how the burden of the tax is distributed. If the demand for good X is less elastic, meaning that changes in price have a smaller effect on the quantity demanded, then consumers will bear a larger portion of the tax burden compared to producers. This is because the demand curve does not shift significantly in response to a price increase, leaving consumers with fewer alternatives or options to reduce their consumption in response to the higher price. As a result, they are less able to mitigate the impact of the tax through substitution or reduced demand, leading to a greater share of the tax burden being shouldered by consumers."
