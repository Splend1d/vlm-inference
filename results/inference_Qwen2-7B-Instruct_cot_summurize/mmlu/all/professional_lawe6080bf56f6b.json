Subsequently, the jury returns a verdict for Plaintiff. The day after the jury returns its verdict, the court enters judgment for Plaintiff. One week later, Defendant moves to set aside the verdict and have judgment entered in accordance with its motion for directed verdict. In the motion, Defendant raises arguments that were not raised at trial. Plaintiff's counsel objects to the court even hearing the motion to set aside the verdict. Should the court consider the motion?\n\nA. Yes, because Defendant has raised new grounds.\nB. Yes, because Defendant had ten days after the jury returned its verdict within which to move to set aside the verdict.\nC. No, because the court denied the motion for directed verdict rather than reserving ruling.\nD. No, because the court entered final judgment for Plaintiff before the motion to set aside the verdict was filed.\n"

No, because the court entered final judgment for Plaintiff before the motion to set aside the verdict was filed.\n\nIn the context of civil procedure, once a court enters final judgment, it generally ends the litigation on the merits of the case. This means that any further motions or requests by either party, such as a motion to set aside the verdict, must be made within certain time limits and typically cannot introduce new grounds not previously presented to the court during the trial or post-trial motions period. In this scenario, since the court already entered judgment for the plaintiff after the jury verdict, the defendant's subsequent motion to set aside the verdict would likely be precluded by the entry of final judgment. Therefore, the court should not consider the motion based on the principle that the issue has been finally resolved."
