They have a right publicly to remonstrate against the abuses of power in the strongest terms, to put their neighbors upon their guard against the craft or open violence of men in authority, and to assert with courage the sense they have of the blessings of liberty, the value they put upon it, and their resolution at all hazards to preserve it as one of the greatest blessings heaven can bestow.\u2026 But to conclude: The question before the Court and you, Gentlemen of the jury, is not of small or private concern. It is not the cause of one poor printer, nor of New York alone, which you are now trying. No! It may in its consequence affect every free man that lives under a British government on the main of America. It is the best cause. It is the cause of liberty. And I make no doubt but your upright conduct this day will not only entitle you to the love and esteem of your fellow citizens, but every man who prefers freedom to a life of slavery will bless and honor you as men who have baffled the attempt of tyranny, and by an impartial and uncorrupt verdict have laid a noble foundation for securing to ourselves, our posterity, and our neighbors, that to which nature and the laws of our country have given us a right to liberty of both exposing and opposing arbitrary power (in these parts of the world at least) by speaking and writing truth.\n\u2014Andrew Hamilton, concluding argument, libel trial of newspaper editor\nJohn Peter Zenger, August 4, 1735\nAndrew Hamilton assumes which of the following?\n\nA. Americans have more freedoms than people in other countries.\nB. People in other countries have more rights than Americans.\nC. Natural rights are merely ideas that don't really exist.\nD. Rights are granted by the government.\n"

Rights, such as the freedom of speech and opposition to arbitrary power, are being considered natural and inherent to all free men living under a British government in America, rather than granted by the government.\n\nThis aligns with the idea that these rights are fundamental and universally applicable, not dependent on governmental permission or decree. He argues that these rights are essential for preserving liberty and that their defense can lead to respect and admiration from fellow citizens and future generations, as well as serve as a barrier against tyranny."
