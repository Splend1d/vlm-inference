However, they are not necessarily accurate or reliable in all situations. Accuracy and reliability can be compromised if there are are disturbances or changes in the system that are not accounted for by the fixed control actions. Therefore, while simplicity and economy are advantages, accuracy and reliability may not always apply depending on the specific context or requirements of the application."
