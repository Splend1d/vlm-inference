He is sexually active with multiple male and female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He takes no medications. He drinks two to five beers on social occasions. He occasionally smokes marijuana. His temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). There is no lymphadenopathy. Examination shows three sessile, flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of the penis that are 10 mm in diameter. On application of a dilute solution of acetic acid, the lesions turn white. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Oral acyclovir therapy\nB. Oral doxycycline therapy\nC. Intramuscular penicillin therapy\nD. Cryotherapy\n"

Cryotherapy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including the description of three sessile, flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of the penis that turn white when a dilute solution of acetic acid is applied, suggest a diagnosis of genital warts, which are are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is typically transmitted through sexual contact and can cause warts on various parts of the body, including the genital area.\n\nCryotherapy involves using liquid nitrogen to freeze and destroy abnormal cells or growths. It is a common treatment for genital warts because it is minimally invasive, can be performed in an office setting, and effectively removes the lesions. \n\nThe other options listed are less likely to be appropriate:\n\n- A. Oral acyclovir therapy is used for treating herpes simplex virus infections, not genital warts.\n- B. Oral doxycycline therapy is used for treating infections such as chlamydia or certain types of bacterial infections, but it is not effective against HPV-related warts.\n- C. Intramuscular penicillin therapy is used for treating bacterial infections, not viral conditions like genital warts caused by HPV."
