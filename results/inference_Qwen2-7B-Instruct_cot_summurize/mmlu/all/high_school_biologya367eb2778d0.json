It also inhibits the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis) and protein (proteolysis), thus lowering the availability of glucose and amino acids for energy production. \n\nLet's review why the other options are correct:\nA. Thyroxine, also known as T4, when converted to its active form (T3, increases the metabolic rate by stimulating the activity of many enzymes in the body.\nC. Vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone (ADH, does indeed stimulate water reabsorption in the kidneys, helping to conserve water by reducing urine output.\nD. Epinephrine, or adrenaline, increases blood sugar levels through gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, and it also increases heart rate by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system."
