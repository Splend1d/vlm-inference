His concept aimed to address the overcrowding and squalor of industrial cities while also providing a more sustainable and harmonious living environment. The garden city model that Howard envisioned was characterized by:\n\nA. Six small towns surrounded by green belts and linked to a larger central city - This part of Howard's idea involved creating self-contained communities (the \"towns\" - each with its own local governance, services, and industries - that would be nestled within a broader green space known as the \"green belt.\" These smaller towns would be connected to a larger central city or town, allowing for the benefits of both a compact urban center and the natural surroundings of a rural area.\n\nB. Planning cities to have plenty of trees, flowers, and public gardens - While this is not directly mentioned as a key feature of Howard's garden city, it alignes with his overall goal of integrating nature into urban living. The green spaces were intended to provide recreational areas, improve air quality, and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the cities, contributing to a healthier and more pleasant environment for residents.\n\nC. Each privately owned house to have its own front and back garden - This aspect reflects Howard's belief in the importance of individual property rights and personal space. By ensuring that each house had gardens, he sought to create a sense of ownership and pride among residents, which could contribute to community cohesion and well-being.\n\nD. Tower blocks to displace the population vertically and leave most of the land available as green open spaces - This option does not accurately represent Howard's vision. He did not advocate for high-rise buildings but instead emphasized the importance of a balance between residential and green spaces. His garden cities were designed to be spread out horizontally, with ample green belts around them, rather than towering vertically.\n\nIn summary, Howard's idea of the garden city was about creating sustainable, self-contained communities that balanced urban living with access to nature, through the use of green belts, planned layouts, and a focus on individual property rights and environmental stewardship."
