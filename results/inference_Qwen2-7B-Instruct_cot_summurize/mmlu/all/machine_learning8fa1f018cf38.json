In fact, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (now known as SST v3 - Stanford Sentiment Treebank Version 3 - does include both movie reviews and product reviews, including books. It's designed to help researchers in natural language processing tasks related to sentiment analysis.\n\nStatement 2: The Penn Treebank has been used for language modeling. This statement is True. The Penn Treebank is a dataset that has been widely used in computational linguistics research, particularly for tasks involving parsing and language modeling. It provides a rich resource for understanding syntactic structures in English text, making it valuable for various linguistic analyses and machine learning applications."
