All of the above\n\nInternational institutions, according to International Institutionalists, have been designed to address several key problems in the international system:\n\n1. **War**: One of the primary concerns is the prevention or reduction of conflict between states. Institutions like the United Nations and its various agencies, as well as security organizations such as NATO, are designed to provide mechanisms for resolving disputes peacefully, promoting cooperation, and deterring aggression.\n\n2. **Anarchy**: The international system is often described as anarchic because there is no overarching authority that can enforce rules or resolve disputes among states. International institutions help to create a framework of rules and norms that states can adhere to, which can stabilize relations and reduce the likelihood of conflict by providing a set of agreed-upon behaviors.\n\n3. **Collective action and coordination problems**: States often face challenges in coordinating their actions due to the lack of a central authority. This can lead to free-rider problems where states benefit from collective efforts without contributing their fair share. Institutions facilitate cooperation by setting standards, providing incentives for states to comply with shared goals, and creating mechanisms for enforcement or mutual benefits that encourage participation.\n\nThus, international institutions are play crucial roles in addressing these fundamental issues in the international political economy."
