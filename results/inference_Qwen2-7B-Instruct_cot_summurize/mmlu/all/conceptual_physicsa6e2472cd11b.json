In this case, if the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter but retains all of its mass, the mass per unit area (or surface density) increases significantly because the mass is now concentrated over a much smaller volume.\n\nHowever, what directly affects the weight or gravitational force experienced by an object is not just the surface density, but also the actual gravitational acceleration \\(g\\), which is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{GM}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\(M\\) is the mass of the planet,\n- \\(r\\) is the radius of the planet.\n\nSince the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter, its radius becomes \\(r' = \\frac{r}{10}\\). Plugging this into the formula for gravitational acceleration gives us:\n\n\\[ g' = \\frac{GM}{(r/10)^2} = \\frac{GM}{r^2/100} = 100 \\cdot \\frac{GM}{r^2} = 100g \\]\n\nThis means that the gravitational acceleration increases by a factor of 100. Since your weight is proportional to the gravitational acceleration, if the acceleration is 100 times greater, your weight would be 100 times as much, not 1/100 as much.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation based on the question's premise and typical understanding of gravity and planetary mass distribution is that your weight would increase by a factor of 100, making the correct choice C. 100 times as much. My initial response incorrectly suggested option A, so let me clarify: the correct answer is actually C, not A."
