Shortly thereafter, a girl was strolling in the park when the defendant suddenly jumped from his hiding place and accosted her. Although the defendant intended only to rob his victim, he punched her in the mouth and she fell to the ground. The defendant then grabbed her purse and fled. Unknown to the defendant, the girl suffered a fractured skull when her head struck the pavement. She subsequently died from her head injuries.

Felony murder**.\n\nFelony murder is a legal doctrine that holds a person criminally responsible for a death that occurs during the commission of a dangerous felony, even if the death was unintentional or caused by someone other than the defendant. In this case, the defendant committed a dangerous felony (robbery with force (which could be considered an inherently dangerous felony), and a death occurred as a result. Since the defendant did not intend to cause death, but the death was a foreseeable consequence of the felony, they could potentially be charged under felony murder rules.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of the law regarding felony murder can vary significantly between jurisdictions. Additionally, the precise details of the case (like whether the defendant had control over the circumstances leading to the death, or whether there were mitigating factors, would also influence the legal outcome."
