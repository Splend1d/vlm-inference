This is generally considered morally wrong because it involves damaging property without consent, which is typically viewed negatively in society.\nScenario 2 involves drinking vodka during a class you're teaching. While some might argue that this could be seen as unprofessional or irresponsible, particularly if it affects your ability to teach effectively, it's not universally considered a clear-cut moral wrongdoing under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The context and specifics of the situation would play a role in determining the appropriateness of the action."
