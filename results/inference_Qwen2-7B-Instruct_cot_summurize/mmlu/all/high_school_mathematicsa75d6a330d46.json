                    "text": "To determine how many terms in the expansion of \\((m+n)^6\\) are odd when \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd integers, we can use the binomial theorem and properties of odd numbers.\n\nThe binomial theorem states that:\n\\[\n(m+n)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) is a binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(6\\) elements. \n\nGiven that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are both odd, any power of an odd number remains odd ( because the product or sum of odd numbers is always odd.\n\nFor a term in the expansion to be odd, both \\(m^{6-k}\\) and \\(n^k\\) must contribute an odd result. Since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd, this means that \\(m^{6-k}\\) and \\(n^k\\) are already odd. The key factor then becomes the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\).\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) to result in an odd number, \\(k!\\) and \\((6-k)!\\) must not introduce any factors of 2 into the denominator that could cancel out a factor of 2 in the numerator ( (since if they did, the entire fraction would simplify to an even number). This happens when \\(k\\) is not equal to 3, because:\n\n- If \\(k = 0\\) or \\(k = 6\\), \\(\\binom{6}{k} = \\frac{6!}{0!(6-0)!} = 1\\) ( which is odd.\n- If \\(k = 1\\) or \\(k = 5\\), \\(\\binom{6}{k} = \\frac{6!}{1!(6-1)!} = 6\\) which is even.\n- If \\(k = 2\\) or \\(k = 4\\), \\(\\binom{6}{k} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15\\) which is odd.\n- If \\(k = 3\\), \\(\\binom{6}{k} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = 20\\) which is even.\n\nTherefore, the terms where \\(k\\) is not equal to 3 will result in an odd coefficient, making the entire term odd ( since the base numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd. \n\nSo, there are are 4 terms (\\(k = 0, 2, 4, 6\\)) where the coefficient is odd, making the corresponding term in the expansion of \\((m+n)^6\\) odd.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. 4."
