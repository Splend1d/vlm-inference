Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio.

However, the mention of low sperm count could indicate a possible connection to male factor infertility, which might be related to his lung condition if it's severe enough to affect hormonal balance or cause systemic inflammation.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis of COPD, the examination of sputum for eosinophils would not be the most direct method as it is typically associated with allergic conditions like asthma rather than COPD. The sweat chloride test is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, not COPD. Arterial blood gas analysis can provide information about the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood, but it does not specifically confirm COPD.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice to confirm the diagnosis of COPD in this case would be:\n\nD. Sputum cytology\n\nSputum cytology can help identify the presence of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells, which may be indicative of chronic bronchitis, a component of COPD. This test, combined with the other clinical findings, would strongly support the diagnosis of COPD. \n\nHowever, it's important to consider the full clinical picture, including potential systemic effects of lung disease, which could explain the low sperm count. Further evaluation by a pulmonologist or an endocrinologist might be necessary to address all aspects of the patient's health."
