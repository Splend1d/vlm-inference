This indicates a form of reproductive isolation.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Adaptive radiation - This refers to the diversification of an ancestral species into a multitude of different species, each adapted to a specific ecological niche. It doesn't specifically describe the reproductive isolation scenario.\n\nB. Divergent selection - This is a type of natural selection where different traits are favored in different environments or populations, leading to divergence. While it can lead to reproductive isolation over time, it does not directly explain the scenario of offspring failure when breeding with the original phenotype.\n\nC. Equilibrium - This term typically refers to a state where opposing forces are balanced, often used in contexts such as population dynamics where birth and death rates are equal. It does not fit the scenario of reproductive isolation described.\n\nD. Polyploidy - This refers to organisms having more than two sets of chromosomes. In plants, polyploidy can lead to new species formation due to the inability to produce viable gametes (pollen or eggs) compatible with their own, thus creating reproductive isolation. This seems to be the most fitting explanation for the described phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. Polyploidy."
