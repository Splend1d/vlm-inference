They suggest that there's been a shift from promoting critical thinking (option B, which involves analyzing arguments and evidence to form judgments, to reflective reasoning, option C, which involves considering one's own emotions and feelings in depth. However, they specifically highlight emotional reasoning as being more prominently encouraged in the context of campus culture, where students might be overly focused on their feelings and reactions rather than objective analysis or critical evaluation. Therefore, while emotional reasoning is a key focus of their argument, it seems to fit best with option A."
