This relationship is derived from the demand curve for the output produced by labor, as firms will hire more workers if the marginal revenue product of labor (the additional revenue generated by the last worker hired exceeds the wage rate. Thus, the demand for labor is indirectly linked to the demand for the output it helps produce."
