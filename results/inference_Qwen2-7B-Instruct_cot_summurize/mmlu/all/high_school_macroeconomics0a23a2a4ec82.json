Therefore, among the options you've listed, option C alignss most closely with a monetarist point of view:\n\nC. The money supply should be increased steadily.\n\nMonetarists argue that by controlling the growth rate of the money supply, the central bank can influence inflation and employment rates. They believe that if the money supply grows too quickly, it can lead to inflation, while a slower growth rate can help keep inflation under control. They advocate for a steady, predictable growth in the money supply to maintain economic stability.\n\nOptions A and D do not fit well with monetarist principles:\n\nA. Monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy. - Monetarists generally prefer a more hands-off approach to monetary policy, focusing on maintaining a stable money supply growth rate rather than using it to make frequent adjustments to the economy.\n\nD. The velocity of money is unstable. - Monetarists often assume that the velocity of money (the rate at which money circulates within an economy\u2014is relatively stable over time, and thus they focus more on controlling the money supply than on predicting changes in velocity.\n\nOption B, \"Crowding out is not a problem,\" does not directly align with monetarist principles either. While monetarists might argue against excessive government spending leading to higher interest rates and crowding out private investment ( due to the belief in the stable growth rate of the money supply, they would not necessarily dismiss crowding out as an issue outright. Their main concern is the overall level of the money supply and its effect on inflation rather than the specific mechanism of crowding out."
