If a test has a SEM of 15 points:\n\nA. This statement is related to the concept of confidence intervals and the normal distribution. However, it's not accurate because SEM doesn't directly tell us about the percentage of scores within 15 points of the mean score for the entire population. It rather gives an idea of the precision of the mean score.\n\nB. This statement is closer to the actual meaning of SEM. About 68% of the observed scores for any individual around their true score would fall within one SEM of their score. So, if the SEM is 15 points, then about 68% of the individuals with a given score will have observed scores within 15 points above or below their true score.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect. The SEM does not provide information about the percentage of scores that are in error; it tells us about the precision of the test scores relative to the true scores.\n\nD. This statement is also incorrect. Differences up to 30 points do not necessarily represent the same true score. The SEM only tells us about the precision of the individual score relative to the true score, not whether two scores represent the same underlying trait level.\n\nSo, the most correct conclusion based on the SEM being 15 points is option B: about 68% of the individuals with a given score will have observed scores within 15 points of their true score."
