It's not simply the horizontal or vertical summation of these curves. Instead, it involves considering the total demand for all final goods and services at various price levels. This means that the aggregate demand curve reflects the total spending of households, businesses, governments, and foreigners on domestic products across the entire economy.\n\nFor instance, if we have market demand curves for goods like cars, food, and clothing, to find the aggregate demand curve, we would consider the total demand for all these goods combined at different price levels, not just add them up horizontally or vertically. The aggregate demand curve typically slopes downward because as prices fall, more goods are demanded in total due to the purchasing power of consumers' money increasing."
