He had served as a state trooper since 1978, and in 1998, he became fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. In 2006, the trooper retired and immediately started receiving monthly state pension checks. In 2009, the governor of the state signed into law a statute, which provided in part:\"Section 8. Any member of the state law enforcement staff. . . who is convicted of. . . briberyshall not be entitled to receive any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind from the stateSuch conviction shall be considered a breach of the staff member's employment contractSection 12. The provisions of this Act shall be retroactive to December 31, 1975. Section 14. This Act shall take effect immediately. \"Following the enactment of the statute, the state trooper received a letter from the state which stated that pursuant to the statute, the state is immediately discontinuing pension benefit payments to you on account of your 2008 bribery conviction. \"The trooper contacted an attorney, who challenged the discontinuance of benefits on the grounds that the new law was unconstitutional. Assume that the state's highest court holds the statute constitutional. The trooper might still be able to eventually have his pension reinstated if\n\nA. he exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U. S. Supreme Court.\nB. he receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.\nC. he can show that he was convicted before the effective date of thestatute.\nD. he can show that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause.\n"

                    "text": "The trooper may potentially have his pension reinstated through several possible avenues depending on the specific circumstances and legal arguments available. Given the information provided and the options listed, here are the potential courses of action:\n\n### A. Exercising Constitutional Rights to Discretionary Review in the U.S. Supreme Court\n\n**Explanation:** If the state's highest court rules the statute constitutional, the trooper could seek discretionary review by the U.S. Supreme Court. This means he would file a petition with the Supreme Court arguing that the state court's decision presents a significant question of federal law or constitutional law. The Supreme Court has discretion to accept or reject such petitions. If accepted, the case would then be reviewed to determine if the statute is constitutional under federal law.\n\n### B. Receiving a Presidential Pardon for His Bribery Offense\n\n**Explanation:** A presidential pardon would remove the conviction as a barrier to receiving pension benefits. It would essentially absolve him of the crime that the state law relies on to deny him benefits. However, this option would only apply if the president decides to grant the pardon, and it would need to be granted before any final ruling on the constitutionality of the statute or before any other legal actions that could result in reinstating the pension.\n\n### C. Showing That He Was Convicted Before the Effective Date of the Statute\n\n**Explanation:** If the trooper can prove that he was convicted of bribery before the effective date of the statute (December 31, 1975, as per Section 12 of the statute, the conviction would predate the retroactive application of the law. In this scenario, the statute would not apply to his case, and he would likely be entitled to continue receiving pension benefits. However, the exact interpretation of \"convicted\" and whether it includes the sentencing date or the date of conviction might vary, so this would depend on the court's interpretation of the statute.\n\n### D. Showing That the Statute Violates the Dormant Commerce Clause\n\n**Explanation:** The dormant commerce clause refers to the principle that Congress and state governments cannot enact legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce. If the trooper can argue that the statute disproportionately affects out-of-state retirees or otherwise violates principles of interstate commerce, he might have grounds for challenging its constitutionality based on the dormant commerce clause. However, this argument would likely face significant hurdles because the statute appears to be targeting the conduct of a state employee rather than interstate commerce directly.\n\nIn summary, the most direct avenue for the trooper to potentially have his pension reinstated would be through exercising his rights to discretionary review in the U.S. Supreme Court, especially if the state's highest court has already upheld the constitutionality of the statute.
