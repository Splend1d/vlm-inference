This is an absolute moral rule that one must follow regardless of their desires or consequences. According to Kant, a lying promise cannot be universalized without becoming morally unjust. In other words, if everyone lied when making promises, trust and reliability in society would be undermined, leading to chaos and injustice. Therefore, Kant would argue that such an action cannot be morally justified because it cannot be universally applied without causing harm to the very fabric of social cooperation and trust."
