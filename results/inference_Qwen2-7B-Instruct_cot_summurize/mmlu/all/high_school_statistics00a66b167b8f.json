                    "text": "The correct answer is B. I and III only.\n\nExplanation:\nI. This statement is generally true for a \u03c72 test. For a \u03c72 goodness-of-fit test or a \u03c72 test of independence in a contingency table, it is recommended that the expected frequency count in each cell should be at least 5. This rule of thumb helps ensure that the approximation to the \u03c72 distribution is adequate. If the expected counts are too low, particularly if any are less than 1 or a few are between 1 and 5, the \u03c72 test may not be valid, and alternative tests like Fisher's exact test might be more appropriate.\n\nII. This statement is not strictly true. The degrees of freedom (df) for a \u03c72 test in a contingency table are calculated as (r - 1) * (c - 1), where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns. For example, in a 2x2 table, there would be (2 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 1 degree of freedom, not at least 2. Similarly, in a 3x2 table, there would be (3 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 2 degrees of freedom, which is consistent with the idea that you need at least 2 degrees of freedom but does not universally require it. The requirement for degrees of freedom is more about ensuring that the \u03c72 test statistic follows a \u03c72 distribution closely enough for the test to be valid, rather than an absolute minimum.\n\nIII. This statement is true. For a 4x2 two-way table, the formula for degrees of freedom is (r - 1) * (c - 1). Plugging in the values gives us (4 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 3 degrees of freedom.\n\nTherefore, only statements I and III accurately describe the conditions under which \u03c72 procedures are used or how the degrees of freedom are calculated for a specific type of table."
