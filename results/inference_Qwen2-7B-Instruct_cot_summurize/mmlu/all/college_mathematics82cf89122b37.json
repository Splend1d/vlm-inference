                    "text": "To find the minimum value of \\(x + 4z\\) under the constraint \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or geometric intuition.\n\nGeometrically, the constraint \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2\\) represents a sphere centered at the origin with radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). The function \\(x + 4z\\) is a plane that moves parallel to itself as its normal vector changes. To minimize \\(x + 4z\\) subject to the constraint, we want to move this plane as far as possible into the region where the sphere intersects it (but in a direction opposite to the normal vector of the plane.\n\nThe normal vector of the plane \\(x + 4z = k\\) ( (where \\(k\\) is a constant) is \\(\\langle1, 0, 4\\rangle\\). The direction of the plane's movement to minimize \\(x + 4z\\) would be in the opposite direction of this normal vector, which means moving towards the origin along this line.\n\nThe closest point on the sphere to the origin (in the direction opposite to \\(\\langle1, 0, 4\\rangle\\) can be found by considering the direction vector scaled to the radius of the sphere. This direction vector is proportional to \\(\\langle1, 0, 4\\rangle\\), so we can consider a vector pointing directly away from the origin in this direction, scaled by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), the radius of the sphere.\n\nScaling \\(\\langle1, 0, 4\\rangle\\) by \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{5}\\) ( (to ensure the vector has length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)) gives us \\(\\langle\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{5}, 0, \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{5}\\rangle\\). This vector points in the direction of movement from the origin to minimize \\(x + 4z\\).\n\nThe minimum value occurs when this vector is at its endpoint on the sphere, i.e., when the coordinates satisfy \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2\\). Plugging in the values from our scaled vector:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{5}\\right)^2 + 0^2 + \\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{5}\\right)^2 = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{25} + \\frac{32}{25} = 2\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our scaling is correct. Now, to find the minimum value of \\(x + 4z\\), plug in the values:\n\n\\[\nx + 4z = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{5 + 4\\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{5}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{5 + \\frac{16\\sqrt{2}}{5} = \\frac{17\\sqrt{2}}{5}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimum value of \\(x + 4z\\) and asks for it to be expressed in terms of square roots. The calculation above seems to have been misinterpreted; let's correct that:\n\nGiven the direction vector \\(\\langle1, 0, 4\\rangle\\) and scaling it to fit within the sphere, the closest point on the sphere to the origin in this direction would indeed be scaled by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), but the direct calculation for minimizing \\(x + 4z\\) should not involve finding the endpoint coordinates and then computing \\(x + 4z\\) based on those coordinates as I did above.\n\nLet's simplify the approach:\n\nThe direction vector is \\(\\langle1, 0, 4\\rangle\\), and we're interested in the distance of this vector from the origin, which is \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{17}\\). The minimum value of \\(x + 4z\\) will occur in the direction opposite to this vector, scaled to fit within the sphere. The distance from the origin to any point on the sphere in the direction of \\(-\\langle1, 0, 4\\rangle\\) will be maximized when we project the vector onto the sphere, which is essentially the radius of the sphere times the unit vector in that direction.\n\nThe minimum value of \\(x + 4z\\) corresponds to moving as far \"down\" the vector \\(\\langle1, 0, 4\\rangle\\) as possible while staying on the sphere. This is achieved by moving directly in the direction opposite to \\(\\langle1, 0, 4\\rangle\\) from the origin until you hit the sphere. \n\nThe projection of the vector \\(\\langle1, 0,"
