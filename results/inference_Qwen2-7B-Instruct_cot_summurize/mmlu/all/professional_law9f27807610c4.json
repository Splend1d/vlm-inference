She was taken to a hospital where she was treated by a doctor who determined that the woman would need surgery to set the broken bones so that they would heal properly. During the surgery, the doctor inserted several metal screws into the woman's leg to hold the bones together. Although the hospital charged the woman a substantial fee for the doctor's services, the bill did not include a separate charge for the cost of the bone screws. A few months after the surgery, the woman's leg still was not fully healed. The doctor eventually concluded that the screws that were inserted into the woman's leg had been defective. The woman was forced to have a second surgery to replace the defective screws. If the woman asserts a strict tort liability claim against the doctor and the hospital for using defective screws in her surgery, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the doctor and the hospital provided a product to her that was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\nB. prevail, because the doctor and the hospital probably would have realized the screws were defective if they had carefully examined them.\nC. not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws and, therefore, the defect in the screws was not their fault.\nD. not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital will be treated as service providers rather than product sellers.\n"

Strict tort liability typically involves claims against manufacturers or sellers of products, where the plaintiff alleges that the product was defective and caused harm. However, in this case, the doctor and the hospital are being considered service providers, not product sellers, since they did not manufacture the screws themselves but used them as part of their medical treatment services.\n\nUnder the law, service providers are generally not held liable for the quality of products they use, unless it can be proven that they were negligent in selecting or supervising the use of those products. The fact that the screws were defective and caused further injury does not automatically make the doctor and the hospital liable for the defect, as they are not the manufacturers of the product. Therefore, the woman is unlikely to prevail based on the information provided, unless she can demonstrate that the doctor or the hospital was negligent in some way related to the selection or use of the screws."
