According to Moscovici's theory, when the minority leader is viewed by members of the majority as having legitimate power, this can significantly influence the majority's opinion. This is because the perception of legitimacy gives the minority leader's viewpoint greater credibility, making it more persuasive to others within the majority group.\n\nOption A refers to \"idiosyncrasy credits,\" which is a concept related to how individuals in a group can accumulate positive evaluations for being different or unique. However, this does not directly relate to changing the opinion of the majority.\n\nOption B suggests that consistency in expressing an opinion without appearing dogmatic can influence others. While this may contribute to the acceptance of an idea, it is not specifically tied to the dynamics between the majority and minority positions as described by Moscovici.\n\nOption C states that a small numerical difference between the minority and majority can influence the majority's opinion. While this might make the minority's position seem more viable or relevant, it doesn't necessarily guarantee a change in the majority's view. The key factor here is the perceived legitimacy of the minority's leader, as described in option D."
