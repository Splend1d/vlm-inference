He testified that accounting records conclusively demonstrated that the defendant had not committed any type of fraud. On cross-examination of the professor, the prosecuting attorney asked him if he was familiar with a particular treatise. The professor responded affirmatively. The attorney then asked him if the treatise was accepted as authoritative and if he was aware of the conclusions regarding the ability of accountants to detect fraud. The professor responded in the affirmative. The prosecutor now attempts to read the following section of the treatise into evidence: \"It is virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty the existence, or lack thereof, of fraud in the majority of white-collar crime cases, given the sophistication of defendants and the variety of accounting methods available. \"On objection by the defendant's attorney, the trial judge will\n\nA. overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence.\nB. overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence.\nC. sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. sustain the objection, because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nIn this scenario, the treatise is being being offered as evidence through the testimony of the accounting professor who is familiar with it and acknowledges its authority. However, since the treatise itself is not being offered for the truth of its contents but rather as a means to show the professor's knowledge and expertise, it would typically not be admitted as an exhibit or as direct evidence. Instead, the professor's testimony about the treatise could potentially be used to establish their qualifications as an expert witness or to explain their reasoning in their analysis.\n\nThe statements from the treatise, if read into evidence, would likely be considered hearsay, which is a statement made out of court that is offered into court for the truth of the matter asserted. Hearsay is generally not admissible unless it falls under one of several exceptions. Without additional context or specific exceptions applicable in this situation ( such as the treatise being offered for the purpose of showing the professor's methodology, opinions, or expertise rather than the truth of the statements themselves - it is most likely that the judge would sustain the objection and not admit the treatise into evidence.\n\nOption A ( overruling the objection and permitting the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence, would imply that the judge would accept the treatise as substantive evidence, which is unlikely given the nature of the statements.\n\nOption B overruling the objection and permitting only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence, implies that the judge might selectively admit certain parts of the treatise based on whether they align with other evidence presented, which is also not the typical approach for dealing with hearsay.\n\nOption D sustaining the objection because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions, suggests that even though the professor acknowledged familiarity with the treatise, if it was not central to their expert opinion, the treatise itself may not be relevant to their testimony. However, this does not directly address the hearsay issue.\n\nTherefore, based on the standard rules of evidence and the specific concerns raised ( that the treatise is hearsay - the most appropriate action would be for the judge to sustain the objection and not admit the treatise into evidence."
