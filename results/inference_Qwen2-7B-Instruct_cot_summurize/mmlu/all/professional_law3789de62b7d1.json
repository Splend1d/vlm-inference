It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial photographer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the photographer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of a photographic studio in the city. In an action by a studio located in the city challenging the constitutionality of the $200 per year excise tax, the court will most likely declare the tax\n\nA. constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax.\nB. constitutional, as within the powers of the state to tax the instruments of interstate commerce.\nC. unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.\n"

In this case, the tax would be seen as serving the purpose of generating revenue for the city, which is a common and permissible use of taxation powers. \n\nThe fact that there's also a separate tax on itinerant photographers, with a credit system allowing them to offset this with the studio tax, does not necessarily make the studio tax discriminatory or unconstitutional, as long as the credit system is properly structured and does not unfairly disadvantage the studio owners.\n\nOptions B, C, and D could potentially be relevant depending on the specifics of how the tax is applied and its impact on commerce, but based solely on the information provided, the most likely outcome would be that the court finds the $200 tax on studios to be constitutional."
