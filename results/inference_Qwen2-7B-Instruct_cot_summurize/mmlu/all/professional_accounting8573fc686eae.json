Nonsampling risk is not related to the selection of a sample; it involves errors made by the auditor regardless of whether they use sampling or not. So, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. This statement correctly identifies nonsampling risk as arising from situations where the auditor fails to identify material misstatements, which can happen even without using sampling.\n\nC. Sampling risk refers to the risk that the auditor's conclusion based on a sample may differ from what would have been reached if the entire population was examined. It's about the uncertainty associated with using a sample, not the uncertainty in applying audit procedures themselves. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. Sampling risk doesn't include the possibility of selecting inappropriate audit procedures. It is specifically related to the risk associated with using a sample instead of examining the entire population. Hence, this statement is also incorrect."
