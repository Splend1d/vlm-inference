Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the main character fails to provide direct help to a person in danger by only throwing a life vest instead of attempting a rescue or seeking help. This could be seen as neglectful and potentially harmful, depending on the circumstances, as simply throwing an object without further assistance might not save the drowning man. This action can be considered morally wrong because it involves failing to prevent harm or actively causing harm through inaction.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is playing baseball in their grandmother's backyard. This action is generally harmless and does not involve any moral wrongdoing. Assuming the game is conducted safely and within reasonable boundaries, there is no violation of rights or harm inflicted on others."
