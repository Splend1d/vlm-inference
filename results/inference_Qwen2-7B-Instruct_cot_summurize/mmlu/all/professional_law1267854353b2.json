One year later, the buyer sold the house to a woman for $50,000 more than the buyer had paid, conveying it to the woman by a quitclaim deed. Four months after moving in, the woman discovered a number of latent defects in the foundation that caused the house's basement to take on water during heavy rains. The woman contacted the builder about the problem. Toward the end of their heated conversation, the builder yelled at her, \"So get it fixed!\" After the woman had the foundation repaired by a cement contractor at a cost of $25,000, she successfully sued the builder to recover that amount from him. What is the most likely reason that the woman was successful?\n\nA. The court found an implied warranty of habitability from the builder to the buyer that was enforceable by a subsequent buyer.\nB. The court found that by paying the buyer $50,000 more for the house than the buyer had paid the builder, the woman did not get the benefit of her bargain.\nC. The court found that by yelling at the woman to \"get it fixed,\" the builder had committed himself to paying for the repair.\nD. The court found that the defects in the foundation were a breach of the covenant of further assurances in the warranty deed from the builder to the buyer.\n"

                    "text": "A. The court found an implied warranty of habitability from the builder to the buyer that was enforceable by a subsequent buyer.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when a property is conveyed through a warranty deed, there is an implied warranty of habitability. This means that the seller (in this case, the builder) warrants that the property is fit for its intended use and has no known structural or material defects that would make it uninhabitable. Even though the warranty deed does not explicitly state this, courts often recognize this as an implied condition due to the nature of real estate transactions.\n\nThe woman, being the subsequent buyer, could argue that this implied warranty of habitability was breached by the latent defects in the foundation, and thus, she could seek recovery from the original builder. This would allow her to hold the builder accountable for the repairs necessary to restore the house to its habitable condition.\n\nThe other options do not align with standard legal principles:\n\nB. The price difference between the buyer and the seller does not typically have any bearing on the enforceability of warranties or guarantees attached to the sale of a property.\n\nC. Yelling at the woman to \"get it fixed\" might be seen as a hostile or unprofessional interaction, but it does not necessarily establish a contractual obligation for the builder to pay for repairs. Legal obligations are typically based on express agreements or legal implications, rather than emotional outbursts.\n\nD. The covenant of further assurances refers to the obligation of the grantor (the builder in this case\u2014to provide additional assurances or actions to support the title or possession of the property. While it might be relevant in some cases, it does not directly address the issue of latent defects or the implied warranty of habitability in this scenario."
