Their payouts (i.e. dividend or coupons) are made after corporation tax has already been deducted.\n\nEquity represents ownership in a company, and dividends paid to shareholders come out of the company's profits after all expenses, including taxes, have been accounted for. Bonds, on the other hand, are debt instruments, and the interest payments (coupons) are made before corporation tax deductions affect the company's bottom line. \n\nA. They can be issued by firms. - This statement is true; both equity and bonds can be issued by firms to raise capital.\n\nC. Their payouts (i.e. dividends or coupons) are made before corporation tax has been deducted. - This statement is false as explained above.\n\nD. They can be traded on the secondary market. - This statement is true; both equity (stocks) and bonds can be bought and sold on secondary markets like stock exchanges."
