She does not want you to discuss this matter with anyone. To be consistent with the provisions of the ethics codes of the American and Canadian Psychology Association, your best course of action would be to:\n\nA. inform the client of the limits of confidentiality and report the unethical behavior.\nB. inform the client of the limits of confidentiality and contact the other psychologist.\nC. discuss the client's options with her and maintain her confidentiality unless she signs a release.\nD. contact the Ethics Committee to determine what the appropriate steps would be in this situation.\n"

The choice between options A, B, and C depends on the specific details and context, but generally, Option C alignss with the ethical principles:\n\n**C. Discuss the client's options with her and maintain her confidentiality unless she signs a release.**\n\nThis option respects the client's autonomy and privacy while also providing guidance on the available actions. It allows the client to make an informed decision about whether to take any further steps regarding the reported incident, including reporting it to the appropriate authorities or seeking redress through other means. It is important to ensure that the client understands that you will not disclose information without their consent, except in cases where there is an imminent risk of harm to the client or others, as mandated by law.\n\nIt is crucial to maintain open communication with the client throughout this process, ensuring they feel supported and empowered to make decisions that align with their well-being. If the client chooses not to pursue action against the previous psychologist, respecting their wishes while still emphasizing the importance of maintaining professional boundaries and safety is key."
