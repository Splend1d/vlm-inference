Driving in a new location\n\nOlder adults might face challenges while driving in unfamiliar areas due to factors such as difficulty in navigating, reading maps, or using GPS systems effectively. This can increase the risk of traffic accidents. However, it is important to note that age alone doesn't necessarily correlate with an increased risk of accidents; individual skills, health conditions, and driving habits also play significant roles."
