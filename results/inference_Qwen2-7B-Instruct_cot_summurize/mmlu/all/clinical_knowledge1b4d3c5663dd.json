One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care.\n\nAs of 2020, it was estimated that around one in six adults aged 65 or older provided informal care for someone who was ill, frail, or disabled. This statistic highlights the significant role that informal carers play in supporting vulnerable individuals within their communities. \n\nIt's important to note that options A, C, and D are do not accurately reflect the general consensus on the status of informal carers as of 2020:\n\n- Option A claims that 50% of over 65s provide informal care, which would imply an extremely high proportion of this age group is involved in caregiving activities, likely an overestimation based on available data.\n- Option C suggests that informal carers should not be included in discharge planning. This statement is false because involving informal carers in healthcare decision-making, including discharge planning, is crucial to ensure the continuity of care and support for both the patient and the caregiver.\n- Option D states that the majority of informal carers are fit and active, which may not necessarily be true. The health status of informal carers can vary widely depending on their age, personal health conditions, and other life circumstances."
