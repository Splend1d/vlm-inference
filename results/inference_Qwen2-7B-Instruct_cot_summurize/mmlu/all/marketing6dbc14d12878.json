These stages typically include Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline. This model helps businesses understand how consumer demand for a product changes over time and plan accordingly for marketing, production, and sales strategies.\n\n- **Introduction**: The product is launched into the market.\n- **Growth**: Sales increase as the product gains popularity.\n- **Maturity**: Sales stabilize as the market becomes saturated.\n- **Decline**: Sales start to decrease as new products enter the market or consumers' needs shifts.\n\nUnderstanding this lifecycle can help businesses make informed decisions about when to invest in marketing, how to adjust pricing strategies, and whether to phase out a product."
