The goal is to help the individual learn that the feared object or situation does not necessarily lead to an anxiety response when they are calm.\n\nThe steps typically involved in systematic desensitization are:\n1. Constructing a hierarchy of feared images or situations.\n2. Teaching the client relaxation techniques (such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization.\n3. Instructing the client to visualize each feared image while maintaining a relaxed state.\n\nHypnosis is not typically used as a step in systematic desensitization. Hypnosis can be used as a technique for inducing a state of relaxation, but it is not a standard component of the systematic desensitization process, which primarily relies on guided imagery and relaxation training."
