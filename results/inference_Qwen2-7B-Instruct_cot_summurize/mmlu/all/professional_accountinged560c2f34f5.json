In this case, Stark Co.'s legal counsel believes there's a reasonable possibility of an unfavorable outcome with damages ranging from $100,000 to $150,000. Therefore, Stark should accrue the minimum estimate of $100,000. Additionally, Stark should disclose the maximum possible exposure, which is $150,000, in the notes to its financial statements. This provides transparency to stakeholders about the potential financial impact of the lawsuit."
