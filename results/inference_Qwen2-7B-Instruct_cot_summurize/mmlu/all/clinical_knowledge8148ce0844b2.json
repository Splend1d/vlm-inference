To ensure best lung expansion and accuracy and consistency of readings.\n\nStanding or sitting upright maximizes lung capacity by allowing the diaphragm to fully expand, which in turn leads to more accurate measurements of peak flow rate. This position ensures that the patient is using their lungs to their full capacity, providing a more reliable reading. It also helps maintain consistency across different readings for comparison."
