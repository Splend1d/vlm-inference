                    "text": "In 1985, a landowner, the undisputed owner of an apartment building, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the landowner died leaving no heirs. In her will, the landowner left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America. The apartment building was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the landowner died, the tenant, having learned of the landowner's death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts of America organization was unaware of the landowner's gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Girl Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the apartment building. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. In an ejection action by the Girl Scouts of America against the tenant, the organization will prevail\n\nA. because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\nB. if the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.\nC. if the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\nD. because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is C. if the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\n\nUnder the concept of adverse possession, the tenant would need to have occupied the property openly, notoriously, and continuously for at least 20 years without permission from the rightful owner to gain legal title to the property. However, if the tenant believes that the lease with the deceased landowner was still in effect after the latter's death, this belief could potentially prevent the tenant from establishing adverse possession. \n\nIn this scenario, the tenant would likely have a defense against the Girl Scouts' claim to the property because the lease continued in effect after the landowner's death until it expired or was terminated according to its terms. The tenant's belief in the continuation of the lease would not necessarily be legally valid, but it would provide a basis for the tenant to argue that they were not occupying the property as an adverse possessor. \n\nThe other options do not directly address the legal requirements for adverse possession or provide a valid defense for the tenant:\n\nA. Discontinuing payment of rent following the landowner's death does not automatically disqualify the tenant from adverse possession; it depends on whether the tenant otherwise meets the criteria for adverse possession.\n\nB. Leasing the property to another party during the tenant's absence due to military service does not affect the tenant's status under adverse possession laws, unless the tenant has abandoned the lease or the property.\n\nD. Not paying property taxes does not typically affect a tenant's rights under adverse possession laws, although tax liens could eventually lead to a loss of title through a process known as tax foreclosure."
