                    "text": "An elderly married couple was shopping in a crowded retail store. The husband was several feet ahead of his wife when she saw him slip and lose his balance. He was able to prevent a fall by holding onto a counter. Wife saw something sticky on a wide part of the floor but became disoriented by seeing her husband slipping and gripping the counter. With other shoppers behind her, she stepped forward and fell on the wet floor, breaking her hip, and requiring extensive complicated surgeries. She sued the store for negligent maintenance. She proved through discovery that the retailer did not clean the mess soon enough and did not put up a warning sign. The store filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, alleging that the wife voluntarily assumed the risk as a matter of law. The trial court agreed, ruling there was no issue of material fact in dispute for the jury to decide. On appeal, is it likely that the appellate court will reverse and remand for a new trial?\n\nA. No, because wife proceeded to encounter a known danger voluntarily, thereby assuming the risk of injury as a matter of law and there were no material issues of fact for a jury to decide.\nB. No, because even taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party under Rule 56, it is nonetheless clear that she knew there was a danger and she accepted the risk.\nC. Yes, because there is evidence that raises a material issue of fact whether the wife was in an emergency where she did not have time to deliberate on whether to move forward.\nD. Yes, because the store was strictly liable to the wife, who was a customer invited on the premises to do business and the store had to protect her.\n"

Yes, because there is evidence that raises a material issue of fact whether the wife was in an emergency where she did not have time to deliberate on whether to move forward.\n\nIn this scenario, the wife was faced with a sudden and unexpected situation: her husband slipping and potentially falling. Given the context, it's plausible that she was disoriented and unable to assess the risk of proceeding further carefully or immediately take protective actions due to the urgency of ensuring her husband's safety. This situation could be considered an emergency, and under such circumstances, one might argue that the wife did not voluntarily assume the risk in the traditional sense, as she was responding to an immediate threat rather than deliberately choosing to expose herself to a known danger.\n\nThe appellate court would likely consider whether the trial court correctly ruled that there was no issue of material fact for the jury to decide. If the court determines that there is sufficient evidence suggesting that the wife was in an emergency and thus did not voluntarily assume the risk, they may reverse the lower court's decision and remand the case for a new trial, allowing the jury to weigh the facts and determine if the wife's actions were a result of an emergency response or voluntary assumption of risk."
