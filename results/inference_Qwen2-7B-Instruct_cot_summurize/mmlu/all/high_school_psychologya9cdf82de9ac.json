This concept is central to Carl Jung's analytical psychology and is distinct from the personal unconscious proposed by Sigmmond Freud.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\n- A. fictional finalisms: This term does not align with Jungian psychology. It doesn't refer to any concept within the collective unconscious.\n  \n- B. complexes: Complexes are indeed part of Jung's theory, but they are more closely associated with the personal unconscious rather than the collective unconscious. Jung described complexes as relatively isolated centers of personality that develop due to repressed or denied feelings, experiences, or attitudes.\n\n- C. archetypes: These are concepts found in Jung's collective unconscious. Archetypes are universal patterns of thought and behavior that are believed to be common across human cultures and species. They include symbols such as the hero, the mother, the trickster, and the shadow, which can manifest in dreams, myths, art, and daily life.\n\n- D. feelings of inferiority: Feelings of inferiority can be related to personal complexes or issues that may have their roots in the personal unconscious, rather than being a direct component of the collective unconscious.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. archetypes."
