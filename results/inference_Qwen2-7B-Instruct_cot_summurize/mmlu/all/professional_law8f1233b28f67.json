The owner of the motel is prosecuted for violating the statute by showing pornographic movies in the motel rooms.

In the United States, the Supreme Court has established a framework for determining what constitutes \"obscene\" material under the First Amendment. Generally, for material to be considered obscene, it must lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. However, this determination is made within the context of community standards.\n\nIn the specific scenario presented, the motel rooms are not considered \"public areas\" for the purposes of applying the state statute against showing obscene films. The fact that the films are shown in private rooms occupied by consenting adults means that the case would likely be evaluated under the First Amendment's protection of privacy in one's home or personal space, as well as the protection of speech and expression between consenting adults.\n\nGiven that the movies are shown in private rooms and the consent of the individuals involved, the owner's conviction would most likely be overturned based on the right of consenting adults to view such films in private, assuming the films do not fall under the legal definition of obscenity according to prevailing community standards and the aforementioned constitutional protections."
