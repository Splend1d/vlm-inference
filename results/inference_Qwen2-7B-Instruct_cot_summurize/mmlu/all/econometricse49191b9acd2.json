(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nExplanation:\n\n(i) The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) are often hard to interpret in practice: This statement is true because ACF and PACF plots can sometimes be complex, especially when dealing with non-stationary data or data with high autocorrelation. They require experience and understanding of time series analysis to interpret correctly.\n\n(ii) The ACF and PACF can be difficult to calculate for some data sets: While this might not be universally true as most statistical software packages can easily compute ACF and PACF, it could be more challenging to calculate these functions accurately if the data set is very large, has missing values, or exhibits extreme variability.\n\n(iii) Information criteria represent an alternative approach to model order determination: This statement is true. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (HQIC) are indeed used as alternatives to interpreting ACF and PACF plots for determining the appropriate order of an ARIMA model or other time series models.\n\n(iv) If applied correctly, the ACF and PACF will always deliver unique model selections: This statement is false. While ACF and PACF plots are useful tools for identifying potential orders of an ARIMA model, they do not guarantee unique model selection. There can be multiple valid models that fit the data well, and additional criteria such as information criteria, residual diagnostics, and theoretical considerations are typically needed to make final model choices."
