                    "text": "The correct answer is B. the skewed salary distribution tells us that assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied.\n\nWhen constructing a confidence interval, particularly a t-confidence interval, one of the key assumptions is that the data are normally distributed or that the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply, ensuring the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal. In this case, the salaries are described as being right-skewed, which means they are not normally distributed. This skewness suggests that the data are asymmetrically distributed with a longer tail on the higher end. \n\nGiven that the sample size is only 20, which is relatively small, it may not be sufficient to rely on the Central Limit Theorem to ensure the sampling distribution of the mean is normal. As a result, using a t-confidence interval might not be appropriate, as it assumes normality of the population or the sampling distribution of the mean.\n\nIt's worth noting that the other options can also lead to issues when forming a confidence interval:\n\n- Option A ( suggests that the sample size is too small relative to the total population, which could indeed be a concern for representativeness, but it does not directly relate to the appropriateness of using a t-distribution for forming a confidence interval under these circumstances.\n  \n- Option C indicates that the population standard deviation is unknown, which is generally a reason to use a t-distribution rather than a z-distribution for forming a confidence interval. However, this issue doesn't specifically address the problem caused by the skewed distribution of the data.\n  \n- Option D mentions the negotiability of salaries, which does not affect the statistical assumptions required for forming a confidence interval. The negotiability of the superintendent's salary would not justify excluding it from the sample, nor does it impact the applicability of the t-distribution under the given conditions."
