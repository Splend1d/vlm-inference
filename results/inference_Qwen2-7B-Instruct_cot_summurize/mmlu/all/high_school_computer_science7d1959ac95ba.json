This loop will terminate when number reaches an even number less than or equal to 0. After exiting the loop, it checks if the final value of number is exactly 0. \n\nGiven this logic:\n\n- If the initial value of `number` is even and greater than 0, it will reach 0 exactly after half of its value (decremented by 2 each time. In this case, the procedure will return `true`.\n- If the initial value of `number` is odd, it will not reach 0 in a single step because it's reduced by 2 each iteration. It will exit the loop at some even number before reaching 0, and since the final check compares against 0, it will return `false`.\n- If the initial value of `number` is 0, the procedure will immediately return `true` as it satisfies the condition inside the `IF` statement without entering the loop.\n- For any other initial value that makes the loop run (like even numbers less than 0, the same logic applies: they will reach 0, and the procedure will return `true`.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is even, and it otherwise returns false."
