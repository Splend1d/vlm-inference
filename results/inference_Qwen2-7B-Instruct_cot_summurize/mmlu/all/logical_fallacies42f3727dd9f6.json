                    "text": "The \"fallacy of composition\" occurs when someone assumes that what is true for a part of something must also be true for the whole thing. For example, if every member of a sports team is good at their position, it doesn't necessarily mean the team as a whole will perform well.\n\nIf Heather's actions (or lack thereof in making the third option into the correct answer for number 8 are being being used to draw conclusions about a larger group or situation (such as assuming all members of a team, class, or organization behave similarly based on one person's actions), then yes, you're correct. This would indeed be an example of the fallacy of composition.\n\nHowever, without more specific information about the context and the argument being made, it's hard to definitively say whether the situation is actually an instance of the fallacy of composition. The other options you've listed are:\n\nA. **Gambler's Fallacy** - This fallacy involves believing that past events influence the likelihood of future independent events. For example, thinking that after several coin flips landing heads up, a tail is 'due' next.\n\nB. **Equivocation** - This fallacy happens when someone uses a word or phrase with multiple meanings in an argument, causing confusion or misleading the audience.\n\nC. **Appeal to Pity** - This fallacy involves using emotional appeals based on sympathy rather than logical arguments. It's when an argument is made based on the emotional impact rather than factual evidence or logical reasoning.\n\nGiven your description, if the argument is making a broad statement about a group based on the behavior of a single individual without considering the possibility that the same principles might not apply to the group as a whole, then it sounds like the fallacy of composition. If you have more details about the argument in question, I could help clarify further!"
