To find their daily travel distance, divide the total miles by the number of days:\n\n\\[ \\text{Daily travel distance of humpback whales} = \\frac{2240 \\text{ miles}}{28 \\text{ days}} = 80 \\text{ miles/day} \\]\n\nIf they had traveled at this rate for 32 days, we multiply the daily distance by 32:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total distance in 32 days} = 80 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 32 \\text{ days} = 2560 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, we compare this total distance to the distance the gray whales traveled in 32 days, which is 2,368 miles:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 2520 \\text{ miles} - 2368 \\text{ miles} = 152 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNone of the options provided (A. 128, B. 192, C. 280, D. 408 match the calculated difference of 152 miles.
