In fact, the Indus Valley Civilization was known for its urban planning and organization. The residential areas were laid out in a grid-like pattern, with streets running north-south and east-west, and the buildings were constructed with standardized brick sizes and shapes, indicating a high level of planning and standardization. The presence of a citadel and monumental walls also align with archaeological findings from the Indus Valley cities."
