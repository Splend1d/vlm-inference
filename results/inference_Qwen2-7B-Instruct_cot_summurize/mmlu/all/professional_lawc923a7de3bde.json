For 15 years, a commercial fisherman had kept a daily log of the water level at his dock on the riverbank opposite the land in order to forecast fishing conditions. The plaintiff hired a draftsman to graph the data from the fisherman's logs for use as a trial exhibit. At trial, the fisherman testified to the care with which he had made the measurements and recorded them in his logs, which had been made available for the defendant's inspection. The draftsman then testified to the manner in which he had prepared the graphs. With this foundation, are the graphs admissible?\n\nA. No, because they are hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because they violate the \"best evidence\" rule.\nC. Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\nD. Yes, as the draftsman's expert opinion of the water levels.\n"

Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\n\nIn legal terms, these graphs would likely be admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), which allows for the admission of a summary of voluminous documents when the original documents are are too numerous or lengthy to conveniently be inspected by the trier of fact. In this scenario, the daily logs of the fisherman, if they were extensive, might qualify as voluminous records. The draftsman's creation of a summary (or graph) of this information would serve as an acceptable substitute for the full set of logs during the trial, provided that the foundation laid out is sufficient to establish the accuracy and reliability of the graphs."
