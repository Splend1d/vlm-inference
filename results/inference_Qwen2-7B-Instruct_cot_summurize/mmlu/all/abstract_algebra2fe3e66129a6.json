                    "text": "To determine if the relation ~ is not anti-symmetric, transitive, reflexive, or symmetric, we need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of relations:\n\n1. **Reflexive**: A relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself. That is, for all \\(a\\) in set \\(A\\), \\((a, a) \\in ~\\). In other words, every element must have an arrow pointing back to itself.\n\n2. **Symmetric**: A relation is symmetric if for all \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in set \\(A\\), if \\((a, b) \\in ~\\), then \\((b, a) \\in ~\\). This means that if there's a pair going from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\), there should also be a pair going from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Anti-symmetric**: A relation is anti-symmetric if for all \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in set \\(A\\), if both \\((a, b) \\in ~\\) and \\((b, a) \\in ~\\), then \\(a = b\\). This means that if there's a pair going from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) and another from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be the same element.\n\n4. **Transitive**: A relation is transitive if for all \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in set \\(A\\), if \\((a, b) \\in ~\\) and \\((b, c) \\in ~\\), then \\((a, c) \\in ~\\). This means that if there are are paths from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) and from \\(b\\) to \\(c\\), then there should also be a direct path from \\(a\\) to \\(c\\).\n\nGiven the relation ~ as \\({(1, 2), {1, 3), {4, 2)}\\):\n\n- **Reflexive**: This relation does not include any pairs where both elements are the same (i.e., it doesn't contain \\((1, 1)\\), \\((2, 2)\\), \\((3, 3)\\), or \\((4, 4)\\). Therefore, it is **not reflexive**.\n\n- **Symmetric**: This relation includes \\((1, 2)\\) but not \\((2, 1)\\), \\((1, 3)\\) but not \\((3, 1)\\), and \\((4, 2)\\) but not \\((2, 4)\\). Thus, it is **not symmetric**.\n\n- **Anti-symmetric**: For anti-symmetry, if \\((a, b)\\) is in the relation, \\((b, a)\\) cannot be in the relation unless \\(a = b\\). Since \\((1, 2)\\), \\((1, 3)\\), and \\((4, 2)\\) do not violate this rule (because there are no corresponding \\((2, 1)\\), \\((3, 1)\\), or \\((2, 4)\\) pairs, it might seem like it could potentially be anti-symmetric. However, since it is not symmetric, it cannot be anti-symmetric because one of the conditions for anti-symmetry requires symmetry ( which is not met here. So, while it doesn't directly violate the anti-symmetric property, the lack of symmetry means it cannot be considered anti-symmetric.\n\n- **Transitive**: To check for transitivity, we look for any instances where \\((a, b)\\) and \\((b, c)\\) exist, and \\((a, c)\\) should also exist. In this case:\n    - There is no \\((a, b)\\) and \\((b, c)\\) pair combination present that would require a \\((a, c)\\) pair. Since there are no such combinations in the given relation, we cannot find a counterexample to disprove transitivity. Therefore, based on the provided pairs, the relation is **transitive**.\n\nSo, the correct answers are based on the analysis above are:\n\n- **B. Transitive**"
