The equator is also part of the geographic coordinate system, serving as one of the reference lines for latitude measurements. However, distance to the nearest city does not provide an absolute location in geographic terms; it offers a relative position based on proximity to a named urban area. Absolute location requires a precise measurement that can be pinpointed globally, such as coordinates or a combination of geographic names and their specific locations on maps."
