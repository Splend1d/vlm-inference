Researchers can exercise greater control over experiments than in naturalistic observation. \n\nIn an experiment, researchers manipulate one or more variables to observe the effect on another variable, while controlling for other variables. In contrast, naturalistic observation involves observing subjects in their natural environment without any manipulation by the researcher, making it harder to control variables."
