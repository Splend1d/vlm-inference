This relationship is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{pKa} + \\log_{10}[HA]) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- pH is the measured pH of the solution (4.26 in this case,\n- pKa is the acid dissociation constant of the acid, which we're trying to find,\n- [HA] is the concentration of the undissociated acid.\n\nGiven that we have 0.25 mol of the acid in 0.25 L of solution, the initial concentration of the acid ([HA]) is:\n\n\\[ [HA] = \\frac{\\text{moles of acid}}{\\text{volume of solution}} = \\frac{0.25 \\text{ mol}}{0.25 \\text{ L}} = 1 \\text{ M} \\]\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for pKa:\n\n\\[ \\text{pKa} = 2(\\text{pH}) - \\log_{10}[HA] \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{pKa} = 2(4.26) - \\log_{10}(1) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{pKa} = 8.52 - 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{pKa} = 8.52 \\]\n\nTherefore, the pKa of this weak acid is 8.52, which corresponds to option B."
