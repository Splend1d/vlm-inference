                    "text": "A woman who was three months pregnant enrolled in a pre-natal and post-natal exercise program at the local gymnasium. The contract signed by the woman was to last for one year and called upon the woman to pay $2,000 in quarterly payments of $500. The contract also specified that all fees were non-refundable. Upon signing the contract, the woman made her first payment of $500 and started classes the next day. The woman attended classes on a regular basis for the next three months. At the end of the three-month period, the woman was involved in an automobile accident. Although she was not seriously injured, her doctor advised the woman that she needed complete rest. Her doctor told her to avoid strenuous activity and advised her to discontinue her pre-natal exercise classes. One week later, the woman received a billing notice from the gymnasium, indicating that her second installment payment of $500 was past due. She immediately telephoned the manager of the gymnasium and informed him that she would not be attending any further classes because of her accident. Also, the woman said she did not feel obligated to make any additional payments. Which of the following most accurately describes the woman's duty to pay the gymnasium the second installment fee of $500?\n\nA. It would be excused, because of impossibility of performance.\nB. It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.\nC. It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.\nD. It would be not excused, because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.\n\nIn this scenario, the essential purpose of the contract between the woman and the gymnasium was for the woman to receive pre-natal and post-natal exercise services over the course of a year. However, due to the automobile accident and subsequent medical advice to avoid strenuous activity, the woman is unable to fulfill the main objective of the contract, which is to attend exercise classes. This makes it impossible for her to continue with the agreement as intended, thus frustrating the purpose of the contract.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. \"Excused, because of impossibility of performance\" could apply if there were an unforeseen event that makes it physically impossible for the woman to perform her obligations under the contract, such as being in a location where the gymnasium is inaccessible. However, in this case, the main issue is the inability to engage in the exercise program due to medical advice, not physical impossibility.\n\nC. \"Would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.\" While this might seem applicable given the non-refundable clause, the key consideration here is whether the contract's primary purpose can be fulfilled. In this case, it cannot, making the contract effectively unenforceable against the woman.\n\nD. \"Would not be excused, because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.\" This option suggests that the woman is still bound by her obligation to pay the second installment despite the frustration of the contract's purpose. However, the frustration of the contract's purpose generally means that both parties are no longer bound by their obligations under the contract, including payment obligations, when the contract's essential purpose is thwarted."
