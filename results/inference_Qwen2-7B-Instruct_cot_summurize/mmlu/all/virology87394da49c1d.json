Both a and b\n\nThe risk of perinatal transmission of HIV-1 infection can be increased by mixed feeding ( (the combination of breastfeeding and supplementing with other foods or liquids) and very early introduction of solids, because these practices may increase the baby's exposure to HIV in the mother's milk or through other means. However, it's important to note that the risk can be significantly reduced by antiretroviral therapy for the mother during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and breastfeeding."
