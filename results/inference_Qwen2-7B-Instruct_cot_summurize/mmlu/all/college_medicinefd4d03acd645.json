The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one\n\nThe bystander effect suggests that individuals are less likely to help someone in need when there are are more people around. This phenomenon can be influenced by factors such as perceived risk, the number of potential helpers, and the perceived responsibility to act. In this scenario, if the pedestrian perceives the young woman as wealthier than himself, it might initially increase his likelihood of helping since he might feel less personally responsible or threatened. However, the bystander effect could still come into play due to the presence of other people (option B) or because of the individual's own hesitation to take action in front of others (option D). \n\nOption C ( the person requiring aid being of the same ethnicity, doesn't necessarily change the bystander effect in the way described. The bystander effect is often explained through social psychological theories that don't typically consider ethnic similarity as a primary factor.\n\nOption D, the presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl, could potentially decrease the pedestrian's sense of personal responsibility to act, as they might believe that the other person will provide assistance. This aligns with the bystander effect theory, which posits that the presence of others can reduce the likelihood of an individual offering help."
