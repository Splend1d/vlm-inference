Proximity.\n\nThe principle of proximity in Gestalt psychology suggests that elements that are close to each other in space are tend to be perceived as a group. In the case of the word \"in car n a t e,\" your brain groups the letters 'c', 'a', and 'r' together due to their close proximity, making it easier for you to perceive the word 'car'. The other letters are less prominent because they are further apart from each other. This grouping helps in simplifying our visual world and make sense of complex stimuli by categorizing them into meaningful units."
