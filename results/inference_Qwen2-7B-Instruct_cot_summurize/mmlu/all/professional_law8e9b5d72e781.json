In order to finance the purchase of the property in 2005, the landowner borrowed $100,000 from the bank, which secured the loan with a mortgage that amortized principal and interest payments over a 15-year period. The bank promptly recorded the mortgage. This jurisdiction has the following recording statute in effect:\"Any unrecorded conveyance or mortgage is invalid as against a subsequent bonafide purchaser for value without notice who records first. \"In 2006, the landowner subdivided the property into three one-acre lots. He sold lot ito his friend for $75,000. The following year, the landowner sold lot 2 to his brother for $60,000. The landowner continued to reside on lot 3. When the landowner sold lots 1 and 2 to the friend and the brother, the deeds did not make any reference to the original mortgage between the landowner and the bank. In 2009, the landowner was laid off from his job and went into default on his mortgage payments. The bank is now about to institute foreclosure proceedings. Which of the following most accurately states the rights and obligations of the parties?\n\nA. The bank can foreclose only on lot 3 because ownership to that parcel is retained by the landowner, the original mortgagor.\nB. The bank has the option of foreclosing on parcels 1, 2, or 3 because the mortgage covered the entire three-acre tract.\nC. The bank must first foreclose on lot 3, and if the proceeds are insufficient, then the mortgagee may foreclose against lots 1 and 2 in the inverse order of their alienation.\nD. The bank can foreclose on lot 3, but not on lots I and 2 unless the friend and the brother assumed the mortgage when they purchased their land from the landowner.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The bank must first foreclose on lot 3, and if the proceeds are insufficient, then the mortgagee may foreclose against lots 1 and 2 in the inverse order of their alienation.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Recording Statute**: The jurisdiction has a recording statute in place, meaning that any unrecorded conveyance or mortgage is invalid as against a subsequent bona fide purchaser for value without notice who records first. This implies that the landowner's sales of lots 1 and 2 were potentially unrecorded, and the bank ( being a subsequent bona fide purchaser for value without notice after recording the mortgage, would have priority over these sales.\n\n2. **Mortgage Coverage**: The mortgage was taken out on the entire three-acre tract, covering all three lots. Therefore, the bank has the right to foreclose on the entire property to recover the debt.\n\n3. **Foreclosure Order**: Given the recording statute and the fact that the mortgage was properly recorded, the bank can proceed with foreclosure on the entire property. However, the bank must follow the order of alienation ( that is, it must attempt to recoup the full amount owed from the last property sold ( i.e., lot 3, before moving to foreclose on the earlier properties ( lots 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Assumption of Mortgage**: The friend and the brother, who bought lots 1 and 2, did not assume the mortgage when purchasing. Without assumption, they do not have an obligation to pay the mortgage debt. If the foreclosure proceeds from lot 3 are insufficient, the bank would then pursue foreclosure on lots 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately reflects the rights and obligations of the parties based on the information provided."
