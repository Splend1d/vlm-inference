Critics argue that utilitarianism, which focuses on maximizing overall happiness or utility, might not adequately account for these\u9ad8\u5c1a actions that are good in themselves but do not contribute directly to the greatest happiness principle. This can lead to a critique that utilitarianism undervalues virtuous actions that are not part of the most efficient means to maximize happiness."
