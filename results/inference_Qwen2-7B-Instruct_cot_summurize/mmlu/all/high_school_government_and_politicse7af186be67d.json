The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nAmerican federalism refers to the division of power between the national (federal) government and the state governments. It ensures that powers not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment specifically states this principle by reserving powers not delegated to the federal government back to the states or the people. This directly reflects the concept of federalism in the United States. \n\nA. The system of checks and balances among the three branches of the national government is an example of the internal balance within the federal government, not federalism between the federal and state governments.\n\nB. The process by which international treaties are completed involves the federal government's role as the representative of the nation in foreign affairs, not the division of power between federal and state governments.\n\nC. The special constitutional status of Washington, D.C., is a unique case because it does not have full statehood but has elements of both federal and state characteristics due to its specific constitutional provisions. However, this is not a general principle of federalism, which primarily deals with the relationship between the federal and state governments."
