This could include considerations of sovereignty, the impact of immigration on domestic populations, and the ethical implications of admitting immigrants versus prioritizing citizens' needs for resources and opportunities.\n\nStatements A, B, and D do not necessarily contradict the idea that self-governance is morally relevant; they focus more on specific aspects of immigration policy and its economic impacts or potential negative effects on citizens. However, without direct insight into Macedo's specific views, this interpretation is speculative."
