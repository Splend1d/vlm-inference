Then, we calculate the truth value for each part of the argument: the premise (I \u2228 J and the conclusion I, based on the given equivalence I \u2261 ~J.\n\nHere's how you would set up the truth table:\n\n```\nI | J | ~J | I \u2261 ~J | I \u2228 J | Conclusion\n----------------------------------------------\nT | T | F  |  F     |  T    |  T\nT | F | T  |  T    |  T    |  T\nF | T | F  |  F    |  T    |  F\nF | F | T  |  T    |  F    |  F\n```\n\nLet's break down each row:\n1. **Row 1**: I is True, J is True.\n   - ~J is False ( (since J is True)\n   - I \u2261 ~J is False ( (since I is True but ~J is False)\n   - I \u2228 J is True ( (since both I and J are True)\n   - Conclusion is True ( (matches the premise)\n\n2. **Row 2**: I is True, J is False.\n   - ~J is True  ( (since J is False)\n   - I \u2261 ~J is True  ( (since I is True and ~J is True)\n   - I \u2228 J is True  ( (since I is True)\n   - Conclusion is True  ( (matches the premise)\n\n3. **Row 3**: I is False, J is True.\n   - ~J is False  ( (since J is True)\n   - I \u2261 ~J is False  ( (since I is False but ~J is False)\n   - I \u2228 J is True  ( (since J is True)\n   - Conclusion is False  ( (does not match the premise)\n\n4. **Row 4**: I is False, J is False.\n   - ~J is True  ( (since J is False)\n   - I \u2261 ~J is True  ( (since I is False and ~J is True)\n   - I \u2228 J is False  ( (since neither I nor J are True)\n   - Conclusion is False  ( (does not match the premise)\n\nFrom the truth table, it's clear that the argument is invalid because there are at least one row where the premises (I \u2228 J) are true, but the conclusion (I) is false (specifically in Row 3. \n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and J is false**. However, I made a mistake in interpreting the counterexample choice in the original answer. The correct interpretation based on the provided choices should focus on identifying a scenario where the argument's conclusion does not logically follow from its premises. In this case, the counterexample presented in option C does indeed show an instance where the argument is invalid ( specifically, when I is true and J is false, the conclusion I is false, contradicting the premise I \u2228 J being true. Therefore, the correct answer aligns with the identified counterexample, confirming the argument's invalidity."
