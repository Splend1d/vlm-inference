This action is generally considered morally wrong as it involves causing unnecessary suffering to an innocent creature.\n\nIn Scenario 2, using medical training to develop bioweapons goes against ethical principles in the medical field and international laws concerning weapons development. It involves the misuse of skills intended for healing and improving human health for the purpose of causing harm, which is morally wrong."
