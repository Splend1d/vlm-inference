It has order \\(5! = 120\\), so it contains 120 elements.\n\nThe subgroup generated by an element \\(p\\) is denoted by \\(\\langle p \\rangle\\). In this case, \\(p = ( (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3)\\), which is a product of two cycles: a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle. The order of the subgroup \\(\\langle p \\rangle\\) is the least common multiple (lcm of the lengths of the disjoint cycles in \\(p\\).\n\nThe cycle decomposition of \\(p\\) is given as:\n\n\\[p = ( (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3)\\]\n\nThis shows that \\(p\\) is composed of a 4-cycle \\((1, 2, 5, 4)\\) and a 2-cycle \\((2, 3)\\). The lengths of these cycles are 4 and 2, respectively.\n\nThe lcm of 4 and 2 is 4, which means the order of \\(\\langle p \\rangle\\) is 4.\n\nTo find the index of \\(\\langle p \\rangle\\) in \\(S_5\\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Index} = \\frac{|G|}{|\\langle p \\rangle|} \\]\n\nGiven that \\(|S_5| = 120\\) and \\(|\\langle p \\rangle| = 4\\), we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Index} = \\frac{120}{4} = 30 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is not listed among the options you provided (A. 8, B. 2, C. 24, D. 120.
