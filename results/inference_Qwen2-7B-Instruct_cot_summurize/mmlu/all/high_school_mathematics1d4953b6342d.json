Therefore, the total number of unique fractions that can be created is:\n\n\\[4 \\times 4 = 16\\]\n\nHowever, this calculation includes cases where the same number could appear in both the numerator and the denominator, leading to equivalent fractions like \\(2/2\\) and \\(3/3\\). These would typically count as just one unique value when considering the fraction's value, not the fraction itself as it was initially presented.\n\nGiven the question's focus on \"unique numbers\" potentially implying distinct values (and recognizing that equivalent fractions are considered the same value), we must adjust our approach slightly. The key here is understanding that every combination of a numerator and denominator (where order matters) creates a unique fraction. However, since we're looking at unique numbers, we should clarify that in this context, every fraction with distinct numbers is counted once regardless of its value being \\(1/2\\), \\(2/1\\), etc., all being considered different fractions but mathematically equivalent to \\(1\\).\n\nThus, considering the original intent might be to count unique fractions without considering their simplification to whole numbers, we actually should clarify the question's intent better aligns with counting the unique fractions rather than their numerical value post-simplification. Given the typical interpretation of the question aiming for the number of unique fractions created, the calculation of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) fractions directly answers the question under the assumption that equivalent fractions due to common factors are not considered distinct for the purpose of counting unique fractions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the corrected understanding of the question, is **not explicitly listed** among the options A through D as presented. The correct answer, under the clarified interpretation, would be **16** unique fractions that can be created, which doesn't match any of the provided choices. It appears there might have been an expectation for a specific format or type of answer not aligned with the detailed calculation provided."
