The size of a McDonald's kitchen is a structural feature that cannot be easily changed within a short period; it requires significant investment and time to expand or reduce its capacity. Thus, it is more likely to be adjusted in the long run when business conditions, customer demand, or other strategic decisions necessitate changes. \n\nThe other options ( amount of wood used to make a desk, number of pickles put on a sandwich, and number of teacher's assistants in local high schools - are generally considered variable inputs that can be adjusted relatively quickly in response to changes in demand or operational needs."
