                    "text": "Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Alcohol makes the tremor of benign essential tremor worse - This statement is generally true. Alcohol can exacerbate symptoms of essential tremor, making them more pronounced.\n\nB. Hemiballismus is due to a stroke causing paralysis of the distal half of the arm - This statement is incorrect. Hemiballismus is actually a disorder characterized by sudden, violent flinging movements of the limb away from the body. It is usually caused by damage to the basal ganglia or thalamus, often due to a stroke or other neurological condition affecting the brain.\n\nC. A 'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia - This statement is true. Dystonia can manifest as abnormal postures and muscle contractions, including a \"milkmaid\" grip where the hand is held out with the fingers spread and the thumb extended.\n\nD. Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia - This statement is true. Focal dystonias are characterized by sustained, repetitive, and involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting or repetitive movements or postures of specific body parts. Writer's cramp is a type of focal dystonia that affects the hand and wrist during writing or playing musical instruments.\n\nSo, the correct answers are:\n\nA. Alcohol makes the tremor of benign essential tremor worse\nC. A 'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia\nD. Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia"
