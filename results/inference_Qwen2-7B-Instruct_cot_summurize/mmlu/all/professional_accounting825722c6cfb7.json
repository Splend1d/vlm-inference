Smith has calculated that automation would result in savings of $45,000 a year due to reduced scrap and $65,000 a year due to reduced labor costs. The machine has a useful life of 4 years and falls in the 3-year property class for MACRS depreciation purposes. The estimated final salvage value of the machine is $120,000. The firm's marginal tax rate is 34 percent. The incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is closest to\n\nA. $280,000.00\nB. $380,000.00\nC. $480,000.00\nD. $580,000.00\n"
