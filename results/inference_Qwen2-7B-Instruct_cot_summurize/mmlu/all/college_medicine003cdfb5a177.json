The primary transcripts of many genes can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, a process known as alternative RNA splicing.\n\nThis is how several different proteins can be produced from the same gene. Alternative splicing allows for the same gene to produce multiple protein variants by rearranging exons ( within the pre-mRNA before it's translated into a protein. This increases the genetic diversity without increasing the number of genes in the genome."
