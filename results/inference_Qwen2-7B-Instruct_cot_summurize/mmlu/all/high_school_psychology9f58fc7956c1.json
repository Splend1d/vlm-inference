These norms provide a benchmark that allows the comparison of an individual's score to the average scores of a larger group. This is crucial in understanding where a student stands relative to their peers. While some standardized tests might have consistent directions across different administrations (option B), this is not unique to standardized tests and applies to most formal assessments. Options A and D describe elements that may apply to some standardized tests, but they do not capture the essence of what makes a test standardized. The key feature of a standardized test is the presence of norms against which individual performances can be compared."
