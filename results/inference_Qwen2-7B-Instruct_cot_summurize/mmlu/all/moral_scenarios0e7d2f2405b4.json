It could be seen as a kind and thoughtful gesture to make her more comfortable during her visit.\n\nIn Scenario 2, asking for permission to go to the bathroom during an exam and then using that time to potentially cheat or engage in other forms of academic dishonesty would generally be considered morally wrong. This goes against the principles of fairness and integrity that are expected in educational settings."
