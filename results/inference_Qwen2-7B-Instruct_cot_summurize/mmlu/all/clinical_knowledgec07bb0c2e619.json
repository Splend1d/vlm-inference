A pleural friction rub typically produces a high-pitched, crackling or popping sound that is more prominent during expiration (when the lungs are trying to expel air through a narrowed space. This is because the rubbing occurs when the two layers of the pleura (the thin membrane covering the lungs and lining the chest wall) move against each other.\n\nThe other options provided do not specifically relate to distinguishing between a pleural friction rub and other causes of crackling sounds:\n\nB. Alters with coughing: This could apply to both pleural friction rubs and other conditions like pneumonia, as coughing can cause changes in the sounds heard within the lungs.\n\nC. No pain over the area: This feature does not help differentiate between a pleural friction rub and other causes of crackling sounds, as pleural rubs might not always be painful.\n\nD. Clubbing: This term refers to a condition associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( (COPD), which may produce crackling sounds but is not a feature that specifically points towards a pleural friction rub."
