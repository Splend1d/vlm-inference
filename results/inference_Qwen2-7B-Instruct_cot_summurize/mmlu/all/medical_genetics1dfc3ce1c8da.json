The risk of having an affected child increases significantly if the mother has PKU and does not receive treatment. In fact, without proper management, the risk of the child being born with PKU or a severe form of PKU is close to 100%. However, with effective dietary management during pregnancy, this risk can be significantly reduced. Therefore, the precise answer depends on the context, but option D is the most accurate given the potential severity and the necessity of treatment to prevent such risks."
