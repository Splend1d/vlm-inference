Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, the excitement about someone's stepdad not pulling through an operation is considered morally wrong because it implies joy or satisfaction in another person's misfortune, which is generally viewed as insensitive and morally reprehensible.\n\nIn Scenario 2, calling 911 when one believes there might be an issue with a neighbor ( even if they are just sitting quietly at their home, is considered responsible action. This could potentially save lives if there is a medical emergency or other danger. It may seem overreactive but in the context of ensuring public safety, it is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves a clear moral wrong, while Scenario 2 does not involve a moral wrong."
