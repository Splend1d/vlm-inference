Prior to beginning they read a list of Miranda rights to him on a form that the suspect had in front of him. After the reading, he initialed each paragraph indicating he understood. At the bottom of the form was an express written waiver of the Miranda rights, which he signed. He had been interrogated in the past and was familiar with the procedure. During the four hours of interrogation he was given bathroom breaks, coffee, and a sandwich. At the end of the process, he made a logical and seemingly cogent confession to all of the burglaries in a taped statement. The defendant later moved to suppress the confession, arguing that he was coming down from drugs at the time and was intellectually unable to understand and comprehend the nature of the warnings or the waiver. What is the most likely decision of the court under the totality of the circumstances?\n\nA. The outward signs all indicate that the suspect understood the procedure and gave a voluntary confession despite his disabilities.\nB. There are too many questionable deficiencies in the suspect's ability to understand what was going on and the confession must be suppressed.\nC. He was too confused to understand what was going on and the confession was coerced by the persistence of the police.\nD. The signing of a written waiver of Miranda rights is always proof that the suspect gave a voluntary confession.\n"

The outward signs all indicate that the suspect understood the procedure and gave a voluntary confession despite his disabilities.\n\nThe court would likely consider the totality of the circumstances when evaluating the voluntariness of the suspect's confession. This includes factors such as the suspect's mental state (in this case, the ADHD, dyslexia, and low IQ; the presence of Miranda warnings; the suspect's ability to understand and waive those rights; and the conditions under which the confession was made (including the provision of bathroom breaks, food, and beverages.\n\nGiven that the suspect initialed each paragraph of the Miranda warning indicating understanding, signed a written waiver, and provided a logical and seemingly cogent confession after a period of interrogation, it suggests that he was able to comprehend the situation and give a voluntary statement. The fact that he had been previously interrogated and was familiar with the procedure also works in favor of the voluntariness of his confession. The court may conclude that despite his disabilities, the suspect was capable of understanding the proceedings and giving a voluntary confession."
