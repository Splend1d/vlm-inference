This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. On January 15, 2009, the sale of the dairy farm is finalized and the buyer paid the farmer $75,000. The fanner executed a general warranty deed. The deed contains the following covenants of title:(1) Covenant for seisin. (2) Covenant of the right to convey. (3) Covenant against encumbrances. After the buyer takes possession of the dairy farm, he learns of the son \u0080\u0094investor 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied, and seeks monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.\nB. the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.\nC. the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.\nD. the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.\n"

It doesn't directly relate to the existence of encumbrances.\n- **Covenant of Right to Convey**: Guarantees the grantor has the authority to transfer the property. It doesn't address whether the property is free from encumbrances.\n- **Covenant Against Encumbrances**: This covenant guarantees that the property is free from any claims, liens, or other burdens at the time of conveyance. If the property is later found to have an outstanding mortgage (like the one from 1936 that wasn't satisfied), the buyer can argue that this covenant was breached when the deed was originally delivered.\n\nIn this case, since the buyer discovered the unfulfilled mortgage after taking possession, they can claim that the covenant against encumbrances was breached at the time of conveyance (i.e., when the deed was signed and delivered. This entitles them to recover damages for the breach."
