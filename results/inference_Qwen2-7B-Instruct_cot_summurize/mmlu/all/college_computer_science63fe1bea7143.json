In a circuit-switched network, a dedicated path is established between two points for the duration of the communication session. In contrast, packet switching involves breaking data into packets and routing them individually through the network, which allows for more efficient use of bandwidth and the ability to handle variable-length messages and multiple sessions simultaneously."
