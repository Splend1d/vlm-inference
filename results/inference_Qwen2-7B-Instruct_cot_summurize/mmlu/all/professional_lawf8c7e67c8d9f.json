When he became chronically ill and could not care for himself, his unmarried daughter moved into his home to take care of him. As time went on, the widower became senile, lost touch with reality, and required continuous care. When that happened, the caretaking daughter made out a deed to herself as grantee and had him sign as grantor. He was not aware of what he was doing when he signed it. After the widower died, the two married children sued to have the deed set aside for mental incompetence. Assuming they can prove the foregoing allegations, will the court likely strike down the deed?\n\nA. No, because the caretaking daughter had a right to the property in return for all of the work that she performed.\nB. No, because every deed is strongly presumed to be valid when signed.\nC. Yes, because he did not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of his act or the meaning of the legal instrument he signed.a\nD. Yes, because it was obtained by mutual mistake.\n"

Yes, because he did not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of his act or the meaning of the legal instrument he signed.\n\nWhen someone signs a document while lacking the mental capacity to understand its implications, the court may invalidate the document under the doctrine of incapacity. In this case, the widower's mental incompetence due to senility makes him unable to comprehend the significance of transferring his property through a deed. The fact that the deed was executed for his benefit (care during his illness) does not change the legal requirement that he must have been capable of understanding the transaction at the time of signing. Therefore, the court is likely to strike down the deed based on the principle that mentally incapacitated individuals cannot enter into binding legal agreements."
