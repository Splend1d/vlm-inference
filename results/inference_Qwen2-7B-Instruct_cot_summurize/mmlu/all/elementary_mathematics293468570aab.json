To convert this to an improper fraction (which is another way of expressing it as a single fraction), you multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction and then add the numerator. \n\nSo, for 1 and 1/11:\n\n- Multiply the whole number (1) by the denominator (11: \\(1 \\times 11 = 11\\)\n- Add the numerator of the fractional part (1: \\(11 + 1 = 12\\)\n\nThus, \\(1\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{12}{11}\\). This is already in its simplest form because 12 and 11 have no common factors other than 1."
