The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n"

Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this scenario, the heat lost by the sample (Q_sample equals the heat gained by the water Q_water. This is based on the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed from one form to another.\n\nThe formula for calculating heat transfer is:\n\n\\[ Q = m \\cdot c \\cdot \\Delta T \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( Q \\) is the heat transfer,\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the substance,\n- \\( c \\) is the specific heat capacity of the substance ( (the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius),\n- \\( \\Delta T \\) is the change in temperature.\n\nSince both substances are at different temperatures initially and reach the same final temperature, they must exchange equal amounts of heat to reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, regardless of the magnitude of their temperature changes, the amount of thermal energy transferred from the sample to the water must be the same.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not directly follow from the information given. Option A suggests that the sample lost more energy than the water gained, which contradicts the principle of conservation of energy. Option C relates to heat capacities, but it does not necessarily follow from the temperature changes alone; the relationship between heat capacity and temperature change depends on the specific heat capacities of the substances involved. Option D involves an equilibrium constant, which is not relevant to the described scenario involving heat transfer between two substances."
