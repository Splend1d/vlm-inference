As the boss stood up to leave the table, her wallet fell out of her pocketbook onto the floor. The boss was unaware of what occurred and proceeded to the bathroom. The woman, however, saw the wallet fall. Intending to steal it, the woman picked up the wallet and placed it in her pocket. Before the boss returned to the table, the woman had a change of heart and decided to give the wallet back. Thereupon, the woman told her boss what had happened and handed her the wallet when she returned from the bathroom. The woman is guilty of which, if any, crime?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Larceny.\nC. Embezzlement.\nD. False pretenses.\n"

Since she did not keep or use the wallet for personal gain after finding it, she has not committed any theft-related crime. Therefore, no crime was committed by the woman in this situation."
