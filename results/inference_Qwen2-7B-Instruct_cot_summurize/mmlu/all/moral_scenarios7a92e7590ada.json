Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, calling the fire station when your kitchen is on fire would be considered morally wrong if you did so negligently or falsely, knowing there was no fire but wanted to cause a commotion or without realizing there was a fire. However, if you genuinely believed your kitchen was on fire and acted to save lives and property, this action would generally be seen as responsible and not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, selling hot brownies at the school bake sale would typically be considered a positive contribution to the community or school event. It demonstrates resourcefulness and possibly generosity, depending on how the proceeds are used. This action would generally not be viewed as morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
