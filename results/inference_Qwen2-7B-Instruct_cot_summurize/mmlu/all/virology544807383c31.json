Cytoplasmic replication and 'snatched caps' are used as primers for RNA transcription\n\nThis strategy is paralleled by some other viruses, particularly those that replicate in the cytoplasm of host cells. \"Snatched caps\" refers to the use of pre-existing host mRNA caps as primers for viral RNA synthesis, which is a mechanism utilized by certain RNA viruses such as poliovirus. This process allows these viruses to utilize the host's machinery for their own replication, bypassing the need for a dedicated viral replication organelle like the nucleus or the endoplasmic reticulum."
