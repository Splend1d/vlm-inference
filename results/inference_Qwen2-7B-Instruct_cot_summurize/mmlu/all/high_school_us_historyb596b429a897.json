This sentiment is most closely mirrored in:\n\nC. Governor Orval Faubus's response to the steps taken by President Dwight Eisenhower to resolve the Little Rock crisis in 1957.\n\nGovernor Faubus famously defied federal authority by deploying the Arkansas National Guard to\u963b\u6b62 black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, which was part of the desegregation efforts initiated by President Eisenhower. The situation highlighted the tension between state and federal authority, as well as the struggle for civil rights and the rule of law against oppressive local governance.\n\nIn contrast, A. Justice Frank Murphy's dissent in the Supreme Court case, Korematsu v. United States in 1944, focused on the issue of internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, which is not directly comparable to the absolute monarchy described in the quote.\n\nB. U.S. Army lawyer Joseph Welsh's opposition to Senator Joseph McCarthy in the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954, involves a critique of political tactics rather than an absolute authority over people.\n\nD. John Lewis's endorsement of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, while a significant civil rights victory, does not directly reflect the same sentiment of absolute power over people as described in the quote."
