O(n^2). \n\nAsymptotically, this means that as the input size (n) grows very large, the function grows without bound at the rate described by its big O notation. \n\nA. O(1) represents constant time complexity. The running time does not depend on the size of the input.\n\nB. O(n) represents linear time complexity. The running time grows linearly with the size of the input.\n\nC. O(n^2) represents quadratic time complexity. The running time grows quadratically with the size of the input. This is the fastest growing function among the options given, so it will be the largest asymptotically for large enough values of n.\n\nD. O(log n) represents logarithmic time complexity. The running time grows logarithmically with the size of the input, which is slower than linear but faster than constant.\n\nTherefore, for sufficiently large n, the running time for option C (O(n^2) will be larger than that for options A, B, and D."
