A disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures.\n\nWhen a CPA performs agreed-upon procedures, their engagement is limited to performing specific tasks as agreed upon with the engaging party. The CPA is not providing an opinion on the overall financial statements or the fairness of the procedures used. Instead, they provide a report stating whether the procedures were performed as agreed and if the results agree with the schedule provided. There is no responsibility taken for the adequacy or effectiveness of internal controls or the fairness of the procedures leading up to the calculation of the rate of return. Therefore, option C accurately reflects what should be included in the CPA's report on these procedures."
