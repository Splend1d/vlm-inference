It transforms the outputs of a network layer into a probability distribution over predicted output classes.\n\nThe second statement is also true. In a nonuniform softmax distribution, adjusting the \"temperature\" parameter can affect the entropy of the distribution. A higher temperature results in a more uniform distribution, whereas a lower temperature leads to a more peaked (or concentrated) distribution, reflecting greater confidence in the predicted class. This concept is particularly useful in various machine learning contexts, such as in reinforcement learning where it influences exploration vs. exploitation trade-offs."
