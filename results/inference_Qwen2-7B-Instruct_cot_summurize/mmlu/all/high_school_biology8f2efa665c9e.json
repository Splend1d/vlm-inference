During this process, several byproducts are generated including NADH and ATP. The reaction is not reversible; pyruvate does not directly convert to lactate in glycolysis.\n\nFermentation, on the other hand, is an alternative pathway that occurs when oxygen is scarce or absent. It involves the conversion of pyruvate back into a usable molecule like lactate ( (anaerobic fermentation) or ethanol and carbon dioxide (alcoholic fermentation), thus reversing the direction of the reaction from glycolysis. \n\nThe other options listed represent processes that either occur in the reverse direction during fermentation (B: pyruvate to ethanol, C: NADH reduction back to NAD+, or D: ATP synthesis in the reverse direction using ADP and phosphate to form ATP."
