This implies that using someone else for personal gain without their consent is morally wrong.\n\nGiven this principle:\n\n- Selling one of your own teeth ( (Option A) could be seen as a trade where the individual's body part is used as a means to an end (financial gain). While this might not necessarily violate Kant's humanity formulation directly since it involves self rather than others, it does challenge the idea of respecting one's autonomy and bodily integrity.\n\n- Engaging in prostitution ( (Option B) involves the use of another human being primarily for sexual gratification, which directly contradicts the idea of treating people as ends in themselves. Prostitution often involves the exploitation of individuals for profit, and it fails to respect their inherent dignity and autonomy.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate answer would likely lean towards Option C: both A and B. However, it's important to note that the precise application of Kant's principles can sometimes lead to nuanced interpretations, especially when dealing with complex ethical scenarios involving personal rights, autonomy, and societal norms."
