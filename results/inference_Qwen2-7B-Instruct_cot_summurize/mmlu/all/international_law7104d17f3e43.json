This recognition is essentially a political act where one state formally acknowledges another as a legal subject with sovereignty.\n\nOut of the options provided:\n\nA. Recognition is determinative of statehood - This statement encapsulates the essence of the constitutive theory. It suggests that a state's existence is dependent on being being recognized by others, which is a key tenet of the constitutive theory.\n\nB. Recognition requires constitutional approval by third nations - This option does not directly align with the constitutive theory. While a constitution may play a role in how a state is perceived and potentially influences recognition, the constitutive theory focuses more on the political act of recognition itself, rather than requiring constitutional approval from other states.\n\nC. Recognition requires that the constitution of the recognized State includes sufficient human rights guarantees - This option touches upon a related aspect, but it is not central to the constitutive theory. The theory is more concerned with statehood recognition rather than the specific content of a state's constitution, particularly in terms of human rights.\n\nD. Countries wishing to be recognized must possess a valid constitution - This statement implies an aspect of the constitutive theory but goes beyond its core principle. The constitutive theory primarily concerns the act of recognition, whereas this statement could be interpreted as a condition for statehood, which is not necessarily the same as what the constitutive theory entails.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer based on the constitutive theory of recognition is A: \"Recognition is determinative of statehood.\""
