Instead, they rely on innate immune responses which include the presence of phagocytes that engulf and digest invading pathogens. They do not have the same types of cells found in vertebrates like T-lymphocytes ( (T-cells), B-cells, and helper T-cells, which are key components of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates."
