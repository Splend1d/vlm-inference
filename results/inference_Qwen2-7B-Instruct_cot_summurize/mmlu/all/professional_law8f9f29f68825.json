The contract provided that the owner was to pay the employee a salary of $2,000 per month, payable one-half to the employee and one-half to the employee's elderly mother. The contract further stipulated that \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable. \"When the mother learned of this contract, she wrote a letter to the owner stating, \"Kindly pay the amounts due me under your contract with my son directly to the nursing home, where I am presently a patient. \" During the first year of the contract, the owner paid $1,000 per month to the employee and $1,000 per month to the nursing home. After one year, another pizza restaurant opened across the street, creating competition. During the next few months, business steadily declined. As a result of the loss in business, the owner informed the employee that unless he agreed to take a cut in his salary, the employee would be fired. Reluctantly, the employee orally consented to a salary reduction of $500 per month. By the terms of their oral agreement, the owner promised to continue to pay $1,000 to the employee, but to pay only $500 per month to the nursing home. If the nursing home brings suit against the owner for breach of contract, who is most likely to prevail?\n\nA. The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\nB. The owner, because the agreement between the owner and the employee reduced the owner's obligations to the nursing home.\nC. The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\nD. The nursing home, because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (Article 2, which governs contracts for the sale of goods and certain services, and under many states' common law, an anti-assignment clause in a contract typically prevents the assignment of contractual rights by one party without the consent of the other. However, such clauses are generally unenforceable when they come into conflict with laws regarding support obligations or where there is a third-party beneficiary interest. In this case, the mother has a right to receive payments for her care, which can be considered a support obligation, and she is also a third-party beneficiary under the contract.\n\nThe nursing home can argue that it has a vested interest in receiving the payments due to the mother's health care needs, which were the basis for her assignment. Even though the employee agreed to a reduction in his salary, this does not affect the nursing home's entitlement to the payments under the mother's assignment.\n\nThe oral agreement between the owner and the employee to reduce the payment to the nursing home does not override the mother's assignment, especially since the owner continued to make payments according to the original contract terms for the first year. Therefore, the nursing home is most likely to prevail in its suit against the owner for breach of contract."
