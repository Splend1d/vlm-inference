The 80-acre tract included the family home, an exquisite mansion built in 1929 by a wealthy industrialist. For many years, the closest town to the tract had been in the grips of economic decline. However, in 1988 and 1989, several large corporations built plant facilities in the local area. By the early 1 990s, prosperity had burst upon the area. To take advantage of the real estate boom, the attorney divided the 80-acre tract into 160 lots. By 1995, the attorney had sold 90 lots to various individual buyers. Each deed contained the following provisions:\"It is an express covenant and condition that the property hereby conveyed shall not be used for other than single-family residences. \"\"The grantor hereby covenants for himself, his heirs, successors, and assigns to insert a similar restriction in all deeds to lots now owned by grantor in the 80- acre tract. \"In 1996, the county board of supervisors purchased from the attorney 30 lots within the 80-acre tract. The board, which had the power of eminent domain, planned to construct a new county pest-control office on the property. The deed of conveyance from the attorney to the county board of supervisors made no mention of the aforesaid restrictions contained in the deeds to other lot owners in the 80-acre tract. The attorney \u0080\u0094county deed, however, did contain a provision, which stated:\"The grantee hereby covenants for itself, its successors, and assigns that this conveyance is made in lieu of the exercise of the power of eminent domain. \"Thereafter, the county enacted a zoning ordinance whereby the 30 lots were rezoned to permit the construction of a pest-control office building. When the county started construction, all the other lot owners in the 80-acre tract brought suit to enjoin the building plan or, in the alternative, to recover damages. If the county board of supervisors, the named defendant, prevails on both counts, it will be because\n\nA. the power of eminent domain is the equivalent of the power to zone.\nB. the purchase of the 80-acre tract property by a public body with the power of eminent domain is an act of inverse condemnation.\nC. the abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking.\nD. restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking.\n\nWhen the county board of supervisors purchased the 30 lots from the attorney, they acquired the property subject to any existing covenants and conditions that were part of the deed. In this case, those conditions included the prohibition on using the property for purposes other than single-family residences. However, when the county rezone these 30 lots to permit a pest-control office building, it effectively abrogates the original covenant, allowing the property to be used for a different purpose than originally intended.\n\nIf the county prevails in court, it would likely be because the court determines that the abrogation of the restrictive covenant through rezoning is not a compensable taking. A \"taking\" under the law typically refers to a government action that deprives an owner of property without just compensation. In this scenario, the county's rezoning action does not directly result in the county acquiring the property for its own use (which would require compensation, as it did when it purchased the lots from the attorney. Instead, it changes the permitted uses of the property, which may not necessarily amount to a compensable taking depending on the specific legal precedent and jurisdiction.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not accurately reflect the legal principles at play here:\n\nA. The power of eminent domain is not equivalent to the power to zone. Eminent domain allows a government to take private property for public use, while zoning regulates land use within a municipality.\nB. The purchase of the property by a public body with the power of eminent domain is not automatically considered an act of inverse condemnation. Inverse condemnation occurs when the government takes private property without formal eminent domain proceedings, but in this case, the county purchased the property.\nD. Restrictions on the use of land can indeed be enforced against subsequent buyers, but this is contingent on the terms of the deed and whether the buyer had knowledge of the restrictions at the time of purchase. In this case, the question is more about the effect of rezoning on the enforceability of the original covenant, rather than the enforceability against the county."
