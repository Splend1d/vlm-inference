Light-textured soils like loamy sand tend to have lower water holding capacity compared to heavier soils. This means that these soils can dry out more quickly after receiving irrigation or rainfall. Thus, they often require more frequent irrigation to maintain adequate moisture levels for optimal corn growth. \n\nIn contrast, B ( heavy-textured soil, such as silty clay, generally holds more water, which might lead to overwatering if irrigation is not managed properly. A. dispersed alluvial fan soil and D. region of low humidity both may also require careful management of irrigation frequency due to their specific conditions, but the question focuses on soil type, making C the most directly appropriate answer."
