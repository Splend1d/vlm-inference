This typically leads to an increase in the average collection period, as payments are collected over a longer time frame. \n\nOptions B, C, and D are not guaranteed outcomes and depend on various factors such as market conditions, customer behavior, and overall financial management. Extending credit periods might lead to increased sales if customers take advantage of the longer payment terms, but this also depends on the demand for your products or services. However, it could potentially lead to higher bad debt losses if customers are unable to pay within the extended period. Higher profits would require careful consideration of the cost of extending credit (such as interest expenses, administrative costs, and potential bad debts - which might not necessarily increase with the extension of credit periods, especially if sales volume doesn't significantly increase."
