They were also capable hunters and may have engaged in cooperative hunting strategies. The controlled use of fire suggests they had the ability to manage and use fire for various purposes such as cooking, warmth, and protection. \n\nOptions B, C, and D either attribute characteristics to Homo erectus that are not well-supported by the archaeological record or attribute characteristics to other species of hominins. For example, while gardening and elaborate burials are associated with later human species ( Homo sapiens, there is no evidence to suggest that Homo erectus engaged in these activities. Similarly, while fishing and building structures might be attributed to some early humans, they are not specifically tied to Homo erectus in the same way their other characteristics are."
