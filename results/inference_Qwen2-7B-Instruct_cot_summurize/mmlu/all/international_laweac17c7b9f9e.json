This refers to the European Court of Justice's decision in Kadi v. Commission, which ruled that EU regulations implementing UN Security Council resolutions must provide for effective judicial review and respect the principle of proportionality. This means that while the resolutions are part of international law, their application within the EU must be consistent with EU law, particularly in terms of respecting fundamental rights."
