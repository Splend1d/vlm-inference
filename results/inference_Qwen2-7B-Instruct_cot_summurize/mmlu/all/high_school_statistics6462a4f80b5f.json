Independence is determined by whether \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)\\). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. \\(P(A \\cup B) = 1\\) implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n\n- **Analysis**: If \\(P(A \\cup B) = 1\\), it means that either event A or event B or both must occur since their union has full probability. However, this condition does not necessarily mean that A and B are mutually exclusive ( because mutual exclusivity requires \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\), which would be implied if A and B cannot occur simultaneously. This statement could be misleading without proper context; it's not generally true that mutual exclusivity follows from their union having full probability, but rather the other way around. So, this statement is also false as stated.\n\nC. \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\) implies events A and B are independent.\n\n- **Analysis**: Events A and B being independent means that knowing whether one event occurs does not change the probability of the other event occurring. Independence is defined by the equality \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)\\). A necessary (but not sufficient condition for independence is that \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\), which would imply that events A and B cannot occur simultaneously. However, this condition alone does not imply independence, especially when neither event can occur on its own ( which would require \\(P(A) = 0\\) or \\(P(B) = 0\\). Thus, while \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\) suggests a lack of overlap, it does not necessarily imply independence in all contexts. This statement is false as it stands without additional context regarding the probabilities of A and B.\n\nD. \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\) implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n\n- **Analysis**: This statement is true. If the probability of both A and B occurring together is zero, then it means that there is no possibility for them to occur at the same time. In probability theory, this is precisely the definition of mutual exclusivity. Therefore, if \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\), we can conclude that events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n\nThe correct answer is D."
