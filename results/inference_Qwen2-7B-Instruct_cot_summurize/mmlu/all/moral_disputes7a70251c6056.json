Among the options provided, obesity does not necessarily fit this definition as it is generally a physical condition resulting from excessive body fat rather than an immoral act. The other options\u2014callousness, selfishness, and greediness\u2014are often associated with negative moral qualities that can lead to harmful behaviors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB. obesity"
