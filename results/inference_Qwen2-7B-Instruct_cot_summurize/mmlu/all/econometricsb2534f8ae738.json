(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nGARCH(1,1) models can capture:\n\ni) **Fat tails in the return distribution** - GARCH models account for volatility clustering by allowing the variance to be time-varying, which often leads to fatter tails in the distribution of returns than what a normal distribution would suggest.\n\nii) **Leverage effects** - This refers to the tendency of volatility to increase when the price falls (and thus there is an increase in the value of short positions). GARCH models can incorporate this effect through additional terms that allow for negative correlations between returns and conditional variances.\n\niii) **Volatility clustering** - This is a key feature where large changes in prices tend to be followed by large changes, and small changes tend to be followed by small changes. GARCH models explicitly model this by allowing past squared residuals and past variances to influence current variance.\n\nHowever, GARCH models do not directly capture the relationship between volatility and returns (iv) directly, although this indirect effect is part of how it captures volatility clustering. The leverage effect is more about the asymmetric impact on volatility, rather than volatility influencing returns."
