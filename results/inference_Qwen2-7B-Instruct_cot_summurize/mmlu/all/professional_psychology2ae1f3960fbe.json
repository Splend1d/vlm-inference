Therefore:\n\nA. Memorizing vocabulary words would likely be affected since it involves language processing.\nB. Constructing a daily schedule requires logical sequencing, which could be impacted by left hemisphere damage.\nD. Using the process of elimination to answer multiple-choice questions involves logical reasoning, which is also likely to be impaired.\n\nHowever, reading a map primarily involves spatial reasoning and visual-spatial skills, which are are less dependent on the language and logical functions primarily controlled by the left hemisphere. Thus, unilateral damage to the left hemisphere is least likely to result in an inability to read a map compared to the other options."
