Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.\nFrench revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794\nThe passage above appears to articulate which of the following political principles?\n\nA.

The end justifies the means\n\nRobespierre argues that the extreme measures of \"terror\" ( or strict enforcement of justice, are justified by the necessity to protect the republic from its enemies and to uphold the rights of the public interest over private interests. This reflects the idea that if the ultimate goal ( in this case, the survival and success of the republic is important enough, then the means used to achieve that goal can be extreme or even morally questionable. \n\nThe other options do not fit the context of the quote:\nA. \"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\" is the principle behind communism, not the French Revolution or Robespierre's ideas.\nB. \"Might makes right\" is not a principle espoused by Robespierre, who believed in the power of reason and virtue rather than force.\nD. \"The government is best that governs least\" is a principle associated with libertarianism, not with the radical measures taken during the French Revolution."
