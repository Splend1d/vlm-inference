He decides to torture the victim's father for no good reason. After the beating, the father is hospitalized and in intensive care. The victim was not present but read about it in the newspaper and heard about it from the authorities. Victim suffered extreme emotional distress and required medical treatment. Can victim bring a successful action against perpetrator for intentional infliction of emotional distress? (IIED)\n\nA. No, because victim was not present at the time that the outrageous behavior occurred.\nB. Yes, because the activity was outrageous and shocking.\nC. No, because perpetrator did not know that the father had immediate family members.\nD. Yes, because in torture cases there is strict liability imposed on the perpetrator.\n"

Yes, because the activity was outrageous and shocking.\n\nIn jurisdictions that recognize intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to cause severe emotional distress. In this case, the man's actions of mercilessly brutalizing an innocent elderly person, especially if the victim reads about it or hears about it, could likely be considered outrageous and shocking, potentially leading to a successful IIED claim. The fact that the victim was not present during the incident might initially seem like a barrier, but the emotional distress experienced upon learning about the incident could still qualify under the \"outrageous\" and \"shocking\" criteria necessary for IIED.\n\nHowever, the specifics of the legal outcome would depend on the laws of the jurisdiction where the incident took place, including any relevant precedent set by courts in similar cases."
