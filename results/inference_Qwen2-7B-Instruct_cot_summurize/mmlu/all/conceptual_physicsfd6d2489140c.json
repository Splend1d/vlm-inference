                    "text": "The correct answer is A. move farther than the input piston.\n\nIn a hydraulic press (or any hydraulic system for that matter, the movement and force transmission are governed by Pascal's Principle. This principle states that an increase in fluid pressure at any point in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid. \n\nTherefore, in terms of movement, the distance moved by the output piston is directly proportional to the area of the output piston compared to the input piston, assuming the same force is applied to both pistons. The smaller piston moves a greater distance than the larger one because it has a smaller surface area. However, it does not move farther than the input piston; rather, it moves more quickly due to its smaller surface area. \n\nAs for force, according to the principle of force conservation, the force exerted by the output piston is equal to the force exerted on the input piston. Therefore, option B is incorrect because the force can be exactly matched, not exceeded.\n\nRegarding speed, as mentioned above, the output piston moves more quickly than the input piston, but this is not about exceeding the speed of the input piston; it's about moving more quickly due to the smaller area.\n\nFinally, D. \"produce increased energy\" is incorrect because, according to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system. In a hydraulic system, the total mechanical energy ( which includes kinetic and potential energy, remains constant, so the energy produced by the output piston equals the energy put into the system by the input piston. \n\nSo, the correct statement is that the output piston cannot move farther than the input piston."
