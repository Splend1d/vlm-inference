The stockbroker decided to end his life by jumping off a bridge. He walked to the middle of the bridge, climbed over the railing, stood on the tiny ledge on the edge of the bridge, and prepared to jump. A taxi driver who happened to be crossing the bridge at that moment saw what the stockbroker was doing. The taxi driver slammed on his brakes, jumped out of his taxi, started running toward the stockbroker, and yelled, \"Don't do it!\" Pleased to hear that someone cared about him, the stockbroker changed his mind about committing suicide and decided that he wanted to live. At that moment, however, the stockbroker started to lose his balance, and his feet began to slip off the small, grimy ledge of the bridge. Just as the stockbroker started to fall, the taxi driver reached him and grabbed the back of his jacket. The taxi driver hung on tightly to the jacket and nearly was pulled over the side of the bridge, but he managed to hang on. Using every bit of strength he could muster, the taxi driver pulled the stockbroker back up and onto the bridge. The stockbroker was relieved to have been saved from falling. Unfortunately, the taxi driver suffered a severe injury to his back from the strain of hanging on to the stockbroker and pulling him back up onto the bridge. A statute in the jurisdiction makes attempted suicide a crime. If the taxi driver asserts a claim against the stockbroker to recover damages for his injuries, will he prevail?\n\nA. No, because the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself.\nB. No, because attempted suicide was a criminal offense in the jurisdiction.\nC. Yes, because the stockbroker put himself in a position of peril.\nD. Yes, because he succeeded in saving the stockbroker's life.\n"

Yes, because the stockbroker put himself in a position of peril.\n\nUnder most jurisdictions' laws regarding tort liability, a person can be held liable for causing harm or injury to another if they negligently or intentionally create a situation that puts others at risk of harm. In this case, the stockbroker's decision to commit suicide by jumping off the bridge created a perilous situation that directly endangered the safety of those around him, including the taxi driver. By attempting to save the stockbroker, the taxi driver sustained significant injuries.\n\nIn tort law, the concept of \"res ipsa loquitur\" ( (the thing speaks for itself) might apply here, suggesting that the injury occurred due to negligence on the part of the person responsible for the situation, which in this case would be the stockbroker. Additionally, the statute making attempted suicide a crime does not negate the stockbroker's potential liability for the injuries caused to the taxi driver through his actions leading to the suicide attempt.\n\nTherefore, the taxi driver may have grounds to sue the stockbroker for damages under tort law, as the stockbroker's actions were foreseeable and directly resulted in the taxi driver's injuries."
