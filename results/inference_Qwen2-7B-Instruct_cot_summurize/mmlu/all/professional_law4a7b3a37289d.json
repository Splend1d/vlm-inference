The grand jury issued a subpoena requiring the corporation to produce all emails and internal documents regarding the corporation's knowledge of the risks of an oil spill. The corporation has objected, citing its Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Can the subpoena be enforced?\n\nA. No, because the corporation was not granted transactional immunity.\nB. No, because the corporation was not granted use-and-derivative-use immunity.\nC. Yes, because a corporation has no Fifth Amendment privilege.\nD. Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents.\n"

Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from self-incrimination, but it does not apply to corporations. Corporations can be compelled to produce documents without violating their rights under the Fifth Amendment. The fact that the corporation may have to disclose information that could incriminate its employees or officers does not shield the corporation from complying with the subpoena for documents."
