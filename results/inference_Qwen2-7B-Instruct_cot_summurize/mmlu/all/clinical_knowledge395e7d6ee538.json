Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power.\n\nCreatine supplementation has been shown to enhance physical performance during short, high-intensity exercise such as weightlifting and sprinting. It works by increasing the amount of creatine phosphate available in the muscles, which in turn helps regenerate ATP (the energy currency of the cell) more quickly, leading to improved strength and power.\n\nAs for the other options:\nA. While increasing protein intake can support muscle growth, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that consuming more than 3 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day necessarily stimulates muscle growth or increases strength beyond what can be achieved with standard dietary recommendations for athletes.\nC. Amino acid supplements may provide certain benefits related to muscle recovery and growth, but their overall impact on increasing muscle strength and power compared to whole protein sources or complete protein sources like meat, eggs, and dairy is not definitively established.\nD. Muscle damage, often referred to as \"muscle soreness\" or \"delayed onset muscle soreness\" ( (DOMs), is typically caused by overloading the muscles with exercises that they are not accustomed to, leading to microscopic tears in muscle fibers. Shortening contractions alone do not induce muscle damage unless they are intense enough to cause these tears."
