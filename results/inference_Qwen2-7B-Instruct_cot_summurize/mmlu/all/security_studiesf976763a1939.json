War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour.\nB. War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass.\nC.

All of these options.\n\nFrom a realist perspective in international relations, each of the options provided touches upon valid considerations that could influence the likelihood of war:\n\nA. When a state is losing power, it might feel more vulnerable and less capable of defending itself against threats. This can lead to a greater inclination towards aggressive behavior as an attempt to regain or maintain its position in the international system.\n\nB. In multipolar systems, where there is no clear hegemon, states may have incentives to buckpass\u2014avoiding direct responsibility for international actions and instead expecting others to take the lead. This can create a dynamic where states are less willing to cooperate and more likely to act unilaterally, potentially escalating tensions and leading to conflict.\n\nC. An offensive-defense balance that favors offense can create an environment where states feel pressured to expand their capabilities or assert themselves to counterbalance the threat. This heightened competition and insecurity can increase the risk of military confrontation.\n\nTherefore, all of these statements can be considered true under certain conditions within the realist framework of international relations."
