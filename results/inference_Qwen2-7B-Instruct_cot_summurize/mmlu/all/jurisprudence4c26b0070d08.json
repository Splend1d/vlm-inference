A morality of aspiration.\n\nRuth Benedict Fuller's \"inner morality of law\" refers to an ethical framework that emphasizes the moral obligations and aspirations of individuals within legal systems, rather than solely focusing on the rules or consequences. It is a concept that transcends mere legal positivism ( which focuses on the rules and validity of laws as they exist, regardless of their moral content. It is not directly an Aquinian concept of natural law, which holds that there are are objective moral principles that are universally valid and that can be discovered through reason. And it doesn't necessarily reject the 'harm principle', which suggests that the only justifiable purpose of law is to prevent harm to others, though Fuller's approach does focus more on individual morality and less on the external consequences of legal actions."
