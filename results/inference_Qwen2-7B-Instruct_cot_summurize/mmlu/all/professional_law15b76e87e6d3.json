Liability is based on a statute making owners of automobiles liable for the negligent actions of those driving with the consent of the owner of the vehicle. The plaintiff offered into evidence the testimony of his doctor that the plaintiff had said to the doctor, when consulting the doctor for treatment, that he felt pain in his back immediately after the accident, and that pain persisted. The trial court should rule this testimony\n\nA. admissible as a spontaneous declaration.\nB. admissible under the hearsay exception of declaration of present bodily condition.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible as conclusions.\n"

The testimony offered by the plaintiff's doctor would be admissible under the hearsay exception of declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nThis exception allows statements made by a person describing the symptoms or effects of an injury at the time it occurred to be admitted as evidence, provided they were made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event. In this case, the doctor's statement about the plaintiff expressing pain in his back immediately after the accident and the persistence of that pain would likely fall under this exception, as it appears to be a statement describing the plaintiff's immediate reaction to the incident, which is relevant to the issue of whether the plaintiff suffered personal injuries and the extent thereof.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because the statement does not seem to qualify as a spontaneous declaration ( which is typically an unpremeditated statement made in response to an event, and it is also within the recognized exception of a declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the statement is not a conclusion but rather a description of symptoms reported by the plaintiff to the doctor."
