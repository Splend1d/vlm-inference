The speech act is the end point of the two-stage process of securitization, at this point the legitimacy of the existential threat is established and the right to employ special measures in addressing the threat is granted to the securitizing actor.\nC. The presentation of an issue as threatening the survival of a referent object is referred to as a speech act. The process of securitization consists of this articulation of the speech act, and accordingly is referred to as a discursive model.\nD. The articulation of an issue as a security threat is referred to as a speech act. This speech act is presented to an audience by a securitizing actor. This actor attempts to convince that audience of the credibility of the issue as an existential threat to a specific referent object. If successful, the audience is convinced and the securitizing actor is granted recourse to legitimately use extraordinary measures in response to the threat.\n"

Here's how each option relates to this process:\n\nA. Correct. By using the language of security, an issue can be elevated beyond normal political discourse to receive urgent attention and potential exceptional measures. This linguistic shift is pivotal in moving an issue into the security realm.\n\nB. Also correct. The speech act in securitization marks the moment when the existential threat is formally acknowledged, legitimizing the securitizing actor's right to employ special measures. This act is the culmination of the securitization process.\n\nC. Correct. The term \"speech act\" refers to the act of presenting an issue as a threat to the survival of a referent object. This is indeed central to the discursive model of securitization, which is essentially about the language used to articulate such threats.\n\nD. Correct. This option succinctly captures the essence of securitization: the articulation of an issue as a security threat through a speech act. This act is performed by a securitizing actor who seeks to convince an audience of the issue's severity, thereby gaining the right to use extraordinary measures. If successful, the audience agrees with the characterization of the issue as an existential threat.\n\nIn summary, all options accurately describe different facets of how language functions in the process of securitization."
