The formula for exponential growth in this context is:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(P(t)\\) is the number of people infected after \\(t\\) days,\n- \\(P_0\\) is the initial number of people infected (which is 10 in this case,\n- \\(T\\) is the time it takes for the number of infected to double, which is 3 days here, and\n- \\(t\\) is the time in days since the start.\n\nWe want to find the smallest \\(t\\) such that \\(P(t) \\geq 1000\\), the total population of the town.\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation gives us:\n\n\\[ 1000 \\leq 10 \\times 2^{(t/3)} \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[ 100 \\leq 2^{(t/3)} \\]\n\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\log_2{100} \\leq t/3 \\]\n\n\\[ t/3 \\geq \\log_2{100} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq 3 \\times \\log_2{100} \\]\n\nSince \\(\\log_2{100} = \\log_2{(10^2)} = 2\\log_2{10}\\) and \\(\\log_2{10}\\) is approximately 3.3219, we get:\n\n\\[ t \\geq 3 \\times 3.3219 \\]\n\n\\[ t \\geq 9.9657 \\]\n\nThis means that it takes slightly more than 9.9657 days for the virus to spread to 1000 people from an initial count of 10. Since we cannot have a fraction of a day in this context, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 10 days. Therefore, the entire town would be infected by the end of the 10th day since January 1st, making the earliest date when the entire town would be infected January 10th.\n\nThe correct answer is A. January 10th."
