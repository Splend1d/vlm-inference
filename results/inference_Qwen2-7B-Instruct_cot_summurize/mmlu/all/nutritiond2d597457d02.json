It led to significant changes in consumer behavior and food choices because of the perceived health risks associated with consuming beef and other products derived from infected animals. The fear was that eating beef could lead to a similar disease in humans, known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD. This fear resulted in a decrease in demand for beef and beef-related products, particularly in countries like the United Kingdom where the outbreak occurred. The risk perception influenced not only consumer behavior but also had economic impacts on the agricultural sector and food industry."
