Specifically:\n\n- \\(4\\mathbb{Z} = \\{ \\dots, -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, \\dots \\}\\) is the set of all even integers divisible by 4.\n- \\(2\\mathbb{Z} = \\{ \\dots, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, \\dots \\}\\) is the set of all even integers divisible by 2.\n\nSince \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\) is a subset of \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\), any coset of \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\) in \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\) will be a shift of \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\) by an element of \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\) not already in \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\). \n\nGiven that \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\) contains all elements of the form \\(4n\\) where \\(n\\) is an integer, any coset of \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\) in \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\) can be generated by taking an element not in \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\) (i.e., an odd multiple of 2 (since all elements in \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\) are even multiples of 2), and adding it to every element of \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nThe smallest positive odd multiple of 2 that isn't in \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\) is 2 itself ( since \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\) contains all multiples of 4, which are also multiples of 2 but with a specific divisibility condition. Thus, the first non-trivial coset is \\(4\\mathbb{Z} + 2 = \\{ \\dots, -6, -2, 2, 6, \\dots \\}\\), which is precisely \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\) since every element is already in \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nTherefore, the only coset of \\(4\\mathbb{Z}\\) in \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\) is \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\) itself, which means the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\(4\\mathbb{Z}, 2 + 4\\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\nWhere \\(2 + 4\\mathbb{Z}\\) represents the coset formed by adding 2 to every element of \\(4\\mathbb{{Z}}\\), resulting in \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\)."
