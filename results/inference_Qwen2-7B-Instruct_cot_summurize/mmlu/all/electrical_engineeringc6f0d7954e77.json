Relaxation oscillator.\n\nRelaxation oscillators typically use a single transistor and a capacitor, which can be easily integrated on a single chip with modern semiconductor fabrication techniques. \n\nOn the other hand, A. Crystal oscillator requires precise tuning that is difficult to achieve in a monolithic IC due to limitations in matching and temperature compensation. B. Hartley oscillator and C. Wien bridge oscillator involve more complex circuitry including inductors and capacitors, making them harder to integrate into a monolithic IC compared to a relaxation oscillator."
