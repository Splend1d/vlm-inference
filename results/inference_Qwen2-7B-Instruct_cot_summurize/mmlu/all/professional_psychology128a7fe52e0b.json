Decreasing the within-group variability will lead to a higher value for the denominator term in the F-ratio formula, which in turn increases the overall F-ratio. This is typically desirable when conducting an ANOVA test, as a higher F-ratio suggests a stronger effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable."
