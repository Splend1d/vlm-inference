( (1982), is characterized by:\n\nB. commitment, challenge, and control\n\nHardiness refers to an individual's ability to maintain a positive attitude towards stress and adversity, typically comprising three components: commitment, challenge, and control. Commitment involves seeing life as meaningful and engaging in activities that contribute to personal growth and fulfillment. Challenge refers to perceiving stressful situations as opportunities for learning and development rather than as threats. Control encompasses the belief in one's ability to influence events and outcomes through effort and persistence.\n\nThe other options listed do not specifically capture the essence of hardiness as outlined by Kobasa et al."
