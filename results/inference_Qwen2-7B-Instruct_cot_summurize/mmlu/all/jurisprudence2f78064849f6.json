That law is essentially an artefact or social construction. \n\nThe Social Fact Thesis, as a cornerstone of positivism, posits that laws are not inherently linked to moral or metaphysical truths, but are instead human creations and social phenomena. They exist as constructs within a society and are defined by the rules and regulations set forth by governmental authorities. This thesis underscores the separation between law and morality, and emphasizes the role of social facts and societal norms in the creation and interpretation of legal systems."
