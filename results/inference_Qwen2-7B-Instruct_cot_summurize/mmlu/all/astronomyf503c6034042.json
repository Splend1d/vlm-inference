This is influenced by the distance from the Sun (which affects the speed at which the Earth moves in its orbit) and the shape of the orbit (which affects the time spent at different points in the orbit.\n\nThe relationship between the orbital period \\(T\\) and the semi-major axis \\(a\\) of an orbit in a circular approximation can be described by Kepler's Third Law:\n\\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\]\n\nSo if the Earth's orbit were three times further from the Sun, we could estimate the increase in the orbital period using this law. Let's denote the original semi-major axis as \\(a_1\\) and the new semi-major axis as \\(a_2 = 3a_1\\). The original orbital period is \\(T_1\\), and the new orbital period is \\(T_2\\).\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\\[ \\frac{T_2^2}{T_1^2} = \\frac{a_2^3}{a_1^3} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(3a_1)^3}{a_1^3}} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\sqrt{27} \\]\n\\[ T_2 = 3^{3/2} \\times T_1 \\approx 5.2 \\times T_1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of a year would be approximately 5.2 times longer, making option B correct."
