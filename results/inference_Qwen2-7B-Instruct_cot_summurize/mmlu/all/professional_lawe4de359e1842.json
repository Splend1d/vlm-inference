The privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis clause protects individuals from their home state's discrimination when they enter into or transact business in another state. While it was originally aimed at protecting the rights of freed slaves, it could potentially be applied to corporations as legal \"persons\" under certain interpretations of the law. \n\nB. The comity clause of Article IV deals with interstate relations and does not specifically address corporations.\n\nC. The Fifth Amendment's prohibition against compulsory self-incrimination applies to individuals, not corporations, since corporations can't be compelled to testify against themselves.\n\nD. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to provide equal protection under the law to all persons within their jurisdiction. It applies to corporations but in the context of ensuring that corporations are treated equally under the law, not that they receive preferential treatment over individuals."
