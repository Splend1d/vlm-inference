If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.\n\nThis interpretation correctly captures the meaning of the given arguments in predicate logic: there exists at least one cookie that has oatmeal ( (\u2203x)(Cx \u2022 Ox)), if something is not a cookie and doesn't have chocolate chips (~Cx \u2283 ~Bx), then it cannot have oatmeal (~Og). The last statement asserts that the object in question doesn't have oatmeal because it was previously established that it's not a cookie and doesn't have chocolate chips."
