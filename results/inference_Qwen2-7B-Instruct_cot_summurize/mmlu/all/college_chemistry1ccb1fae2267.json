                    "text": "First, let's understand the given information:\n\n- The g-factor for Cu(II) is given as 2.12.\n- The separation between each line is 500 MHz.\n- We need to convert this separation into both field units (mT (milliTesla) and wavenumbers (cm^-1.\n\nTo convert MHz to mT (milliTesla):\n\n1 MHz = 1 x 10^6 Hz\n\n500 MHz = 500 x 10^1 Hz\n\nWe know that:\n1 Hz = 2\u03c0 x 10^-7 T.s^-1\n1 Hz = 2\u03c0 x 10^-4 mT.s^-1\n\nTherefore, \n500 MHz = 500 x 10^1 Hz = 500 x 2\u03c0 x 10^-4 mT.s^-1\n\nSo, 500 MHz = 314.16 x 10^-4 mT = 31.411 mT \n\nNow, we need to convert it into cm^-1 using the relation:\n1 T = 100,000 cm^-1\n\nTherefore,\n31.411 mT = 31.411 x 100,000 cm^-1 = 3,141,100 cm^-1\n\nNow, to find the hyperfine splitting (\u0394E (in terms of energy difference), we use the formula:\n\u0394E = g * \u03bc_B * B * h / (2\u03c0\n\nWhere:\ng - is the g-factor\n\u03bc_B - is the Bohr magneton (approx. 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T\nB - is the magnetic field strength (in this case, \u0394E will be divided by this value to get the splitting\nh - is Planck's constant divided by 2\u03c0, which is approximately 1.00 x 10^-4 J.s\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\u0394E = 2.12 * 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T * 31.411 x 100,000 cm^-1 / 1.00 x 10^-4 J.s\n\nCalculating the above expression, we get \u0394E \u2248 6.62 x 10^-4 cm^-1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be the one that matches this value when converted from cm^-1 to mT. \n\nLet's check the options:\n\nA. 0.185 mT = 0.00185 cm^-1\nB. 16.850 mT = 0.01685 cm^-1\nC. 32.953 yT = 0.032953 cm^-1\nD. 45.172 yT = 0.045172 cm^-1\n\nNone of these options match our calculated value of \u0394E \u2248 6.62 x 10^-4 cm^-1. It seems there might have been a mistake in the calculation or interpretation of the question. \n\nThe correct conversion of 500 MHz to field units (mT would indeed be around 31.411 mT, but when converting this into wavenumbers (cm^-1, the result should be 3,141,100 cm^-1, not any of the options provided. \n\nIf the question asked for the conversion of 31.411 mT to wavenumbers (cm^-1, then it would be approximately 3,141,100 cm^-1. This does not match any of the options either, suggesting potential discrepancies in the question or the options provided."
