It is essentially the ability of the test to detect an effect, if the effect actually exists.\n\nGiven:\n- P(rejecting H0 when H0 is true ( (Type I error) = 0.05\n- P(fail to reject H0 when H0 is false) = 0.22\n\nThe power of the test can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Power} = 1 - P(\\text{fail to reject } H0 \\text{ when } H0 \\text{ is false}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Power} = 1 - 0.22 = 0.78 \\]\n\nHowever, this option is not available in your choices. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation or presentation of the question. Given the options:\n\nA. 0.22  \nB. 0.05  \nC. 0.95  \nD. 0.74  \n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer would be D. 0.74, because it represents the closest value to the calculated power of the test, which should be 0.78 based on the given probabilities. However, there seems to be a discrepancy since none of the options exactly match this calculation. If the goal was to find the power based on the provided context, the intended answer might have been misstated or misunderstood. The correct power calculation based on the provided probabilities is indeed 0.78, not listed among the options."
