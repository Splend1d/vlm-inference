A dissolution of hierarchical modes of authority into collaborative team-based decision protocols.\n\nThis option does not align with the concept of the McDonaldization of society, which refers to the process by which social processes and organizations become structured like fast-food restaurants. Key characteristics of this process include rationalization, predictability, efficiency, calculability, control, and controllability. \n\nA dissolution of hierarchical modes of authority into collaborative team-based decision protocols would be more aligned with principles of organizational restructuring such as Agile or Lean methodologies, rather than the McDonaldization model proposed by George Ritzer. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n- A. Rationalization of decisions into cost/benefit analysis structures and away from traditional modes of thinking: This is a key aspect of McDonaldization, where everything is analyzed in terms of costs and benefits.\n- B. Bureaucratic organization that formalizes well-established division of labor and impersonal structures: This also fits within the McDonaldization framework, where roles and tasks are clearly defined and standardized.\n- D. An intense effort on achieving sameness across diverse markets: This is another characteristic of McDonaldization, where consistency and uniformity are prioritized over local customization."
