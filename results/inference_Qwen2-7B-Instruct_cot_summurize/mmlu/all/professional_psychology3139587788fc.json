In other words, it's the difficulty in learning new adaptive responses due to interference from old learning.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each option for clarity:\n\nA. Reminiscence: This term generally refers to the act of recalling memories from one's past. It doesn't specifically refer to the difficulty in learning new adaptive responses due to interference from old learning.\n\nB. Retroactive inhibition: This is the opposite of proactive inhibition. It refers to the effect of new learning on the retention of older information. When new information makes it harder to remember older information, it's called retroactive inhibition.\n\nC. Latent learning: This concept refers to learning that occurs without immediate reinforcement or feedback. It's not about the difficulty in learning new adaptive responses due to interference from old learning but rather about the process of learning that can occur even without direct reinforcement."
