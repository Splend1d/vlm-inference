She denies any tenderness, fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination reveals a\u00a02-cm\u00a0freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid. In addition to thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels, the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is\n\nA. a nuclear thyroid scan\nB. an iodine131\u00a0scan\nC. fine-needle aspiration\nD. ultrasonography of the thyroid gland\n"

It is commonly used for evaluating thyroid nodules as it can help determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant based on the cell characteristics observed under a microscope. \n\nWhile other options like thyroid scans (A, B, and D) may provide additional information about the function or structure of the thyroid gland, they do not specifically target the characterization of a single lesion. Therefore, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy is typically the first step in assessing the nature of the thyroid nodule."
