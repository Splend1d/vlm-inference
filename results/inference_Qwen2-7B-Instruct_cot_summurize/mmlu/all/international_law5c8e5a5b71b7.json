The UDHR is a UN General Assembly resolution\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948. It is not a legally binding treaty but rather a political declaration that sets out fundamental human rights and freedoms to which all people are entitled. The UDHR has been influential in shaping international human rights law and has led to the creation of various treaties and conventions that do have legal force."
