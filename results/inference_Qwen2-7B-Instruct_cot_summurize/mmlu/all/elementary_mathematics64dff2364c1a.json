Prime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime factors, which are prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.\n\nA. 2 \u2022 9 \u2022 11 is incorrect because 9 is not a prime number (it can be divided by 3).\nB. 2.5 \u2022 7 \u2022 3 is incorrect because 2.5 is not an integer and hence not a prime number.\nC. 1 \u2022 11 \u2022 13 is incorrect because 1 is not considered a prime number."
