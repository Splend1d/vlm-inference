When she picked up the car, there was a bill for $5,000 on the dash board. All of the services and parts were workmanlike, not defective and pertained to the areas in the instructions. She refused to pay, claiming that there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval. Can she be held responsible for contractual services performed?\n\nA. No, because there is always an implication that the provider must get permission before doing work not approved.\nB. Yes, because the circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent.\nC. No, because a contract cannot be based on implications and guess work.\nD. Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.\n"

Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.\n\nIn this scenario, the regular customer provided clear written instructions for services to be performed on her car, which included checking and tuning the engine, ensuring the brakes are not defective, examining the tires, and checking and repairing all major systems. The lack of a verbal discussion regarding price or details does not negate the existence of a contract. Instead, it suggests that both parties understood the terms through their previous dealings and the context of the situation ( driving across the country necessitates a thorough check-up of the vehicle. \n\nContracts can indeed be formed without explicit verbal agreements, especially when there is a history of similar transactions and practices between the parties involved. In such cases, the court might find that an implied-in-fact contract existed, as the circumstances and past practices demonstrate a mutual understanding and agreement between the customer and the mechanic regarding the services to be performed and the consideration to be paid.\n\nTherefore, the mechanic is justified in charging the customer $5,000 for the work completed, assuming the services and parts were workmanlike and as per the instructions given. The customer cannot be held responsible for paying the bill only if she had explicitly refused the services beforehand."
