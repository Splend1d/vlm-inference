However, his views align more closely with option D: \"both b and c.\" Aquinas believed that all actions, including those related to pleasure, have a purpose or end (telos). For him, operations (or actions) exist for the sake of achieving some higher good, which could include pleasure, but not as an end in itself. Instead, pleasure is seen as a means to a higher end, such as the fulfillment of human nature or the attainment of happiness. This perspective reflects his broader teleological view that everything in the universe has a purpose and operates toward that purpose."
