Any element in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})\\) can be written uniquely as \\(a + b\\sqrt{6}\\), where \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). This shows that any element in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})\\) can be expressed as a linear combination of \\(1\\) and \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) with coefficients from \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nSince \\(1\\) and \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) are linearly independent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) ( (you cannot have \\(\\sqrt{6} = c \\cdot 1\\) for some \\(c \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\)), they form a basis for \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})\\) as a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Therefore, the dimension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(2\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2"
