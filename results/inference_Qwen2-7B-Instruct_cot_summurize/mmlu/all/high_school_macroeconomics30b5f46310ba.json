This increased demand stimulates economic activity and thus raises real GDP. \n\nOn the other hand, when the government increases its spending on goods and services, it also boosts aggregate demand in the economy. This additional demand further drives up production and output, contributing to an increase in real GDP.\n\nHowever, this expansionary fiscal policy can also lead to inflationary pressures as the increased demand competes with the existing supply of goods and services, potentially pushing up prices. Hence, the price level rises along with the real GDP.\n\nIt's important to note that this effect assumes that the economy has some capacity to expand without facing constraints like full employment or high inflation. In reality, the effectiveness of such policies depends on various factors including the state of the economy, the size of the fiscal stimulus, and the overall economic conditions."
