He identified several mechanisms through which states can either grow or decline:\n\n1. **Resource Curse**: Countries with abundant natural resources might struggle to develop diverse economies, leading to dependency on those resources and vulnerability when prices fluctuate.\n\n2. **Trade Patterns**: A country's position in the global trade network can significantly impact its economic health. Kennedy discusses how changes in trade patterns can lead to shifts in power dynamics between nations.\n\n3. **Technological Advancements**: Innovations and technological progress can either propel a nation forward or leave it behind if it fails to adapt quickly enough.\n\n4. **Inequality and Political Stability**: Internal political stability and social cohesion are crucial for economic development. Kennedy notes that rising inequality can undermine a state's ability to sustain long-term growth and power.\n\n5. **Demographic Trends**: Population growth rates can affect a country's economic potential, as larger populations require more resources and can lead to labor shortages or overpopulation issues.\n\n6. **Military Expenditures**: While military strength is often seen as a source of power, Kennedy argues that excessive spending on defense can detract from economic development and leave a state vulnerable if it relies too heavily on its military capabilities.\n\nKennedy did not specifically argue that all world-leading economies were declining due to low growth and inflation (nor that the United States could no longer remain a superpower and was in decline. Instead, he provided a framework for understanding how various economic forces can contribute to the rise and fall of great powers over centuries. He also did not assert that the rise of Japan had been exaggerated; rather, he contributed to discussions on the complexities of economic and military power shifts in the contemporary world."
