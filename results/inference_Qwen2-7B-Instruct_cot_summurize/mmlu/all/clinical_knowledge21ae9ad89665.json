These symptoms typically progress through several stages as the condition worsens.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- **Pain** suggests irritation or inflammation.\n- **Erythema** (redness of the skin around the IV site indicates an inflammatory response.\n- **Swelling** is another sign of increased fluid in the tissue surrounding the vein.\n\nGiven these symptoms, it's clear that they align with the signs of phlebitis, specifically at a point where intervention is necessary to prevent further complications such as infection or damage to the vein.\n\n**Answer**: The symptoms described suggest that you're dealing with **Stage 2** of phlebitis, which requires **re-siting the cannula**. This means moving the cannula to a different, healthier vein if possible. It's important not to ignore these signs, as they can escalate without appropriate management. After re-siting the cannula, you should monitor the area closely for any further signs of improvement or worsening. If symptoms persist or worsen, medical attention may be required for further treatment."
