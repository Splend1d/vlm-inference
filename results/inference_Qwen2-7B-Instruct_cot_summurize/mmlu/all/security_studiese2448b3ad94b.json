However, it does not exclusively limit its consideration to social class. Instead, it considers classes based on their relationship with means of production, primarily distinguishing between the bourgeoisie (or capitalist class, who own the means of production, and the proletariat or working class, who do not own the means of production but sell their labor.\n\nMarx's theory also incorporates economic, political, and ideological aspects, recognizing that these dimensions interact and influence each other in the development of class structures and societal formations. Therefore, while social class is certainly a crucial element, HM does not reduce the concept of class to just this one dimension."
