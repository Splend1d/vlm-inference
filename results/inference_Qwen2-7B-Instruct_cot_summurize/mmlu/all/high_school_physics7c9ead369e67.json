                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula for a bi-convex lens. The lens formula is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) is the focal length, \\( v \\) is the image distance, and \\( u \\) is the object distance.\n\nGiven that the radius of curvature is 20 cm, the focal length \\( f \\) for a bi-convex lens is half of the radius of curvature, which gives us \\( f = 10 \\) cm. The object distance \\( u \\) is given as 30 cm.\n\nLet's substitute these values into the lens formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{30} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( v \\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{3}{30} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15} \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nSince \\( v \\) is positive, the image is real (and located behind the lens). \n\nNow let's calculate the magnification \\( m \\) using the formula:\n\n\\[ m = -\\frac{v}{u} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values for \\( v \\) and \\( u \\):\n\n\\[ m = -\\frac{7.5}{30} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is inverted. The absolute value of the magnification tells us the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object. Since the object height is 2 cm, the height of the image will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Height of Image} = 2 \\times |m| = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 0.5 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Real, inverted, height = 1 cm. Note that there seems to be a discrepancy in the final height calculation; it should be 0.5 cm rather than 1 cm based on the provided calculations.
