This is due to the law of reflection which states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. In this case, the \"angle of incidence\" is your line of sight to the mirror and the \"angle of reflection\" is the line from the mirror to your image. Therefore, the distance of your image behind the mirror is equal to your distance in front of the mirror."
