Wrong, Not wrong\n\nPushing a man out of the way of a train would generally be considered morally wrong because it involves intentionally causing harm to another person, even if the intention is to save them from a greater danger. \n\nTossing your sunroof towards your daughter, assuming you have the ability to do so safely and without causing any harm to her or others, would not typically be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action seems playful and spontaneous, but without context about how it was executed and its consequences, it's hard to definitively say it's wrong. However, the key factor here is that it was not intended to cause harm, which is a common defense in moral evaluations."
