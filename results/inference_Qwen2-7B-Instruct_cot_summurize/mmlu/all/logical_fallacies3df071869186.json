This is often referred to as an \"avoiding the point\" or \"shifting the focus\" fallacy.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each of the options you provided:\n\nA. \"You too\" fallacy: This is a type of ad hominem fallacy where someone dismisses an argument by pointing out hypocrisy in the person making the argument. For example, \"You can't say that you're against cheating because you cheated on your test.\"\n\nB. Irrelevant conclusion: This refers to a situation where the conclusion drawn from the evidence or premises does not logically follow from them. It is not specifically about evading the issue but rather about a logical error in drawing a conclusion.\n\nC. Appeal to fear: This is a type of logical fallacy where someone argues that a proposition must be true because it will cause fear if it is false. It manipulates emotions rather than addressing the issue at hand.\n\nD. Argument against the person: Also known as an ad hominem fallacy, this involves attacking the character or circumstances of the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. This is not a direct synonym for evading the issue but is related in that both involve avoiding substantive engagement with the argument at hand.\n\nTo directly answer your question, there isn't a specific term among these options that directly corresponds to another name for evading the issue. However, evading the issue itself could be considered a type of ad hominem or red herring fallacy depending on how it's used."
