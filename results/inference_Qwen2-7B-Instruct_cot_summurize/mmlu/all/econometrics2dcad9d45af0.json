The autocovariance function at lag \\(k\\) for an MA(1 model is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma(k) = \\sigma^2 \\phi^{|k|}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance of the white noise term,\n- \\(\\phi\\) is the moving average coefficient, and\n- \\(|k|\\) is the absolute value of the lag.\n\nIn this case, the moving average coefficient \\(\\phi = 0.4\\). However, without knowing the disturbance variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)), we cannot compute a numerical value for the autocovariance at any specific lag. \n\nSo, given the options:\n\nA. 0.4\nB. 1\nC. 0.34\nD.
