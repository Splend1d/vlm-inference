The set aH (which consists of all elements of the form ah where h is in H) and Ha (which consists of all elements of the form ha for a in G and h in H) have the same cardinality. This is because there's a bijection between them given by the map h -> a^{-1}h which preserves the structure of the sets.\n\nStatement 2: True. For aH and Hb to be identical or disjoint, consider their relationship. If aH and Hb have an element in common, say x, then x can be written as ax for some a in G and x in H. Also, x can be written as bh for some b in G and h in H. Therefore, ax = bh. By rearranging, we get ab^{-1}h = x. Since h is in H, ab^{-1} must also be in H for x to be in both aH and Hb. This implies that aH and Hb either share no elements (disjoint), or one is contained in the other (identical). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. True, True."
