If the replacement was done without intent to deceive the owner about the material quality (and assuming no other legal issues arise from the use of clay pearls), it might not necessarily be considered morally wrong in the traditional sense. However, if there was any deception involved in presenting the replacement as the original item, that would indeed be morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
