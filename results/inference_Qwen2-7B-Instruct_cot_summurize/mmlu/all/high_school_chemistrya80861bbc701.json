                    "text": "The correct answer is B. This is a spontaneous process because of an entropy increase.\n\nWhen potassium perchlorate dissolves in water and the temperature of the solution decreases, it indicates that heat has been released into the surroundings (exothermic process). However, the primary reason for considering this a spontaneous process in this context is due to an increase in entropy. \n\nEntropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. When solid potassium perchlorate dissolves in water, it breaks apart into its constituent ions (K\u207a and ClO\u2084\u207b, which then disperse freely throughout the solvent. This dispersal increases the disorder in the system, leading to an overall increase in entropy. The release of heat (exothermic aspect) is secondary to the entropy increase in this case. Therefore, the dissolution of potassium perchlorate in water is a spontaneous process driven by an increase in entropy."
