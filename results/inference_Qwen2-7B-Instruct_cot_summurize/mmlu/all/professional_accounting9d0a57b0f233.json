If the court awards $100,000 (with a probability of 0.7, Smith will receive 40% of the amount above $20,000, which is $80,000. So, Smith's fee in this scenario would be 40% of $80,000, or $32,000. However, since Smith also receives a flat retainer of $20,000, the total fee in this scenario would be $32,000 + $20,000 = $52,000.\n\nIf the court awards $0 ( with a probability of 0.3, Smith will still receive the flat retainer of $20,000, as there is no additional percentage of the award to be paid.\n\nSo, the expected value from legal fees can be calculated as follows:\n\n(Probability of winning * (Legal fee in winning scenario) + (Probability of losing * (Legal fee in lose scenario)\n\n= (0.7 * $52,000 + 0.3 * $20,000\n\n= $36,400 + $6,000\n\n= $38,400\n\nHowever, Smith also has to account for their out-of-pocket expenditures of $15,000. To find the net expected value, subtract these expenses from the total expected value:\n\nNet Expected Value = $38,400 - $15,000\n\nNet Expected Value = $23,400\n\nNone of the given options (A, B, C, D match this calculation. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or an error in the provided options. Based on the calculations, the closest answer would be A. $25,900, but this does not precisely match our calculation. The correct answer based on the provided data and calculation method should be $23,400."
