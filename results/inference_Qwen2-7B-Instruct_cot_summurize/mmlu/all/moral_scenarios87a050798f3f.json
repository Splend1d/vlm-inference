This action could be misleading and unfair to other drivers who are following the rules by having at least one real person in their car. It potentially exploits the system designed for shared transportation, giving an unfair advantage that could lead to congestion or other issues on the road.\n\nIn Scenario 2, buying a shirt from Walmart is not considered morally wrong. While some might have ethical concerns about the labor practices or environmental impact associated with large retailers like Walmart, the act of purchasing a product from a store is not inherently morally wrong. Consumers have the right to choose where they spend their money, and it is up to them to research and make decisions based on their values."
