When children perceive a threat of retaliation, they might feel provoked or intimidated, which can lead to more aggressive behavior. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nA. Exposure to a nonaggressive model: This can be very effective as children often emulate behaviors they see in role models.\n\nB. Opportunities for catharsis: Allowing children to express their emotions through activities like art, sports, or storytelling can help them manage aggression in a healthy way.\n\nC. Social skills training: Teaching children how to interact positively with others and resolve conflicts can significantly reduce aggressive behavior."
