By limiting the amount to the value of the vehicle sold.\n\nWhile this statement may inform potential buyers about the valuation of the car, it does not effectively disclaim the implied warranty of merchantability. An implied warranty of merchantability means that the goods are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. Limiting liability to the value of the vehicle does not address whether the vehicle meets the ordinary expectations of a consumer for its use.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\nA. Stating in the contract that there is no \"implied warranty of merchantability\" directly addresses and disclaims the warranty.\n\nB. Stating in writing that the vehicle is sold \"as is\" is a common phrase used to indicate that the seller is not providing any warranties beyond what is specifically stated.\n\nC. Setting forth an express disclaimer that is clear, on the point, and conspicuous ensures that the disclaimer is easily noticeable and understood by the buyer, which can be effective if done properly."
