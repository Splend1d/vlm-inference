The first floors of both buildings were occupied by various retail establishments. The buildings' other floors were rented to professionals and used as offices. There was an enclosed walkway that connected the second floor of each building. Thus, shoppers and office staff could walk across the common walkway and gain access to each building. While the buildings were being used in this manner, the millionaire sold the dental building to an investor by warranty deed, which made no mention of any rights concerning the walkway. The walkway continued to be used by the occupants of both buildings. Thereafter, the walkway became unsafe as a consequence of wear and tear. As a result, the investor hired a contractor to repair the walkway area. When the millionaire saw the contractor removing the carpeting along the walkway, he demanded that the investor discontinue the repair work. After the investor refused, the millionaire brought an action to enjoin the investor from continuing the work. The most likely result will be a decision for\n\nA. the millionaire, because the investor does not have rights in the walkway.\nB. the millionaire, because the investor's rights in the dental building do not extend to the walkway.\nC. the investor, because the investor has an easement in the walkway and an implied right to keep the walkway in repair.\nD. the investor, because he has a right to take whatever action is necessary to protect himself from possible tort liability from persons using the walkway.\n"

                    "text": "C. the investor, because the investor has an easement in the walkway and an implied right to keep the walkway in repair.\n\nIn real estate law, an easement allows one property owner to use a portion of another property for a specific purpose. In this case, the enclosed walkway between the two buildings seems to serve as a practical utility for the tenants and occupants of both buildings, thus creating an implied easement. This means the investor, as the new owner of the dental building, has a right to use the walkway as part of their property rights.\n\nFurthermore, there is an implied covenant of habitability in real estate transactions, which means that the property must be kept in a condition suitable for its intended use. If the walkway becomes unsafe due to wear and tear, it is reasonable for the investor to maintain or repair it to ensure safety for all users. The millionaire's argument would likely fail if it contradicts the principles of implied easements and the duty to maintain the property in a safe condition.\n\nTherefore, the court is most likely to rule in favor of the investor, allowing them to proceed with the repairs under the assumption of an easement and the necessity to maintain the safety of the property for all users."
