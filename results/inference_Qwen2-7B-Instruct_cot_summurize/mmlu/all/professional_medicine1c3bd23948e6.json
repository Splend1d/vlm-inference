She began a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole 2 days ago but has had no relief of her symptoms. She has had intermittent constipation for the past 12 years. She has not had nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools. She has a 3-year history of hypertension. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago because of leiomyomata uteri. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 280,000/mm3 ; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Test of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin\nB. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\nC. Pelvic ultrasonography\nD. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast\n"

Given her history of hypertension and previous abdominal surgery, it's important to rule out complications related to her prior surgery or potential infectious causes.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the options:\n\nA. Testing for Clostridium difficile toxin: This would be relevant if the patient was treated for another bacterial infection and now presents with diarrhea, which could indicate a C. difficile infection. However, this doesn't seem to be the primary concern based on the information provided.\n\nB. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( (ERCP): This procedure is used primarily to examine the bile ducts and pancreatic ducts, diagnose conditions like gallstones or pancreatitis, and treat certain conditions. It doesn't directly address the patient's abdominal pain or cramping, making it less likely the first choice here unless other diagnostic tests have ruled out more straightforward causes.\n\nC. Pelvic ultrasonography: This would be useful if there were suspicions of pelvic pathology, such as ovarian cysts or endometriosis. However, given the history of a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooo-oophorectomy, this seems less likely to be the primary cause of her current symptoms.\n\nD. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast: A CT scan can provide detailed images of the abdominal organs, which is helpful for diagnosing conditions like appendicitis, diverticulitis, or other abdominal infections. This option appears to be the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and need for a comprehensive assessment of the abdominal region.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is **D. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast**."
