It's a measure of the frequency at which money circulates in an economy. This concept is crucial in understanding inflation, economic growth, and monetary policy. The formula often associated with the velocity of money is:\n\nMV = PT\n\nWhere:\nM = Money supply\nV = Velocity of money\nP = Price level\nT = Transactions volume\n\nFrom this equation, you can see that the velocity of money (V = PT/M. Therefore, option D accurately defines the velocity of money."
