Medical history is significant for sickle cell trait and mild anemia. She has been taking 800 mg of ibuprofen three times daily for Achilles tendinitis diagnosed 1 month ago. She has smoked five cigarettes daily for the past 15 years, and she drinks one to five beers on weekends. She experimented with cocaine briefly 16 years ago, but she has never used intravenous drugs. She has been in a monogamous sexual relationship for the past 12 years. Today, vital signs are temperature 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses periorbital edema but no jugular venous distention. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination discloses an S1 and S2 without murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination discloses bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion. Examination of the lower extremities shows pitting edema from the mid thigh to the ankles bilaterally. Results of which of the following studies are most likely to be abnormal in this patient?\n\nA. HIV antibody study\nB. Serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration\nC. Toxicology screening of the urine\nD. Urine protein concentration\n"

Therefore, the most likely abnormal study to order would be one that evaluates heart or kidney function.\n\nOption B: Serum B-type natriuretic peptide (concentration. This hormone is primarily produced by the heart and its levels can rise in response to heart failure, indicating potential cardiac dysfunction.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are may also be relevant:\n\nA. HIV antibody study - Since HIV can cause similar symptoms and affect kidney function, it could be considered if there were additional risk factors or symptoms suggestive of HIV infection.\n\nC. Toxicology screen of the urine - Cocaine use can lead to fluid retention, and it should be ruled out given the patient's history of brief cocaine use 16 years ago.\n\nD. Urine protein concentration - Proteinuria (elevated protein in the urine) can indicate renal dysfunction, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n\nTherefore, among these options, serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration seems the most directly relevant to the patient's presenting symptoms related to cardiac function. However, depending on the clinical context, all of these tests could be ordered to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's health status."
