Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization because it prevents the binding of sperm to the egg, thus preventing the acrosomal reaction and fertilization.\n- C. Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization for the same reason as option A; it disrupts the essential interaction between sperm and egg.\n- D. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads because ZP2 is not the target protein for sperm binding and does not initiate the acrosomal reaction when bound to sperm.\n- B. Contrary to the other options, incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs should facilitate in vitro fertilization, as it provides an opportunity for sperm to bind to their specific receptor, enhancing the chances of successful fertilization rather than blocking it."
