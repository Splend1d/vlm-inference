Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected. In addition, this patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with which of the following agents?\n\nA. Adenovirus\nB. BK virus\nC. Epstein-Barr virus\nD. Herpes simplex virus\n"

BK virus is a common cause of acute rejection in patients who have undergone renal transplantation, especially those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. The other options listed ( adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus, while they can cause infections in humans, are not typically associated with the clinical presentation and context provided for this patient."
