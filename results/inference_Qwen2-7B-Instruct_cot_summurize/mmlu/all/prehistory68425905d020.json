It encompasses the processes that organisms undergo after death, including decomposition, alteration by physical and chemical processes, and their eventual fossilization. This field helps archaeologists and paleontologists understand the post-mortem history of remains, which can provide insights into ancient environments, ecosystems, and the processes that lead to the preservation of biological material."
