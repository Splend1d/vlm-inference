In this case:\n\n1) \\(Cu^{2+} + e^- \\rightarrow Cu^+\\)\nThis reaction shows that copper(II) ions (\\(Cu^{2+}\\)) gain an electron to form copper(I) ions (\\(Cu^+\\)). This is a reduction process.\n\n2) \\(Cu^+ + e^- \\rightarrow Cu^0\\) \nThis reaction demonstrates the same concept, where a copper ion (\\(Cu^+\\)) gains an electron to become neutral copper metal (\\(Cu^0\\)). This is also a reduction process.\n\n3) \\(Fe^{2+} \\rightarrow Fe^{3+} + e^-\\)\nIn this reaction, iron(II) ions (\\(Fe^{2+}\\)) lose an electron to form iron(III) ions (\\(Fe^{3+}\\)). This is an oxidation process, not a reduction.\n\nTherefore, options 1 and 2 are the correct choices because they represent reduction half-reactions."
