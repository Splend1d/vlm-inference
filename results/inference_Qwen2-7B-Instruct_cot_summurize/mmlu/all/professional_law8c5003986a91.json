                    "text": "A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n"

                    "text": "Under the common law of riparian rights, which applies in this jurisdiction, the millionaires' rights to the stream water would generally be considered superior to the rancher's rights if the millionaires were able to demonstrate that their use of the water was reasonable and necessary for the enjoyment of their property. This legal principle states that water belongs to the land, not the person, and that upstream landowners (like the rancher) do not have superior rights to water over downstream landowners (like the millionaire).\n\nThe doctrine of prior appropriation is not followed here, meaning that the first party to use the water has priority over later users, regardless of whether their use is more \"beneficial\" or \"reasonable\". The millionaires' claim to senior rights is based on the fact that they started using the water in 1956, long before the rancher began using the water in 1986.\n\nGiven these legal principles:\n\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\n\nThis statement is incorrect under the common law of riparian rights. Upstream landowners do not have superior rights to water over downstream landowners simply due to their location.\n\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\n\nThis statement is also incorrect. Under riparian rights, domestic use does not necessarily have superior rights over agricultural use. The priority is given to the reasonable and necessary use of the water for the enjoyment of the land, which in this case would likely favor the earlier user.\n\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. An easement by prescription requires continuous, open, and notorious use without permission for a statutory period, which in this case is 15 years. While the millionaire has been using the water since 1956, the question does not provide enough information about whether his use was continuous, open, notorious, and for 15 years without permission to grant an easement by prescription.\n\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nThis statement correctly identifies the basis for the millionaires' claim to rights under the common law of riparian rights. The millionaires' use of the water predates the rancher's use and has been continuous, which under the principles of riparian rights would likely entitle them to the water for their use.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water**."
