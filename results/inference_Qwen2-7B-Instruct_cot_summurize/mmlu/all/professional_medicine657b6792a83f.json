On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?\n\nA. Intramural (pre-prostatic)\nB. Membranous\nC. Prostatic\nD. Spongy\n"

This is because it is located near the base of the penis where there is a high risk of trauma from external forces, such as a motor vehicle accident. The membranous urethra is covered by a thin layer of tissue and contains the internal urethral sphincter, which can be disrupted or torn by forceful trauma. This can lead to significant bleeding, urinary tract complications, and potentially life-threatening conditions if not promptly diagnosed and treated."
