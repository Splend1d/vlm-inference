This is because consumers in Japan have less disposable income to spend on foreign products.\n\nThe decrease in demand for U.S. dollars (from Japanese buyers who are purchasing fewer American goods) implies that the demand for the dollar decreases, leading to a depreciation of the dollar's value relative to the yen. This is due to the law of supply and demand: when there is less demand for a currency, its value tends to fall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Decrease in exports to Japan, decrease in demand for the dollar, and a decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the yen."
