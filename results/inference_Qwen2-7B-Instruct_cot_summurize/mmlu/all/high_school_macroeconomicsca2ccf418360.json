An increase in foreign income\n\nAn increase in foreign income typically leads to an increase in the demand for foreign goods, which reduces the demand for domestic goods. This reduction in demand for domestic products causes the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. \n\nHere's a brief explanation of why the other options do not cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left:\n\nA. Expectations of surpluses of goods in the future might lead consumers and businesses to save more or invest less, potentially reducing current aggregate demand. However, this effect is on the level of aggregate demand rather than its position along the curve.\n\nB. A decrease in income taxes increases disposable income, which could stimulate aggregate demand by encouraging more consumption and investment. This would actually shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, as more people have more money to spend.\n\nC. An increase in government spending directly adds to aggregate demand because it represents an injection of funds into the economy. This would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, not left."
