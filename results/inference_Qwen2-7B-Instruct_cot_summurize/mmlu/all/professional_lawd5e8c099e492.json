Three days after the contract was formed, but prior to delivery of the casebooks, the publisher called the owner of the law bookstore and informed him that, because of a calculation error, the price for the casebooks should have been $11 per book, and the shipment could not be delivered unless the owner promised to pay that amount. The owner reluctantly agreed. The owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is\n\nA. enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.\nB. enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.\nC. unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.\nD. unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.\n"

In this scenario, the owner of the law bookstore relied on the original contract terms (i.e., the price being $10 per book. When the publisher informed them of the error and demanded more money, the owner had a choice: either agree to the new price or risk not receiving the casebooks at all. Agreeing to the higher price in order to secure the delivery of the books can be seen as a reliance on the publisher's promise not to breach the contract, even though the original contract price was incorrect. This reliance could be considered detrimental because it led to the owner making a decision that impacted their business ( - agreeing to a higher cost for the books.\n\nGiven this situation, the owner's agreement to pay $11 per book might be enforced under the principle of promissory estoppel, assuming they can demonstrate that they relied on the publisher's promise to the detriment of their business. However, the enforceability may also depend on local laws and the specific circumstances surrounding the contract and the parties' intentions, which were not provided in the question."
