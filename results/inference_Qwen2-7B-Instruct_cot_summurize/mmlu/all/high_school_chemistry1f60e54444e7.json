The 1s peak has the lowest energy.\n\nIn the context of photoelectron spectroscopy, the energy levels of electrons in an atom are determined by their principal quantum number (n. The 1s orbital corresponds to the lowest possible value of n (which is 1. As the value of n increases, the energy required to remove an electron from the atom also increases. Therefore, the 1s peak will have the lowest energy among the options provided."
