The heat produced by the nuclear reactions is used to convert water into steam, which then drives a turbine connected to an electrical generator to produce electricity.\n\nB. Generate electricity directly: While the heat produced in a nuclear reactor can be used to generate steam for electricity production, the process does not generate electricity directly. The heat converts water into steam, which turns turbines to generate electricity.\n\nC. Gets energy from nothing: No, this statement is incorrect. A nuclear reactor does not get energy from nothing; it derives its energy from the nucleus of atoms through a process called nuclear fission. In this process, the nucleus of an atom is split into two smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy.\n\nD. Is a major polluter of the atmosphere: Nuclear reactors themselves do not produce greenhouse gases during operation, making them a relatively clean source of energy compared to fossil fuels. However, they do produce radioactive waste, which requires safe storage and disposal over long periods. Additionally, the mining of uranium (the fuel for nuclear reactors, can have environmental impacts. Therefore, while not a major atmospheric polluter during operation, nuclear power plants still have environmental concerns related to their waste management and the extraction of resources."
