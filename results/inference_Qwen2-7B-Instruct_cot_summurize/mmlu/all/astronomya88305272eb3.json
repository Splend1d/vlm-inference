When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet, we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.\n\nExplanation:\nMeteor showers occur when Earth intersects the orbital path of a comet or asteroid, leading to the release of debris such as dust and rocks into space. This debris, known as meteoroids, enters the Earth's atmosphere at high speeds, where friction with the air causes them to heat up and glow, resulting in what we see as meteors or shooting stars. If this debris comes from the orbit of a comet, the event is referred to as a meteor shower associated with that comet. As the comet orbits the sun, it leaves behind a trail of debris, and when Earth passes through this trail, we experience meteor showers."
