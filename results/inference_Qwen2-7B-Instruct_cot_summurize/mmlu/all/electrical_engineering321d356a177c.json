When using this method, if the total power is measured by one wattmeter, it implies that the system is purely resistive (i.e., there's no reactive power involved.\n\nPower factor (PF = Real Power / Apparent Power\n\nFor a purely resistive load, the power factor is always 1 because the entire applied power is consumed as heat (there's no reactive power (cosine of 90 degrees is 0, which means no phase difference between voltage and current).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1."
