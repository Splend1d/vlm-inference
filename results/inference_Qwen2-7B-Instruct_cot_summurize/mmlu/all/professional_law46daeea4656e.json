He and his associate occupy the first floor for their architectural business. In June 2005, the architect entered into a valid and binding written lease with a tenant to rent the second floor office space for four years at a monthly rental of $5,000. The lease contained a provision wherein the architect was required to repaint the second floor premises after two years of occupancy. On June 1, 2007, the tenant sent the architect a written letter requesting the repainting of the second-floor office space. The architect made no reply and failed to perform the repainting as the lease required. The cost of repainting the tenant's office was estimated at $1,750. On July 1, 2008, the architect had still not repainted the premises. The following day, the tenant moved out, mailed the keys to the architect, and refused to pay any more rent. The lease was silent as to the rights and remedies of the tenant due to the architect's failure to perform the repainting. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction. In an appropriate action by the architect against the tenant for the rent due, the architect will\n\nA. win, because there was no constructive eviction.\nB. n, because the tenant had the remedy of self-help.\nC. lose, because he cannot maintain an action for rent while in breach of an express covenant.\nD. lose, because the obligation to pay rent is dependent on the architect's performance of his express covenant.\n"

This breach means that the architect is in violation of an express covenant within the lease, making it impossible for him to legally pursue an action for rent from the tenant. The tenant, therefore, may have grounds to refuse payment based on the architect's non-performance of his contractual obligations."
