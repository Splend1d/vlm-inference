The Z-score formula is:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWhere \\( X \\) is the value of interest, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFor 70% of the trucks weighing more than 12,000 pounds, this corresponds to the 30th percentile ( because 100% - 70% = 30%. From the standard normal distribution table, the Z-score corresponding to the 30th percentile is approximately -0.52.\n\nSo, for the first condition:\n\\[ -0.52 = \\frac{(12000 - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\\[ 12000 - \\mu = -0.52\\sigma \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 12000 + 0.52\\sigma \\] ... (Equation 1\n\nFor 80% of the trucks weighing more than 10,000 pounds, this corresponds to the 20th percentile because 100% - 80% = 20%. From the standard normal distribution table, the Z-score corresponding to the 20th percentile is approximately -0.84.\n\nSo, for the second condition:\n\\[ -0.84 = \\frac{(10000 - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\\[ 10000 - \\mu = -0.84\\sigma \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 10000 + 0.84\\sigma \\] ... Equation 2\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of \\( \\mu \\) and \\( \\sigma \\).\n\nSubtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\\[ (10000 + 0.84\\sigma - ( (12000 + 0.52\\sigma) = 0 \\]\n\\[ 10000 - 12000 = 0.84\\sigma - 0.52\\sigma \\]\n\\[ -2000 = 0.32\\sigma \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{-2000}{0.32} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = -6250 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to have gone wrong due to an incorrect approach in setting up the equations. Let's correct this:\n\nInstead of subtracting the equations directly, we should solve them for \\( \\mu \\) and then equate them to find \\( \\sigma \\). Let's correct this:\n\nFrom Equation 1: \n\\[ \\mu = 12000 + 0.52\\sigma \\]\n\nFrom Equation 2: \n\\[ \\mu = 10000 + 0.84\\sigma \\]\n\nSetting them equal to each other:\n\\[ 12000 + 0.52\\sigma = 10000 + 0.84\\sigma \\]\n\\[ 2000 = 0.84\\sigma - 0.52\\sigma \\]\n\\[ 2000 = 0.32\\sigma \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{2000}{0.32} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = 6250 \\]\n\nNow, substituting the value of \\( \\sigma \\) back into one of the equations to find \\( \\mu \\):\n\nUsing Equation 1:\n\\[ \\mu = 12000 + 0.52(6250) \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 12000 + 3250 \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 15250 \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice to our calculated mean (\\( \\mu = 15250 \\)) is not listed among A-D, which suggests there might have been an error in the interpretation or calculation process. However, given the options provided, none exactly match our calculated values. This indicates a potential misunderstanding in the provided choices or in the approach to solving the problem with the given data points. Given the context and calculations based on the information provided, the closest theoretical approach aligns with a mean around 15,250 pounds and a standard deviation around 6,250 pounds"
