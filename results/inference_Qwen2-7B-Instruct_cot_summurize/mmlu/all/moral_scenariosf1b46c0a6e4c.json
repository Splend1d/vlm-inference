Therefore, scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, while the parent's motive might be rooted in discomfort or misunderstanding about diversity and race, the act of telling their child to find new friends based on race is discriminatory and promotes prejudice. This action also violates moral standards concerning respect for individuals' choices and the importance of inclusivity and equality. Thus, it can be seen as morally wrong."
