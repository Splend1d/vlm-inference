Genetic studies have shown that the closest genetic matches for some of the oldest American skeletons are with Siberian populations, rather than European ones. This implies that the initial peopling of the Americas might have occurred through a land bridge from Siberia, rather than from Europe, which would support an earlier and possibly different colonization route."
