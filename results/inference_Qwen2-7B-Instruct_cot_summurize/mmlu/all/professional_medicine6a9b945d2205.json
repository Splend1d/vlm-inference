Her medications include occasional ibuprofen for mild osteoarthritis of both knees. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/79 mm Hg. Examination of the right knee shows warmth, erythema, and effusion. Exquisite tenderness is produced with minimal range-of-motion testing. Examination of synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration shows that it is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Deposition of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of these findings?\n\nA. Ammonium urate\nB. Calcium oxalate\nC. Calcium pyrophosphate\nD. Calcium urate\n"

Calcium pyrophosphate.\n\nCalcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD or pseudogout refers to the condition where calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals deposit in joints, muscles, skin, and other tissues. The patient's symptoms such as sudden onset of pain, swelling, warmth, erythema, and effusion in the right knee along with exquisite tenderness are consistent with this diagnosis. \n\nThe examination of synovial fluid under polarized light microscopy showing positively birefringent rhomboids is also characteristic of CPPD. These rhomboids are the crystals of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate. Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and laboratory finding, the most likely cause of these findings is calcium pyrophosphate deposition."
