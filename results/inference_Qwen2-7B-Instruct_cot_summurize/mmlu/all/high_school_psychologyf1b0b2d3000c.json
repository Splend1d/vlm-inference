This allows educators to understand how well a student is performing relative to their grade level or age group, which can be useful for identifying areas where a student may excel or struggle when compared to their peers.\n\nWhile each option has some relevance, option B most directly addresses a key advantage of standardized norm-referenced assessments over curriculum-based assessments. These tests are not necessarily tailored to the specific curriculum (option A), do not specifically focus on mastery of prerequisite units (option C), and do not inherently provide more information on the interplay between the student's learning environment and skills (option D). Instead, they are designed to provide a comparative perspective on student performance within a broader context."
