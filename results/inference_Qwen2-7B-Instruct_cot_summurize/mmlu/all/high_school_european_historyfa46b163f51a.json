Conservatism\n\nThe political reaction led by Klemens von Metternich, in response to the Chartists, the French Revolution, and other liberal movements, was primarily one of Conservatism. Metternich was a leading figure in the Austrian Empire during the post-Napoleonic era, known for his efforts to restore and maintain the status quo in Europe. His policies aimed to suppress revolutionary and liberal ideas, particularly those emerging from the French Revolution and later, the Chartist movement in Britain, which advocated for democratic reforms such as universal male suffrage. By doing so, Metternich sought to uphold traditional monarchical power structures and prevent the spread of liberal and nationalist ideologies that threatened the existing political order."
