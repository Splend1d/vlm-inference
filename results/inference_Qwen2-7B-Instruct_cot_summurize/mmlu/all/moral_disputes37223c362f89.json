Consequentialist and Dignity-Based: These are two different ethical theories. A consequentialist approach focuses on the outcomes or consequences of actions to determine their morality, often seeking the greatest good for the greatest number. On the other hand, a dignity-based approach emphasizes the inherent worth and respect due to individuals, regardless of the outcomes of their actions.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nA. consequentialist and dignity-based"
