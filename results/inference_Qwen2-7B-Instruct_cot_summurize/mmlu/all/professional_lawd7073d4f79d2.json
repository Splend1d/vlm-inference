The items were displayed on a variety of tables and shelves, which were easily accessible to the customers. While the woman was walking down one of the aisles, her attention became focused on a doll that was prominently exhibited on an overhead display shelf. When the woman approached the doll display, she reached up to grab the doll. As she did so, the woman failed to see a baseball lying on the floor. She tripped over the baseball and fell down, fracturing her hip. If the woman asserts a claim against the toy store for her injuries, will the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur apply on the issue of whether the toy store was negligent and responsible for the baseball being on the floor?\n\nA. Yes, because the woman was a business invitee on the premises of the toy store.\nB. Yes, because the toy store was in control of the premises at the time of the accident.\nC. No, because another customer may have caused the baseball to be on the floor.\nD. No, because the baseball was an intervening act that cuts off the toy store's liability.\n"

                    "text": "The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is a legal principle that allows a plaintiff to infer negligence from the very nature of the accident itself, without needing to prove direct evidence of negligence. This doctrine is typically applied when there is a high probability that the injury would not have occurred absent negligence by the defendant, and the defendant had exclusive control over the instrumentality causing the harm.\n\nGiven the scenario:\n\nA. Yes, because the woman was a business invitee on the premises of the toy store.\n\nThis option might seem plausible if the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur could apply. However, it's important to note that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur generally does not apply in situations where the cause of the accident can be attributed to some other party than the defendant. In this case, since the woman was injured due to a baseball being on the floor, the question arises as to who had control over the premises at the time of the incident.\n\nB. Yes, because the toy store was in control of the premises at the time of the accident.\n\nThis option could potentially align with the application of res ipsa loquitur if the toy store had exclusive control over the condition of the premises, including the presence of objects like baseballs on the floor. However, the presence of a baseball suggests that it might have been placed there by someone other than the store's staff, such as a child or an employee who left it out inadvertently.\n\nC. No, because another customer may have caused the baseball to be on the floor.\n\nThis option seems more likely to counter the application of res ipsa loquitur. If the baseball was left on the floor by another customer, it implies that the toy store was not responsible for its presence, and thus, the doctrine would not apply. The responsibility for maintaining the premises in a safe condition would not be attributed solely to the toy store, as they would not have been in control of the actions of all visitors.\n\nD. No, because the baseball was an intervening act that cuts off the toy store's liability.\n\nThis option directly addresses the scenario. An intervening act is an event that occurs after the defendant's negligent act and contributes to the injury. If the toy store can demonstrate that the baseball was left on the floor by a third party (i.e., another customer or an employee who intended to retrieve it but forgot), then the toy store's liability for the injury could be limited or eliminated based on the intervening act defense. This defense argues that the subsequent act of placing the baseball on the floor was not foreseeable by the initial wrongdoer (the toy store) and therefore breaks the chain of causation between their actions and the injury.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer depends on the specific circumstances of how the baseball came to be on the floor. If the toy store can prove that the baseball was not within their control and was instead left there by another party, then the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur would not apply, and the toy store would not be liable for the woman's injuries based on the mere presence of the baseball on the floor."
