All of these\n\nExplanation:\n- A laser beam is characterized by having all its photons (the particles of light) with the same frequency and wavelength, which determines the color of the light.\n- The phase of each photon in a laser beam is also synchronized, meaning they all oscillate in unison. This coherence in phase is what gives lasers their unique properties, such as high intensity and narrow beam width.\n- The speed of light in a vacuum, which is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second, is constant for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer. Since a laser beam is just a focused and highly coherent beam of light, it travels at this speed as well.\n\nTherefore, all parts of a laser beam have the same frequency, phase, and speed."
