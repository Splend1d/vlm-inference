                    "text": "The correct answer is **B. The conservation of the angular momentum in the tail keeps it always pointing away from the Sun**.\n\nComets, when they approach the Sun, heat up and release gas and dust into space. This material gets ionized by the solar radiation, creating a plasma. The ions are charged particles that can be influenced by electric and magnetic fields. However, it's the conservation of angular momentum that explains why the ion tail points away from the Sun.\n\nAngular momentum is a measure of how much an object is spinning or moving in a circular path. In the case of a comet, as the ice sublimates ( changes from a solid to a gas without becoming a liquid, it carries away angular momentum from the comet. This is because the ice, being at a lower temperature, has less kinetic energy and thus less momentum than the gas it leaves behind. As the ice sublimates, it essentially \"pushes\" off against the rest of the comet, imparting angular momentum to the expelled gases and ions.\n\nSince angular momentum must be conserved in the absence of external torques, the expelled material, including the ions, gains angular momentum in a direction opposite to the comet's motion around the Sun. This causes the ion tail to point away from the Sun, perpendicular to the comet's orbital plane and the direction of its motion. Similarly, the dust tail also tends to point away from the Sun but may not always be perfectly aligned due to other forces like gravity and the solar wind.\n\nRadiation pressure ( (A), the solar wind ( (D), and Keplerian orbits ( (C) all play roles in the behavior of comets and their tails, but they do not directly explain why the ion tail specifically points away from the Sun. It's the conservation of angular momentum that provides the most fundamental explanation for this phenomenon."
