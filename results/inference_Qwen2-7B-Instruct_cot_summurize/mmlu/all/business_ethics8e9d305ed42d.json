This includes:\n\n1. Duty of care: Managers and directors must exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence in managing the company's affairs.\n2. Duty of loyalty: They must act in good faith and put the interests of the shareholders ahead of their own personal interests.\n3. Duty of obedience: They must adhere to the company's bylaws and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\n4. Duty of disclosure: They must provide full and fair information to shareholders when making decisions that could affect their investments.\n\nOption A (1,3,4 is incorrect because it excludes the duty of loyalty, which is a crucial part of fiduciary responsibility.\nOption B. 1,2,3 is also incorrect because it omits the duty of obedience, which is equally important.\nOption D. 2,3,4 is incorrect because it does not include the duty of care, which is fundamental to the concept of fiduciary responsibility."
