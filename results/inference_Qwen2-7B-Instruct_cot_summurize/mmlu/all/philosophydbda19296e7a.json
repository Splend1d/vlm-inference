However, there are instances where telling the truth could lead to harm or danger. For example, if someone is about to drive drunk and you know that telling them the truth about their dangerous state will prevent an accident but also potentially cause them to lose trust in your honesty, this rule becomes morally impossible. It forces a choice between two ethical imperatives: preventing harm (vs. maintaining honesty.\n\nB. \"Always do whatever brings about the greatest happiness.\" This is known as utilitarianism, a moral theory that suggests actions are right if they promote happiness or pleasure, and wrong if they produce the opposite. However, this rule can lead to moral impossibilities when considering the concept of rights and duties. For instance, if maximizing happiness requires infringing upon someone else's rights (\u2014such as taking something without permission to help feed a starving person\u2014it creates a conflict between the greater good and respect for individual autonomy.\n\nC. \"Always assert what you don\u2019t think to be the case.\" This rule is inherently deceptive and dishonest. In many situations, people have a responsibility to tell the truth or at least not mislead others. If one were to always claim ignorance or false information, it could lead to misinformation, confusion, or manipulation, which are are ethically problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, all of these options present scenarios where following them would create moral impossibilities, as they force individuals into situations where adhering to one ethical principle necessarily contradicts another."
