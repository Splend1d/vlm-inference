Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. The man's nephew agreed to live on the farm and take care of it during his uncle's absence. When the man returned from his mother's home in 1999, he continued in possession until 2010 when the womanbrought an ejectment action. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. The court would most likely hold that\n\nA. the woman was the rightful owner and thus entitled to possess the farm.\nB. the woman was entitled to possession, because the man's intermittent possession was insufficient to make him an adverse possessor.\nC. the man was entitled to possession, because his possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required for the statutory period.\nD. the man was entitled to possession, because of the privity between the man and his nephew, which aided him in fulfilling the required statutory period.\n"

In this case:\n\n- The man took possession of the farm in 1987 and remained there until 1997, meeting the requirement for \"continuous\" possession.\n- He then returned to the farm in 1999 after caring for his sick mother, which breaks the continuous possession, but he re-acquired possession in 1999.\n- He maintained possession until 2010, satisfying the \"continuous\" requirement despite the break in 1997-1998.\n- His possession was \"hostile\" in that it was against the rights of the woman, who was the rightful owner at the time.\n\nTherefore, under these circumstances, the court would likely rule that the man had successfully acquired legal title to the farm through adverse possession, making option C the correct choice."
