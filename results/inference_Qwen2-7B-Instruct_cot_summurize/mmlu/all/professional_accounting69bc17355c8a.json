Acceptance of a client relationship. \n\nQuality control policies and procedures for a CPA firm typically include guidelines for accepting new clients, assessing their suitability for the firm, and managing the relationship to ensure compliance with professional standards and ethical considerations. This includes evaluating the client's business environment, the nature of the services required, and the potential for conflicts of interest or assurance issues. Professional skepticism, while important in auditing, is not specifically a part of the quality control policy related to acceptance of a client relationship. Computer information processing and efficiency of organizational structures might be addressed in the firm's operations manual but would not be directly part of the quality control policy for auditing practice."
