A good coach and the motivation to succeed.\n\nWhile factors such as diet and intelligence can certainly play roles in athletic performance, they are not necessarily the primary determinants of success in sports. \n\n1. **Innate Ability**: This refers to an athlete's natural physical attributes, like speed, strength, coordination, and agility. These are often genetically inherited traits that give athletes a competitive edge.\n\n2. **Capacity to Respond to Training Stimulus**: This means how well an athlete can adapt and improve through training. It includes their recovery capabilities, their ability to learn new skills or techniques, and their willingness to put in the necessary work and effort.\n\n3. **A Good Coach**: A skilled coach can help athletes optimize their abilities, refine their technique, and develop strategies for competition. They also provide motivation, set goals, and offer feedback, which are are critical for improvement and success.\n\n4. **Motivation to Succeed**: This internal drive is crucial. Motivation can come from various sources, including personal goals, a love for the sport, competition, or external factors like parental expectations or team camaraderie. High motivation helps athletes push through tough times, stay committed to training, and maintain focus on their objectives.\n\nTherefore, while diet and intelligence might contribute to an athlete\u2019s overall health and cognitive function, which can indirectly impact performance, it's the combination of innate talent, ability to train effectively, having a good coach, and strong motivation that are typically the most decisive factors in determining sporting success."
