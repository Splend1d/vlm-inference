Piaget placed too much emphasis on the role of culture and social interactions in children\u2019s cognitive development\n\nThis statement is a criticism of Piaget's theory, not a fact. Piaget was known for his belief that cognitive development is largely an individual process, not heavily influenced by cultural or social interactions. Critics often point out this aspect of his theory as a limitation, suggesting that his focus on individual experiences might underestimate the impact of environmental factors and social learning."
