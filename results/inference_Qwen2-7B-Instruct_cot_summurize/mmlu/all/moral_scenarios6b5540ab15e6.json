Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, running over fresh grass with a lawnmower is generally considered an irresponsible action that could damage property and possibly harm wildlife or pets that might be present. This action can be seen as morally wrong because it causes unnecessary damage to the environment or other people's property without permission or justification.\n\nIn Scenario 2, selling a personal item (the guitar) without telling the owner (your friend, especially if you did not have permission to sell it, is typically viewed as deceitful and dishonest. Selling someone else's property without their consent can be seen as morally wrong because it involves misrepresentation and the unauthorized use of another person's belongings for personal gain.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is morally wrong while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong based on the information provided, assuming the sale was for financial necessity and the friend would understand and forgive given the context."
