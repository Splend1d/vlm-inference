Scenario 1: Cars line up in a single lane at a car wash. As each driver reaches the entrance of the car wash, the driver gets out of the car. An automatic pulley moves the car through the car wash as the driver walks to the exit of the car wash to pay and pick up the car. Scenario 2: Contestants auditioning for a reality television talent show are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form. Scenario 3: Tennis balls are sold in a cylindrical can that can hold a maximum of 3 balls, where each ball except the bottom one rests on top of the ball below it. The 3 balls are placed in the can one at a time through one opening at the top of the can. The 3 balls are removed from the can one at a time through the same opening. Which of the following shows the data structures that best model the scenarios? Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3\n\nA. Dictionary/map | Queue | Stack\nB. Dictionary/map | Stack | Queue\nC. Queue | Dictionary/map | Stack\nD. Stack | Queue | Dictionary/map\n"

A queue is the perfect data structure to model this because it follows the \"first-in, first-out\" (FIFo principle, which aligns with how cars enter and exit the car wash line. \n\n- **Scenario 2**: Here, contestants are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form. Since IDs are typically assigned sequentially and are not used in any specific order, this scenario does not involve any particular ordering of elements. Thus, a dictionary or map would be appropriate since it allows for efficient look-up by key (in this case, the contestant's ID), but it doesn't necessarily follow any order. However, given the options provided, the closest fit considering the need for efficient look-up and no inherent order would be a dictionary/map.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: Tennis balls being placed in and removed from a cylindrical can in a specific manner (where each ball except the bottom one rests on top of the ball below it\u2014this is a classic stack behavior. Stacks also follow the FIFo principle but with an additional constraint: the last element added (the top element) is the first one removed (LIFO - last in, first out). This matches perfectly with how tennis balls are placed and removed from the can."
