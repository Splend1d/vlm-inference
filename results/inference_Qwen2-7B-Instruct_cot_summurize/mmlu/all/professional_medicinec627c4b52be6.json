He does not think the symptoms are problematic, but his wife is concerned because he sometimes falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present. He also once fell asleep while driving at night and drove off the road, narrowly avoiding injury. His wife says that he has always snored loudly, and over the past year, he has had episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 105 kg (231 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2 . His pulse is 76/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/76 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. 24-Hour ambulatory ECG monitoring\nB. Multiple sleep latency test\nC. Polysomnography\nD. CT scan of the head\n"

Polysomnography\n\nPolysomnography (also known as a sleep study or overnight sleep study, is the most definitive method to diagnose sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. It involves monitoring multiple physiological parameters during sleep, including brain activity, eye movements, muscle tone, heart rate, oxygen levels in the blood, and breathing patterns. This comprehensive assessment can identify whether the patient experiences pauses in breathing, frequent awakenings, and other sleep-related issues that might be contributing to their excessive daytime sleepiness and other symptoms. \n\nWhile options like 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring (A, multiple sleep latency test (B, and CT scan of the head D could provide useful information in certain contexts, they would not specifically address the potential sleep apnea in this case. A 24-hour ECG might help detect cardiac issues, a sleep latency test could assess rapid eye movement sleep onset, and a CT scan of the head could rule out structural brain abnormalities. However, none of these tests are as comprehensive for diagnosing sleep apnea as polysomnography."
