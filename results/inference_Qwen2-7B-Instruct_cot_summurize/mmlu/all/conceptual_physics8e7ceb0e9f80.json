Neither of these\n\nThe electric field does not get weaker with distance inside the plates (option A is incorrect), and it doesn't follow the inverse-square law (option B is incorrect) because the inverse-square law applies to point charges or fields emanating from a single source, which is not the case for two parallel plates."
