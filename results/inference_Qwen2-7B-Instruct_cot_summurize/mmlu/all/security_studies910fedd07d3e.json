Resilience refers to the ability of an IT system to identify and defend against a cyber-security threat.\nB. The only way to build a truly resilient IT system is to ensure that it can repel all types of threat and remain and avoid attack.\nC. Resilience in an IT system refers to its ability to function when there are no threats to its security.\nD. Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from attack.\n"

Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from attack.\n\nResilience in cybersecurity means that a system can withstand attacks, maintain functionality, and continue to operate effectively even when under threat. It involves having robust defense mechanisms in place, being able to detect and respond to breaches quickly, and having plans for recovery and restoration after an attack. This is crucial because it minimizes the impact of cyber-attacks, reduces downtime, and protects sensitive data."
