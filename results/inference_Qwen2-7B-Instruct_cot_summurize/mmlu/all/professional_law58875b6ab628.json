Sufficient, because it satisfies the title of seisin.\n\nIn legal terms, a conveyance instrument must provide a clear and definite description of the property being transferred. The phrase \"the eastern one-tenth of the western corner of the property\" provides a specific boundary for the land to be conveyed, which allows for identification of the property. Therefore, this description is sufficient to satisfy the title of seisin, which is the legal right or title to own property. \n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Insufficient, because it is too vague - This option would apply if the description did not provide enough detail to identify the property being conveyed. However, in this case, the description is precise.\n\nC. Sufficient, because the property can be identified - While this statement is true, it doesn't directly address the legal requirement for the conveyance instrument. The focus should be on whether the description satisfies the title of seisin.\n\nD. Insufficient, because the gifts to the children lacked consideration - The question does not mention anything about consideration, which refers to something of value exchanged between parties in a contract. The lack of consideration is not relevant to the sufficiency of the property description provided in the conveyance instrument."
