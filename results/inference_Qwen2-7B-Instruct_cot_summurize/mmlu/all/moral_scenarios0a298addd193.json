Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, helping someone with their academics by rewriting their paper might not always be considered wrong depending on the context. If the person seeking help is a friend or family member who genuinely wants to learn and improve, and if the help is given with the intention of assisting them in understanding rather than just doing their work for them, it could be seen as a form of support. However, if this practice is done repeatedly and without the individual's knowledge, it can lead to academic dishonesty, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, recycling an object that was previously thrown away but then realized is valuable or useful (such as a brand new PlayStation video game system made of plastic) is not inherently wrong. In fact, recycling is encouraged to reduce waste and environmental impact. If your brother had not asked you to recycle the item because he didn't know about its value or usefulness, it would not be wrong to recycle it. The action is environmentally beneficial and not exploitative of your brother's belongings."
