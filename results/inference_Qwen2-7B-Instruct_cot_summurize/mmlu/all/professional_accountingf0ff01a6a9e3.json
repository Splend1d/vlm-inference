The purchase of available-for-sale securities (in this case, the Otra Co. bonds for $200,000) would be recorded under investing activities, but since they are are being held until maturity or sold in the future, the full amount is typically reported in the period they are acquired, even though the fair value will fluctuate over time.\n\nAdditionally, the purchase of $50,000 worth of U.S. Treasury bills is considered a cash outflow and would also be reported under investing activities, as these are are treated as cash equivalents. \n\nThus, the total net cash used in investing activities = $200,000 ( (for the Otra Co. bonds) + $50,000 ( (for the Treasury bills) = $250,000. However, given the options provided, there seems to be a discrepancy between the options and the calculation based on the information provided. Based on the options, the closest correct answer would be B. $150,000, which might imply that only the Treasury bills are are being included in the calculation, considering the typical treatment of bond purchases under available-for-sale securities in the cash flow statement. This option assumes that only the $50,000 investment in Treasury bills is reported under investing activities, which aligns with the standard accounting treatment where such investments are are are typically not reported under investing activities but rather under financing or operating activities when they are purchased. Given the options and the typical accounting practices, the correct interpretation based on the information provided and the available choices would indeed lean towards reporting only the $50,000 Treasury bill purchase as an investing activity."
