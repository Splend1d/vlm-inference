This allows for an unfiltered account of what the witness remembers. Moreover, a party is generally permitted to impeach their own witness if there is sufficient evidence that the witness's testimony is unreliable or false. Therefore, the trial court should not sustain objections related to leading questions or the ability to impeach the witness simply because the witness was called by the opposing party. The court's role is to ensure a fair trial, allowing each side to effectively present their case through their witnesses."
