If their mean diameter is under 1.23 centimeters or over 1.27 centimeters, the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed. The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0: \u03bc = 1.25 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: \u03bc \u2260 1.25. The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected. In test terminology, what would a Type II error result in?\n\nA. A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery\nB. An unnecessary stoppage of the production process\nC. Continued production of wrong size ball bearings\nD.

Continued production of wrong size ball bearings\n\nA Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0) when it is actually false. In this scenario, if the machinery is not adjusted because the test did not detect that the mean diameter of the ball bearings is significantly different from 1.25 cm (when it actually is, say it's too small or too large), then the production will continue without making necessary adjustments. This means the ball bearings produced might be consistently smaller than 1.23 cm or larger than 1.27 cm, leading to continued production of the wrong size ball bearings."
