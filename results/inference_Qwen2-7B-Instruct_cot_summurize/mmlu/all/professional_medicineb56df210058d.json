He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle\nC. Glycogenolysis in the liver\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues\n"

However, the primary mechanism that maintains blood glucose levels within the reference range after an overnight fast is glycogenolysis in the liver.\n\nGlycogenolysis refers to the breakdown of stored glycogen (a polysaccharide that stores glucose) into glucose-1-phosphate, which can then be converted to glucose-6-phosphate and eventually released into the bloodstream as glucose. This process helps maintain stable blood glucose levels during periods when food intake is low.\n\nThe other options do not directly explain how the man's serum glucose concentration remained within the reference range:\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal would lead to increased glucose levels, not stabilization.\n\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle is a minor contributor to overall glucose homeostasis compared to the liver's role.\n\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues is related to satiety and energy balance, but it does not directly contribute to the maintenance of serum glucose levels."
