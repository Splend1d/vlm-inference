Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, hiding a blanket from someone who is shivering could be seen as morally wrong because it deprives them of immediate relief and care, assuming that the blanket was necessary for the person's well-being and you had the means to provide it without any cost or inconvenience to yourself. This action potentially disregards the welfare and needs of another individual.\n\nIn Scenario 2, ensuring that one's children get food while there isn't enough for everyone else can be considered a morally justifiable act. It prioritizes the well-being of one's own children, which is a natural and often societal expectation, especially if the parents have legal custody or parental rights over their children. Moreover, this action does not necessarily harm others since the intention is to care for one's own family members.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 presents a morally questionable action, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong, considering the context and intent behind the action."
