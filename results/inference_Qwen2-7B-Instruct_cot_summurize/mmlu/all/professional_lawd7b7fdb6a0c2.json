The defendant claimed he acted in self-defense after the man drew a knife on him and made menacing gestures with it. The defendant called a witness to the stand to testify that the defendant had a reputation in the community for being a peaceful person. On cross-examination of the witness, the prosecuting attorney asked the witness if he had heard that the defendant had often engaged in fights and brawls. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the trial judge should rule the question\n\nA. proper, because it tends to show the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation.\nB. proper, because it is relevant to prove the defendant's violent propensities.\nC. not proper, because it puts into evidence separate and unrelated offenses.\nD. not proper, because character cannot be proved by generalities.\n"

This line of questioning could potentially confuse or mislead the jury, as it shifts attention away from the specific events and circumstances surrounding the incident in question. It is important to keep the trial focused on the facts pertinent to the charges at hand rather than introducing irrelevant details about the defendant's past actions."
