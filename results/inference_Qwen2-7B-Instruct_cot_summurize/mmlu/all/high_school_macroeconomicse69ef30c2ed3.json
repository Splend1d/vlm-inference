                    "text": "In the short run, a contractionary monetary policy typically leads to a decrease in aggregate demand, a decrease in output, and a decrease in the price level. This is because contractionary monetary policy involves measures such as raising interest rates or selling government securities, which tend to reduce the money supply in the economy. This reduction in the money supply makes borrowing more expensive, thus dampening spending (both consumer and business), leading to lower aggregate demand. As demand for goods and services falls, businesses may cut production, resulting in lower output. Additionally, with reduced demand and lower levels of economic activity, prices tend to fall as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Decreases    Decreases    Increases"
