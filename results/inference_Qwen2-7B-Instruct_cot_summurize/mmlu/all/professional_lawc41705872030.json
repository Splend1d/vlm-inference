Hold onto the goods and make the best of them because a business cannot reject goods already approved by a written agreement signed by both parties.\nB. Try the goods out for several months; if they are not going to be satisfactory, then ship them back to the seller who must provide a refund.\nC.

Identify and document the nonconformity, then send the goods back right away.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a buyer has certain rights when receiving nonconforming goods. The buyer should:\n\n1. **Identify and Document the Nonconformity:** Carefully identify the specific nature of the nonconformity. This could include defects in quality, quantity, or other material issues that prevent the goods from meeting the contract specifications. It's important to document these issues thoroughly, including any relevant communications with the seller, photographs, or test results that confirm the nonconformity.\n\n2. **Notify the Seller:** Promptly notify the seller of the nonconformity. This notification should clearly state the issue(s) and include the evidence gathered during the identification process. The notice should be given within a reasonable time after the buyer becomes aware of the problem, typically before taking any actions that might exacerbate the issue or make it more difficult to resolve.\n\n3. **Return the Goods:** Depending on the severity and nature of the nonconformity, the buyer may have the right to return the goods to the seller. The return process should be coordinated with the seller, and ideally, documented through a formal return authorization (RA) process if available. The goods should be returned in their original condition or as close to it as possible, unless the nature of the nonconformity makes this impractical.\n\n4. **Seek Remedies:** After returning the goods, the buyer can seek remedies such as a refund, replacement of the goods, repair, or a reduction in price. The exact remedy will depend on the specifics of the contract and the nature of the nonconformity.\n\nIt's important for the buyer to consult legal counsel familiar with the UCC and applicable laws in their jurisdiction to ensure compliance with all legal requirements and to effectively pursue their rights as a buyer."
