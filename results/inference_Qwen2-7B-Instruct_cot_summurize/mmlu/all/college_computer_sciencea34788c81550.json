Worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.** This is true because in a balanced binary search tree, each step reduces the search space approximately by half. Thus, the worst-case time complexity for searching an element is \\(O(\\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of nodes.\n\n- **II. Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.** This is also true for a balanced binary search tree. Since it maintains balance, the average number of comparisons needed to find an element is also \\(O(\\log n)\\).\n\n- **IV. The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes.** This statement is true for a balanced binary search tree. Given that the tree is balanced, its height grows logarithmically with the number of nodes, which is another way of saying that the tree's structure allows for efficient search operations.\n\n**III. Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree.** This statement is not accurate as the best-case scenario would imply finding the target on the first attempt, regardless of the tree's height. In a balanced binary search tree, while the height provides an upper bound on the search time, the best-case scenario is not directly proportional to the height but rather depends on the specific location of the target within the tree.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C do not fully capture the properties of a height-balanced binary search tree as described by statements I, II, and IV."
