The atomic mass of Chromium is approximately 52, which represents the sum of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. To find out the number of neutrons, we subtract the atomic number from the atomic mass:\n\nNumber of neutrons = Atomic mass - Atomic number = 52 - 24 = 28\n\nThe number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons since atoms are neutral overall. Therefore, there are also 24 electrons.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 24 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons."
