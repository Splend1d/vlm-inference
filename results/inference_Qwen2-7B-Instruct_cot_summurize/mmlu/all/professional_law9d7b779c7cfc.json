The mortgage was promptly recorded. The next year, the father died intestate. The father's heirs were the son and his two sisters. The sisters first learned of the mortgage just after their father died. The sisters now assert that the son, their brother, holds the mortgage for their benefit as well as for himself because as a tenant in common with his sisters, he has a fiduciary duty toward them. There are no applicable statutes. Are the sisters correct?\n\nA. No, because the mortgage was granted before the tenancy in common was created.\nB. No, because the three siblings took the farm as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\nC. Yes, because a fiduciary relationship exists among tenants in common.\nD. Yes, because their three interests are equal.\n"

No, because the three siblings took the farm as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nIn this scenario, the key factor is the nature of the property ownership between the siblings. When individuals own property together as tenants in common, each owner has an undivided interest in the whole property, but these interests do not automatically pass to the other owners upon the death of one of them. Instead, the deceased owner's share typically passes according to the terms of their will or, if there is no will, through state intestacy laws.\n\nIn contrast, joint tenants with right of survivorship would have different rules; when one joint tenant dies, their share immediately passes to the surviving joint tenants without going through probate. However, since it is stated that the siblings took the farm as tenants in common, the typical rule applies where the deceased tenant's interest would pass to their heirs ( in this case, their children ( under intestacy laws unless there is a specific agreement or will stating otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the assertion that the son holds the mortgage for the benefit of his sisters as well as for himself due to a fiduciary duty does not hold true under the standard rules of property law regarding tenants in common. The sisters' claim would depend on whether they have any specific rights or agreements established prior to their father's death that grant them rights over the mortgage. Without such provisions, the standard legal principles suggest that the son would hold the mortgage primarily for his own benefit, as it was secured by his father's farm during his lifetime."
