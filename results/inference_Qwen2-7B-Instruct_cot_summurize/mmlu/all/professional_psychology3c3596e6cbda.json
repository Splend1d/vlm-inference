Universal, selective, and indicative.\n\nThese three terms represent different aspects or levels of primary prevention:\n\n1. **Universal Prevention**: This approach targets the entire population without any specific selection criteria. It aims to reduce risk factors that affect everyone, such as promoting healthy eating habits, regular exercise, and vaccinations.\n\n2. **Selective Prevention**: This level of prevention focuses on specific high-risk groups within the population. For example, it might involve providing educational programs about substance abuse for students in schools with high rates of such issues.\n\n3. **Indicative Prevention**: Also known as indicated prevention, this involves identifying individuals who show early signs of potential health problems or risk behaviors. For instance, offering smoking cessation programs to individuals who smoke or screening for high blood pressure.\n\nEach of these facets of primary prevention plays a crucial role in health promotion and disease prevention by addressing risk factors at different levels of the population."
