This behavior is particularly interesting because it often goes against the common practice of voting for all candidates from the same political party ( to form a \"party ticket.\" \n\nIn option B, a voter is making strategic choices based on individual preferences for different races or offices rather than aligning with the overall party platform. This can lead to a mix of party affiliations across different elected positions."
