Humanistic therapists focus on creating a supportive environment where clients can explore their feelings and experiences freely. They often use empathetic responses like nodding and saying affirmations (\"yes, uh huh\") to show understanding and encourage the client to continue sharing. This approach contrasts with the more structured methods of psychoanalysis, behavior therapy, and cognitive therapy, which have different focuses and techniques."
