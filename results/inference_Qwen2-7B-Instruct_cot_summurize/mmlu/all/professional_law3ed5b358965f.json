The man should be found guilty of\n\nA. burglary.\nB. robbery and burglary.\nC. robbery and murder.\nD. burglary, robbery, and murder.\n"

Since the retiree died as a direct result of the struggle to free himself (due to suffering a heart attack), the man can be charged with murder.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific charges would depend on the laws of the jurisdiction in question and how they define these crimes, including whether the death is considered a result of the felony (which could elevate the charge of murder under certain laws (such as felony murder rules). However, based on the information provided, the correct answer choice reflects the most common understanding of the charges in this scenario."
