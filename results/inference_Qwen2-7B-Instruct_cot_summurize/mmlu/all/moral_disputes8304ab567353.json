Instead, it appears to suggest a hopeful perspective on societal change, which could be seen as a potential positive outcome rather than an objection.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. \"The argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism\" - This is an objection because it suggests that the argument incorrectly assumes that a person's traits and abilities are entirely determined by their genetic makeup, ignoring environmental and other factors.\n\nB. \"The expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually\" - This is also an objection because it questions whether placing any additional burdens or expectations on SCNT children is ethically justifiable compared to those conceived through sexual reproduction.\n\nD. \"If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT\" - This is an objection because it implies that societal acceptance or lack thereof should dictate the ethical permissibility of a scientific procedure, potentially overlooking the complex ethical considerations involved in such technologies."
