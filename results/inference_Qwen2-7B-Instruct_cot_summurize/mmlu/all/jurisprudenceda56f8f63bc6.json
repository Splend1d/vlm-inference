The international recognition of human rights after World War II\n\nThe revival of natural law in the 20th century was significantly influenced by the international recognition of human rights after World War II. This period saw the drafting and adoption of several key international documents that affirmed the principles of natural law, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. These documents recognized fundamental human rights that were seen as inherent and universal, reflecting core principles of natural law.\n\nWhile events like the Great Depression, the rise of Fascism, and the Bolshevik Revolution may have had broader societal impacts, they did not directly contribute to the revival of natural law as understood in legal and philosophical contexts."
