This action reduces the cost of borrowing, encourages lending, and increases liquidity in the financial markets, thereby stimulating economic activity.\n\nConversely, options A (budget surpluses and higher discount rates, D increases in government spending and higher discount rates, would typically be used during a period of economic expansion or inflationary pressures to cool down the economy."
