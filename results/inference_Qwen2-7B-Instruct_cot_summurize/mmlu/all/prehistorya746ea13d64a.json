These included the use of irrigation systems to cultivate crops in an area prone to drought, the construction of terraces to stabilize the slopes of hills and mountains, and the creation of chinampas - floating gardens made of paddy fields mud and vegetation that were placed on shallow lake beds. This allowed them to grow a variety of crops even in the limited arable land available."
