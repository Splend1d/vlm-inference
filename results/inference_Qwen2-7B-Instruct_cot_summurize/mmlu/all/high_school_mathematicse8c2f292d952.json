The integers from 3 to 14 (inclusive) will give us the potential square roots of our odd perfect squares because 1 and 2 do not give odd squares when squared, and 15 and above would exceed 211 when squared.\n\nThe odd numbers in this range are: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13.\n\nNow, let's square each of these odd numbers to see if they fall within the given range (between 5 and 211:\n\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n- \\(9^2 = 81\\)\n- \\(11^2 = 121\\)\n- \\(13^2 = 169\\)\n\nAll of these squares fall within the desired range of 5 to 211, so there are are **6** odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 6**."
