Therefore, this $6,000 unrealized gain would be recognized in Dodd Co.'s balance sheet, not in its income statement. However, if asked for the amount that should be recognized in the income statement, the correct answer would be $0, as per standard accounting practices for available-for-sale securities. The tax impact mentioned in the question does not affect the calculation of the unrealized gain itself but would be considered when recognizing the gain or loss on the sale of these securities."
