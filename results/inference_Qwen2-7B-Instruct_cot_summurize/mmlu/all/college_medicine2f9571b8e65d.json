Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Anal\n\nDuring the anal stage, which typically occurs from ages 1 to 3, children learn about order, organization, and control over bowel and bladder functions. Issues or conflicts during this stage can lead to fixation, manifesting in behaviors such as neatness or messiness, control issues, or stubbornness later in life."
