The Supreme Court receives thousands of petitions each term, but it only agrees to hear a small fraction of them. The Court's docket is carefully managed, and the Justices consider various factors when deciding whether to grant certiorari, including the importance of the legal question, the need for uniformity in the law, and the potential for broader implications. Given the limited number of cases the Court can hear, it typically selects cases that are deemed particularly significant or have the potential to resolve important questions of law."
