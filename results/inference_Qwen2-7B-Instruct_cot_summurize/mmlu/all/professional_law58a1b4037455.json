The man raised his gun at the officers and a flurry of shots followed. The man was injured but survived; the woman co-conspirator died from a police officer's bullet. The authorities charged the man with felony-murder of the woman. He was convicted and appealed. Under the prevailing modern view of felony murder, will the appellate court likely reverse the first-degree murder conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because the felony murder rule has been declared unconstitutional.\nB. Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime.\nC. No, because all states recognize that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime regardless of who fired the fatal shot.\nD. No, because the man started the flurry of shots instead of surrendering; he caused the woman's death and is guilty of first degree murder.\n"

No, because all states recognize that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime regardless of who fired the fatal shot.\n\nUnder the prevailing modern view of felony murder, the law typically holds that if a death occurs during the commission of a felony (such as a bank robbery), and the defendant knew or should have known that the risk of death was a foreseeable consequence of the felony, then the defendant can be held liable for felony murder, even if the death was caused by someone other than the defendant. This is true regardless of whether the death was caused by the defendant's actions, the actions of the victim, or the actions of law enforcement. Therefore, it is unlikely that the appellate court would reverse the first-degree murder conviction based on the felony murder rule."
