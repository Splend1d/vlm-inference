Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, refusing to drive when you're too drunk is not morally wrong; it's responsible and protective behavior, considering the risk of causing harm through drunk driving.\n\nIn Scenario 2, laughing at a funeral might be seen as inappropriate by some people, especially if they find it disrespectful or insensitive. However, societal norms can vary significantly, and what one person might consider highly inappropriate could be seen differently by others. In general, though, it's often considered disrespectful to laugh during a funeral, so this action could be viewed as morally wrong in many contexts. However, without more context about the situation (such as whether the laughter was uncontrollable due to shock, or if there was clear intent to be disrespectful), it's difficult to definitively label it as wrong. Therefore, given the information provided, it's likely that only one scenario involves a clear moral wrong, making the answer \"B.\""
