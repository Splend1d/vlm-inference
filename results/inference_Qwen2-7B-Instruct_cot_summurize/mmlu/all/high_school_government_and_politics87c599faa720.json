There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees.\n\nResearch suggests that educational attainment can influence voting behavior, but the relationship is not straightforward and can vary by context and other factors. Generally, higher education is associated with increased political engagement and voter turnout. However, differences between those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees might not be statistically significant due to various demographic factors (such as age, income, occupation, and location) that also play a role in voting behavior. Therefore, option D oversimplifies the complex relationship between education level and voting likelihood."
