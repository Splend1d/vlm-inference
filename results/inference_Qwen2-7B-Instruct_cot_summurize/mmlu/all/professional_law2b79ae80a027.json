Since no fundamental right is involved, the petitioner must show the age restriction is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\nC.

Since no fundamental right is involved, the petitioner must show the age restriction is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n\nWhen a law affects a non-fundamental right, such as the right to run for public office, the standard of review is rational basis review. Under this standard, the state only needs to demonstrate that the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. This means that the state must show that the age restriction serves a valid purpose and that there is a reasonable connection between the age limit and that purpose. The petitioner, in this case, would have the burden of proving that the age restriction is not rationally related to any legitimate government interest."
