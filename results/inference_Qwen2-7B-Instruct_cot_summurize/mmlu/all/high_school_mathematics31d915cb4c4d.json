That is,\n\n\\[f'(\\xi) = \\frac{f(\\pi) - f(0)}{\\pi - 0}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\xi\\) is some value in \\((0,\\pi)\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\(f(0)\\) and \\(f(\\pi)\\):\n\n- \\(f(0) = 2\\sin(0) + \\sin(0) = 0\\)\n- \\(f(\\pi) = 2\\sin(\\pi) + \\sin(4\\pi) = 0 + 0 = 0\\)\n\nThus, the average rate of change is:\n\n\\[\\frac{f(\\pi) - f(0)}{\\pi - 0} = \\frac{0 - 0}{\\pi} = 0\\]\n\nSo, we're looking for values of \\(c\\) in \\((0,\\pi)\\) where \\(f'(c) = 0\\). Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us:\n\n\\[2\\cos(c) + 4\\cos(4c) = 0\\]\n\nThis equation is not trivial to solve analytically due to the presence of both \\(c\\) and \\(4c\\) inside the cosine functions. However, given the periodic nature of the cosine function and the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\), we can infer that within this interval, each of the cosine terms will have at most two zeros (one for \\(c\\) and another for \\(4c\\), considering their periods and the fact that they oscillate between -1 and 1.\n\nFor \\(2\\cos(c) = 0\\), \\(c = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) is a solution in \\([0,\\pi]\\).\nFor \\(4\\cos(4c) = 0\\), solving \\(4c = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) leads to \\(c = \\frac{\\pi}{8}, \\frac{3\\pi}{8}\\), which are also in \\([0,\\pi]\\).\n\nTherefore, there are are 3 points in the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\) where \\(f(x) = 2\\sin(x) + \\sin(4x)\\) satisfies the Mean Value Theorem.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 3."
