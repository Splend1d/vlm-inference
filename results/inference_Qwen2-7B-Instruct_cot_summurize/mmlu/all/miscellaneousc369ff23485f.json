Take periodic breaks to view natural lighting\n\nTo prevent screen-induced eyestrain, it's important for computer users to take regular breaks and look away from the screen to reduce visual fatigue. Looking at natural light can help relax your eyes and give them a rest from the constant focus required when staring at a screen. \n\nUsing eye drops (A could be helpful if you experience dry eye symptoms due to screen use, but it's not a direct solution for eyestrain caused by screen viewing. Changing the choice of software programs (B or limiting the resolution on the monitor (C might improve readability and comfort slightly, but these changes don't directly address the issue of eyestrain that comes from prolonged screen viewing."
