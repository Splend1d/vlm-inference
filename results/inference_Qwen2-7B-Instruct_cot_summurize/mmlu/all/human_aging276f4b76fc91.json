Internal.\n\nInternal control refers to an individual's personal resources, skills, and abilities that they can use to manage their environment and overcome challenges. People with strong internal control are more likely to adapt to their living conditions and find ways to address any accessibility issues they may encounter.\n\nExternal, primary, and total control refer to different aspects of environmental or systemic factors that might impact accessibility. For example, external control involves the influence of the physical environment, policies, and other external entities on an individual's ability to access resources or perform tasks. Internal control, as mentioned, pertains to an individual's own capabilities and resources. Primary control often refers to the initial choice or decision-making power one has in a situation. Total control implies having complete authority over all aspects of a situation. In the context of accessibility problems, individuals with high levels of internal control are generally less likely to face significant barriers due to their ability to cope and adapt effectively."
