He did not necessarily imply that the underclass consisted solely of people who formed an \"inferior 'race' with low levels of intelligence\" ( as this statement reflects a racialized view that is not supported by Murray's work. Instead, Murray often discussed the concept of the underclass in terms of societal issues such as welfare dependency, lack of work ethic, and a breakdown of traditional family structures.\n\nHowever, Murray did suggest that some members of the underclass may exhibit behaviors such as living \"morally unsound lives of crime and squalor,\" which he saw as indicative of a broader societal problem. He argued that the underclass was characterized by high rates of welfare dependence, single-parent households, and a lack of educational attainment and job skills.\n\nAdditionally, Murray did emphasize the importance of individual responsibility and the role of the family in providing a stable environment for children to thrive. He believed that the welfare system could inadvertently contribute to the problem by creating incentives for dependency rather than self-sufficiency.\n\nIt's important to note that Murray's views on the underclass are controversial and have been subject to criticism for oversimplifying complex social phenomena and potentially reinforcing stereotypes about disadvantaged groups. His ideas have sparked debates on the nature of poverty, social policy, and the responsibilities of individuals and society in addressing economic inequality."
