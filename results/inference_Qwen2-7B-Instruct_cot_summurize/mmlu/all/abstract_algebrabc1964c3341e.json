A factor (or quotient) group \\(G/N\\) can be either Abelian or non-Abelian depending on the group \\(G\\) and the normal subgroup \\(N\\). For example, if \\(G\\) is a non-Abelian group but \\(N\\) is chosen such that it contains all the commutators of \\(G\\), then \\(G/N\\) can become an Abelian group because the relations imposed by the normal subgroup \\(N\\) might force the elements to commute in the factor group.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is true. If \\(K\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(H\\), and \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\), then indeed \\(K\\) is also a normal subgroup of \\(G\\). This follows directly from the definition of normal subgroups and the chain of inclusion \\(K \\leq H \\leq G\\). Since \\(K\\) is normal in \\(H\\), for any \\(h \\in H\\) and \\(k \\ \\in K\\), \\(hkh^{-1} \\in K\\). And since \\(H\\) is normal in \\(G\\), for any \\(g \\ \\in G\\) and \\(h \\ \\in H\\), \\(ghg^{-1} \\in H\\). By transitivity, for any \\(g \\in G\\) and \\(k \\in K\\), \\(gkg^{-1}\\) must be in \\(H\\), and since \\(H\\) is normal in \\(G\\), this means \\(gkg^{-1}\\) must also be in \\(K\\), proving \\(K\\) is normal in \\(G\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. False, True**."
