The key here is that the substitute should have similar reactivity and ability to reduce substances to a desired oxidation state as the silver metal amalgam.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. H+(aq) - This is a hydrogen ion in aqueous solution. It can't act as a reducing agent since it tends to oxidize rather than reduce other elements.\n\nB. Na(s) - Sodium metal. This is a strong reducing agent, capable of reducing many elements to their ground state. It is a good candidate for a substitute.\n\nC. Ca2+(aq) - Calcium ion in aqueous solution. It does not have any reducing properties; it will tend to oxidize rather than reduce other elements.\n\nD. Mg(s) - Magnesium metal. Like sodium, magnesium is a strong reducing agent and could potentially be used as a substitute.\n\nBased on the criteria, both B (Na(s) and D. Mg(s) are strong reducing agents and could serve as substitutes for silver metal amalgam in certain chemical reactions. However, considering the question's context of seeking a \"reasonable and safe\" substitute, sodium might be considered more suitable due to its higher reactivity and widespread availability compared to magnesium. Therefore, the best answer would be **B. Na(s)**."
