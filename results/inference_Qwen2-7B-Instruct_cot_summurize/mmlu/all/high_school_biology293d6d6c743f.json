The evolution of eukaryotic cells introduced membrane-bound organelles that allowed for compartmentalization within the cell. This separation provided distinct spaces for various metabolic processes, such as the production of energy (in mitochondria), protein synthesis (in the endoplasmic reticulum), and DNA replication (in the nucleus), among others. This specialization increased the efficiency of these processes and overall cellular function."
