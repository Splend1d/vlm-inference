This concept suggests that the moral norms and laws we follow in society are essentially agreements among individuals, either real or imagined, to form a social order. These agreements might be explicit, as in written constitutions, or implicit, as in unspoken understandings about how society should function. The idea is that these agreements are mutually beneficial and allow for cooperation within society."
