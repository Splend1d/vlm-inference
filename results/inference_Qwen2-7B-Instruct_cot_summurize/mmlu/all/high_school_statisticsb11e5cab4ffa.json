The formula for the standard error is:\n\n\\[ SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of voters surveyed.\n\n\\[ SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.64(1-0.64)}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2816}{400}} = \\sqrt{0.00070375} \\approx 0.026 \\]\n\nNow, to find the margin of error (ME), which gives us the range around our sample proportion where we expect the true population proportion to lie with a certain level of confidence, we use:\n\n\\[ ME = Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE \\]\n\nFor a 90% confidence interval, \\( Z_{\\alpha/2} \\) is approximately 1.645 ( (this comes from the standard normal distribution table).\n\n\\[ ME = 1.645 \\times 0.026 \\approx 0.04 \\]\n\nSo, the margin of error is about 4%. This means that we are 90% confident that the true proportion of undecided voters in the population falls within the range of:\n\n\\[ 0.64 \\pm 0.04 \\]\n\n\\[ 60\\% \\text{ to } 68\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 90.4%, which is an approximation based on understanding that the confidence level corresponding to a margin of error of about 4% is close to 90%.\n\n**Note:** The exact percentage might vary slightly depending on the precise calculation method used for \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\), but the closest choice given the options provided is D. 90.4%."
