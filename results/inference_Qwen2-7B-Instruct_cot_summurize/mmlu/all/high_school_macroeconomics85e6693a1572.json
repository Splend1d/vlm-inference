The initial impact on the reserves in the banking system would be a reduction of $29 million ( (the amount sold).\n\nHowever, due to the reserve requirement, banks are only required to hold 10% of their deposits as reserves. This means that for every dollar of new deposits, banks can lend out 90 cents. Therefore, when the Fed sells securities and removes $29 million from the banking system, this action reduces the total amount of money that can be lent out by the banking system.\n\nTo calculate the total decrease in the money supply:\n\nInitial reduction in reserves = $29 million\n\nMoney multiplier = 1 / Reserve ratio = 1 / 0.10 = 10\n\nTotal decrease in money supply = Initial reduction in reserves * Money multiplier = $29 million * 10 = $290 million\n\nSo, the money supply can decrease by $290 million."
