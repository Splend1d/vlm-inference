The IEA reported that Chile's renewable energy investment as a percentage of GDP was 3.8%, which was higher than any other country at the time. \n\nChina, on the other hand, was the world's largest investor in renewable energy overall in 2015, but it invested a smaller fraction of its GDP in renewables compared to Chile. India and Japan also invested in renewable energy, but their investments as a percentage of GDP were lower than Chile's."
