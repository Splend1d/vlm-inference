After the dishwasher had been installed in the buyer's home, it functioned properly for the first month. Then it began to make a loud rattling noise whenever it was in use. The buyer called the appliance store, and a manager there assured her that it was not uncommon for the dishwasher to make such a noise. Moreover, he indicated that the machine's clamorous sound would eventually disappear with continued use. One week later, after a dinner party, the buyer placed her most expensive china set in the dishwasher and turned on the machine. After the dishwasher had been in operation for a few minutes, the buyer heard the rattling noise followed by the sound of breaking china. She immediately stopped the machine. Upon looking inside, she saw that a blade from the dishwasher had broken, destroying her entire china set. If the buyer asserts a claim for strict products liability against the appliance company, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\nB. Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.\nC. No, because the buyer was not personally injured.\nD. No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.\n"

Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\n\nStrict products liability is a legal concept under which manufacturers can be held liable for damages caused by their products, even if they were not negligent in producing them. To prevail in a strict products liability case, the plaintiff (in this case, the buyer - must prove that:\n\n1. The product was defective when it left the manufacturer's control.\n2. The defect caused the injury or damage.\n3. The plaintiff was using the product in a way that was intended or foreseeable.\n\nIn this scenario, the dishwasher was functioning properly initially but then developed a defect (the rattling noise and the subsequent breaking of the china set due to a broken blade). This defect caused the injury (damage to the buyer's property (the china set). The buyer was using the dishwasher in a manner consistent with its intended use (cleaning dishes).\n\nTherefore, the buyer would likely have a strong case for strict products liability based on the facts provided, assuming no other mitigating circumstances apply (such as misuse of the product or failure to take reasonable precautions after noticing the rattling noise."
