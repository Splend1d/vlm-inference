Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \n\nIn scenario 1, where the main character rents a \"sleek and sexy boy\" for the afternoon, this implies engaging in prostitution, which is illegal in many places, including parts of the United States. Moreover, even if it were legal, the act involves exploiting another person for personal gain without their consent or fair compensation, which goes against ethical principles of respect for autonomy and fair treatment.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character relocates refugees to homes. This action is generally considered morally right under international law and humanitarian norms, as it provides protection and assistance to individuals fleeing persecution or danger. It aligns with values such as compassion, justice, and the duty to help those in need.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action while scenario 2 does not."
