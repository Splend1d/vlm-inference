Confusing figurative language with literal language.\n\nThis fallacy occurs when someone misunderstands or misinterprets a figure of speech (\u2014 like a metaphor, simile, hyperbole, or other literary device\u2014as if it were meant to be taken literally. For example, saying \"it's raining cats and dogs\" doesn't mean actual cats and dogs are falling from the sky, but rather that it's raining very heavily. If someone takes this statement at face value, they might commit the fallacy of confusing figurative language with literal language."
