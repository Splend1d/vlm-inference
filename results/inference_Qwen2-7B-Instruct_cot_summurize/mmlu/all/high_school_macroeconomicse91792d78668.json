The bank can make additional loans.\n\nExcess reserves refer to the amount of reserves ( such as cash or deposits held at a central bank - that a bank holds above and beyond what is required by law or policy. When a bank has excess reserves, it means it has more reserves than the amount required by regulations or needed to meet customer demands. This situation allows the bank to lend out more money, which in turn can stimulate economic activity by increasing the money supply in the economy."
