This cooperation can involve compromise on legislation or shared goals that benefit the country as a whole. While each party may have its own set of priorities and ideologies, periods of bipartisanship can lead to more stable and enduring policies outcomes. \n\nJudicial activism (B), constitutional fragmentation of power (C), and affirmative action programs D) are not primary mechanisms for achieving relative stability in American public policy. Judicial activism refers to judges making significant decisions based on personal beliefs rather than the law, which can lead to instability if not aligned with legislative intent. Constitutional fragmentation of power involves the division of governmental powers among different branches or levels of government, which can lead to checks and balances but does not inherently ensure policy stability. Affirmative action programs aim to address historical discrimination by promoting equal opportunities, and while they can be controversial, they are not typically seen as a stabilizing force in public policy."
