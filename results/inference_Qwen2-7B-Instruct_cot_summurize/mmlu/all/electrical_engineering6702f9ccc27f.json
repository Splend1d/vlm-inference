Based on the difference between the actual output and the desired output (known as the error signal), adjustments are made to the system to minimize this error. This feedback mechanism allows for precise control and adaptation to changes in the system's environment or inputs. \n\nIn contrast, an open loop control system operates without any feedback from its output. The system executes a predetermined sequence of actions without adjusting its performance based on the results of those actions. Since there is no feedback loop, changes in the input or disturbances in the system cannot be compensated for automatically."
