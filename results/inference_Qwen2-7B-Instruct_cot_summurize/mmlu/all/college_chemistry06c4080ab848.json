After a pulse with B1, the populations tend to equilibrate based on the energy difference between the two states.\n\nGiven that initially, n\u03b1 = n\u03b1eq and n\u03b2 = n\u03b2eq, where n\u03b1eq and n\u03b2eq represent the equilibrium populations, we need to determine the populations after a 5.0 \u03bcs pulse with B1 = 4.697 mT.\n\nIn NMR, when a pulse is applied, the populations of the two spin states will redistribute according to the energy difference between them and the duration of the pulse. If the pulse is short compared to the relaxation times of the system, the populations will not have time to fully redistribute to their equilibrium values. Therefore, immediately after the pulse, the populations will be closer to each other than at equilibrium.\n\nOption C suggests that n\u03b1 = \u00bd(n\u03b1eq + n\u03b2eq) and n\u03b2 = \u00bd(n\u03b1eq + n\u03b2eq), which is the correct answer under these conditions. This means that after the pulse, the population in each state would be equal to half the sum of the initial populations in both states, reflecting the redistribution due to the magnetic field pulse but before they reach full equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. n\u03b1 = \u00bd(n\u03b1eq + n\u03b2eq) and n\u03b2 = \u00bd(n\u03b1eq + n\u03b2eq)"
