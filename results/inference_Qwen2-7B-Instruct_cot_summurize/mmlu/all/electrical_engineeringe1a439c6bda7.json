Since the full scale reading is 100V, the maximum error the voltmeter can have is:\n\n\\[ 2\\% \\times 100V = 2V \\]\n\nThe actual measurement made by the voltmeter is 75V. The error in this case is the difference between the true value and the measured value. Assuming the true value is 75V ( (as no other information is given about the true value), the error would be zero in an ideal scenario, but given the context, it seems we're looking for the maximum possible error based on the voltmeter's specifications.\n\nSince the question seems to ask for the \"limiting error\" which could imply the maximum possible error under the voltmeter's accuracy guarantee, regardless of the actual measurement, the answer would be directly related to the voltmeter's accuracy specification. \n\nGiven that the guaranteed accuracy is 2% of full scale, and the full scale is 100V, the limiting error is thus 2V ( as calculated above. To express this error as a percentage of the measured voltage (75V, we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2V}{75V} \\times 100\\% = 2.66\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2.66 %."
