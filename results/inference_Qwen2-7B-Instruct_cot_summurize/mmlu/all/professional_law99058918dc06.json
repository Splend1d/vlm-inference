This prohibition was enacted to prevent motorists from evading radar or speed checkpoints on county and state highways. A neighboring state has no such regulation in effect. By the same token, Congress has taken no action on the matter. A resident of the neighboring state has installed a radar detection device in his automobile. While driving to visit his mother he is arrested and charged with violating the aforementioned state statute. The resident files a complaint challenging the constitutionality of the state statute. As applied to the resident, the state prohibition against the use of radar detection devices is likely to be held\n\nA. constitutional, because it protects a legitimate state interest.\nB. constitutional, because the commerce clause does not invalidate a state regulation relating to interstate commerce unless Congress takes express action to do so.\nC. unconstitutional, because the state statute fails to give credit to the law of a neighboring state.\nD. unconstitutional, because it unduly burdens interstate commerce.\n"

The Supreme Court has long recognized that the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate interstate commerce and that state laws that substantially burden interstate commerce must be justified by a legitimate local purpose unrelated to economic protectionism.\n\nIn this scenario, the state's law applies uniformly to all vehicles on its roads, regardless of the state of origin or the purpose of travel ( including residents commuting from another state. However, the impact of this law on an individual who uses the device solely for personal, non-commercial purposes while traveling between two states could potentially be seen as an undue burden on interstate travel, especially if there are are no significant state interests served by the prohibition that cannot be achieved through less restrictive means.\n\nThe resident's challenge would likely focus on the fact that the law applies equally to all drivers regardless of their state of residence, but it might argue that the application of the law to the resident, who is merely using the device for personal reasons, imposes an unnecessary burden on interstate travel. This argument could resonate with courts interpreting the dormant Commerce Clause, leading to a finding that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the resident.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual decision would depend on the specific facts of the case and the legal arguments presented, as well as the interpretation of the Commerce Clause by the court at the time of the decision."
