Let's break down the two statements given:\n\n1. **An attacker replaces bytes sent by a client with bytes of the attacker\u2019s own choosing.**\n   - This scenario describes a type of attack known as a **man-in-the-middle attack** or a **\u4e2d\u95f4\u4eba\u653b\u51fb** in Chinese. In such an attack, the attacker intercepts and possibly alters the communication between the client and the server. TLS uses cryptographic techniques to prevent this kind of attack by ensuring that only the intended parties can decrypt the messages, thus making it difficult for an attacker to alter the data without detection.\n\n2. **An attacker reading the plaintext bytes sent by a client.**\n   - TLS encrypts the data being exchanged between the client and the server, which means that even if an attacker intercepts the encrypted data, they would not be able to read its original content without the decryption key. This property, known as confidentiality, is a core feature of TLS that ensures that the data remains private from unauthorized third parties.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. True, False**\n\nTLS protects against an attacker reading the plaintext bytes sent by a client ( **False** because TLS encrypts the data, preventing attackers from reading the plaintext. However, it also protects against the attacker replacing bytes sent by a client with bytes of the attacker\u2019s own choosing **True**, by employing mechanisms like digital signatures and certificate verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data being transmitted."
