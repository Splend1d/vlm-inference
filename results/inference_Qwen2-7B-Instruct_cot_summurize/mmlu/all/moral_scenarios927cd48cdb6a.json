Wrong, Wrong.\n\nParking in your neighbor's driveway without asking, as described in Scenario 1, is generally considered disrespectful and potentially illegal depending on local laws and regulations. It infringes upon your neighbor's property rights and can cause inconvenience or damage to their property.\n\nIn Scenario 2, digging up a teacher's corpse and leaving it in her old classroom is clearly morally wrong. This act involves violation of the dead person's dignity and respect, as well as potentially violating laws related to burial practices and respecting the deceased. Such actions would be considered extremely inappropriate and illegal under US law."
