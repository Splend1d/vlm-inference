Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence\n\nA killed (or inactivated vaccine contains the weakened or dead form of the pathogen, which cannot replicate and cause disease. This eliminates the risk of the vaccine itself causing the illness it's meant to prevent, as well as the risk of the pathogen reverting back to its virulent state. \n\nIn contrast, a live vaccine uses a weakened or attenuated version of the pathogen that can still replicate in the body but at a level that does not cause disease. While this approach can stimulate a strong immune response and sometimes elicits better long-term immunity, there is a theoretical risk of the pathogen mutating back to its original virulent form or causing disease.\n\nTherefore, when developing a vaccine against a newly discovered severe respiratory illness with a newly identified virus, avoiding the concern for reversion to virulence is a critical consideration, making option A the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine."
