Since virtually all of the video games required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each video game to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many video game owners have complained about the video game tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer video games are purchased by the restaurant owners. No manufacturer of video games is located in the state. Which of the following is most likely to have standing to bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the video game tax bill in an appropriate federal court?\n\nA. A manufacturer of video games who is attempting to sell them to a restaurant owner in the state.\nB. A state resident who frequently plays video games at restaurants.\nC. A national video game association whose members travel to the state to play video games at restaurants.\nD. The director of the state's youth organization who wants to provide video games that only play for free at recreation centers within the state.\n"

This affects its ability to make sales and profits within the state market."
