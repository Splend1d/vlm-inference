This is one of the fundamental properties of Euclidean space. \n\nA. Elliptical geometry, also known as Riemannian geometry, deals with surfaces like spheres where the sum of the angles in a triangle is always greater than 180 degrees.\n\nC. Hyperbolic geometry involves spaces that are curved in such a way that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always less than 180 degrees.\n\nD. Linear geometry isn't a standard term in mathematics, but if it refers to straight lines and flat surfaces, then it's essentially describing Euclidean geometry, where the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees."
