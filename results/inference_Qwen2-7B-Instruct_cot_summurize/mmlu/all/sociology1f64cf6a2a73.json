However, it is important to note that while some of these goals might have been controversial or subject to interpretation, the government generally pursued them as part of its agenda.\n\nRegarding option C, \"generous financial benefits for single parents, students, and the unemployed,\" this was not a policy objective that the Thatcher government pursued. In fact, her administration was known for implementing austerity measures and reforms that led to cuts in public spending, including social programs. The government aimed to reduce welfare dependency and encourage work through various reforms such as the introduction of means-tested benefits and changes to unemployment benefits. Therefore, the answer to your question would be C."
