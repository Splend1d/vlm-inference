It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the calculation or the interpretation of the question. The correct approach should lead to a value closer to the options given, considering the precision of the calculation and the options provided. Given the typical precision of NMR linewidth calculations, the closest correct answer based on standard rounding and precision would indeed be:\n\nB. 21.2 Hz"
