The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand\u2026In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy.

The Mongol administration of its Russian domains during the period from 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. was characterized by tolerance towards various religious traditions, including Orthodox Christianity, unlike the situation described in Ibn Battuta's observations of the Mongol administration in China, which appears to have been more open to multiple religious practices, including Islam, Buddhism, and possibly Hinduism.\n\nB is incorrect because both the Mongol administration in Russia and China had elements of tribute systems from local rulers or principalities, but the specifics of how tribute was managed and the degree of centralization differ significantly between the two regions.\n\nC is incorrect because the Mongol administration was generally viewed positively by its subjects in both Russia and China, although there were instances of unrest due to policies such as taxation and military campaigns. The perception of favorability varied over time and across different groups within the empire.\n\nD is incorrect because while the Mongols did stimulate trade networks that included routes connecting Russia and China, there is no evidence to suggest that the Mongol administration in China intentionally curtailed Chinese economic activity. In fact, the Mongol rule facilitated trade and cultural exchanges between China and other parts of Eurasia."
