Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, running around loudly at the park can be considered morally wrong if it disturbs others or violates local noise regulations, as parks often have rules about maintaining quiet and peace for all visitors. In Scenario 2, admiring paintings at the Louvre is not morally wrong; it is an appreciation of art, which is generally encouraged and considered a positive activity."
