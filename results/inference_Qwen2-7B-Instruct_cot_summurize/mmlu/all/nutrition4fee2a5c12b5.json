Reduction in lean body mass: As people age, they often lose muscle mass (a process known as sarcopenia. This loss of muscle tissue reduces the amount of lean body mass, which in turn decreases the overall metabolic rate because muscles require more energy to maintain their function.\n\nB. Reduction in physical activity: Older adults may reduce their physical activity due to various reasons such as health concerns, mobility issues, or decreased interest. Physical activity is a significant driver of energy expenditure, so less movement leads to lower energy use.\n\nC. Reduction in basal metabolic rate: Basal metabolic rate (the amount of energy expended while at rest to support vital functions like breathing and circulation\u2014naturally declines with age. This decrease in BMR contributes to the overall reduced energy expenditure observed in older adults.\n\nThus, all these factors contribute to the reduced energy expenditure typically seen in older adults."
