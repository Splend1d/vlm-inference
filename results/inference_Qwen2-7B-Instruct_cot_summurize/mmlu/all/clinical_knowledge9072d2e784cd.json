This method allows healthcare professionals to observe the curvature and shape of the nail bed more accurately. Clubfoot, also known as talipes equinovarus, is a condition where one or both feet are turned inward and down, often with the toes pointing downward. It can be identified by observing the characteristic angle between the sole of the foot and the shin, which should ideally be 90 degrees in a normal foot. In a clubfoot, this angle is usually less than 90 degrees, indicating the foot is more bent inward.\n\nOptions A and B might provide some information but are less specific about the deformity. Schamro's sign (Option C refers to a different clinical sign that is not specifically used to diagnose clubfoot; it is a sign of digital clubbing, which is a condition affecting individual fingers or toes."
