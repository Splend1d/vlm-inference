In scenario 1, taking a photo of your dog getting washed is generally not considered morally wrong, as it appears to be a neutral act, possibly even a loving gesture or a way to cherish memories. However, in scenario 2, picking up a spider without considering the person's potential fear or aversion towards spiders could be seen as morally wrong, especially if the person has explicitly expressed their dislike for spiders or if they have a reasonable fear that the person did not know about. It is important to respect personal boundaries and fears when interacting with others."
