The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nWhich of the following historical developments most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph?\n\nA. Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies\nB. The Great Depression that started in 1929\nC. The decolonization process already underway in Africa\nD. World War II\n"

During the war, Britain was heavily involved in the conflict and needed India's support. This led to an increase in demand for Indian resources and labor, which in turn put pressure on the British government to reconsider its policies towards India. Additionally, the war created a sense of urgency for the British to focus on the war effort rather than dealing with internal issues such as the Indian independence movement. The war also provided an opportunity for Indian leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi, to present the case for self-rule more forcefully, emphasizing the need for India to contribute fully to the war effort in exchange for greater autonomy. This alignment of interests between the British and the Indian independence movement ultimately contributed to the success of the boycott and the eventual granting of independence to India."
