The defendant has pleaded not guilty, claiming that he made an honest mistake as to the date the expenses were paid. At trial, the prosecutor offers evidence of the defendant's involvement in an earlier scheme to help a different client falsify tax returns in the same way. Is the evidence of the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is impermissible character evidence.\nB. No, because it is not relevant to the issues in this case.\nC. Yes, to show absence of mistake.\nD. Yes, to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime.\n"

This is known as the \"mistake of law\" defense, and the prosecution may attempt to rebut this defense by showing that the defendant had knowledge of the law and intentionally violated it. By introducing evidence of the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme, the prosecution can argue that the defendant did not make a genuine mistake but was instead intentionally helping clients to evade taxes."
