Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is zero or undefined.\n\nFirst, let's compute the derivative of \\(f(x)\\):\n\n\\[f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(e^x - cx) = e^x - c\\]\n\nTo find the critical points, set the derivative equal to zero:\n\n\\[e^x - c = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\n\\[e^x = c\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides (since \\(c > 0\\) and \\(e^x > 0\\) for all \\(x\\), this operation is valid:\n\n\\[x = \\ln(c)\\]\n\nNow that we have found the critical point at \\(x = \\ln(c)\\), we need to determine if this point corresponds to a minimum, maximum, or neither. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative or by considering the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) near \\(x = \\ln(c)\\).\n\nThe second derivative of \\(f(x)\\) is:\n\n\\[f''(x) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(e^x - cx) = e^x\\]\n\nSince \\(e^x > 0\\) for all \\(x\\), \\(f''(x) > 0\\) for all \\(x\\), indicating that \\(f(x)\\) is concave up everywhere, and thus any critical point will correspond to a local minimum.\n\nFinally, we evaluate \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x = \\ln(c)\\):\n\n\\[f(\\ln(c)) = e^{\\ln(c)} - c\\ln(c) = c - c\\ln(c)\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) occurs at \\(x = \\ln(c)\\), which corresponds to choice **D. f(log c)**."
