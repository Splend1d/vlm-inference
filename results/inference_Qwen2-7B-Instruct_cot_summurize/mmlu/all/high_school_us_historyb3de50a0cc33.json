Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The \"Know-Nothings,\" lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day\u2026.But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers\u2026..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst\u2014a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War\u2014Poland and Italy.\"\nRobert H.

The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798\n\nThese acts were passed during the presidency of John Adams and included provisions that were used to silence political opposition by criminalizing certain criticisms of the government and restricting immigration. They reflect an early instance of nativism, which involves hostility towards immigrants and can sometimes include accusations of disloyalty or espionage, especially from foreign-born individuals.\n\nThe other options do not fit the description of nativist legislation:\n- A. The Wagner Act of 1935 was part of the New Deal and aimed to strengthen labor unions and improve workers' rights, but it does not specifically target immigrants or reflect nativist sentiments.\n- C. The Espionage Act of 1917 was enacted during World War I to punish those who interfered with military operations or gave aid to enemies of the United States. While it did impact immigrants and could be seen as having a discriminatory effect, it was not primarily a nativist law; rather, it was a wartime measure with broad applications.\n- D. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 is often considered a progressive piece of legislation that abolished national-origin quotas and established a system based on skills and family reunification, which contrasts with the nativist sentiments of the past. It is not an example of nativism itself but rather a response to address earlier nativist policies."
