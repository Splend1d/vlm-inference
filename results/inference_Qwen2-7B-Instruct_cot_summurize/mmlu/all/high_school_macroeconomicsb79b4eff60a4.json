This situation typically arises when there's a decrease in the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS), which leads to higher prices (inflation) while the aggregate demand (AD) remains relatively stable or increases slightly. The reduction in SRAS could be due to factors such as rising input costs, labor strikes, or natural disasters that disrupt production. As a result, the economy experiences a slowdown in growth along with price increases and possibly higher unemployment."
