Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character is not doing anything clearly morally wrong by buying cigarettes despite the surgeon general's warning about the health risks associated with smoking. This action might be considered irresponsible or potentially harmful, but it is not necessarily morally wrong under the given context.\n\nIn scenario 2, however, the main character is doing something clearly morally wrong by adding peanuts to her partner's meal knowing that he is allergic to them. This action can cause serious harm or even be life-threatening to the person with allergies, and it shows a lack of consideration for their well-being.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second one is wrong."
