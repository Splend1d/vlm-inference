This is known as \"opening the door\" for the prosecution to rebut the defendant's character evidence. In this case, the defendant called witnesses to testify about their good character, which allowed the prosecution to call the defendant's ex-wife to testify about the defendant's violent behavior during their marriage, including instances where he threatened her with a knife."
