When he saw the headlights of another car appear in the distance, he reached to turn the high beams off. Instead of turning from high-beam to low-beam, the headlights on the car turned off completely. The man tried repeatedly to turn the lights on again but could not do so. He collided with the other car and suffered injuries. The man has brought an action against the manufacturer of the headlight controls in his car, the manufacturer of his car, and the retailer who sold him the car. If the man can establish that a defect in the controls caused the accident, from whom can he recover?\n\nA. Only the manufacturer of the car and the retailer of the car.\nB. Only the manufacturer of the car.\nC. Only the manufacturer of the headlight controls and the manufacturer of the car.\nD. All three defendants.\n"

All three defendants.\n\nIn this scenario, the man can potentially recover damages from all three defendants: the manufacturer of the car, the manufacturer of the headlight controls, and the retailer who sold him the car. \n\n1. **Manufacturer of the Car**: The car manufacturer would be responsible for any defects in the overall vehicle, including the headlight control system. If the issue with the headlight controls is found to be due to a manufacturing defect, the car manufacturer would be liable for any damages resulting from the malfunction.\n\n2. **Manufacturer of the Headlight Controls**: The company that produced the specific control mechanism or switch for the headlight system would also be held accountable if the defect lies within their product. This could include issues with the design, materials, or assembly of the control mechanism.\n\n3. **Retailer of the Car**: The retailer, in this case, could be liable under the concept of \"seller's liability\" or \"warranty of merchantability.\" If the retailer knew about the defect when they sold the car and did not disclose it, or if the defect occurred because of poor installation or handling during the sale process, the retailer might be held liable.\n\nTo successfully recover damages, the man would need to prove that:\n- A defect existed in the headlight controls (either from the control manufacturer or the car manufacturer.\n- This defect directly caused the car's lights to turn off unexpectedly and contributed to the accident.\n- The retailer, if applicable, had knowledge of the defect or failed to properly inspect or install the car.\n\nThus, all three parties may be held liable depending on the specific circumstances and evidence presented in court."
