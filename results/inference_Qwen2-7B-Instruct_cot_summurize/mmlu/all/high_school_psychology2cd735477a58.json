Therefore, Jerome studies Latin.\n\nWe cannot determine whether Jerome studies calculus (or both calculus and Latin from the given information. The statement \"Some students who study Latin also study calculus\" only tells us that there is an overlap between students studying Latin and students studying calculus, but it does not specify which students are. Hence, option B is the correct answer based on the provided information."
