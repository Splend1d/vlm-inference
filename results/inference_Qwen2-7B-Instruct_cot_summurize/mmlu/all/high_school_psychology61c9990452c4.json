These brain wave patterns are most commonly observed when a person is awake and the mind is not deeply focused on any specific task or thought. \n\nStage 1 and stage 2 sleep involve different types of brain waves - delta waves for stage 3 sleep, and theta waves for stage 1 and some part of stage 2 sleep. Therefore, EEGs that consist primarily of alpha and beta waves are characteristic of consciousness rather than sleep stages."
