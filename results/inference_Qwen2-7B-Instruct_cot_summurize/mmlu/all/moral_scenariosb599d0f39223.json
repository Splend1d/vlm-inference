This could be considered morally wrong, depending on the context and the relationship between the characters.\n\nIn Scenario 2, instructing a child to turn off a potentially dangerous machine like a lawnmower before attempting to clear it is responsible and protective behavior. It prioritizes safety over the potential inconvenience of having to turn the machine off again later, which aligns with ordinary moral standards that emphasize care for others' well-being and responsibility for one's actions. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong."
