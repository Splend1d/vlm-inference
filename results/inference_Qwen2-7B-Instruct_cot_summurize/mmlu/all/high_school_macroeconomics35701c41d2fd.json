However, it may not always be effective due to certain limitations:\n\nI. Crowding out: This refers to the situation where increased government borrowing leads to higher interest rates. As interest rates rise, private investment tends to decrease as borrowing costs for businesses go up. This phenomenon can offset the intended stimulative effects of fiscal policy, making it less effective.\n\nII. Rational expectations: Rational expectations theory posits that individuals make economic decisions based on all available information, including past government actions and their implications for future policy. If people anticipate that fiscal policy will lead to inflation, for example, they might adjust their behavior accordingly ( by, for instance, demanding higher wages or increasing prices now. This can negate the intended impact of fiscal stimulus, as the policy may not achieve its desired outcome in the way policymakers expect.\n\nIII. The balanced budget amendment: While this is a legal constraint rather than a mechanism directly affecting fiscal policy effectiveness, it can limit the government's ability to use deficit spending as a tool to manage the economy during recessions or to stimulate growth. Thus, it indirectly affects the effectiveness of fiscal policy, but it was not listed among the reasons for ineffectiveness in the original options provided.\n\nTherefore, the two reasons given that specifically address why fiscal policy might not always be effective are are I ( crowding out and II. rational expectations."
