The security guard knew that the barber, an elderly man, had a history of significant heart problems. The security guard decided to play a joke on his friend. The security guard took out his gun, burst through the door of the barber shop, pointed the gun at the friend, and shouted, \"Don't move or I'll shoot!\" The barber, thinking that an armed intruder was about to shoot the friend, suffered a heart attack and collapsed. If the barber brings suit against the security guard for infliction of emotional distress and seeks recovery for damages arising from the heart attack, he should\n\nA. prevail, because the security guard knew the barber was present.\nB. prevail, because the security guard assaulted the friend.\nC. not prevail, because the barber was not a member of the friend's immediate family.\nD. not prevail, because the resulting harm was unforeseeable.\n"

The fact that the barber suffered a heart attack as a result of this incident is unfortunate, but it was an unforeseeable consequence of the security guard's actions. It would be difficult to argue that the security guard had a duty to anticipate such a severe medical reaction from the barber, especially given the barber's known health condition.\n\nAdditionally, the law typically does not hold individuals liable for unforeseeable consequences of their actions, especially if those consequences are outside the realm of typical risks associated with the conduct in question. In this case, the risk of a heart attack was not something that could reasonably have been anticipated by the security guard when playing a prank.\n\nTherefore, the barber would most likely not prevail in a lawsuit seeking recovery for damages arising from the heart attack caused by the security guard's actions."
