If a practice is riskier than the alternatives, then that practice is moral, prudent, or otherwise to be pursued, to be a problematic \"hidden assumption\" of harm arguments against homosexuality. \n\nThis is because the argument assumes that being something is riskier than another automatically makes it morally preferable, which Corvino argues is not necessarily the case. The morality of an action should not solely depend on its risks compared to other options but also on whether those actions align with moral principles and respect the rights and well-being of all individuals involved."
