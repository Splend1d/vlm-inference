Volunteers who have had problems with such injuries were randomly assigned to use either a traditional keyboard or the new design. A significance test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis that a smaller proportion of those using the new keyboard will suffer injuries than those using the traditional keyboard. The resulting P-value was 0.07. Which is a correct interpretation of this P-value?\n\nA. The null hypothesis should be rejected.\nB. The null hypothesis should be accepted.\nC. There is a 7% chance that the null hypothesis is correct.\nD. There is a 7% chance of getting a difference between the two groups at least as large as the observed difference if the new keyboard is really no better at preventing injuries.\n"

There is a 7% chance of getting a difference between the two groups at least as large as the observed difference if the new keyboard is really no better at preventing injuries.\n\nThis means that if there is actually no difference (i.e., the new keyboard is no better than the traditional one in preventing injuries, we would still see the observed or more extreme difference in injury rates between the two groups about 7% of the time due to random variation. \n\nGiven that the P-value is typically compared against a predetermined significance level (often 0.05, and since 0.07 exceeds this threshold, it suggests that while the data provides some evidence against the null hypothesis (that there is no difference in injury rates between the two keyboards, it does not provide strong enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the conventional significance level. This implies that based on the P-value alone, we do not have sufficient grounds to conclude that the new keyboard is indeed better at preventing injuries. However, the decision might depend on the context, the cost of making a wrong decision, and the practical implications of the results."
