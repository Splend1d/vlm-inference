In this case, the manufacturer's offer stated that it would remain open until October 1. By sending the fax on September 29 revoking the offer, the manufacturer attempted to withdraw from the agreement before the acceptance (the retailer's letter dated September 30) became legally binding.\n\nSince the offer specifically stated it would remain open until October 1, the manufacturer's attempt to revoke the offer on September 29 would be invalid if the acceptance reached them after the stated expiration date. The fact that the acceptance arrived on October 1, within the time frame specified in the original offer, means that the offer could not have been revoked legally prior to receiving the acceptance.\n\nTherefore, the revocation is not valid, as it contradicts the terms set forth in the original offer, and the contract is considered to be formed upon the retailer's acceptance."
