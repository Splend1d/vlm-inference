To describe the international as hierarchically ordered and comprised of a dense set of constructed political, economic, social, military and cultural relations.\n\nPostcolonial analysis often uses the term 'thick space' to refer to a complex, layered, and historically embedded space that is shaped by colonial histories, power dynamics, and cultural practices. This concept highlights the intricacies of global interactions beyond simple linear hierarchies or Western-centric narratives. It suggests that spaces (like the international arena in International Relations ( are are not just geographical locations but are richly textured with histories, cultures, and socio-political dynamics that are often overlooked in traditional analyses. \n\nSo while options B, C, and D also touch upon aspects of how the international system can be influenced by colonial legacies and Western dominance, they do not specifically define the international through the lens of 'thick space'. Option A more accurately captures the essence of using 'thick space' in postcolonial analysis by emphasizing the complexity and depth of global interactions."
