Air freight services can provide insurance for the items being shipped, which would be crucial for high-value items like jewelry. Additionally, air cargo typically offers a higher level of security and tracking capabilities compared to other modes of transportation. \n\nWhile other options like trucks, ships, or railroads might be more cost-effective for bulkier or less valuable items, they may not offer the same level of safety and security that's important for protecting expensive jewelry during transit."
