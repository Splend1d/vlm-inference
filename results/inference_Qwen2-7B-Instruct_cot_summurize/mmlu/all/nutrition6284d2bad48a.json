Flavonoids are a subclass of polyphenols, and within flavonoids, isoflavonoids are a specific group found primarily in plants like soybeans.\n\nB. The digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products are not changed by process.\n\nIncorrect. The digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones can be influenced by various factors including the processing methods used on soy products. For instance, heat treatment or fermentation might alter their bioavailability.\n\nC. \u00df-Carotene and lycopene can both act as provitamin A.\n\nCorrect. Both \u00df-carotene and lycopene are carotenoids that can act as provitamin A because they can be converted into vitamin A in the human body.\n\nD. Carotenoids and flavonoids both belong to the polyphenol class.\n\nIncorrect. While both carotenoids and flavonoids are part of the larger family of phytochemicals, they do not both belong to the polyphenol class. Flavonoids are a type of polyphenol, but carotenoids are not polyphenols; they are a separate class of phytochemicals.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A and C."
