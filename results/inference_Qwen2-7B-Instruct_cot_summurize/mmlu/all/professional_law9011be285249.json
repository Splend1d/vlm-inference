The woman became suspicious and told the man that she wanted to engage an accounting firm to audit the agency's books. In a panic to prevent the audit and avoid being discovered, the man decided to have the woman killed. He contacted a professional killer and hired him to kill the woman for $10,000. A short time later, the woman died in a car crash arranged by the killer. In addition to embezzlement, of what crime or crimes may the man properly be convicted?\n\nA. Conspiracy and murder.\nB.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Embezzlement**: This is the primary crime committed by the man as per the information provided, where he was stealing money from the agency.\n\n2. **Solicitation**: By contacting and hiring a professional killer to commit the murder of the woman, the man was soliciting a crime. Solicitation is the act of persuading, inducing, or encouraging another person to commit a crime.\n\n3. **Conspiracy**: The act of agreeing with someone to commit a crime also constitutes conspiracy. In this case, the man agreed with the professional killer to carry out the murder. Even though the woman died in a car crash, not as a direct result of the man's initial plan, the conspiracy to commit murder still stands.\n\n4. **Murder**: Although the woman did not die at the hands of the professional killer due to the car crash, it is worth noting that the man indirectly contributed to her death through his actions in hiring the killer. His intent to cause her death and his actions leading up to it would likely be considered in a court of law when determining whether he is guilty of murder.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be **D. Solicitation, conspiracy, and murder**. It's important to note that the legal system might view the murder charge differently due to the unintended death caused by the car crash rather than the direct action of the hired killer. However, the man's solicitation and conspiracy to commit murder would still hold."
