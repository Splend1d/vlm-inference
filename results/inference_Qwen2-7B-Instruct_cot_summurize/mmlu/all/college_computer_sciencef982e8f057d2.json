III only\n\nIn a multiprogrammed system, where multiple processes are executed concurrently, it's crucial for programs to be able to run simultaneously without interfering with each other. This is where the concept of \"reentrancy\" comes into play. A reentrant program is one that can be interrupted at any point during its execution, allowing another process to run, and then resume its execution from where it left off seamlessly. \n\nOption I (The program is a macro refers to a feature in programming languages that allows code expansion at compile-time, but it does not directly relate to the ability of a program to share resources across multiple processes.\n\nOption II. The program is recursive refers to a function that calls itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met. While recursion can be useful, it doesn't inherently enable sharing of the program across multiple users in a multiprogrammed system.\n\nOption III. The program is reentrant is the correct choice because it allows a program to be safely interrupted and resumed by another process, making it suitable for sharing among multiple users in a multiprogrammed environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. III only."
