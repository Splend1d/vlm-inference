                    "text": "To determine the H+ (concentration in a 1.0 M phenol (C6H5OH) solution, we can use the acid dissociation constant (Ka. Phenol is an aromatic alcohol that acts as a weak acid in water, and its dissociation can be represented by:\n\n\\[ \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^- + \\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+ \\]\n\nThe acid dissociation constant (Ka) is given as \\(1 \\times 10^{-10}\\). We can use the expression for Ka to find the concentration of H+ ions (\\([H_3O^+]\\)):\n\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{[\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^-][\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+]}{[\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH}]} \\]\n\nSince only a small fraction of the phenol molecules will dissociate, we can assume that the change in concentration of phenol ([C6H5OH]) is negligible compared to its initial concentration (1.0 M. Thus, the concentration of phenol in the denominator can be approximated as 1.0 M.\n\nLet's denote the concentration of H+ ions and phenoxide ions as \\(x\\) (since they're both produced in equal quantities during dissociation. So,\n\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{x \\cdot x}{1.0} \\]\n\\[ 1 \\times 10^{-10} = \\frac{x^2}{1.0} \\]\n\\[ x^2 = 1 \\times 10^{-10} \\]\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{1 \\times 10^{-10}} \\]\n\\[ x = 1 \\times 10^{-5} \\]\n\nTherefore, the H+ concentration in the solution is \\(1 \\times 10^{-5} M\\).\n\nThe correct answer is D. 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M."
