[H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-]\n\nIn the dissociation of sulfurous acid (H2SO3, it first donates a proton to water molecules forming hydrogen ions (H+ and bisulfite ions (HSO3-. The reaction can be represented as:\n\nH2SO3 + H2O \u2192 H3O+ + HSO3-\n\nThen, the bisulfite ion can further donate a proton to form sulfate ions (SO3^2- and more hydrogen ions:\n\nHSO3- + H2O \u2192 H3O+ + SO3^2-\n\nTherefore, at equilibrium, the concentration order will be: [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-]. This is because sulfurous acid is a weak acid and does not completely dissociate into its ions."
