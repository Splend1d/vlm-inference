                    "text": "A retiree lived in a single-family dwelling in the city. Adjacent to his home was a vacant lot that measured 100 feet by 175 feet. The lot, which the retiree owned, was situated on the corner of Davis Street and University Way. The tract measured 100 feet along Davis Street and 175 feet along University Way. The retiree executed a deed purporting to convey the vacant lot to his lifelong friend for the consideration of $28,000. After escrow, the deed was delivered to the friend, who immediately filed it with the county recorder's office. The recorded instrument described the property conveyed as \"all the tract of land beginning at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way; thence west along Davis Street 100 feet; thence north 175 feet; thence west 100 feet; thence south 175 feet along University Way to the place of beginning. \" Three months after his conveyance to the friend, the retiree died intestate. His heirs have now filed an appropriate action contesting the friend's title to the vacant lot. Which of the following statements is most accurate concerning the outcome of this suit?\n\nA. The retiree's heirs will prevail because metes and bounds, rather than streets, are appropriate boundary descriptions.\nB. The friend will prevail because equity will not permit forfeiture for a mere technicality.\nC. The outcome will depend on whether the tract of land was plotted as a lot in a subdivision.\nD. The outcome will depend on whether the last call (175 feet along University Way) prevails over the third call (west 100 feet).\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The outcome will depend on whether the last call \"175 feet along University Way\" prevails over the third call \"west 100 feet.\"\n\nIn the context of legal descriptions of property, especially when dealing with metes and bounds descriptions, the order of the calls or bearings can be significant. Typically, the description follows a logical sequence that allows one to plot the property accurately. In this case, the description given is:\n\n1. Beginning at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way;\n2. Thence west along Davis Street 100 feet;\n3. Thence north 175 feet;\n4. Thence west 100 feet;\n5. Thence south 175 feet along University Way to the place of beginning.\n\nUpon closer inspection, there seems to be an issue with the fourth call, \"thence west 100 feet.\" If the first three calls were followed correctly, the property would end up at the beginning point, which is the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way, as specified in the first call. However, the fourth call contradicts the third call, which states to go north 175 feet, then west 100 feet, and end up back at the starting point. The fourth call would instead take the property back to the same starting point if it were followed as written, without actually covering any additional distance.\n\nThe last call, \"thence south 175 feet along University Way,\" would logically follow the last northward movement described, assuming the intention was to return to the starting point. However, since the third call is already northward, the fourth call as stated (\"west 100 feet\") would not logically fit into the description without causing ambiguity or inconsistency.\n\nGiven this issue, the court would likely need to interpret the intent behind the deed description and determine which of the conflicting directions (north or west) should be considered valid. If the court determines that the description intended to describe a contiguous parcel of land, the last call might be deemed more relevant, as it would allow for a clear and consistent boundary. Alternatively, if the court finds that the deed was intended to be a clear and unambiguous description, the issue could hinge on whether the document should be interpreted strictly according to its words or if there was an implied correction or clarification.\n\nWithout further information about the parties' intentions or any prior agreements, the outcome would indeed depend on how the court interprets the conflicting directions within the metes and bounds description. Therefore, option D accurately reflects that the outcome will depend on resolving this ambiguity."
