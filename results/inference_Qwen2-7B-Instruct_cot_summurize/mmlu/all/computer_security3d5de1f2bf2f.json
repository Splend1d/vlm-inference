It generates each different input by modifying a prior input\n\nMutation-based fuzzing works by starting with valid inputs (often actual test cases or real-world data) and then applying random or heuristic-driven mutations to these inputs. The mutated inputs are then fed into the target system to see if any faults or vulnerabilities are triggered. This process can be repeated iteratively, generating new inputs based on previous ones."
