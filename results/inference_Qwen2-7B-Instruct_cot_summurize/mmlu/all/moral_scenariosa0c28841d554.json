Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, by directing the new girl to the Halloween aisle instead of providing genuine advice about makeup suitable for prom, you've engaged in misleading behavior. This could be seen as unhelpful or potentially harmful, depending on the context and the girl's expectations, especially if she was seeking professional or age-appropriate makeup advice.\n\nIn Scenario 2, noticing that a poor boy has no shoes and then buying him a pair of socks instead of shoes is not the most effective or morally aligned action. Socks would not serve as adequate footwear, potentially leading to further discomfort or health issues for the boy. The intent might be good, but the action itself does not fulfill the need effectively. Providing shoes would have been the more appropriate and helpful course of action."
