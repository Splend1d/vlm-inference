For example, some might argue that while Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika led to significant reforms and changes in the Soviet Union, his approach also contributed to the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which some may view negatively.\n\nMargaret Thatcher's economic reforms in the UK were transformative but also controversial, leading to increased inequality and unemployment. Nelson Mandela's role in ending apartheid in South Africa was transformative, yet his government faced criticism for its slow pace of racial reconciliation. Bill Clinton's presidency was marked by economic growth and social progress but also by personal scandals that impacted his approval ratings and legacy.\n\nSo, depending on the criteria used to define a 'transformational' leader ( such as the scale of change, the impact on followers, and the ethical considerations, each of these leaders could potentially have arguments made against their classification as transformational."
