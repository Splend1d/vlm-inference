Sentience refers to the ability to experience feelings, sensations, and perceptions. In his philosophy, Singer argues that beings capable of experiencing pleasure and pain (sentient beings) should be given moral consideration because their welfare matters morally. This principle is foundational to his utilitarian approach, where the greatest good for the greatest number is sought, particularly emphasizing the importance of preventing unnecessary suffering."
