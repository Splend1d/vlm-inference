An increase in technology can lead to more efficient production and lower costs, shifting the aggregate supply curve to the right. The other options ( changes in consumer confidence, changes in the money supply, and changes in spending by state governments - all have direct impacts on aggregate demand, which is represented by the movement along the aggregate demand curve or a shift of the curve itself."
