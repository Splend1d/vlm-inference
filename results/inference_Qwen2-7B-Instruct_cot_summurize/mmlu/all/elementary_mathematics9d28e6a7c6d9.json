To find out if the total number of batteries she bought can be divided evenly by 4, we need to check each option:\n\n- A. 22: \\(22 \\div 4 = 5.5\\), which is not an integer, so this cannot be the total number of batteries.\n- B. 22: As mentioned, \\(22 \\div 4 = 5.5\\), which is not an integer, so this also cannot be the total number of batteries.\n- C. 28: \\(28 \\div 4 = 7\\), which is an integer, so this can be the total number of batteries.\n- D. 30: \\(30 \\div 4 = 7.5\\), which is not an integer, so this cannot be the total number of batteries.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits the criteria is C. 28."
