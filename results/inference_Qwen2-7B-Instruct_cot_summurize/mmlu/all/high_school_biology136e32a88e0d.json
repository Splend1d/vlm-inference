                    "text": "The correct answer is D. A single gene can produce more than one trait because of alternative splicing.\n\nAlternative splicing is a process in which not all exons ( (exons are coding regions of genes) of a gene are included in every mRNA transcript produced from that gene. This means that from a single gene, multiple protein variants can be produced, each potentially having different functions or affecting different traits. This mechanism allows for a high degree of genetic diversity within an organism, even from a relatively small number of genes.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not fully explain how humans can exhibit so many different traits from a smaller number of genes:\n\nA. Modification of histone proteins usually increases the function of genes through processes like histone acetylation or methylation, which can influence gene expression but does not directly increase the number of traits per gene.\n\nB. Epigenetics involves changes to the expression of genes without altering the DNA sequence itself, including modifications to histones and DNA methylation. While epigenetic changes can influence gene expression and contribute to phenotypic variation, they do not directly increase the number of traits derived from a single gene.\n\nC. Pseudogenes are non-functional copies of functional genes and introns are non-coding sequences within genes. The discovery that humans have fewer genes than initially thought did not prove that pseudogenes and introns are expressed; rather, it showed that these elements do not necessarily correlate with the number of functional genes and their ability to produce diverse traits."
