                    "text": "The correct answer is C. cannot name objects placed in the left hand if the patient cannot see them.\n\nThe corpus callosum is the main bundle of nerve fibers connecting the two cerebral hemispheres in the brain. It plays a crucial role in transmitting information between the left and right hemispheres. In a right-handed person, the left hemisphere typically controls the right side of the body and is dominant for language processing.\n\nWhen the corpus callosum is cut (a procedure known as a split-brain surgery), the two hemispheres are no longer able to communicate directly through this pathway. This means that even though both hemispheres receive sensory information (like touch or sight), they are unable to coordinate their responses effectively.\n\nIn the case of naming objects placed in the left hand (which is controlled by the right hemisphere after the split-brain surgery), the patient would be unable to name the object because the language center (in this case, located in the left hemisphere) is not able to send signals back to the right hemisphere to perform the task. \n\nOptions A, B, and D are not generally associated with the effects of cutting the corpus callosum. Option A might seem plausible due to motor function being primarily controlled by the brain's hemispheres, but it is not a direct consequence of corpus callosum severance. Option B refers to visual perception which is not directly affected by corpus callosum severance. Option D pertains to verbal intelligence, which is more likely to be influenced by damage to the language centers within the left hemisphere, rather than a severed corpus callosum alone."
