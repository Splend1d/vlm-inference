They found that patients who drank at least three cups of green tea per day had a much lower incidence of depression. In an American newspaper article about this study, which of the following statements should not be made?\n\nA. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have healthier lifestyles than those who don't.\nB. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have a more positive outlook on life than those who don't.\nC. Because this is observational data, the association between drinking green tea and a lower incidence of depression is not an indication of a causal relationship.\nD. People who want to avoid depression should consider drinking green tea on a daily basis.\n"

People who want to avoid depression should consider drinking green tea on a daily basis.\n\nWhile the study suggests an association between drinking green tea and a lower incidence of depression, it does not establish causation. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to directly recommend that people change their behavior based solely on this observational study's findings without further research confirming a causal link. The other options acknowledge potential confounding factors (lifestyle and outlook) and the limitations of observational data, making them more scientifically cautious."
