In discussing repair of the hernia with the parents, it is most appropriate to inform them of which of the following?\n\nA.

Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time\n\nInguinal hernias in infants and young children are generally harmless and often close spontaneously as the abdominal muscles strengthen. However, they do need to be repaired surgically eventually. Delaying surgery can lead to complications such as incarceration (where the contents of the hernia become trapped and cannot return to their original location) or strangulation (where the blood supply to the contents of the hernia is cut off). \n\nThere is no evidence that delaying surgery will affect sperm production (oligospermia), so option B is incorrect.\n\nOption A suggests waiting until the child is 2 years old, but this is not advised as it increases the risk of complications.\n\nOption D is too extreme; while hernias should be addressed promptly, they are not emergencies requiring immediate surgery."
