The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nThe legacies or adaptations of legacies from the Mongol empire are varied. Most notably, they include which of the following selections?\n\nA. Public libraries\nB. Universal health care\nC. The game of chess\nD. Religious tolerance\n"

According to the text, under the rule of the Mongol Khans, there was a significant degree of religious freedom and tolerance across their vast domain, which encompassed regions from eastern Europe to southern China. This allowed for the coexistence of different religious practices without fear of persecution.\n\nThe other options provided ( A. Public libraries, B. Universal health care, and C. The game of chess, do not directly align with the historical legacy or adaptation described in the context of the Mongol Empire's influence. While these might have been cultural influences that could have been affected by the Mongol rule in certain ways, they are not specifically highlighted or attributed as direct legacies of the Mongol Empire in the passage you've referenced."
