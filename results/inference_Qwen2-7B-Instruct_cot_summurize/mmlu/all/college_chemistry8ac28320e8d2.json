BeCl2 (Beryllium chloride: Beryllium has an oxidation state of +2 and can form a coordinate bond with a lone pair from another atom, making it a strong Lewis acid.\n- B. MgCl2. Magnesium chloride: Magnesium in its ionic form does not have a significant ability to act as a Lewis acid due to its stable +2 oxidation state and the presence of Cl-, which tends to be the Lewis base in this case.\n- C. ZnCl2. Zinc chloride: Zinc has an oxidation state of +2 and can accept a lone pair, making it a Lewis acid.\n- D. SCl2. Sulfur monochloride: Sulfur tends to be more reactive as a Lewis acid than chlorine because it is less electronegative.\n\nAmong these, **B. MgCl2** is the least likely to behave as a Lewis acid due to magnesium's stable +2 oxidation state and the preference of chloride ions to donate electrons rather than accept them."
