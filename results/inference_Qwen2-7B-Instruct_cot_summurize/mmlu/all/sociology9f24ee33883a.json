The process of becoming part of a society by learning its norms and values.\n\nSocialization is the process through which individuals learn the behaviors, attitudes, and values that are appropriate within their society. This happens gradually over a person's lifetime, starting from early childhood, through interactions with family, peers, schools, and other societal institutions. Through these interactions, individuals not only learn how to function effectively within their society but also develop a sense of identity and belonging."
