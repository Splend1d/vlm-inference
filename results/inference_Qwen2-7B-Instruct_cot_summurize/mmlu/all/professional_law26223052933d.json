They signed a contract that said that if they purchased new items on the account, they would not own the old purchases until the new ones were paid in full. That provision was in fine print on the reverse side of the papers. When husband lost his job, they had by that time paid for everything purchased on the account except for one chair they bought a few weeks earlier. The store sued, trying to repossess all furniture ever sold to the couple. Will the couple likely prevail on a defense of unconscionability?\n\nA. No, because they might be able to find another store to sell them furniture, which proves that there was no lack of bargaining power.\nB. No, because the store was nice enough to extend credit, and the couple should be expected to pay for everything before they own any of it.\nC. Yes, because any time a seller puts terms in fine print it is proof of bad faith and unconscionability.\nD. Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\n"

Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\n\nExplanation:\n\nUnconscionability is a legal doctrine that allows courts to invalidate or modify contracts that are are grossly unfair or one-sided. The key factors considered when determining unconscionability include whether one party has significantly more bargaining power than the other, whether the contract terms are hidden or obscure, and whether the terms are excessively harsh or oppressive to one party.\n\nIn this scenario, several factors point towards potential unconscionability:\n\n1. **Significantly Unequal Bargaining Power**: The couple had less than perfect credit, which likely means they had limited options for financing and thus less bargaining power compared to the furniture dealer who could extend credit.\n\n2. **Fine Print and Hidden Terms**: The provision regarding ownership of old items being contingent upon payment of new items was on the \"reverse side of the papers,\" suggesting that it was not prominently displayed or easily noticed. This could indicate that the dealer took advantage of the couple's lack of awareness or understanding of the terms.\n\n3. **Harsh or Oppressive Terms**: The requirement that the couple would not own previously purchased items until all new purchases were paid off could be seen as disproportionately harsh, especially given the husband's sudden loss of employment. This term places an undue financial burden on the couple.\n\n4. **Impact of Circumstances**: The sudden loss of employment makes it difficult for the couple to meet the terms of the contract, highlighting the potential unfairness of the agreement.\n\nGiven these factors, it is reasonable to argue that the court may recognize unconscionability in this case. The combination of unequal bargaining power, obscure terms, and harsh terms makes it likely that the court would consider the contract terms to be unconscionable and potentially rule in favor of the couple."
