Food production\n\nThe irregularity of the wet monsoon in South Asia can significantly impact food production as it is a major source of water for agriculture in the region. The monsoon's unpredictability can lead to either excessive or insufficient rainfall, affecting crop yields and potentially leading to food shortages and increased food prices. This can have wide-ranging effects on both local communities and global food markets."
