                    "text": "The correct answer is C. production is higher.\n\nReal GDP is a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders, adjusted for price changes. When real GDP increases, it means that the total output or production has increased. This could be due to an increase in the quantity of goods and services produced, an improvement in efficiency, or both.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are not necessarily true without additional information:\n\nA. Prices may or may not be higher. If productivity increases and the cost of production decreases, prices might remain stable or even decrease despite an increase in real GDP.\n\nB. Employment may be higher, but it is not guaranteed. An increase in real GDP suggests more production is taking place, which typically leads to more jobs being available. However, other factors like technological changes, labor market policies, or global economic conditions can affect employment levels.\n\nD. Prices and/or output is higher - This statement encompasses the potential outcomes, but it does not specifically address the fact that the increase in real GDP directly measures production (output), not just prices or output in isolation. While it's possible that prices could rise with increased demand or if costs increase, the primary conclusion we can draw from an increase in real GDP is that production has increased."
