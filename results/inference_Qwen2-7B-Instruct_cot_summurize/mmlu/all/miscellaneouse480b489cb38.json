In this scenario, as the taxable income decreases from $25,000 to $20,000, the tax rate increases from 24% to 25% ( (since 20,000 * 0.20 = 4,000 and 25,000 * 0.24 = 6,000). This means that someone with less income is paying a larger percentage of their income in taxes compared to someone with more income, making the tax system regressive."
