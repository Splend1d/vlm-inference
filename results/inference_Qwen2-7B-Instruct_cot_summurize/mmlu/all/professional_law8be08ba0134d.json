The title search revealed an open mortgage from a previous owner to a local bank. It was recorded 25 years ago. The mortgagor could not be found and the bank lost its records. The purchase agreement gave the seller 90 days extra in such a situation to clear title by bringing a quiet title action. The seller did not follow that provision and went to settlement with the bad title and demanded more extra time to file a quiet title action. The buyer decided not to wait and demanded her down payment be returned and that the deal be rescinded. Will litigation most likely favor the buyer's position?\n\nA. Yes, because the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure stated in the purchase agreement.\nB. No, because the seller always has the right to bring an action for adverse possession against the holder of the open mortgage.\nC. Yes, because the open mortgage is so old that it would be declared void by all courts.\nD. No, because the buyer did not act in good faith when it refused to give the seller additional time at the closing.\n"

In this scenario, the seller agreed to convey good and marketable title, which means they were responsible for ensuring that there were no encumbrances or issues with the title that would prevent a smooth transfer to the buyer. By not following the agreed-upon procedure to clear the title issue within the given timeframe, the seller breached the terms of the contract. As a result, the buyer is within their rights to demand the return of the down payment and rescind the contract. Litigation is most likely to favor the buyer's position due to the seller's breach of contract."
