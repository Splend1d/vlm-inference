According to the contract, settlement (or closing) was to take place on March 1 of the same year. On January 20, a barn on the property was destroyed by fire. When the buyer was notified of the loss the following day, he contacted the seller and told him that the deal was off because of the fire. As a result, the buyer filed suit against the seller on January 25 for a refund of his down payment of $5,000. In his suit, the buyer will be unsuccessful and will be obliged to complete the contract if the court determines that on January 20\n\nA. the buyer held the legal title to the farm.\nB. the seller held the legal title to the farm.\nC. the buyer held the equitable title to the farm.\nD. the seller held the equitable title to the farm.\n"

The buyer held the equitable title to the farm.\n\nIn a contract of sale, there are two types of titles that can be held: legal title and equitable title. Legal title refers to the formal ownership rights registered with the government or relevant authority, while equitable title refers to the informal right of ownership recognized by courts and based on the terms of the contract. In this scenario, since the contract was in place and settlement was scheduled, it is likely that the buyer had already received the equitable title under the agreement of sale.\n\nWhen the barn was destroyed by fire, the buyer could not have legally taken possession of the property, which would affect the legal title. However, the fact that the buyer had already paid a down payment and was set to complete the contract indicates that they had the equitable title at the time of the loss.\n\nGiven that the buyer had the equitable title but not the legal title when the barn was destroyed, the court would likely determine that the buyer's obligations under the contract were not voided due to the destruction of the property. The seller would still be obligated to convey the legal title upon settlement, assuming all other conditions of the contract are met.\n\nTherefore, the buyer will be successful in enforcing the contract, requiring the seller to complete the transaction, even after the barn was destroyed, because the buyer held the equitable title at the time of the loss."
