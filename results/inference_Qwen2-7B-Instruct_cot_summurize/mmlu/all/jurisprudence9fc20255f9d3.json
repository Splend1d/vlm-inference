Law is determinate.\n\nCritical legal theorists would likely reject the proposition that \"Law is determinate.\" They argue that law is not a fixed, objective system but is influenced by societal values, power dynamics, and human interpretation. They critique the idea that legal outcomes can be predicted solely based on the application of rules and principles, suggesting instead that law is often used to serve the interests of dominant groups within society."
