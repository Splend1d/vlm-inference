In the context of group counseling, the therapist should clearly explain that the obligation of group members to respect confidentiality is not just a matter of personal honor or a lesser concern compared to individual therapy. Instead, it is a legal responsibility and is typically protected by state or provincial laws. This means that any breach of confidentiality could result in legal consequences for both the group member and the therapist if it leads to harm or violation of another's rights.\n\nWhile the therapist may emphasize the importance of trust and integrity within the group environment, the legal framework ensures that confidentiality is maintained as a fundamental right and duty for all involved parties."
