The defendant was inside the store waiting for his coffee when a member of the city's parking enforcement department drove by the vehicle. Seeing that there was no handicapped sticker on the car, the parking official stopped and started ticketing the vehicle. When the defendant came outside, he got into an argument with the parking official. After the defendant became verbally abusive, the parking official told him to desist or he was going to impound the vehicle. After the defendant continued his badgering, the parking official told him that he was impounding the vehicle and called the station house for officer assistance. A few minutes later, a police officer arrived on the scene. He asked the defendant for identification and then proceeded to frisk him for weapons. The officer found a clear vial containing heroin in the defendant's back pocket. He then placed the defendant under arrest. Thereupon, the parking official went into the defendant's car and began an inventory search. In this jurisdiction, parking enforcement personnel have statutory authority to conduct inventory searches of impounded vehicles. The parking official did not find anything of interest. After the police officer placed the defendant in the patrol car, the officer asked the parking official if he could search the vehicle, to which the parking official responded yes. The officer looked under the floor mat and found a bag containing marijuana. The defendant was taken to the station house and charged with unlawful possession of heroin and marijuana. Prior to trial, the defense filed a motion to exclude the heroin and marijuana from being admitted into evidence. The motion will be granted with respect to\n\nA. the heroin only.\nB. the marijuana only.\nC. both the heroin and the marijuana.\nD. neither the heroin nor the marijuana.\n"

                    "text": "The motion to exclude the evidence will likely be granted with respect to:\n\nC. both the heroin and the marijuana.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. **Heroin**: The officer conducted a frisk for weapons upon the defendant's arrest. During this pat-down search, the officer found a clear vial containing heroin in the defendant's back pocket. Such a search is typically considered a lawful protective search incident to a lawful arrest for the officer's safety. However, the search must be limited to the area where the officer has reason to believe evidence of the offense of arrest might be found. The discovery of the heroin during this search would generally be admissible as it is directly related to the arrest and the officer's need for self-defense.\n\n2. **Marijuana**: The officer then searched the vehicle without probable cause or consent after the defendant was arrested. This search occurred after the defendant had been placed in the patrol car and was not incident to any immediate safety concern. The parking official gave permission for the officer to search the vehicle, but the officer's subsequent search of the vehicle under the floor mat and finding a bag containing marijuana would be considered an illegal search absent exigent circumstances or a warrant. Therefore, the marijuana would likely be excluded from evidence under the exclusionary rule, which prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence in court.\n\nThus, the motion to exclude the evidence will be granted with respect to the marijuana due to the lack of legal justification for the search, but the heroin may still be admissible as it was discovered during a lawful protective search incident to the defendant's arrest."
