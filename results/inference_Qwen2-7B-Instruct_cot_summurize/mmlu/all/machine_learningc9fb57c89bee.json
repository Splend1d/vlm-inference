In boosting, the overall classifier \\(f\\) is indeed constructed from a set of weak learners \\(h\\), and it maintains the same functional form as the individual weak learners, but with optimized parameters. For example, if each \\(h\\) is a linear classifier, then \\(f\\) would also be a linear combination of these classifiers, where the coefficients (or parameters) are tuned during the boosting process to improve the overall performance.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. Cross-validation is often used in the context of boosting ( or any machine learning model to select the optimal number of iterations (or rounds) in the boosting algorithm. This helps prevent overfitting by evaluating the model's performance on unseen data at different stages of training. By choosing the number of iterations that minimizes the cross-validation error, one can avoid overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen data."
