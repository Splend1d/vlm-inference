This rate is composed primarily of frictional and structural unemployment.\n\nFrictional unemployment occurs when people are temporarily unemployed while they search for new jobs or move from one job to another. Structural unemployment happens when there is a mismatch between the skills workers have and the skills employers need, often due to technological changes or shifts in industry demand.\n\nWhile the natural rate does not typically include cyclical unemployment ( which is caused by fluctuations in the business cycle and can rise during recessions and fall during expansions \u2013 some economists argue that a small amount of cyclical unemployment might be part of the natural rate if the economy is experiencing persistent or deep recessions. However, this point of view is debated among economists."
