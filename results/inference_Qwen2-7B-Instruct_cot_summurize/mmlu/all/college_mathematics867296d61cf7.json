Let's denote this limit as \\(L\\).\n\nGiven that the sequence converges, we can say:\n\n\\[L = \\sqrt{3 + 2L}\\]\n\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives us:\n\n\\[L^2 = 3 + 2L\\]\n\nRearranging the equation, we get a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[L^2 - 2L - 3 = 0\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[(L - 3)(L + 1) = 0\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions: \\(L = 3\\) or \\(L = -1\\).\n\nHowever, since the sequence consists of positive terms (as \\(x_1 = 1\\) and each subsequent term is derived from a positive number under a square root operation, we discard \\(L = -1\\) because it doesn't make sense in the context of the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the limit of the sequence is:\n\n\\[L = 3\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 3"
