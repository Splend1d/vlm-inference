The Soviet Union's economic struggles and reliance on planned economies, as opposed to market-driven ones, have often been cited as examples of this incompatibility. Advanced technologies often require a high degree of autonomy and flexibility in decision-making, which can be difficult to achieve within a totalitarian framework.\n\nIt's important to note that this perspective is one interpretation of historical events, and there may be other factors at play in the development of any particular country or regime."
