                    "text": "A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold, overwriting the adjacent memory locations. This issue typically arises in one of several scenarios:\n\n- **Option A**: When writing to a pointer that has been freed. In this case, the pointer no longer points to valid memory, but the application continues to write data to it, potentially overwriting other parts of memory or the stack.\n\n- **Option B**: When copying a buffer from the stack to the heap. If the copy operation is not properly controlled, it might exceed the size of the buffer intended for it, leading to an overflow.\n\n- **Option C**: When a pointer is used to access memory not allocated to it. This scenario can lead to buffer overflows if the code mistakenly writes data beyond the bounds of the allocated memory.\n\n- **Option D**: When the program notices a buffer has filled up, and so starts to reject requests, this is not directly related to a buffer overflow. Instead, it's about managing buffer capacity and handling full buffers appropriately, often through mechanisms like queue management or buffer de-allocation.\n\nTherefore, the most general answer regarding when a buffer overflow occurs is that it happens when more data is written to a buffer than it can contain, which could be described by any of the options given under specific conditions ( A, B, or C."
