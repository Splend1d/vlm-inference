In the second frame of the first game, the first friend apparently got a strike when he knocked down all 10 pins. However, the second friend accused the first friend of fouling because his foot went over the line. The first friend denied fouling and wanted to mark down a strike on the scorecard. The second friend refused to give the first friend a strike and wrote in a zero on the scoring sheet. The first friend became enraged. The second friend then went to bowl his frame. As the second friend turned his back, the first friend approached from behind with a bowling ball in his hand. The first friend then raised the bowling ball threatening to hit the back of the second friend's head. The second friend, who had his back turned, did not see the first friend's actions. The third friend saw what the first friend was about to do and could easily have warned the second friend; but the third friend remained silent. The first friend then struck the second friend on the back of the head with the bowling ball, causing a deep scalp wound. If the second friend asserts a cause of action against the third friend, he should\n\nA. prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.\nB. prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.\nC. not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.\nD. not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.\n"

The third friend's failure to warn the second friend about the impending danger (does not constitute a legal duty to do so. Legal principles of duty of care typically require a person to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm to others, but this duty is based on relationships, proximity, and foreseeability. In this case, there is no established relationship between the third friend and the second friend that would create such a duty, nor is there a specific context where the third friend should have reasonably foreseen that warning would be necessary to prevent harm.\n\nAdditionally, the third friend's silence does not imply an intent to cause harm or contribute to the injury; rather, it reflects a decision not to intervene, which is not actionable under most tort laws unless it can be shown that the failure to act constituted a breach of a legal duty owed to the injured party. Without evidence that the third friend had a legal obligation to warn or prevent the harm, the second friend would likely not prevail in an action against the third friend."
