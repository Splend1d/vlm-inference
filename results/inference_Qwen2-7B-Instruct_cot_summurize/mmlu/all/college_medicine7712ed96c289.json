For example, antidepressants often work by influencing the levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which can impact mood and energy levels. \n\nA. Acetylcholine is involved in memory and learning processes, and its alteration might affect cognitive fatigue rather than general physical fatigue. Noradrenaline plays a role in the body's \"fight or flight\" response, so changes in its levels could impact energy levels but might not be the primary focus for treating fatigue specifically.\n\nC. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is linked with learning and memory. Its imbalance can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, but it's not typically the primary target for treating fatigue in the same way that dopamine and serotonin are.\n\nB. Dopamine and acetylcholine are both involved in different aspects of motivation and movement control, but they are not usually targeted for managing fatigue specifically in the same context as serotonin and dopamine."
