Increase, Decrease, Increase.\n\nWhen a central bank implements contractionary monetary policy, it typically raises interest rates by selling government securities in the open market. This action reduces the money supply in the economy, making borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses. As a result, we would expect interest rates to increase.\n\nRegarding new home purchases, higher interest rates make mortgages more costly. This increased cost deters potential home buyers, leading to a decrease in the demand for new homes.\n\nAs for the unemployment rate, while contractionary monetary policy might initially lead to a slight decrease in unemployment due to increased investment and economic growth ( because companies may hire more workers to meet demand, the long-term effect is often an increase in unemployment. If the economy's capacity to produce goods and services is fully utilized at the current employment level, further increases in production will require more labor. However, if the economy is already operating at or near full employment, any attempt to increase output through higher prices rather than more labor will lead to inflation without creating additional jobs. Thus, in the long run, the policy might contribute to rising inflation pressures rather than job creation, potentially pushing the unemployment rate back up as firms adjust to the higher costs and reduced purchasing power of consumers."
