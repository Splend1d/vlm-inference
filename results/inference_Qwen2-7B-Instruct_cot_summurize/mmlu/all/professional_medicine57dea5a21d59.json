During this period, she also has had memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, and has been reprimanded at work for arriving late. Over the past 2 weeks, she has had three episodes of palpitations and shortness of breath that have awakened her from sleep. Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood and constricted affect. She says that she is no longer interested in activities that she used to enjoy. She has suicidal ideation without a plan. Her hemoglobin concentration is 11 g/dL, and serum ferritin concentration is 140 ng/mL. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?\n\nA. Donepezil therapy\nB. Ferrous sulfate therapy\nC. Ginkgo biloba extract therapy\nD. Paroxetine therapy\n"

Ferrous sulfate therapy\n\nGiven the symptoms described and the laboratory findings (low hemoglobin concentration and serum ferritin level), the most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia. The symptoms of fatigue, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, and the suicidal ideation can all be associated with anemia, especially when it is severe or chronic.\n\nThe appropriate initial step in treatment would be to address the underlying cause of the anemia, which in this case is likely iron deficiency. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option would be:\n\nB. Ferrous sulfate therapy - This is an oral iron supplement that can help increase iron stores and improve anemia over time.\n\nThe other options listed are not as directly related to the symptoms and diagnosis:\n- A. Donepezil therapy is used for Alzheimer's disease.\n- C. Ginkgo biloba extract therapy is used for improving cognitive function but is not typically the first line treatment for anemia.\n- D. Paroxetine therapy is an antidepressant used for treating depression, but there is no indication that the patient is primarily suffering from depression based on the information provided."
