I and III only\n\nThe gustatory system, also known as the taste system, and the olfactory system, which is responsible for our sense of smell, are both chemically based sensory systems. They detect chemical substances in the environment, specifically molecules that interact with taste buds or odor receptors, respectively.\n\nThe auditory system, on the other hand, detects sound waves and is not primarily a chemical sensory system; it relies on vibrations that cause movement in the ear's structures, which then send signals to the brain."
