Depressive symptoms\n\nWhile depressive symptoms are often co-occurring with anorexia nervosa, they are not considered a diagnostic criterion for the disorder according to the DSM-5 ( (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition). The primary diagnostic criteria for Anorexia Nervosa include a significantly low body weight, distorted body image, and fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even when significantly underweight. Additionally, individuals with anorexia nervosa often engage in extreme efforts to avoid weight gain, including severe restrictions on food intake and excessive exercise."
