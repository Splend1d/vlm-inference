The root value of the biceps reflex is actually C5, C6, which is correct. This means that damage to these spinal segments could affect the biceps reflex.\n- B. This statement is accurate. In neurological assessments, if no reflex can be elicited by tapping a tendon (using a reflex hammer, for example), it is correctly documented as \"absent.\"\n- C. The triceps reflex is elicited by striking the triceps tendon located behind the elbow joint, not in the antecubital fossa (which is the area on the front of the upper arm).\n- D. Brisk finger jerks do not confirm a lower motor neuron lesion; they typically indicate an upper motor neuron lesion, as they suggest overactive upper motor neurons leading to exaggerated reflexes and increased muscle tone. Lower motor neuron lesions are associated with flaccid paralysis, decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, and atrophy of muscles supplied by the affected nerve."
