These organizations came together with shared interests or goals to collectively oppose the nomination. This strategy involves multiple groups working collaboratively towards a common objective, which in this case was to influence the outcome of the nomination process. Realignment typically refers to shifts in political party support or ideology, impeachment is the process of removing a public official from office, and a recall election allows voters to remove an elected official before their term ends, none of which directly apply to this scenario."
