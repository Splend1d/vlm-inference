In this context, providing education and job training to adolescents and young adults who have recently been released from a drug treatment program falls under tertiary prevention because it targets those who have already experienced the issue (drug addiction) and seeks to mitigate the potential negative outcomes such as unemployment, further health complications, and social exclusion."
