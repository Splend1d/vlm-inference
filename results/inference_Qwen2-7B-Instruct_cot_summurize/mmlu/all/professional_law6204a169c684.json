He often sold and leased his guard dogs to various business and factory owners who used the guard dogs to frighten away intruders from entering their premises at night. One evening, the breeder was in the back yard of his home training three of his guard dogs. The back yard was enclosed with a chain link fence and a latched gate that prevented the dogs from running out. After the training session, the breeder opened the gate and permitted the dogs to run loose in his front yard. Minutes later, a man was walking along the sidewalk in front of the breeder's house when he was attacked by one of the dogs. The man suffered severe injuries and died as a result of the attack. The breeder should be found guilty of\n\nA. murder.\nB. involuntary manslaughter.\nC. voluntary manslaughter.\nD. reckless endangerment.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would be B. Involuntary Manslaughter.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter is typically charged when someone unintentionally causes death through criminal negligence or recklessness. The key aspects of this charge include:\n\n1. **Negligence**: The defendant failed to exercise reasonable care, which led to the death of another person.\n2. **Recklessness**: The defendant acted with a conscious disregard for human life, understanding the risk but proceeding anyway.\n3. **Unintentional Death**: The death occurred without the defendant's intent to cause harm.\n\nGiven the scenario:\n\n- The breeder was training vicious guard dogs that were known to attack strangers.\n- He allowed these dogs to run loose after training them to attack.\n- A man was attacked by one of the dogs and died.\n\nThis situation suggests that the breeder was aware of the danger posed by the dogs (both due to their training and their nature as vicious guard dogs. By allowing them to run loose, especially knowing their history, the breeder demonstrated a level of recklessness that could lead to unintended harm to others.\n\nTherefore, the breeder could potentially be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for failing to properly secure the dogs, leading to an unintentional death caused by their attack."
