Violations of human rights that pertain to the structure of a person's practical, social, and political agency. This refers to situations where the very systems, policies, or norms within a society limit an individual's ability to fully exercise their human rights.\n\nB. Ongoing patterns of behavior by a large number of agents which predictably result in many others coming to be deprived of the object of a fundamental human right: the means of subsistence. This type of violation occurs when there is systemic deprivation of basic necessities like food, shelter, and resources, leading to widespread human rights abuses.\n\nC. The violation of fundamental human rights brought about the political structures of a particular government. This involves how governance structures can directly impact human rights, either by enabling or preventing the protection of these rights through policy, law, or lack thereof.\n\nTherefore, Ashford's definition encompasses all three aspects, making option D the correct answer."
