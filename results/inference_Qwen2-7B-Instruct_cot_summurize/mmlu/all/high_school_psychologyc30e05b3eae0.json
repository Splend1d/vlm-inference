When we can't assimilate new information, we change our schemas through accommodation.\n\nPiaget's theory of cognitive development is centered around the idea that children construct knowledge through experiences and interactions with their environment. The process of learning something new often involves the concept of \"assimilation\" and \"accommodation\". \n\n- Assimilation refers to the process of fitting new information into existing cognitive structures ( or schemas. If the new information fits well into existing schemas, it is easily assimilated.\n  \n- Accommodation occurs when the new information does not fit into existing schemas. In this case, the individual must adjust or modify their schemas to accommodate the new information. This might involve creating a new schema or modifying an existing one to better fit the new information.\n\nSo, when someone encounters new information that doesn't fit into their existing understanding, they need to change or expand their mental structures through accommodation in order to incorporate the new information effectively."
