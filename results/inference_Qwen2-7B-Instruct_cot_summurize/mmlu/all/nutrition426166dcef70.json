For most people with diabetes, the target LDL level is less than 70 mg/dL if they have no other cardiovascular disease risk factors. If there are additional cardiovascular disease risk factors, the target LDL is less than 100 mg/dL.\n\nSo, among the given options, D. BP < 130/80, Trig <150, LDL < 100, seems to align with the general guidelines, but it's crucial to note that specific targets can vary based on individual health conditions and should be discussed with a healthcare provider."
