Without such judgments, it might be difficult to understand why someone would choose one action over another from an ethical standpoint.\n\nHowever, labeling this individual as immoral (option B) is not necessarily accurate. Morality involves adhering to societal norms or personal principles, which can be subjective and vary widely among individuals. Refusing to make moral judgments does not inherently mean one lacks moral values; it could simply mean they do not feel the need to articulate these judgments publicly or consistently.\n\nOption C suggests that such a person cannot coherently invoke morality to protect their own interests. This might be true in some contexts where explicit moral reasoning is required to justify actions, but it doesn't necessarily preclude the possibility of acting ethically out of instinct or other motivations.\n\nOption D argues that such a person couldn\u2019t possibly exist. This seems highly unlikely since human behavior and thought processes are incredibly diverse, and there's ample evidence of individuals with varying degrees of moral reasoning and judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while refusing to make positive moral judgments might be considered irrational in some contexts, it does not automatically equate to immorality or impossibility. The nature of morality is complex and varies across individuals and cultures, allowing for a wide range of perspectives and behaviors."
