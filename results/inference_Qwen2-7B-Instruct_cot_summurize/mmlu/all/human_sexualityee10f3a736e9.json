This openness might extend to other areas of sexuality, including attitudes towards extramarital sex. However, it's important to note that individual beliefs and behaviors can vary widely, and not everyone who is liberal about premarital sex will necessarily be liberal about extramarital sex or engage in specific sexual activities like swinging. Options B and C describe specific behaviors that may or may not align with one's attitudes; they are not necessarily consequences of having liberal attitudes about premarital sex alone. Therefore, while option A is a reasonable inference based on the information provided, options B and C cannot be universally assumed without additional context."
