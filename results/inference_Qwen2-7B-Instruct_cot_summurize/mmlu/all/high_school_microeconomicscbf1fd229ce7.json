Ease of entry and exit in the long run\n\nBoth perfect competition and monopolistic competition feature relatively easy entry and exit in the long run, allowing new firms to enter the market and existing firms to leave as conditions change. This characteristic helps to ensure that economic profits are driven down to zero in the long run in both market structures.\n\nExplanation for other options:\n\nB. Homogenous products: While monopolistic competition involves many sellers offering slightly differentiated products (not identical), in perfect competition, products are considered perfectly homogeneous, meaning consumers perceive no difference between the products offered by different sellers.\n\nC. Perfectly elastic demand for the firm's product: In perfect competition, this is true because if one firm raises its price even slightly, it will lose all its customers to competitors selling at the lower price. In monopolistic competition, however, demand is less than perfectly elastic due to product differentiation.\n\nD. Long-run positive profits: Neither perfect competition nor monopolistic competition leads to long-run positive profits. In both market structures, competitive pressures force firms to earn only normal profits ( just enough to cover costs and keep them in business."
