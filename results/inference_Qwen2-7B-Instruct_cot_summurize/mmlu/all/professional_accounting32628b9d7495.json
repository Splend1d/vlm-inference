If there is a choice between investments with the same level of return but different levels of risk, the investor would choose the one with lower risk. Therefore, when comparing the three options, we first prioritize those with the lowest risk:\n\n1. ( (2,2) has the lowest risk (1 standard deviation) and a moderate return (2%).\n2. ( (2,3) has a slightly higher risk (1 standard deviation) but a higher return (3%).\n3. ( (4,2) has the highest risk (2 standard deviations) and the lowest return (2%).\n\nGiven these considerations, a rational and risk-averse investor would prefer option B, which orders the pairs from least to most favorable: ( (2,2), (2,3), ( (4,2)."
