The cashier was nervous and moving slowly, and when she accidentally spilled all of the money out of the bag and onto the floor, the defendant shot her and left. The bullet lodged close to the cashier's spine, paralyzing her. The defendant was subsequently prosecuted and convicted of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Two months later, the cashier decided she wanted an operation to remove the bullet. The doctors warned the cashier that the procedure was very risky and could result in her death. The cashier decided to go ahead with the surgery and, unfortunately, died as a result. If the defendant is now prosecuted for felony murder, he should be found\n\nA. not guilty, because he was not the cause of the cashier's death.\nB. not guilty, because the subsequent prosecution violates double jeopardy.\nC. not guilty, because the cashier decided to have the surgery, aware of the risks.\nD. guilty, because he was the cause of the cashier's death.\n"

Even if the defendant did not directly cause the death, they can still be charged with felony murder if their actions were a substantial cause of the victim's death. In this scenario, the defendant's actions led to the cashier being shot, which in turn led to her decision to undergo a risky operation. The death occurred as a direct result of the gunshot injury sustained due to the defendant's criminal actions. Therefore, under the principle of felony murder, the defendant would likely be found guilty even though the death was caused by medical complications rather than the shooting itself."
