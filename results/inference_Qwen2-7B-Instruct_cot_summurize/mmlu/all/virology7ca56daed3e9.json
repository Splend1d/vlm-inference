                    "text": "The spread of filoviruses, which include diseases like Ebola and Marburg, can be restricted through a combination of strategies:\n\n1. **Hygiene and Social Distancing**: These are fundamental public health measures that can help reduce the transmission of many infectious diseases, including those caused by filoviruses. Ensuring good personal hygiene (such as frequent hand washing) and maintaining social distance can prevent the virus from spreading from person to person.\n\n2. **New Vaccines**: Developing effective vaccines is crucial in controlling outbreaks of filoviruses. Vaccination programs can provide immunity to individuals, thereby reducing the number of potential hosts for the virus. This not only protects the vaccinated individuals but also helps in interrupting the chain of transmission within communities.\n\n3. **New Antivirals**: Antiviral drugs therapies can be used to treat individuals who have been infected with filoviruses. These medications work by interfering with the virus's ability to replicate within host cells, potentially reducing the severity and duration of the illness.\n\n4. **New Humanized Monoclonal Antibodies**: These are proteins designed to target specific pathogens or their effects on the body. In the context of filoviruses, humanized monoclonal antibodies can be engineered to bind specifically to filovirus particles, neutralizing them or marking them for destruction by the immune system. They can be administered before or after infection to help prevent or mitigate the effects of the virus.\n\nIn practice, an integrated approach combining all these strategies is often most effective in controlling outbreaks of filoviruses. This might include rapid deployment of vaccines and antivirals during an outbreak, alongside robust public health measures such as hygiene education and social distancing protocols."
