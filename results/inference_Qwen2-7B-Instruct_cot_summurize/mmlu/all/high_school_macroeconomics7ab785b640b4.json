At this rate, there is no cyclical unemployment, which is unemployment caused by economic fluctuations (like recessions or booms). However, it's important to note that even at the natural rate, there can still be frictional unemployment ( from people transitioning between jobs, and structural unemployment, where the skills of workers do not match the needs of employers due to changes in the economy."
