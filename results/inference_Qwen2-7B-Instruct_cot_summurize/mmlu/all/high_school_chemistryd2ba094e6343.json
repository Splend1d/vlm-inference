The endpoint would be before the ideal equivalence point.\n\nExplanation:\nIn a titration, the endpoint is typically identified by a change in color due to a chemical indicator or a physical change like the appearance of a precipitate. The equivalence point is reached when the moles of acid being exactly neutralized by the base (in this case, sodium hydroxide (NaOH). \n\nIf hypochlorous acid (HOCl) decomposes before reaching the theoretical equivalence point, it means that some of the acid has been converted into other substances (like Cl2), leaving less acid than expected for the same volume of NaOH used to reach the endpoint. This results in a situation where more NaOH is \"reacted\" to reach the endpoint compared to what would be needed at the equivalence point if no decomposition had occurred. Therefore, the endpoint would be reached with excess base, indicating that the endpoint is before the ideal equivalence point."
