God. \n\nImmanuel Kant, a prominent philosopher in the field of deontological ethics, argues that the moral law is an objective principle that is universally applicable and not contingent on individual desires or societal norms. According to Kant, this moral law is given to us by reason and is derived from a categorical imperative, which is a universal moral obligation that we must follow regardless of our personal inclinations or circumstances. Kant believed that this moral law is a manifestation of the will of a divine being, whom he referred to as \"the moral lawgiver,\" and that it is our duty to obey this law as a means of achieving moral perfection."
