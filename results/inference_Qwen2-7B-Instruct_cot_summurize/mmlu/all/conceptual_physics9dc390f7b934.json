It works on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where a current-carrying conductor (usually the wire coil in a rotating machine or the armature in an electric motor, moves in a magnetic field causing it to produce motion.\n\nOn the other hand, a generator works on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which was discovered by Michael Faraday. It converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. When a conductor moves through a magnetic field, an electromotive force (or voltage is induced in the conductor.\n\nSo, while they both involve electromagnetic principles, their functions are opposite - one converts electrical energy to mechanical, and the other converts mechanical energy to electrical."
