So after these assignments, `r` holds the value of `s` (which is 2, `s` holds the value of `t` which is 3, and `t` still holds the value of 3. Therefore, when the `DISPLAY` statements are executed, they will display the values of `r` and `s`, which are 2 and 3 respectively.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nC. 2 3"
