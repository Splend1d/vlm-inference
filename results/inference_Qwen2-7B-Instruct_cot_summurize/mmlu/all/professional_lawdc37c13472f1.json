A senator, in his investigation of communist infiltration of national labor unions, found a provision in a statute passed by Congress, which makes it a crime for a member of the communist party to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the communist is dismissed from his position by the union. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of constitutional law regarding the aforementioned provision of the statute?\n\nA. The statutory provision is a form of unconstitutional prior restraint on a person's First Amendment right of free association.\nB. Making it a crime for a Communist to hold a union office is a suspect classification, which violates the equal protection clause.\nC. The statutory prohibition is a reasonable method of discrimination since the benefit to the public outweighs the injury or restrictions that would be inflicted upon the person.\nD. The statutory provision in the act is a form of legislative punishment violative of the Constitution as a bill of attainder.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The statutory provision in the act is a form of legislative punishment violative of the Constitution as a bill of attainder.\n\nA bill of attainder is a legislative act that singles out a specific individual or group and inflicts punishment upon them without a judicial trial. In this case, the statute targets individuals who are members of the Communist Party and prohibits them from holding union offices, essentially punishing them through legislation. This type of law is generally considered unconstitutional because it bypasses the due process protections provided by the judicial system and discriminates against a specific group without a fair trial.\n\nOption A is incorrect because prior restraint refers to government action that prevents speech or other expression before it occurs, which does not apply here.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the provision might affect certain groups disproportionately, it doesn't necessarily violate the Equal Protection Clause unless it can be shown that the classification (being a member of the Communist Party) is irrelevant to the purpose of the law and the law serves no legitimate state interest.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because even if the law might serve a valid purpose ( such as preventing infiltration of political beliefs into labor unions, it still might violate constitutional principles if it discriminates based on a suspect classification or if it constitutes a bill of attainder. The focus of the analysis would be whether the means chosen by the legislature are narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest without overbroad application, rather than simply weighing the benefits against the restrictions."
