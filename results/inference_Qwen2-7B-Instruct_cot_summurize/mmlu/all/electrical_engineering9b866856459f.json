Loop gain should be unity: This means that the overall gain around the loop, when the signal travels through the system and returns to its starting point, must equal 1. In other words, the output must match the input in amplitude.\n\nC. The phase of a feedback signal with respect to input should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0: This condition ensures that there is no phase shift between the input and the feedback signal. When the signal returns to the input, it must arrive in sync (i.e., without any delay or advance in time relative to the input. This allows the oscillator to maintain a steady oscillation without any phase distortion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Both A and C."
