Yes, because of the rule in Shelly's case.\nB. No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.\nC. Yes, because the will is invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments, and the grandchild does not take at all.\nD. No, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.v\n"

Yes, because of the rule in Shelley's Case.\n\nThe rule in Shelley's Case refers to a situation where a person owns an estate (in this case, a house) in fee simple absolute but then creates a trust with specific conditions under which the ownership will pass on. If the conditions are not met (for example, if there is no will left by the grandchild appointing children), the estate reverts back to the original owner or their heirs. However, this does not protect the estate from the original owner's creditors. \n\nSo, even though the house technically reverts to the original owner or their heirs after the grandchild's death, if there is no will naming surviving children, the creditors of the original owner can still attach the house since it was originally owned by the original owner. \n\nTherefore, option A is correct."
