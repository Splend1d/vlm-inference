Combinational circuits do not have memory or feedback loops, while sequential circuits can include flip-flops which store data and thus have memory.\n\nII. This statement is true. Combinational circuits produce outputs that are solely dependent on their current inputs and do not have any memory or feedback. Sequential circuits, however, take into account the timing of inputs along with the current state of the circuit to produce output, thus they do not have a \"memoryless\" property.\n\nIII. This statement is false. While it's common for sequential circuits to use a clock signal to control the timing of state changes, combinational circuits do not require a clock. They simply compute outputs based on their inputs without any notion of time progression."
