Deadweight loss exists\n\nExplanation: A monopoly market is characterized by a single seller, high barriers to entry, product differentiation (not necessarily differentiating products, and the potential for deadweight loss due to pricing above marginal cost. In contrast, monopolistic competition has many sellers offering slightly differentiated products, lower barriers to entry, and no deadweight loss since prices tend to equal marginal cost. Patents and copyrights can exist in both market structures, and the possibility of profit in the short run is also present in monopolistic competition."
