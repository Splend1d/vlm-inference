The host supplied the bats, balls and gloves. An argument arose at home plate after a controversial call by the umpire, who was inebriated like all of the other participants. The host of the party became enraged at the umpire's decision and hit him in the face, breaking his nose. The umpire pressed charges when he became sober, and the authorities charged the host with criminal battery. At trial, the defense raised the defense of voluntary intoxication, arguing that the host lacked the mentality to form an intent to commit a criminal battery. Will the defense of voluntary intoxication be successful under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, criminal battery is a specific intent crime to which voluntary intoxication may be asserted as a defense.\nB. Yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea.\nC. No, the host was grossly negligent in allowing a group of drunk men to play a dangerous game of hardball, which precluded him from the benefit of the defense.\nD. No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available.\n"

No, criminal battery in this case is considered a general intent crime, and the defense of voluntary intoxication is typically not available.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, criminal battery is considered a general intent crime, meaning that the defendant need only have intended to perform the act that caused the battery (in this case, hitting the umpire in the face), rather than intending to cause a specific result such as causing injury or harm. The actus reus ( (the physical act) and the mens rea ( (the mental state) are both required for a conviction, but the mens rea requirement is generally lower for general intent crimes compared to specific intent crimes.\n\nThe defense of voluntary intoxication may be relevant in some cases to argue that the defendant did not have the requisite mens rea for the crime, especially in specific intent crimes where the defendant must intend the specific result. However, it is generally not a defense for general intent crimes, where the focus is on the act itself rather than the specific intent behind it.\n\nIn this scenario, if criminal battery is considered a general intent crime, the defense of voluntary intoxication would likely not be successful because it does not address the specific intent necessary for a specific intent crime. Instead, it argues that the defendant lacked the ability to form any intent due to being being intoxicated, which might not apply when the crime is based solely on the act performed.\n\nIt's important to note that laws and legal interpretations can vary significantly between jurisdictions, so the specific outcome in a real-world case would depend on the applicable laws and how they were interpreted by the court in question."
