It is essentially an overgeneralization or hasty generalization.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Sweeping generalization: This refers to making a broad statement about a group based on too little evidence or ignoring significant differences within the group.\n\nC. Petitio principii ( (also known as circular reasoning): This occurs when the conclusion is included in the premise of an argument.\n\nD. False dichotomy: This involves presenting two opposing options as the only possibilities, when in fact other alternatives may exist.\n\nThe term \"Black-or-white fallacy\" does not refer to a specific logical fallacy listed in standard logical fallacy guides and is not directly related to the concept of the fallacy of accident.\n\nTherefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D directly refer to the fallacy of accident by name. However, the closest answer would be A. Sweeping generalization, as it describes a similar logical error where a general rule is incorrectly applied without considering exceptions. The term \"fallacy of accident\" itself is not commonly used in the same way these options are presented, so it's important to understand its definition in context."
