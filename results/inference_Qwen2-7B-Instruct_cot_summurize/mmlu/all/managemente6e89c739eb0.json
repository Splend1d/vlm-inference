Small span of control\n\nWhile a small span of control can be seen as an advantage in certain contexts (as it allows for more personalized management and potentially higher employee satisfaction due to less direct reports, which can lead to better quality supervision and decision-making), it is not universally considered an advantage of a hierarchical structure per se. Hierarchical structures typically aim for a balance between clear communication paths, discipline, and stability, but the small span of control might not align with the traditional efficiency goals associated with such structures.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C are generally viewed as advantages of a hierarchical structure:\n\nA. Clear chain of command - This provides a straightforward pathway for authority and responsibility, making it easier to manage roles and tasks within the organization.\nB. Quick response to change - While this might not always be the case in a hierarchical setup, effective communication and streamlined processes can help achieve quick responses, especially if the structure is designed with flexibility in mind.\nC. Discipline and stability - These attributes are often associated with hierarchical structures because they provide a predictable framework that helps maintain order and consistency within the organization."
