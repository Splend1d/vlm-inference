The uncle knew that the teen had five license suspensions, several negligence lawsuits against him, multiple DUIs, and that he was an inveterate alcoholic. The teenager got into an accident while driving the car and was seriously injured. He filed a negligent entrustment claim against the uncle, claiming he owed him a duty not to give control of the vehicle to him. The uncle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, asserting that there was no tort for first-party negligent entrustment. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, will the court likely affirm the lower court decision?\n\nA. Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\nB. Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\nC. No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n"

Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\n\nThis is based on the principle that it would not be fair or in accordance with public policy to allow someone who is clearly unsuitable and dangerous to drive to recover damages from the person who lent them the car. This is because the very act of entrusting the vehicle to such an individual increases the risk of harm, and allowing recovery in this situation could potentially incentivize such actions. The courts might interpret that allowing the claim would undermine the purpose of negligent entrustment laws, which aim to deter irresponsible lending of vehicles, especially to those incapable of handling them safely.\n\nIt's important to note that specific laws and court rulings can vary significantly between jurisdictions, so this answer provides a general perspective based on common legal principles."
