The grandfather regularly visited his son's home and was aware that the grandson routinely left toys scattered about the house. The son had never warned the grandfather to look out for toys. The grandfather brought an action against his son to recover for his injuries. At trial, after the close of evidence, both the grandfather and the son have moved for judgment as a matter of law as to liability. The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity and applies the traditional rules of landowner liability. What action should the court take?\n\nA. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on negligence.\nB. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on strict liability.\nC. Grant the grandfather's motion, because the son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn about the risk of toys being left on the floor.\nD. Grant the son's motion, because the son had no duty to warn that the grandson might leave toys on the floor.\n"

In this context, the grandfather's regular visits indicate that he is an invitee, which generally imposes a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition or to warn of known dangers.\n\nThe scenario presents a situation where the son, being aware of the grandson's habit of leaving toys on the floor, could be seen as having knowledge of a foreseeable risk. The grandfather's injury occurred due to this risk, which the son could foresee given the son's awareness of the grandson's behavior. This suggests that the son may have breached his duty of care by not taking reasonable steps to mitigate the risk, such as cleaning up toys or warning the grandfather about the risk.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate action for the court would likely be:\n\nA. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on negligence. This allows the jury to determine if the son breached their duty of care to the grandfather and if this breach was the proximate cause of the grandfather's injuries."
