For instance, they influence the metabolism of fat, particularly in European populations (option B). These genes can affect how efficiently the body processes lipids, potentially impacting health and disease risk.\n\nAdditionally, studies have linked Neandertal genetic contributions to certain human diseases. For example, variants of the gene TYK2, which is related to the immune system and inflammation, have been found to be more common in populations with Neandertal ancestry and have been associated with an increased risk of developing lupus (option C).\n\nTherefore, while Neandertal genes are not universally beneficial to all modern humans, they do contribute to traits like fat metabolism and can increase the risk for specific diseases."
