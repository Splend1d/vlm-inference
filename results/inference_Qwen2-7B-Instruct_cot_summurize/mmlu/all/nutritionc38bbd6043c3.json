The end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is pyruvate.\n\nIn red blood cells, which lack mitochondria and cannot produce ATP through aerobic respiration, glycolysis leads directly to the production of two molecules of pyruvate instead of generating acetyl-CoA for the Krebs cycle. \n\nA. Glucagon does not increase the rate of glycolysis; rather, it stimulates gluconeogenesis, the process by which non-carbohydrate substrates are converted into glucose.\nB. Glycolysis actually requires NAD+ ( and not NADP+, although NADPH plays a role in other metabolic pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway.\nC. In glycolysis, glucose is indeed cleaved, but it's split into two three-cararbon molecules, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, not just two three-carbon products."
