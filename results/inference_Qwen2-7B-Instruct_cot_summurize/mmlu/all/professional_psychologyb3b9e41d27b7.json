Among the options provided, the most characteristic of the classic aging pattern is:\n\nA. Verbal functions are preserved relatively well, but performance decreases on tests of perceptual-integrative ability.\n\nThis is because, in general, older adults tend to maintain their verbal skills ( such as vocabulary, language comprehension, and reading fluency, which are often less affected by aging. However, they may experience more difficulty with tasks that require spatial reasoning, perceptual integration, and processing speed, which can decline due to age-related changes in the brain's processing efficiency and connectivity."
