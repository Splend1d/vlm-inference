Adjustment disorder with anxious mood\n\nThis diagnosis is appropriate because the patient is experiencing distressing symptoms (such as a pounding heart, poor sleep, and restlessness) following a significant life event (relocating for a promotion), which is affecting his ability to function in his daily life (having trouble concentrating at work and calling in sick). These symptoms have been ongoing for less than 6 months, which is consistent with an adjustment disorder.\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder ((option B) might also fit some of the symptoms, but it typically involves excessive and uncontrollable worry about everyday things for more than 6 months without a specific stressor, whereas the patient here seems to be responding specifically to the recent change in his job situation.\n\nMajor depressive disorder ((option C) could potentially apply if there were more signs of persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or weight, insomnia or hypersomnia, fatigue, and other depressive symptoms. However, the information provided does not strongly suggest these symptoms.\n\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder ((option D) is characterized by an excessive preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, control, and doubtfulness, and is not primarily characterized by symptoms such as a pounding heart, poor sleep, or restlessness related to a stressful life event."
