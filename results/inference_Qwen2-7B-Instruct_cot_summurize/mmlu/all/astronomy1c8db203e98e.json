They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars\n\nAsteroids stand out in sky surveys because they reflect sunlight back to Earth, making them appear as brighter points of light compared to most background stars. This reflection allows telescopes to detect and identify asteroids even when they are relatively far from our planet. The brightness comes from the asteroid's surface properties (such as its albedo, which is the fraction of incident light that is reflected. Different materials on the surface of an asteroid can lead to different levels of brightness, with some surfaces reflectinging more light than others."
