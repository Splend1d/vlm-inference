We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normal. Means are not.\nC. We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.\nD. When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n"

When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n\nThe reason we typically use the t-distribution instead of the z-distribution for inference procedures involving means (especially when the population standard deviation is unknown and estimated from the sample, is due to the additional variability introduced by estimating the standard deviation. The t-distribution accounts for this extra uncertainty by having heavier tails compared to the z-distribution, which assumes knowledge of the population standard deviation. This makes the t-distribution more appropriate for situations where the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is estimated from the sample."
