This is because as a race gets longer, an athlete's energy stores (primarily carbohydrates) are depleted, which can limit their ability to sustain high levels of power or intensity. \n\nA. Usually remains constant during a race: This is not accurate for long-distance events where power output tends to decrease over time due to the depletion of energy stores.\n\nC. Is improved by a high fat diet: While a high-fat diet can enhance endurance and help manage carbohydrate stores, it does not directly improve the maximum sustainable power. The type of diet can influence performance indirectly by affecting how efficiently the body uses energy sources, but the primary determinant of maximum sustainable power is physiological and training-specific.\n\nD. Is inversely related to muscle glycogen content: This statement is partially true in the sense that lower muscle glycogen stores might lead to a decreased capacity for sustained high-intensity effort, but it does not fully capture the complexity of factors influencing maximum sustainable power. Other factors like cardiovascular health, oxygen uptake, and neuromuscular efficiency also play significant roles."
