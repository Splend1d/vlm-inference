Here's how each of the options you've listed fits into this:\n\nA. Heroin use was much higher among military personnel in Vietnam than it was among veterans who returned to the United States. This example illustrates that when heroin (a highly addictive and potentially lethal drug was more readily available during the Vietnam War, the rate of its use among military personnel was significantly higher than among those who were exposed to it but not used it while they were serving. This supports the idea that easier access to a drug can lead to increased use.\n\nB. The percentage of physicians who use psychoactive drugs is much higher than the general population. This indicates that when certain psychoactive substances are more accessible to a specific group (in this case, doctors - the usage rates within that group are also higher. This supports the argument that availability increases use, as the group with greater access consumes more of the substance.\n\nC. Alcohol abuse declines when the law restricts the times it can be legally sold. This is an example of the opposite scenario where decreased availability leads to decreased use. While this directly contradicts the claim made by de Marneffe, it is included here to show that availability does have an impact on usage patterns. When alcohol sales are limited, particularly through time restrictions, there is often a corresponding decrease in abuse rates.\n\nIn summary, de Marneffe uses these three examples to demonstrate that the availability of drugs is closely linked to their usage levels, supporting the idea that increased availability leads to increased use."
