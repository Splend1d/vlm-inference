The following day, the artist conveys the property to a bartender; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the artist executes an identical conveyance of the farm to a caterer. The caterer gives the artist a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of prior conveyance to the bartender. The bartender, however, records her deed on February 6. The caterer then conveys his interest in the farm to a dancer, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the caterer. On February 5, the dancer purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the bartender and duly records the deed. In conducting a title search, the dancer should pursue his investigation by looking in the\n\nA. Grantor Index under the caterer's name to ascertain if the caterer acquired title.\nB. Grantee Index under the caterer's name only.\nC. Grantee Index under the caterer's name, then the Grantor Index under the caterer's name, and then in the Grantee Index again, this time under the artist's name to discover if he acquired title.\nD.

Grantee Index under the caterer's name, then the Grantor Index under the caterer's name, and then in the Grantee Index again, this time under the artist's name to discover if he acquired title.\n\nThe reason for this is that when conducting a title search, one must follow the chain of title from the most recent owner ( in this case, the dancer, back to the original owner, the retiree. This involves first looking at the Grantee Index under the current owner's name (the caterer here, to see who sold the property to them. If there are multiple entries for the same name, one must then consult the Grantor Index under that name to see who originally sold the property to the person listed in the Grantee Index. This process continues until the original owner, the retiree, is identified. \n\nIn this scenario, after finding the caterer's entry in the Grantee Index, the next step would be to look at the Grantor Index under the caterer's name to see who sold the property to the caterer. If the caterer purchased the property from the artist, then the final step would be to look in the Grantee Index under the artist's name to see if they acquired the property from the retiree. This will ensure that all transactions have been accounted for and that the dancer can verify the legitimacy and completeness of the chain of title."
