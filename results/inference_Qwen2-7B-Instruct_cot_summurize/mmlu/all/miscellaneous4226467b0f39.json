Scattergories rely primarily on bluffing. \n\n- **Outburst** is a game where players have to think quickly and come up with words that fit certain categories, but it doesn't involve deception.\n- **Balderdash** involves creating fake definitions for real words, but the bluffing aspect is in the creation of plausible but incorrect answers rather than deceiving opponents during gameplay.\n- **Pictionary** is a drawing-based game where players guess the word or phrase being drawn, so it's more about visual interpretation and guessing skills than deception.\n- **Scattergories** requires players to think creatively within specific categories, but its primary mechanics do not involve deception.\n\nHowever, a game that does heavily rely on bluffing is **Euchre**, a trick-taking card game. In Euchre, players often bluff about their ability to win tricks, which can influence other players' decisions."
