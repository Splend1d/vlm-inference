Her data showed that over half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce, because of competition for food and predation. In a single generation, 90% of the squirrels that were born lived to reproduce, and the population increased to 80. Which inference(s) about this population might be true?\n\nA.

Here's why each of these inferences could be true:\n\nA. The amount of available food may have increased: If there is more food available, it could support a larger squirrel population. This would allow more squirrels to survive and reproduce, potentially leading to an increase in the overall population size.\n\nB. The number of predators may have decreased: A decrease in predators would reduce the number of squirrels that are killed, allowing more squirrels to survive and reproduce. This could also contribute to an increase in the population size.\n\nC. The squirrels of subsequent generations should show greater levels of genetic variation than previous generations: If squirrels that would not have survived in the past are now surviving, this suggests that the environment has changed in a way that allows for more genetic diversity. This could occur if, for example, some squirrels develop traits that make them better at finding food or avoiding predators, which could then be passed on to their offspring. Over time, this could lead to greater genetic variation within the population.\n\nGiven the context provided, all of these options (A, B, and C - are plausible explanations for the observed increase in the squirrel population. Without further information, it's not possible to definitively determine which factor(s) played the most significant role in the population increase. Therefore, option D, which includes all three possibilities, seems to be the most accurate inference based on the given information."
