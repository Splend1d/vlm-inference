Explicit memory, which involves conscious recollection of events and experiences, often shows some decline as people age. This is because explicit memory processes rely heavily on the hippocampus and other areas of the brain that can become less efficient with age.\n\nOn the other hand, implicit memory, which is the unconscious or automatic type of memory ( such as skills, habits, and priming effects, tends to remain more stable or even improve with age. This is likely because implicit memory processes are less dependent on the hippocampus and may engage other parts of the brain that maintain their function better over time.\n\nIt's worth noting that these general trends can vary based on individual differences, health status, and lifestyle factors. Additionally, both types of memory can be affected in specific circumstances, such as in cases of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease."
