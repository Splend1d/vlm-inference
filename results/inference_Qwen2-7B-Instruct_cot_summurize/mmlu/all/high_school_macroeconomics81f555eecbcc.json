The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nWhen consumers expect the price of corn to be lower in the near future, they might reduce their demand for corn immediately, anticipating better deals later. This leads to a decrease in the current demand for corn, which shifts the demand curve to the left.\n\nMeanwhile, if the prices of seed corn and fertilizer fall, it generally becomes cheaper for producers to produce corn. This reduces the cost of production, potentially increasing the supply of corn or allowing producers to produce more at the same cost. This shift in the supply curve could either increase or not change the equilibrium quantity, depending on how much the cost reduction impacts supply relative to the demand shift.\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests that the equilibrium price will likely fall due to reduced demand and potentially increased supply. However, without specific information about the magnitude of these shifts, it's difficult to determine whether the equilibrium quantity will rise, remain the same, or even decrease. Therefore, option B best captures the potential impact on the equilibrium price, while acknowledging that the equilibrium quantity's direction is indeterminate based on the given information."
