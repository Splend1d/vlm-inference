The woman, who was seriously injured in the accident, sued the motorboat operator in a personal injury action. During the course of the lawsuit, an important question of consequence was the wind speed on the afternoon the woman was sailing. At trial, the woman calls an orthopedic surgeon to testi1'. The surgeon, who is an amateur boating enthusiast, testified that he was navigating his sailboat into the bay when the motorboat hit the woman. Furthermore, the surgeon testified that in the cockpit of his boat he maintains a sophisticated electronic weathering device that measures wind speed, temperature, and barometric pressure at periodic intervals. The woman then offers into evidence the computer printout from the surgeon's weathering device measuring the wind speed at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the motorboat operator, the printout is\n\nA. admissible as past recollection recorded.\nB. admissible as the record of regularly conducted activity.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, unless there is foundation testimony as to the accuracy and good working condition of the surgeon's electronic weathering device on the afternoon in question.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The computer printout from the orthopedic surgeon's weathering device would be admissible as the record of regularly conducted activity. This is because the device measures wind speed as part of its routine function, and the printout falls under the exception for business records or public records, which are can be admitted into evidence without the need for the author to testify about it. This exception allows for the admission of records made in the regular course of a business or activity, where it is the duty of the person keeping the record to make it, and the record was made at or near the time of the event it documents.\n\nOption A ( \"past recollection recorded\" refers to a situation where a witness makes a written statement while their memory of an event is still fresh, but it does not apply here since the document is not being offered to refresh the memory of the declarant but rather as an original record.\n\nOption C suggests the printout would be inadmissible as hearsay, but this is incorrect because the printout is not hearsay\u2014it is an original record of a regularly conducted activity.\n\nOption D suggests the printout might be inadmissible if there is no foundation testimony regarding the accuracy and working condition of the device. While it is generally advisable to have such testimony to ensure the reliability of the evidence, in this context, the printout itself is considered a record of a regularly conducted activity, and thus should be admissible under the business records exception regardless of whether the specific device's accuracy was testified to, provided other requirements for admitting business records are met."
