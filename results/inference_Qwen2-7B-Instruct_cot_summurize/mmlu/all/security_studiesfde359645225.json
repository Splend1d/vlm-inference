The Orient is a constructed subject that is imagined as inferior, irrational, and backward, in comparison to the West.\n\nEdward Said introduced the term \"Orientalism\" to criticize the Eurocentric representation of non-Western cultures, particularly those in the Middle East and Asia, which often portrayed these regions and its people as inherently inferior, exotic, or primitive. This view was used to justify colonial policies and imperial control. According to Said, this construction of the Orient served the interests of Western powers, particularly during the period of European imperialism."
