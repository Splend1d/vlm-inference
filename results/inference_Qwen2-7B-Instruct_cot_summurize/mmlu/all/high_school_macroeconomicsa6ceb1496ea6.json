GDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures both A. production within a nation's borders and C. income earned by the factors of production plus depreciation and indirect business taxes. However, it does not directly measure B. production by a nation's citizens wherever they may be, as GDP primarily focuses on economic output within the geographical boundaries of a country.\n\nGDP is calculated using the following three main methods:\n1. **Production Method**: This method calculates the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a specific time period.\n2. **Income Method**: It adds up all incomes earned by the factors of production ( such as wages, rent, interest, and profits - plus depreciation and indirect business taxes.\n3. **Expenditure Method**: This method sums up the total spending on consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.\n\nThus, while GDP includes the income from factors of production and accounts for depreciation and indirect business taxes, it primarily focuses on the production that takes place within the country's borders."
