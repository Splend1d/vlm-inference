On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force.

The quote indicates that Peter was determined to change his country and believed he had to provide both the direction and motive force for transformation. This suggests that he maintained or even strengthened traditional practices rather than decentralizing power or promoting reform to the extent implied by the other options. Serfdom was a system where peasants were bound to the land and had limited rights, which was characteristic of Russia during Peter's reign."
