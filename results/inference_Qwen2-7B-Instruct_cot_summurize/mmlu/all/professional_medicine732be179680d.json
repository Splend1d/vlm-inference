Treat the symptoms\n\nGiven that this is the patient's first episode of urticaria and she has no abnormalities on history or physical examination, the most appropriate initial step would be to treat the symptoms. Urticaria can often be idiopathic (of unknown cause) and may resolve spontaneously without any specific treatment. However, symptomatic relief can be provided using antihistamines, which are are usually effective for managing the symptoms of urticaria. If the symptoms persist or worsen, or if there are recurrent episodes, further evaluation might be necessary, including referral to an allergist or further investigations like determining the serum IgE concentration or total eosinophil count, depending on the clinical context."
