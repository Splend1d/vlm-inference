To correctly value a perpetuity paying $10 annually with a 5% discount rate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Present Value} = \\frac{\\$10}{0.05} = \\$200 \\div 10 = \\$20 \\]\n\nSo, the correct interpretation for a perpetuity paying $10 annually at a 5% discount rate is that it is worth $200, but since this was was0 was was000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
