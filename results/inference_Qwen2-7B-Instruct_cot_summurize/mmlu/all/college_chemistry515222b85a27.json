In the case of the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4\u2212 and its conjugate base, the hydrogen phosphate ion HPO4^2-, the chemical shifts you've mentioned (3.42 ppm for H2PO4\u2212 and 5.82 ppm for HPO4^2- reflect these different environments.\n\nWhen the pH of the solution equals the pKa of H2PO4\u2212, the solution will contain equal amounts of H2PO4\u2212 and HPO4^2-. This is because at this pH, the acid-base equilibrium between H2PO4\u2212 and HPO4^2- is balanced, with half of the H2PO4\u2212 molecules being protonated to form HPO4^2-. \n\nIn terms of ^31P N-NMR, this means that the signal you would see in the spectrum represents an intermediate between the two environments. To find the expected chemical shift, we can use the concept of weighted average:\n\n\\[ \\text{Chemical Shift} = \\frac{(C_{H_2PO_4^-} \\times \\text{Shift}_{H_2PO_4^-}) + ( (C_{HPO_4^{2-}} \\times \\text{Shift}_{HPO_4^{2-}})}{C_{H_2PO_4^-} + C_{HPO_4^{2-}}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(C_{H_2PO_4^-} = C_{HPO_4^{2-}} = 0.5\\) ( since there's equal amount of both species,\n- \\(\\text{Shift}_{H_2PO_4^-} = 3.42 \\, \\text{ppm}\\),\n- \\(\\text{Shift}_{HPO_4^{2-}} = 5.82 \\, \\text{ppm}\\).\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Chemical Shift} = \\frac{(0.5 \\times 3.42) + ( (0.5 \\times 5.82)}{0.5 + 0.5} = \\frac{(1.71 + 2.91)}{1} = 4.62 \\, \\text{ppm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 4.62 ppm**."
