Without attempting to get a warrant, the police stopped all the cars waiting for the ferry. In one vehicle, the police noticed three women fidgeting rather nervously.

Probable cause exists when there is sufficient evidence, based on facts and circumstances known to the police, to justify a reasonable belief that a suspect has committed a crime. The fact that the police stopped all cars at the ferry without a warrant does not necessarily mean the stop was unlawful, as it could have been part of a general law enforcement operation or a targeted response to a specific incident (in this case, the reported robbery. If the police observed the three women acting nervously and had reason to believe they might be involved in the crime, this could provide additional grounds for suspicion that the stolen property might be found in their vehicle.\n\nUnder exigent circumstances ( such as the need to prevent the immediate destruction of evidence or the escape of the suspects, a warrant may not be required for a search. This would apply if the police acted swiftly to seize the stolen items before they could be removed from the vehicle or if there was an immediate risk that the evidence would be lost or contaminated.\n\nTherefore, the defendants' motion to suppress the evidence should be denied if the police can demonstrate that they had probable cause to search the vehicle and acted reasonably under the circumstances."
