It is involved in vision, immune function, and maintaining healthy skin, but its primary role does not include the synthesis of blood clotting proteins. This function is more closely related to factors like vitamin K.\n\nB. Activation of vitamin D receptors\nC. Activation of thyroid hormone receptors\nD. Regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation\nThese functions are indeed associated with vitamin A or retinoids ( which are the active forms of vitamin A. They play crucial roles in these processes within the body."
