He criticized the educational system for focusing too much on a single type of intelligence (academic or linguistic intelligence, at the expense of others such as interpersonal, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, etc.\n\nRobert Sternberg is best known for his triarchic theory of intelligence, which includes analytical, creative, and practical intelligence. He also criticized schools for focusing too much on analytical intelligence, which is often measured by standardized tests, and neglecting other forms of intelligence that are equally important in real-world problem-solving and success.\n\nSo, both researchers argue that schools should broaden their focus beyond traditional subjects and methods to include various types of intelligence and methods of learning."
