Persons who have work-related accidents tend to have had more recent life stress than accident-free workers.\n\nWork-related accidents can be influenced by various factors including the level of stress and mental health of an individual. People experiencing significant life stress may find it harder to cope with the demands of their work, increasing the likelihood of accidents. This could include personal issues such as relationship problems, financial difficulties, or health concerns.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not necessarily correlate with work-related accidents:\n\n- A. Feeling more dissatisfied with work does not directly cause accidents but may affect safety behaviors.\n- B. Job promotions do not inherently influence accident rates; rather, they might be affected by performance, which can be impacted by stress or accidents.\n- D. Intelligence is not typically a determining factor in the occurrence of work accidents, although skills and attentiveness might play a role.\n\nIt's important to note that these answers reflect general trends and correlations, and individual circumstances can vary widely. Workplace safety measures aim to address multiple factors that contribute to accidents, including but not limited to, employee well-being, training, equipment safety, and environmental conditions."
