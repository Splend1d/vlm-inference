The long-run average cost curve always intersects the short-run average cost curve at the minimum point of the short-run average cost curve. \n\nIn the long run, all factors of production are variable, meaning that a firm can adjust all its inputs to minimize costs for any given level of output. As such, the long-run average cost curve reflects the lowest possible average cost that can be achieved with different combinations of input quantities. Since the short-run average cost curve includes scenarios where at least one input is fixed ( (e.g., capital), it will have higher costs for certain output levels compared to what could be achieved in the long run when all inputs can be adjusted. The point of intersection between the two curves signifies the most efficient scale of operation for a given technology and factor endowments, where the long-run average cost equals the minimum short-run average cost."
