For TQM to be successful, it is crucial that employees are actively involved in the decision-making process, as they are the ones who directly impact the quality of products or services. When employees feel that their input is valued and they have a stake in the decisions affecting their work, they are more likely to be engaged, motivated, and committed to achieving high-quality results. This involvement can lead to innovative solutions, improved processes, and ultimately better quality outcomes. Therefore, if TQM fails to live up to its potential, one of the primary reasons might be insufficient employee involvement in decision-making."
