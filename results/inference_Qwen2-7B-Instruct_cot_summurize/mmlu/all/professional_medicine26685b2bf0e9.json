His birth weight was 3500 g (7 lb 11 oz), and Apgar scores were 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. At the age of 15 months, physical examination showed no abnormalities, but he was not yet talking. Both of his parents had learning difficulties in school, and his mother stopped attending after the 10th grade. He has a maternal uncle with cognitive disabilities. He is at the 25th percentile for height, 15th percentile for weight, and 90th percentile for head circumference. He appears irritable, he resists making eye contact, and he is flapping his hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?\n\nA. Frameshift mutation\nB. Missense mutation\nC. Nonsense mutation\nD. Trinucleotide repeat expansion\n"

Among the options provided, a \"Trinucleotide repeat expansion\" ( (Option D) fits best with this description.\n\nTrinucleotide repeat expansions refer to a type of genetic mutation where a particular DNA sequence is repeated too many times, leading to a genetic disorder. These mutations can lead to a variety of neurological conditions, including cognitive disabilities, developmental delays, and behavioral issues. Conditions like Huntington's disease and fragile X syndrome are examples where trinucleotide repeats expand beyond a normal range causing disease symptoms.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the correct answer would be D. Trinucleotide repeat expansion. \n\nOptions A ( Frameshift mutation, B: Missense mutation, and C: Nonsense mutation do not typically present with the specific clinical features mentioned or are less commonly associated with developmental disorders and cognitive disabilities in a pattern suggesting a common genetic cause across multiple family members."
