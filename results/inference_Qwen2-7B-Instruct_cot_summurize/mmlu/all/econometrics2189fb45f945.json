This means that the estimated effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable might not accurately reflect their true impact.\n\n2. **Hypothesis tests could reach the wrong conclusions**: The standard errors of the coefficient estimates are inflated due to autocorrelation. Since hypothesis tests rely on these standard errors to determine significance, using them when autocorrelation is present can lead to incorrect conclusions about whether the observed relationships are statistically significant or not.\n\n3. **Forecasts made from the model could be biased**: If the model is used for forecasting and there is autocorrelation in the error terms, the forecasts will be systematically off. This is because the model does not properly account for the dependency structure in the data.\n\n4. **Standard errors may be inappropriate**: As mentioned, the standard errors are typically underestimated in the presence of autocorrelation. This underestimation leads to overly optimistic t-statistics and p-values, making it more likely to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, all of the above statements (i) through iv) are correct when considering the use of OLS in the presence of autocorrelation."
