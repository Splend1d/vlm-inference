A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?\n\nA. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.\nB. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.\nC. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.\nD. The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.\n"

The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.\n\nIn cases involving facial challenges to laws that affect fundamental rights or impose severe burdens, the party challenging the law (in this case, the plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing - typically bears the burden of persuasion. However, when the law impacts economic interests rather than fundamental rights, the burden shifts back to the government to show that the law serves a compelling state interest. In this scenario, the city enacted the ordinance with the goal of improving the quality of rental housing, which could be seen as serving a compelling state interest ( ensuring adequate living conditions for its citizens. To defend the ordinance, the city must show that it is necessary to achieve this compelling interest and that the impact on low-income housing is justified by the need to improve overall housing quality."
