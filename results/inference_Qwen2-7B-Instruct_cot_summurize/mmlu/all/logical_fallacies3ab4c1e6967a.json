It suggests that one should feel sorry for someone and act accordingly, rather than evaluating the argument or issue logically. \n\nIt's important to note that while appeals to emotion can be persuasive, they should ideally be balanced with logical reasoning and evidence. Purely emotional arguments without supporting facts or logic might not lead to sound decision-making or understanding."
