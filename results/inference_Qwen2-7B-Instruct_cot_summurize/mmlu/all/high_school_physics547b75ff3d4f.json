So, we can compare the weights using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_{planet}}{F_{Earth}} = \\frac{G \\frac{m_{planet} M_{Earth}}{R_{Earth}^2}}{G \\frac{m_{Earth} M_{planet}}{R_{planet}^2}} \\]\n\nGiven that the mass and radius of the planet are each twice that of Earth, we have:\n\n- \\(M_{planet} = 2M_{Earth}\\),\n- \\(R_{planet} = 2R_{Earth}\\).\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_{planet}}{F_{Earth}} = \\frac{2M_{Earth} \\cdot M_{Earth}}{(2R_{Earth})^2} = \\frac{2M_{Earth} \\cdot M_{Earth}}{4R_{Earth}^2} = \\frac{M_{Earth}}{2R_{Earth}^2} \\cdot 2M_{Earth} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 = 1 \\]\n\nThis means the gravitational force (weight) on the new planet would be the same as on Earth if both planets had the same mass and radius. However, since the mass of the new planet is actually twice that of Earth's, but the radius is also doubled, the gravitational acceleration would be different due to the inverse square relationship with radius. But since we're comparing it to Earth where the mass has effectively been doubled while the radius has also been doubled, the gravitational acceleration effectively remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the astronaut's weight on this new planet would be the same as on Earth, which is 800 N.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 800 N."
