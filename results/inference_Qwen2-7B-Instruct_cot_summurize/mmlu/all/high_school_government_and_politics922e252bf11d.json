Southerners\n\nThe Democratic Party's pursuit of liberal social policies, such as abortion rights or same-sex marriage, often aligns with more progressive views on social issues. However, this can sometimes lead to alienation among certain segments of the party's base, particularly in the Southern United States. Historically, many Southerners have had more conservative views on social issues, and these policies shifts might not resonate well with their political beliefs.\n\nIt's important to note that while this may be an area of contention, the Democratic Party's base is diverse and includes people from various educational backgrounds ( (A), geographic regions (B), religious affiliations, and ethnicities (D). The party's overall support tends to be strong among college-educated individuals, urban residents, and minority groups."
