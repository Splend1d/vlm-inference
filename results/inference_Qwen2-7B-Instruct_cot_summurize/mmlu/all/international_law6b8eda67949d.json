Treaties is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\nThis principle is enshrined in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969, which states that treaties shall be interpreted \"in good faith in their plain meaning, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty.\" This means that when interpreting a treaty, one should consider the ordinary meaning of the words used, taking into account the context and the purpose or objective of the treaty as a whole. This approach allows for a nuanced interpretation that takes into account the broader objectives and intentions behind the treaty, rather than simply applying a strict textual interpretation."
