The evaluation process should be voluntary and consensual as much as possible, especially in forensic settings where the individual's autonomy can be significantly impacted by the legal system. Thus, it would be appropriate for Dr. Praise to discuss the situation with the defendant's attorney or the court to seek guidance on how to proceed."
