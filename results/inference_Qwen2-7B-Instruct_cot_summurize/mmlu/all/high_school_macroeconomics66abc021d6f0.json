Depreciation of physical capital\n\nNational income is calculated by adding up all the value added in the production process within a country's borders during a given period. This includes wages, salaries, and interest, as these represent compensation for labor and financial capital, respectively. However, depreciation of physical capital ( such as machinery or buildings - is not added back to national income. Instead, it is subtracted because it represents the decline in the value of capital goods over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or other factors. The net result after subtracting depreciation from total output is known as Gross Domestic Product ( (GDP), which is often used as a proxy for national income."
