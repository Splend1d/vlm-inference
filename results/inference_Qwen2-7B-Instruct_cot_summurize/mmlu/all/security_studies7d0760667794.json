                    "text": "D. All of these options.\n\nLet's delve into each point to understand why they limit the case for humanitarian intervention:\n\nA. **It is not self-evident that individuals do have universal and fundamental human rights.** The concept of universal human rights is foundational to the argument for humanitarian intervention, as it suggests that all individuals are entitled to certain rights regardless of nationality, ethnicity, gender, or any other status. However, the existence and universality of human rights are not universally accepted. Different cultures, political ideologies, and legal systems interpret human rights differently, which can lead to disagreements on whether certain actions constitute a violation of human rights warranting intervention.\n\nB. **Advocates of humanitarian intervention exaggerate the extent of global consensus about the use of force to protect human rights.** While there is broad agreement that human rights should be respected, there is less consensus on how to enforce them or when international intervention is justified. This includes debates over the legality under international law (primarily through the United Nations Charter, the principle of state sovereignty versus the responsibility to protect (R2P), and the practical challenges of implementing interventions without clear international consensus or clear legal authority.\n\nC. **Any norm endorsing the use of force to protect individual rights could be abused by powerful states.** This is a significant concern because the power dynamics within the international community mean that smaller, weaker states may be more vulnerable to coercion or manipulation by larger, more powerful states when advocating for humanitarian intervention. Powerful states might use the guise of protecting human rights to pursue their own geopolitical interests, such as regime change or access to resources, rather than genuine concerns for human welfare.\n\nTherefore, considering all these limitations, option D is correct: the case for humanitarian intervention is limited due to the uncertainties around the universality of human rights, the potential for exaggeration of global consensus, and the risk of abuse by powerful states."
