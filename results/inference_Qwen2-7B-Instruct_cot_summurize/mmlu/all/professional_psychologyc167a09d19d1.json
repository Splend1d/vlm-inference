This can lead to a lack of communication and support within the family system.\n\nIn your scenario:\n- The mother's unconcerned attitude towards her son's repeated offenses might indicate she isn't emotionally engaging with the situation or the consequences of her son's actions.\n- The father's choice to go fishing on the day of the court hearing instead of supporting his son could be seen as an avoidance of emotional involvement.\n- The sister's excuse of having too much homework to attend the court hearing suggests a lack of family solidarity and emotional engagement with the family member in need.\n\nOverall, these behaviors suggest that the family members are not emotionally connected or supportive of one another, which is characteristic of an emotionally cut-off family structure."
