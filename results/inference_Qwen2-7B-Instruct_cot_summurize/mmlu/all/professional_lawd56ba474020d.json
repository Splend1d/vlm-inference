It had a contingency clause requiring him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time. It said that time was of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion as to whether he would qualify. The seller told the purchaser that she rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?\n\nA. Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.\nB. Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval \u0080\u0093 the first notice communicated is the effective one.\nC. No, because the amount of time that he was late was a \"de minimus\" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.\nD. No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.\n"

Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.\n\nThe key factor here is the contingency clause in the agreement of sale which required the purchaser to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time, with time being being of the essence. By failing to meet this condition by applying for a mortgage within the stipulated timeframe, the purchaser lost the protection offered by the contingency clause. This means that if the seller decided to rescind the sale based on this breach, she would have a strong legal basis to do so, especially since the contract specifies that time is of the essence. \n\nThe fact that the purchaser later applied for and received approval does not change the outcome in this scenario, as it occurred after the rescission and therefore cannot undo it. The timing of the application was crucial according to the terms of the contract, and its tardiness resulted in the loss of the buyer's ability to complete the purchase under the original agreement."
