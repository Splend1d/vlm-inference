The complexity and size of the Great Zimbabwe ruins, along with other similar structures in Africa, initially puzzled archaeologists who often attributed them to external influences or misunderstood the indigenous people's abilities. However, modern research has debunked these misconceptions, recognizing the sophisticated engineering skills of the Shona people who constructed the site."
