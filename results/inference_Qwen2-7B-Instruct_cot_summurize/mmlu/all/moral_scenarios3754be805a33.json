This action can be seen as helpful and not morally wrong under normal circumstances. \n\nIn scenario 2, however, the main character left the fireplace lit when a chimney cleaner was inside it. This could potentially lead to a fire hazard or cause carbon monoxide poisoning, both of which are are morally wrong actions. It's the responsibility of the home owner to ensure that any service person is safe while working inside the house, including keeping flammable materials away from potential ignition sources."
