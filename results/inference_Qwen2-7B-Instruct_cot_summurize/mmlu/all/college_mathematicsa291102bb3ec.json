So, for each prime factor in the factorization, we can choose the exponents from \\(0\\) up to the given exponent to form the cyclic groups.\n\nFor the prime factor \\(2^3\\), we can have:\n\n- \\(2^0\\)\n- \\(2^1\\)\n- \\(2^2\\)\n- \\(2^3\\)\n\nThat's 4 possibilities.\n\nFor the prime factor \\(3^2\\), we can have:\n\n- \\(3^0\\)\n- \\(3^1\\)\n- \\(3^2\\)\n\nThat's 3 possibilities.\n\nNow, since these are independent choices, we multiply the possibilities together:\n\n\\[4 \\times 3 = 12\\]\n\nHowever, this includes the case where both factors are their maximum powers, which is one specific group, \\(C_{72}\\). But we also have to consider cases where some factors could be absent, which would correspond to direct products with fewer factors. For example, \\(C_{36} \\times C_2\\), \\(C_{18} \\times C_4\\), etc., are not counted in our initial multiplication as they were considered under different combinations.\n\nLet's correct the count by considering all unique combinations:\n\n1. \\(C_{72}\\) ( (i.e., \\(2^3 \\times 3^2\\))\n2. \\(C_{36} \\times C_2\\) ( (i.e., \\(2^2 \\times 3^2\\))\n3. \\(C_{18} \\times C_4\\) ( (i.e., \\(2^3 \\times 3^1\\))\n4. \\(C_{12} \\times C_6\\) ( (i.e., \\(2^3 \\times 3^0\\))\n5. \\(C_{24} \\times C_3\\) ( (i.e., \\(2^2 \\times 3^1\\))\n6. \\(C_{12} \\times C_3 \\times C_2\\) ( (i.e., \\(2^2 \\times 3^0\\))\n7. \\(C_{18} \\times C_2 \\times C_2\\) ( (i.e., \\(2^1 \\times 3^2\\))\n8. \\(C_6 \\times C_6 \\times C_2\\) ( (i.e., \\(2^1 \\times 3^1\\))\n9. \\(C_6 \\times C_3 \\times C_3\\) ( (i.e., \\(2^0 \\times 3^2\\))\n\nAfter carefully listing out all possible unique combinations, we find there are actually 9 structurally distinct Abelian groups of order \\(72\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 9**."
