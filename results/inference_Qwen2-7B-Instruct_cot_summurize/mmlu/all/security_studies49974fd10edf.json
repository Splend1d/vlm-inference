All of these options.\n\nThe concept of \"deepening and broadening\" in security refers to the expansion of traditional security concerns beyond military threats to encompass a wider range of issues that affect human safety and well-being. Here's how each of your options fits into this:\n\nA. **The nexus between identity and security** - This refers to the growing recognition that aspects of identity, such as cultural, social, economic, and political identities, can significantly impact security. Issues like discrimination, xenophobia, and social exclusion can lead to instability and conflict, thus becoming part of the security discourse.\n\nB. **War, the military, and the sovereign state** - Traditionally, security has been associated with military capabilities and the protection of national sovereignty against external threats. However, the deepening and broadening of security also includes considering the impacts of war on civilians, the role of international law in conflict resolution, and the effects of military interventions on global security.\n\nC. **Environmental changes** - With climate change and other environmental factors increasingly affecting societies, there is a growing recognition that environmental degradation can lead to resource scarcity, migration, and conflicts over territory. These issues are now seen as critical components of national and global security strategies.\n\nTherefore, all of these options represent aspects of how the understanding and practice of security have expanded to include not just military threats but also a wide array of non-military challenges that affect human security."
