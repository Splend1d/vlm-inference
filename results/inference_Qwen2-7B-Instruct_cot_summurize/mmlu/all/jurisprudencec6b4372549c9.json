Animals have inherent worth which entitles them to the absolute right to live their lives with respect and autonomy.\n\nTom Regan's sentimental anthropomorphicism argues that all beings that can experience states such as joy, pain, and suffering (known as \"subjects of a life\" or sentient beings) have intrinsic value and deserve moral consideration. This view posits that these beings possess rights simply because they are capable of experiencing suffering and pleasure, and thus should not be treated merely as means to an end."
