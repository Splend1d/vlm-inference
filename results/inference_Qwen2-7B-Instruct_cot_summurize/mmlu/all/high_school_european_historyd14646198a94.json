In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following beliefs, supported first by Calvin, does this passage seem to best support?\n\nA. Salvation\nB. Predestination\nC. Divinity of Jesus\nD. Simony\n"

Predestination\n\nThis passage supports Calvin's belief in predestination, which is the idea that God has sovereignly chosen certain individuals for salvation before the foundation of the world, based solely on His grace and not on human merit or foreseen faith. Calvin argues that the salvation of the remnant of the people is due to the election of grace, meaning that there is no claim or basis for humans to presume their salvation apart from God's unmerited favor. This concept is central to Calvinist theology and contrasts with the idea of free will in determining salvation."
