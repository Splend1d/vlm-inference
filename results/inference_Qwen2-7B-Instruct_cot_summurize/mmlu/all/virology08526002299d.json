Exclusively breast fed for six months\n\nBreastfeeding provides newborns with essential nutrients and antibodies that help protect them against diseases and infections, especially in environments where clean water and healthcare may be scarce. It also helps in the development of the child's immune system. \n\nHowever, it is also important to note that this recommendation assumes that breastfeeding can be safely and effectively practiced in the given circumstances. If there are are issues such as HIV, severe malnutrition, or certain medical conditions that make exclusive breastfeeding unsafe, other feeding options might need to be considered. Therefore, this decision should be made in consultation with healthcare professionals who have knowledge of the specific local context."
