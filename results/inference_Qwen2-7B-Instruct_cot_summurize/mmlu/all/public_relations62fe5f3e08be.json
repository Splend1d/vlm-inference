People should be treated as an end, not a means to an end.\n\nThis statement aligns with the ideas of Immanuel Kant, a key figure in modern Western philosophy, particularly within the field of deontological ethics. Kant believed that actions are morally right if they are based on duty and respect for moral law, rather than their consequences or the desires of the agent. This concept is encapsulated in his principle of treating humanity, whether in oneself or others, always as an end and never merely as a means to an end."
