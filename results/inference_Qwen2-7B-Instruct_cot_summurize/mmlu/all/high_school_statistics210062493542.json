An experiment, thus making cause and effect a reasonable conclusion\n\nThis is because the teacher implemented a specific intervention (weekly practice quizzes - and observed a particular outcome (all students achieving a grade of at least C. This setup allows for the inference of cause and effect, assuming other factors were controlled or were not strong enough to overshadow the impact of the quizzes.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that for a true experiment, the design should ideally include a control group that does not receive the intervention to compare outcomes effectively. Without a control group, while cause and effect can still be reasonably inferred based on the observed data, the strength of that inference might be questioned, especially if there are are other uncontrolled variables that could have influenced the results. Therefore, technically speaking, while option B is correct, the experiment might not meet all the stringent criteria for a perfect experimental design."
