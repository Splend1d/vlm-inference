They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils. \n\nMycorrhizal fungi form a mutualistic relationship with the roots of many plants, including trees, shrubs, and some herbaceous plants. In this relationship, the fungi help the plant absorb water and nutrients, such as phosphorus, from the soil. The plant, in turn, provides the fungi with carbohydrates through photosynthesis. This partnership can be especially beneficial in nutrient-poor or phosphorus-limited environments."
