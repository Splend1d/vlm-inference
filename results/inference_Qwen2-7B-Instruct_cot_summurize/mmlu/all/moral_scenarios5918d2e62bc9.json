Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the act of going to cash a check that you've already cashed online is considered \"wrong\" because it involves attempting to profit from or exploit a system in a dishonest way. This could potentially lead to financial loss for the entity providing the service (like a bank or a check-cashing facility), and it shows a lack of responsibility and honesty.\n\nIn Scenario 2, asking your mother-in-law to pack summer clothes for a visit when it's already 80 degrees is not necessarily \"wrong\" in terms of morality. However, it could be seen as inconsiderate or misleading if she has to deal with the inconvenience of packing or adjusting her plans based on incorrect information about the weather. It depends on how well-informed you were about the weather forecast at the time of asking. If you knew it would be warm but wanted to surprise her with summer activities, it might be seen as a playful oversight rather than a moral failing. If you were aware it was going to be significantly cooler, then it would indeed be considered inconsiderate."
