The double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond, making it relatively shorter than single or triple bonds. \n\nIn contrast, the other molecules ( CO32-, NO2-, and NO3- involve additional atoms (a third oxygen in CO32-, two nitrogen atoms in NO2-, and three oxygen atoms in NO3-. These additional atoms introduce more electron density between the central atom and the bonded atoms, which stretches the bonds. Therefore, the bonds in CO2 are the shortest among these options."
