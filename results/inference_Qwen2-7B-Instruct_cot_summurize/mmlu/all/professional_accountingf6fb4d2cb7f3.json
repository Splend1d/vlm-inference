The total current assets are equal to the sum of inventory and prepaid expenses. Given that the total current assets are $966,000 and inventory is $644,000, we can find prepaid expenses:\n\\[ \\text{Prepaid Expenses} = \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Prepaid Expenses} = 966,000 - 644,000 = 322,000 \\]\n\nHowever, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question's expectation regarding the answer format or calculation since the correct interpretation typically focuses on finding one of these components given the other and the current liabilities. Based on the provided calculations:\n\n- Inventory: $644,000\n\nThe closest answer choice based on this calculation is:\n\nB. $644,000"
