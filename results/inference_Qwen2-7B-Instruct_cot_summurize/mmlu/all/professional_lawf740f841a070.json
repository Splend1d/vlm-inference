A law in the state requires new political entrants, regardless of party affiliation, to obtain five times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident, however, failed to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures to have his name placed on the ballot. On the substantive constitutional issue regarding the validity of the authenticating requirement, the most probable judicial resolution will be to\n\nA. hold the authenticating requirement unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. hold the authenticating requirement unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. dismiss the cause of action because state election procedures are a sovereign state function.\nD. assign the burden of proving the validity of the authenticating requirement to thestate.\n"

This is because the due process clause ensures that no person shall \"be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" If the authenticating requirement is so burdensome that it prevents a qualified candidate from accessing the ballot, it could potentially violate the candidate's right to due process by effectively denying them the opportunity to participate in the democratic process.\n\nThe court might examine whether the requirement is reasonable and serves a compelling state interest, such as ensuring the integrity of the electoral process. If the court determines that the requirement places an undue burden on the candidate's ability to exercise their right to run for office without providing adequate justification, it may find the requirement unconstitutional under the due process clause."
