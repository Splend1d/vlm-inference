Shortly thereafter and prior to the July commencement date of employment, the school elected to terminate its varsity football program. The school publicly attributed the decision to economic factors. Upon hearing this news, the man sought out the headmaster of the school to inquire as to the effect, if any, of this decision on his salary and responsibilities. In order to resolve the matter, the headmaster arranged a meeting among various school officials to discuss the man's situation. Afterward, the school sent written notice to the man of its intent to terminate his employment contract. The man then commenced suit to recover the full balance of his salary calculated on the basis of the contract. At trial, the headmaster was called to testify. On direct examination, he testified that six people (including himself) attended the meeting where it was decided to terminate the man's employment contract. When asked to identify the attendees, the headmaster gave the names of four but, despite trying, was unable to remember the name of the fifth person. The attorney who called the headmaster to testify now seeks to show him her handwritten notes that the attorney prepared during her pretrial interview with the headmaster, in which he provided all five names. The trial court is likely to consider the showing of the notes taken as\n\nA. a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection.\nB. a proper attempt to introduce recorded recollection.\nC. an improper attempt to support the headmaster's credibility.\nD. an improper attempt to lead the witness.\n"

This is known as \"refreshing recollection.\" The purpose of this is to ensure that the witness is accurately recalling information relevant to the case rather than being influenced by external sources or misremembering facts.\n\nIn this scenario, the attorney's handwritten notes from her pretrial interview with the headmaster would likely be considered a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection, assuming the notes were genuinely intended for that purpose and not merely to bolster the witness's credibility or guide the testimony. The attorney would need to lay an appropriate foundation for the introduction of these notes, explaining how they were used to refresh the witness's recollection, and that they are are not being being used to influence or control the witness's answers during the testimony."
