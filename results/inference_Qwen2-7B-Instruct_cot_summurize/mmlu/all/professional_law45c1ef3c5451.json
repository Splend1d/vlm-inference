In order to sell lottery tickets directly to the public, the agency established outlets throughout the country, including in a particular state. The state levies a general tax on the gross receipts from all gaming operations within the state. The state seeks to tax the agency on the sales of lottery tickets from its outlets within the state. Must the agency pay the state gross receipts tax?\n\nA. No, because a federal agency may not pay any monies to a state without explicit federal statutory authorization to do so.\nB. No, because a state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.\nC. Yes, because it is a generally applicable tax that does not discriminate against the agency.\nD. Yes, because the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities.\n"

No, because a state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.\n\nIn the United States, there is a principle known as the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which holds that the federal government is not subject to taxation by states unless Congress has explicitly authorized such taxation. This principle is grounded in the Constitution's Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2), which establishes the supremacy of federal law over state laws, and the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people.\n\nGiven this constitutional framework, a state cannot impose a tax on the federal government or its agencies without an explicit authorization from Congress. In this case, since the federal agency administering the national lottery was established by a federal statute, and there is no evidence suggesting that Congress has granted the state the authority to tax the agency's operations within the state, the agency would not be required to pay the state's gross receipts tax on the sales of lottery tickets from its outlets within the state."
