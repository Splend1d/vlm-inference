It contributes to the formation of:\n\nA. The neural tube, which later develops into the central nervous system (including the brain and spinal cord.\n\nB. Ectomesenchymal cells, which differentiate into connective tissues like bone, cartilage, and some types of connective tissue that form part of the skeleton and other structures.\n\nC. Dental enamel, the hard outer covering of teeth.\n\nTherefore, the ectoderm plays a crucial role in the development of these diverse structures."
