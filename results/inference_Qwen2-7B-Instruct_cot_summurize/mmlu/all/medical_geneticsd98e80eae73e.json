                    "text": "Angelman syndrome is typically caused by a loss of function in the UBE3A gene, which is located on chromosome 15. This loss of function can occur due to several mechanisms:\n\n- **Maternal Uniparental Disomy ( (UPD) 15**: This occurs when an individual inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from the mother and none from the father. Since the UBE3A gene is imprinted, with paternal alleles being active in the brain and maternal alleles being silenced, having two active maternal copies results in a loss of the paternal gene's function, leading to Angelman syndrome.\n\n- **Deletion in the Paternally Derived Chromosome 15**: This situation involves a deletion that removes the paternal copy of chromosome 15, including the UBE3A gene. This deletion can be inherited or occur spontaneously during meiosis.\n\n- **Mutation in the SNRPN Promoter**: The SNRPN (also known as UBE3A-A1, is another gene located on chromosome 15 that plays a role in the imprinting of the UBE3A gene. Mutations in the SNRPN promoter can lead to reduced expression of UBE3A, contributing to Angelman syndrome.\n\nTherefore, all of the options provided (A. Maternal UPD 15, B. Paternal UPD 15, and C. Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15, can result in Angelman syndrome, but it's important to note that D. A mutation in the SNRPN promoter, while related, might not directly cause Angelman syndrome in the same way the others do, as it affects the regulation of UBE3A expression rather than its direct loss."
