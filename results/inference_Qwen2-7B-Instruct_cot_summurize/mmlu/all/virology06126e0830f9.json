East Coast, B. Central United States (Kansas, Missouri etc., C. Southern California, or D. Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho. Instead, the risk tends to be more widespread across the country and influenced by multiple factors including access to healthcare, drug use patterns, and local public health initiatives.\n\nHowever, certain regions-specific trends might exist based on local conditions and public health statistics. For example, some regions might have higher rates due to specific public health challenges like limited access to clean needles, higher rates of injection drug use, or concentrated populations at higher risk for HIV transmission.\n\nTo get the most accurate information about current risks, it would be best to consult the latest reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( (CDC) or similar national health agencies that provide detailed data on HIV prevalence and trends across different states and regions in the U.S."
