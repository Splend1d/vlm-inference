A long-time customer of the drug store presented a prescription to the pharmacist for the medication Clinoril, which was prescribed by her physician to treat her arthritic condition. The pharmacist was in a rush that day because of a backlog of prescriptions to fill, and he misread the customer's prescription. He filled her prescription with Clinitest, a caustic substance not for internal use. He labeled the container with the instructions for Clinoril: \"Take one tablet twice a day. \"The customer followed the instructions, consumed the Clinitest, and suffered severe injuries to her stomach and esophagus. If the customer brings a strict liability in tort action against the pharmacist, what is his best defense?\n\nA. It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.\nB. He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.\nC. He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.\nD. The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.\n"

He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.\n\nIn a strict liability in tort case, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant had a duty of care, breached that duty, and caused damages as a result of the breach. The best defense for the pharmacist in this scenario would likely revolve around demonstrating that they took reasonable care in fulfilling their duties as a pharmacist.\n\nReasoning:\n\nA. It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication. - This option does not address the issue of whether the pharmacist fulfilled their professional responsibilities adequately or not. It focuses on the transaction process rather than the actual handling of the prescription.\n\nB. He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed. - This option could be argued against, as the pharmacist is indeed involved in selling (or dispensing) medications within the context of their profession.\n\nC. He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances. - This option acknowledges that the pharmacist did fulfill their duties with due care, despite the error. By showing that they made a mistake but took all necessary precautions, the pharmacist can argue that they were not negligent.\n\nD. The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls. - This option shifts the focus away from the pharmacist's responsibility and onto the manufacturer, which might not be the best defense for the pharmacist since they are directly responsible for dispensing the correct medication.\n\nGiven these options, C. He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances, is the most plausible defense for the pharmacist, as it directly addresses the issue of negligence and the standard of care expected of a professional pharmacist."
