Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny\u2026We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\"\nSim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819\nThe author of this text expresses a belief in which of the following as requirements for a properly functioning legal system?\n\nA. Truth and religion\nB. Freedom and democracy\nC. Intelligence and order\nD. Morality and justice\n"

Morality and justice\n\nSim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, in his message to the Congress of Angostura, emphasizes the importance of morality and justice as the foundations of a legal system. He argues that laws must be inflexible (beneficent austerity, proper morals, and the practice of justice are essential for maintaining liberty and happiness. He criticizes those who use illusion instead of reality, license instead of liberty, and treachery instead of patriotism. He believes that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants because it is more inflexible and ensures that everyone submits to its benefits. Therefore, the correct answer is D, morality and justice."
