Sexual selection and parental investment\n\nThese theories are central to understanding how mating strategies and reproductive behaviors have evolved in different species. \n\n1. Sexual Selection: This theory, proposed by Charles Darwin, focuses on the role of competition between individuals of the same sex (usually males competing for mates. It explains traits like elaborate displays, fighting abilities, or resource accumulation that are advantageous for attracting mates.\n\n2. Parental Investment: This theory emphasizes the importance of the time, energy, and resources parents invest in raising their offspring. It suggests that traits and behaviors that enhance survival and development of offspring can be favored by natural selection. For example, monogamy may evolve when both partners contribute significantly to offspring care.\n\nTogether, these theories help explain a wide range of mating behaviors and strategies observed across different species, from birds and mammals to insects."
