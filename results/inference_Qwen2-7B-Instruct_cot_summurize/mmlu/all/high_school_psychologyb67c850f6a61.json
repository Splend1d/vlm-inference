Difference threshold.\n\nDifference threshold, also known as the just noticeable difference (JND), refers to the smallest amount of change in stimulation that a person can detect. In this context, it explains why people can typically tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi because their taste buds can detect subtle differences in flavor or ingredients. \n\nSubliminal perception (A) refers to stimuli that are too weak to be consciously perceived, which does not explain how people can generally distinguish between Coke and Pepsi. \n\nAbsolute threshold, B), is the minimum level of stimulation required for a person to perceive a stimulus, which doesn't necessarily explain the ability to differentiate between two similar products like Coke and Pepsi.\n\nSignal detection theory, C), deals with the ability to discriminate between relevant (signals vs irrelevant (noise) information, but it doesn't specifically address the human sensory ability to detect small differences in taste between Coke and Pepsi."
