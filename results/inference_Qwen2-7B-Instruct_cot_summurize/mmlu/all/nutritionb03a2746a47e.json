Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin and therefore is most active following meal consumption\n\nAfter a meal, especially one rich in carbohydrates, there is an increase in insulin secretion. Insulin activates lipoprotein lipase ( (LPL), which is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue. This activation leads to increased hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins, such as chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins ( (VLDLs). The breakdown of these lipoproteins releases free fatty acids (FFAs) into the circulation.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Consumption of a meal does not typically lead to suppression of lipase activity within adipose tissue. Instead, it results in an increase in insulin levels, which promotes lipolysis via LPL activity.\n\nC. During the postprandial period, the synthesis of VLDL is actually enhanced because excess glucose is converted into glycerol and then into diacylglycerol, which can be used to synthesize triglycerides in the liver and other tissues, including adipose tissue. This process leads to the formation of VLDL particles rather than their suppression. \n\nTherefore, option B accurately describes the typical metabolic response to a meal consumption."
