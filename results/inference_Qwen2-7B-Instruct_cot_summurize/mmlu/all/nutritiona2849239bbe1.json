Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) from its presence in food is less than its ADI\n\nFood additives are considered safe when their exposure levels in the body, estimated through consumption, are below the Acceptable Daily Intake ((ADI). The ADI is the amount of a substance that can be ingested daily for an entire lifetime without appreciable health risk. It's a guideline used by regulatory agencies to ensure safety.\n\nWhile all options have some relevance to the safety evaluation of food additives, option B directly corresponds to the standard criterion used by regulatory bodies like the FDA and EFSA to assess the safety of food additives. This criterion ensures that the levels of exposure to the additive are kept low enough to avoid any potential health risks. \n\nOptions A, C, and D are important considerations as well:\n\nA. No evidence of human toxicity has been observed over the period of its use: This means that there have been no reported cases of adverse effects or toxicity in humans who have consumed the additive over a certain period. However, this does not guarantee absolute safety, especially if the use period is limited or if long-term studies are not available.\n\nC. Its toxic effect is observed only at doses 100x the EDI: This suggests that the additive is safe even at much higher doses compared to what is typically consumed. However, this doesn't account for potential cumulative effects of other additives or interactions with other substances.\n\nD. Its benefits outweigh its risks: This principle is more related to the overall risk-benefit analysis of using a food additive. It considers not only the immediate health effects but also the nutritional value, functionality, and other benefits the additive provides to food products. While important, it's not the sole criterion for determining safety."
