This action is clearly morally wrong because it directly endangers the health and possibly life of the children, violating their right to receive necessary medical treatment.\n\nScenario 2 involves assigning judges who were randomly chosen in a debate competition. This action is not morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards, as it is a fair and standard practice in organizing competitive events to ensure impartiality and fairness. The debater's desire to win does not justify manipulating the process in a way that could unfairly disadvantage competitors."
