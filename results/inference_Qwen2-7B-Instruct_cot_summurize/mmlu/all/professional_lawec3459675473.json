The man moved a giant magnolia tree from another section of his property and had it replanted on his property at a spot just 10 feet from the woman's property. At that time, the woman protested that by locating the tree so close to her land, the man was increasing the risk of injury to the woman's greenhouse, in which the woman cultivated prizewinning flowers. Hurricanes are quite common in the area. Severalyears after the replanting of the tree, in the midst ofa hurricane, the tree fell on the woman's greenhouse,destroying rare and valuable plants valued at$25,000. The woman asserted a claim against the man to recover damages for the harm caused by the tree falling on the greenhouse. During trial, the only evidence the woman presented was that the hurricane uprooted the tree, causing it to fall onto her property, and thereby resulting in the damage as claimed. At the end of the woman's case, the man moved for a directed verdict. The man's motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the woman did not produce any evidence to show that the man was negligent.\nB. granted, because the woman's damages resulted from an act of God.\nC. denied, because hurricanes were common in the area.\nD. denied, because the trier of fact may still infer liability for trespass.\n"

The man's motion for a directed verdict would typically be denied if there is sufficient evidence that could allow the jury or judge to infer that the man was negligent in planting the tree too close to the woman's property, even though the hurricane was a natural event. The fact that hurricanes are common in the area does not necessarily absolve the man of liability if it can be shown that he acted negligently in placing the tree near the woman's greenhouse. \n\nNegligence might be inferred based on factors such as the size and potential danger of the tree, the proximity to the woman's property, and whether the man took reasonable steps to secure the tree or warn the woman about its potential risks. The jury would have the discretion to consider these factors and potentially find the man liable for trespass, which is the unlawful entry onto someone else's property, even if the entry was unintentional and caused by a natural disaster."
