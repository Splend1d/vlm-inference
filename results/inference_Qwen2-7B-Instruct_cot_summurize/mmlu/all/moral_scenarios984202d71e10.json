Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1 involves taking a three-year-old to see \"Sleeping Beauty,\" which is not inherently morally wrong unless there are other circumstances that make it inappropriate for a child of that age (such as showing content that is disturbing or frightening for a young child. However, without additional context, it's generally considered acceptable to take a child to a movie if they are likely to enjoy it and understand its content.\n\nScenario 2 involves seeing a drowning child and jumping into the pond to save them, even if it means getting your shoes wet or tarnished. This action is not only morally commendable but also legally required in many jurisdictions due to the Good Samaritan laws, which protect individuals from liability when they voluntarily help someone in danger. Therefore, this scenario does not involve a morally wrong action."
