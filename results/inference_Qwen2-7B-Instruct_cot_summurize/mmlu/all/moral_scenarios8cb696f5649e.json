Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, sticking a knife in someone else's scabbard is generally considered inappropriate and potentially dangerous, especially if it is a sacred or personal item. This action could be seen as disrespectful, potentially harmful, and possibly illegal depending on the context (for example, if the scabbard was part of cultural or religious significance. Therefore, this scenario involves a morally wrong act.\n\nIn Scenario 2, running a comb through one's own husband's hair is not typically viewed as a morally wrong act. While it may be an unusual or surprising action, it doesn't necessarily infringe upon the rights or well-being of another person. However, it might be considered disrespectful or inappropriate depending on the context, such as if the husband had asked for privacy or disliked having his hair combed. Nevertheless, in general terms, it is not seen as a clear violation of moral standards.\n\nSo the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong."
