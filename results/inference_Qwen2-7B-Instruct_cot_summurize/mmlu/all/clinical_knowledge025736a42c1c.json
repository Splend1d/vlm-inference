Back pain is not an uncommon complaint; in fact, it is one of the most common reasons people seek medical care.\n- B. Schober's test is actually designed to assess the mobility of the thoracic spine, not the lumbar spine.\n- C. Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that typically causes stiffness and decreased mobility of the spine, not increased mobility.\n- D. During pregnancy, the body undergoes various hormonal changes which can lead to a temporary flattening or loss of the natural curve (lordosis) of the lower back, as the pelvis widens to accommodate the growing fetus. This is a normal physiological change."
