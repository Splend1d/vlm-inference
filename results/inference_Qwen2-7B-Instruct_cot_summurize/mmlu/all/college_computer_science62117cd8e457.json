This means that each set contains three ways (or ways), and when a word from main memory is accessed, it is placed in one of these three locations based on its address. This increases the hit rate compared to a direct-mapped cache, as there are more chances for a word to find an empty location within its set.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. one in which each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations"
