(F \u2022 L) \u2022 ~C\n\nExplanation:\n- F represents \"likes fish\"\n- L represents \"likes lizards\"\n- C represents \"likes cats\"\n\nThe sentence states that Brittany likes both fish and lizards (F \u2022 L) and also does not like cats (~C). The correct symbolization should capture these two conditions simultaneously, which is represented by the conjunction operator '\u2022' between the two conditions.\n\nOption A: F \u2022 L \u2022 ~C incorrectly includes an additional conjunction with the negation, suggesting that all three conditions ( liking fish, liking lizards, and not liking cats are true at the same time.\nOption C: (F \u2022 L) \u2228 ~C uses the disjunction operator '\u2228', meaning that either Brittany likes fish and lizards or she does not like cats. This does not accurately capture the intended meaning that she likes both fish and lizards specifically, while not liking cats.\nOption D: C \u2022 (F \u2022 L) incorrectly places the negation before the conjunction, suggesting that Brittany likes cats and also likes both fish and lizards, which contradicts the original sentence."
