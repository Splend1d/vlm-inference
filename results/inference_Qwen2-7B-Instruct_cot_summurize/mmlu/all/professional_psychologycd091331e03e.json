The readiness level is determined by two factors: ability and motivation. \n\n- Ability refers to the skills and knowledge needed to perform a task.\n- Motivation refers to the willingness or desire to perform a task.\n\nWhen dealing with subordinates who have low ability but high motivation, a participative ( or democratic style of leadership is recommended. This style involves involving team members in decision-making processes, giving them responsibilities, and encouraging their input. It helps build skills and confidence while still maintaining a sense of direction and purpose from the leader.\n\nOptions A, C, and D describe situations where different leadership styles would be more appropriate:\n\n- A. For subordinates with low ability and low motivation, a telling or directing style might be more effective, providing clear instructions and guidance.\n- C. For those with high ability but low motivation, an empowering style can be beneficial, allowing autonomy and setting challenging goals.\n- D. For those with both high ability and high motivation, a delegating style might be most suitable, as they require minimal supervision and can take on significant responsibilities."
