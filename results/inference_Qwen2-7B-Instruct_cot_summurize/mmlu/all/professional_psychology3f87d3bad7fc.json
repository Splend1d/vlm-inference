In a scattergram, this would appear as a pattern where the spread of points around the regression line changes as you move along the x-axis (the predictor variable. This is in contrast to homoscedasticity, where the spread of residuals is consistent across all levels of the predictor variable.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to heteroscedasticity:\nA. The shape of the relationship (whether it can be described by a straight line or not, depends on whether there's a linear correlation, which is separate from the issue of variance consistency.\nB. A restriction of range refers to the data being limited within a narrow interval, which is unrelated to the variance of errors across different predictor values.\nD. A statistically significant correlation indicates that there is a relationship between variables, but does not specify whether the variance of one variable is consistent across the range of another."
