The gravitational force, because by F = GMm/r^2, the force of the table on the wood at that close range is sufficient to balance the force of the Earth on the wood.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **Electric Force**: This force is significant between charged particles, but the nuclei and outer electrons of atoms are so far apart that their electrical forces are negligible compared to the gravitational force. The electric forces described in options A and C do not play a significant role in holding the table and the wooden block together.\n\n- **Gravitational Force**: This force acts between any two masses. In this scenario, the mass of the table (M, is attracting the mass of the wooden block (m. The gravitational force between them is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation: \\(F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the table, m is the mass of the wooden block, and r is the distance between their centers. At the microscopic level of an atom, r would be much smaller than the size of the table or the wooden block, making the gravitational force significant enough to hold the block in place against its weight.\n\n- **Strong Nuclear Force**: This force binds protons and neutrons together within the nucleus of an atom, which is not relevant to the interaction between the table and the wooden block at a macroscopic scale.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that it is the gravitational force that keeps the wooden block in place on the table, as it balances the downward force of gravity acting on the block."
