Since it takes 20 years for light to travel from the exploding star to Earth, gravitational waves from the same event would also take 20 years or more to reach us. This is because both light and gravitational waves travel at the same speed (the speed of light, which is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. Therefore, even though gravitational waves are thought to propagate slightly faster than light in some theoretical models, the difference is negligible for such vast distances and the time frame involved here is within our understanding based on current physics."
