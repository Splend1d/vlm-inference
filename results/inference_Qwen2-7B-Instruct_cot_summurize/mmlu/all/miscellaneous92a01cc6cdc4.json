However, as of that time, there was no specific statistic for the exact number of cups of coffee consumed in the United States in the past week in 2013. \n\nThe most recent data from the National Coffee Association suggests that in 2020, Americans consumed an average of about 1.8 cups of coffee daily. To estimate weekly consumption, you would multiply this by 7 days:\n\n\\[1.8 \\, \\text{cups/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days/week} = 12.6 \\, \\text{cups/week/person}\\]\n\nAssuming the population of the United States is around 330 million and extrapolating this daily average to weekly consumption gives us:\n\n\\[12.6 \\, \\text{cups/week/person} \\times 330 \\, \\text{million people} = 4,158 \\, \\text{billion cups/week}\\]\n\nThis calculation vastly exceeds the options provided, indicating the data might not be available or the estimation process needs adjustment given the options. For a precise answer, you would need to consult more recent data sources or statistical studies on coffee consumption in the U.S.\n\nGiven the choices provided:\n- A. 300 million cups per week seems too low.\n- B. 1 billion cups per week seems plausible but still likely underestimates the actual consumption based on the average daily consumption rate.\n- C. 3 billion cups per week is also likely an underestimate.\n- D. 9 billion cups per week is the only option that could potentially align with the high-end of the estimated range based on the average daily consumption.\n\nWithout current data, it's challenging to definitively select the correct answer, but D. 9 billion cups per week is the most reasonable choice among the provided options based on the estimation method used. Please verify with the latest available statistics for the most accurate information."
