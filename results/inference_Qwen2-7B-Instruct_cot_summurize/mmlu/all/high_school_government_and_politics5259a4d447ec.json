                    "text": "C. Voting participation for racial minority voters has increased. \n\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a landmark piece of federal legislation in the United States that aimed to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote as guaranteed under the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution. It led to significant increases in voter registration and turnout among racial minorities, especially in the South. \n\nOptions A, B, and D are as you've stated:\n\nA. States have been prohibited from establishing voter identification requirements - This is not directly a result of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, although it did lead to a more robust federal oversight of voting practices in jurisdictions with a history of discrimination.\n\nB. Voters must now pass literacy tests before voting - Literacy tests were indeed used as a barrier to voting, but they were specifically targeted and banned by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which required certain states and localities with a history of discriminatory voting practices to get preclearance from the federal government for any changes to their voting laws or procedures.\n\nD. The voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 - This was achieved through the 26nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1971, which amended the Constitution to set the voting age at 18 for all federal, state, and local elections. This was not part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965."
