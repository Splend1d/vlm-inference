A range of marginal costs over which MR = MC.\n\nExplanation: A kinked demand curve is a type of demand curve that occurs in an oligopoly market structure, where a few firms dominate the market and produce similar products. The characteristics of a kinked demand curve include:\n\n1. **Interdependence of Rivals (**- This means that the actions of one firm can significantly impact the demand faced by other firms in the industry due to the similarity of their products. This interdependence leads to strategic behavior among firms.\n\n2. **Pricing at the Kink** - In a kinked demand curve model, firms typically set prices at the point where marginal revenue ( (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). This is because at this point, any attempt to raise or lower prices will lead to a decrease in total revenue, as the demand is more sensitive above the kink and less sensitive below it.\n\n3. **P < MC** - This condition refers to the fact that firms often operate with prices below their marginal cost. In a kinked demand curve scenario, firms might choose to maintain prices below their marginal cost to deter potential price wars or to avoid losing market share to competitors who might try to undercut prices.\n\n4. **A Range of Marginal Costs over which MR = MC** - While it's true that firms operate at the point where MR = MC, this statement doesn't capture the essence of a kinked demand curve. Instead, what's unique about a kinked demand curve is that there's a \"kink\" or a discontinuity in the elasticity of demand. Before the kink, demand is relatively inelastic, and after the kink, demand becomes more elastic. This discontinuity in elasticity around the price level makes the demand curve look kinked, not that there's a range of marginal costs where MR = MC specifically defines the kinked nature of the curve."
