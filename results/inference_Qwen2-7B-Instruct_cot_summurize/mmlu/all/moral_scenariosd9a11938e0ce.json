In Scenario 2, running over a speed bump while driving might be seen as a minor issue depending on context, but it's generally not considered a morally wrong act unless it leads to an accident or injury, which was not specified. Running over a speed bump could be viewed as reckless or inconsiderate, but not necessarily morally wrong in the absence of causing harm."
