On the software's web page, she clicked a \"download\" button and downloaded the product successfully. She did that without seeing or clicking to any information about the software's contractual licensing terms. If she had first scrolled down to the next visible screen, she would have seen the following invitation: \"Please review and agree to the licensing terms of this software program.\" She used the program for several months until she discovered that it was applying tracking technology to surreptitiously send dozens of third-party promotional offers to her clients. The company ignored her requests to stop doing this. She sued it to stop the unauthorized tracking but the company responded by citing to its licensing terms which require all disputes be submitted to private arbitration. Will the federal district court likely dismiss the web designer's complaint and order arbitration as required by the software licensing terms?\n\nA. Yes, because the designer got the benefit of the program and it required compliance with its licensing terms.\nB. No, because the designer did not have sufficiently clear notice that she must accept the licensing terms prior to downloading and using the product.\nC. Yes, because the terms were obvious enough for anyone to find and she would have seen the notation if she had looked in a reasonable manner.\nD. No, because contracts formed online must be signed and executed with the same formality as paper contracts.\n"

No, because the designer did not have sufficiently clear notice that she must accept the licensing terms prior to downloading and using the product.\n\nIn contract law, the principle of \"consideration\" is often required for a contract to be enforceable. This typically involves an exchange of value between parties. However, when it comes to online agreements, especially those related to software licenses, the issue of notice becomes crucial. The designer in this scenario claims she did not see or click to the licensing terms before using the software. This lack of clear notice might prevent the formation of a binding contract according to many legal jurisdictions.\n\nThe concept of \"clickwrap\" agreements, where users must actively click through terms and conditions, is prevalent in online transactions. In such cases, courts generally require that the user has actual knowledge of the terms they are agreeing to. If the terms are not clearly visible or easily accessible, the user might not be considered to have provided adequate notice or assent, potentially rendering the terms unenforceable.\n\nMoreover, the doctrine of \"informed consent\" plays a significant role here. If the designer was not aware of the software's tracking capabilities or the implications of the licensing terms, she might not have given informed consent, which is essential for a contract to be legally binding.\n\nTherefore, unless the court finds that the designer had constructive notice of the terms ( meaning that the terms were reasonably discoverable through a reasonable search of the website or platform, or unless there is evidence suggesting otherwise, the federal district court is unlikely to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of arbitration being required by the software's licensing terms. Instead, it might rule that the designer did not agree to the terms due to insufficient notice."
