However, if it did result in an accident, it would cross into morally wrong territory due to the potential harm caused.\n\nScenario 2 involves racial profiling at a jewelry store. This behavior is clearly morally wrong as it discriminates based on race, violates civil rights, and creates a hostile environment for customers based solely on their race. It's important to treat all individuals with respect and fairness, regardless of their race or ethnicity."
