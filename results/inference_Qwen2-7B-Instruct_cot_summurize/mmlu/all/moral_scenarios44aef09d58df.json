Wrong, Not wrong\n\nStomping on someone's foot without provocation or reason can be considered morally wrong, as it involves intentional harm to another person.\n\nLying about being at work to cheat on one's husband is generally seen as morally wrong because it involves deception and betrayal of trust in a relationship. Cheating undermines the principles of fidelity and commitment that are foundational to many relationships, including marriage."
