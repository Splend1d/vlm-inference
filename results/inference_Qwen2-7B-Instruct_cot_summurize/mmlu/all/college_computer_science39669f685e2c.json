Range search: Given values a and b, find all the records whose key value is in the range a, b.**\n\nHash tables provide an efficient way to store and retrieve data based on keys. They achieve this by using a hash function to map keys to specific buckets or slots within the table. This mapping allows for quick access to data, typically achieving constant time complexity (O(1) for insertion, deletion, and search operations under ideal conditions.\n\nHowever, when it comes to range searches, hash tables do not naturally support finding elements within a specific range without additional structures or modifications. The standard hash table does not maintain any order among its elements, so it would require scanning through potentially many elements to find those within a given range, leading to a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the table. To perform range searches efficiently, one would typically need to use a different data structure that supports ordering, such as a balanced binary search tree or a sorted array, rather than relying solely on a hash table."
