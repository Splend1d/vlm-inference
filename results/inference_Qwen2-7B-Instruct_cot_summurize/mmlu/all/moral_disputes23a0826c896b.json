Virtue, for Aquinas, is a disposition or character trait that enables a person to act in accordance with reason and reason's ultimate end, which is happiness or beatitudo. Virtues include traits such as justice, courage, temperance, and prudence. \n\nAccording to Aquinas, living a virtuous life is aligned with God's will and thus constitutes the highest form of moral action. Virtue is seen as the mean between two extremes, and it involves habits developed through consistent practice and education. Aquinas argues that virtues are necessary for humans to achieve their ultimate purpose or end, which is to know God and live in harmony with divine law."
