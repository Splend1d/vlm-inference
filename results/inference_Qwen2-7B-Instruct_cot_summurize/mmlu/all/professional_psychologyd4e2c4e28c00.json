Deception is prohibited whether the pain is physical or psychological in nature.\n\nIn research, especially when dealing with human subjects, ethical guidelines strictly prohibit the use of deception that could cause harm, including pain, to participants unless certain strict conditions are met and the research has been approved by an institutional review board (IRB) that considers the risks and benefits. This prohibition applies to both physical and psychological pain because both can have significant impacts on individuals' well-being and autonomy. The ethical frameworks governing research, such as the Belmont Report's principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice, emphasize protecting the rights and welfare of research participants."
