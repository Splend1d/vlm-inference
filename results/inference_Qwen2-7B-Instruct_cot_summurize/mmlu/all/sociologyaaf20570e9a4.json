The ego is the part of the psyche that mediates between the demands of the external world and the internal demands of the id. It operates based on the reality principle, balancing immediate desires ( managed by the id, with the constraints of reality. Therefore, it functions as the rational and practical component of the mind, regulating emotional drives in a way that is realistic and considerate of the environment."
