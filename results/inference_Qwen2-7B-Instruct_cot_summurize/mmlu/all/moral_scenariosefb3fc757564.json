Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, it is generally considered morally wrong for the team's goalie to punch someone, especially after they have scored a goal. Physical violence without justification is not aligned with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, teaching a dragon to perform actions that cause harm to humans could be seen as morally questionable, depending on the context. While the action itself might not necessarily be illegal or directly harmful to an individual, it involves exploiting an animal and causing distress to others (the peasants in this case. However, it's important to note that the concept of \"wrong\" in this scenario is more subjective and open to interpretation compared to the clear-cut morality of the first scenario. The act of teaching a wild animal to harm people can be considered unethical by some, but not universally recognized as morally wrong under current laws and societal norms."
