This might not always be considered morally wrong depending on the context and the severity of the consequences, but it can often be viewed negatively due to the dishonesty involved.\n\nScenario 2 involves taking someone else's property without permission, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards. Borrowing or using someone else's belongings without their consent is typically considered theft or at least a violation of trust. Even if the intention was to return the sweater, the act of taking it without permission is inherently wrong."
