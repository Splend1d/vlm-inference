However, it does not enhance or improve kinesthetic abilities, which refer to one's skills related to body movement and spatial awareness. While hypnosis might indirectly help in enhancing certain physical activities by reducing anxiety or improving focus, it is not a method for directly increasing or improving innate physical abilities."
