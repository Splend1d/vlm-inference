However, the effect on the equilibrium quantity (the point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied) is not necessarily clear-cut and depends on several factors including the price elasticity of demand for DVD players, the availability of substitutes, and the responsiveness of supply.\n\nIf the demand for DVD players is relatively elastic (meaning that a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded), then an increase in demand might lead to a larger increase in quantity demanded than the increase in price, potentially resulting in an increase in equilibrium quantity. Conversely, if the demand is relatively inelastic (meaning that a change in price has a smaller effect on quantity demanded), or if there are few substitutes available, the increase in demand could lead to a greater increase in price than in quantity, causing the equilibrium quantity to decrease.\n\nThe price itself would generally increase due to the higher demand, assuming that supply does not increase proportionally. However, without specific information about the elasticity of demand and supply, it's not possible to definitively predict whether the equilibrium quantity will increase or decrease. Therefore, the correct answer includes the statement that the change in equilibrium quantity is ambiguous."
