A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920\nZamindars had an ability \"to establish a claim to sovereignty\" largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy of\n\nA. religious toleration\nB. universal taxation\nC. martial law\nD. suffrage\n"

Moreland, the Mughal Empire collected revenue through a system where zamindars ( large landholders who often served as intermediaries between the state and peasant farmers - were responsible for collecting taxes from the peasants and forwarding them to the imperial treasury. When a zamindar refused or omitted to pay this revenue, it could be interpreted as a step towards asserting their own sovereignty, as they were no longer acting under the direct authority of the Mughal administration. This act of withholding payment could signify a desire to break away from the dependency on the Mughal Empire and establish their own independent rule. Thus, the policy of universal taxation provided a mechanism for zamindars to challenge their status under the Mughal Empire and potentially assert sovereignty."
