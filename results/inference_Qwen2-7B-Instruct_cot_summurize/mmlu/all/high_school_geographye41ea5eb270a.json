The ashes from the burned plants enrich the soil with nutrients, which can support crops for several years. Eventually, the land becomes depleted of nutrients, and the farmer moves to a new area to start the cycle again.\n\nThis type of agriculture is commonly found in tropical regions, where there is high rainfall and warm temperatures that promote rapid regrowth of vegetation after it has been cleared. Tropical forests provide an ideal environment for shifting cultivation because they have dense vegetation and a wide variety of plant species that can be used for food and fuel. However, this practice can lead to deforestation and soil degradation if not managed properly."
