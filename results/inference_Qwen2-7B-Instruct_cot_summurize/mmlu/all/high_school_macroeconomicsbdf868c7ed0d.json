The slope of this function represents the marginal propensity to consume ( (MPC), which is the fraction of additional income that is spent on consumption. Therefore, the slope of the consumption function is indeed equal to the MPC. \n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because the slope of the consumption function does not equal the marginal propensity to save ( (MPS) or the sum of MPC and MPS. The MPS is actually 1 - MPC, reflectinging the portion of an additional dollar of income that is saved rather than consumed. \n\nOption D is incorrect because when consumers become more pessimistic about the future, they tend to save more (increase in MPS) and spend less, causing the consumption function to shift downward, not upward."
