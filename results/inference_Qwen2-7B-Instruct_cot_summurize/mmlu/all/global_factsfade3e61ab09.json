While this number doesn't directly translate into a percentage of total deaths attributed to suicide, it can be used to estimate that suicide contributed significantly to deaths in Greenland.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 0.90%  \nB. 1.80%  \nC. 3.60%  \nD. 7.20%\n\nWithout precise information on total deaths or suicide rates specifically, we cannot directly choose between these options based solely on the available data. However, considering the suicide rate is quite high compared to many other countries, an option closer to the higher end seems more plausible.\n\nFor a more accurate estimation, one would need to know the total number of deaths in Greenland in 2017 and apply the suicide rate to calculate the percentage. As such, without additional context, it's not possible to definitively select between A, B, C, or D based solely on the information provided. \n\nIn reality, as of my last update, I couldn't find specific 2017 statistics to match exactly with one of those percentages. However, given the high rate mentioned, option C (3.60%, might be the most reasonable choice among those provided, assuming the total death count and suicide numbers align with the given rate when calculated as a percentage. Please note that this is an estimation based on the information available up to my last update and may not reflect the exact situation in 2017."
