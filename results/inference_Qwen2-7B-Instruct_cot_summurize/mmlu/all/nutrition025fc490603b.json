The mRNA formed by transcription of a region of DNA only contains information for the protein to be synthesized.\n\nExplanation:\n- A is incorrect because not all the information in DNA codes for proteins; some DNA sequences do not code for proteins, such as those involved in regulatory functions or those that make up non-coding RNA molecules.\n- C is incorrect because only one strand of DNA is used for transcription, not both. The strand that gets transcribed is usually the one with a specific orientation (either the sense strand or the antisense strand depending on the context.\n- D is partially correct but misleading in its phrasing. The RNA formed by transcription of DNA does indeed undergo modifications before it becomes mature mRNA. These modifications include the addition of a 5' cap, a poly-A tail, and sometimes the removal of introns through a process called splicing. However, the statement inaccurately implies that all RNA is modified into mRNA this way, when in fact, there are other types of RNA that do not undergo splicing, like rRNA and tRNA."
