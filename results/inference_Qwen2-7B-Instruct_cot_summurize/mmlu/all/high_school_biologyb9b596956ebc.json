Placing the substrate and enzyme in a container with double the capacity.\n\nThis choice does not affect the efficiency of the enzyme itself, as it merely changes the volume of the container where the reaction takes place. The efficiency of the enzyme (measured as its catalytic rate under given conditions) should remain constant regardless of the container size.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\nA. Bringing the temperature of the experimental setup from 20\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C could potentially decrease the enzyme's efficiency if the new temperature is outside the optimal range for the enzyme. Enzyme activity typically peaks at a specific temperature and drops off sharply outside this range due to denaturation or loss of structure.\n\nB. Adding an acidic solution to the setup might alter the pH level, which can significantly affect enzyme activity. Many enzymes have a specific pH range within which they function most efficiently; deviations from this range can reduce their efficiency or even cause them to lose activity altogether.\n\nC. Adding substrate but not enzyme would not result in any reaction occurring, as there is no catalyst present to facilitate the conversion of substrate into product. This scenario does not reflect the efficiency of the enzyme but rather indicates a lack of enzyme availability for the reaction."
