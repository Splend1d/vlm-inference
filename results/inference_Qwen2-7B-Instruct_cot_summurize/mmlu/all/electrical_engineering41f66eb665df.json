They provide smooth and easy control: Electric drives can offer precise speed and torque control, making them ideal for applications requiring high accuracy and responsiveness. This feature enables better performance and efficiency compared to traditional mechanical drives.\n\nD. They are simple and reliable: Electric drives typically consist of fewer moving parts than their mechanical counterparts, which reduces the risk of wear and tear, and thus increases reliability. Additionally, they often require less maintenance, leading to lower operational costs over time.\n\nWhile option C ( \"it is cheaper in cost\" might not always be true, the overall cost-effectiveness of electric drives can be a significant factor in their popularity, especially considering factors such as energy efficiency, maintenance costs, and longer lifespan. However, initial investment costs for electric drives might be higher compared to some traditional systems, but the long-term savings can outweigh these expenses."
