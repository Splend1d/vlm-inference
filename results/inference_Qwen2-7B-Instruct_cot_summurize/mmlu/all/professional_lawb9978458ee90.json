Miranda rights are associated with police custody and interrogation, ensuring that individuals understand their rights against self-incrimination before being questioned by law enforcement. In contrast, grand jury proceedings involve the presentation of evidence and testimony by prosecutors to determine if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the target of the investigation. These proceedings do not include the same rights as those provided during police interrogations, such as the right to remain silent or the right to an attorney present."
