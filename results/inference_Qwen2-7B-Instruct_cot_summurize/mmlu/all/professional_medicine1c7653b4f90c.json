Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?\n\nA. Eustachian tube dysfunction\nB. Mucosal edema\nC. Nasal polyps\nD. Oral contraceptive use\n"

Mucosal edema\n\nSinusitis, particularly in this case of acute bacterial sinusitis, is often caused by inflammation and swelling (edema of the mucosal lining within the sinuses. This can be due to a variety of factors including viral infections, allergies, or as seen here, possible bacterial infection. The symptoms like nasal stuffiness, rhinorrhea, and sore throat suggest a possible upper respiratory tract infection which could lead to sinus congestion and inflammation.\n\nOptions A (Eustachian tube dysfunction, C nasal polyps, and D oral contraceptive use are less likely given the context provided:\n\n- A. Eustachian tube dysfunction usually affects the middle ear and can lead to conditions like otitis media, not directly sinusitis.\n- C. Nasal polyps typically cause blockage and obstruction leading to symptoms such as nasal congestion, but are not a common cause for acute bacterial sinusitis unless they are very large and obstructive.\n- D. Oral contraceptive use might influence hormonal changes and potentially affect the immune system, but it is not typically associated with the onset of sinusitis in the way that bacterial infection or inflammation would be.\n\nPlease note that the diagnosis should ideally be made by a healthcare provider after considering all clinical findings and possibly diagnostic tests like imaging or cultures if needed."
