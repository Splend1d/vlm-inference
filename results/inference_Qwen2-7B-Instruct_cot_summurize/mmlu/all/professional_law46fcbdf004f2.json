After an extensive search, he purchased a three-acre undeveloped tract of land for the purpose of developing a small shopping center. At the time the sale was finalized, the developer told his plans to the seller of the three-acre tract, and also mentioned that he was worried whether he had sufficient funds to complete the project. The seller agreed to lend money to the developer to allow for completion of the project. The seller then wrote out the following contract:\"In order to help the developer with his plans for development of a shopping center on the three- acre tract he has this day purchased from me, I will lend him $50,000 at 10 percent interest provided he signs a contract with a builder for construction of the shopping center on this tract. Repayment to me at the rate of $5,000 per year to be secured by a mortgage on the three-acre tract. \"Both parties then signed the contract. The seller's promise to lend $50,000 to the developer is\n\nA. a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.\nB. a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.\nC. a condition subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.\nD. not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.\n"

In this case, the condition precedent is that the developer must sign a contract with a builder for the construction of the shopping center on the three-acre tract.\n\nHowever, the substance of the agreement (i.e., the loan itself and the repayment terms, comes after the developer fulfills the condition precedent (i.e., entering into the construction contract with a builder. This means that the loan is made conditional upon the developer's action (signing the construction contract with a builder, but the actual loan and its repayment terms are part of the broader agreement that follows the fulfillment of the condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract."
