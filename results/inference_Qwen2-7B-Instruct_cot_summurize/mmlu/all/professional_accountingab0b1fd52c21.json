It aims to reduce errors and inaccuracies that might occur with manual timekeeping methods. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Fraudulent reporting of employees' own hours: This system could potentially deter such behavior by making it harder for employees to misrepresent their actual hours worked since they must input their own ID.\n\nB. Errors in employees' overtime computation: The system could minimize this issue by accurately recording when employees start and stop working, reducing the chance of miscalculating overtime based on manual logs.\n\nC. Inaccurate accounting of employees' hours: By automating the clock-in and clock-out process, the risk of human error leading to inaccurate accounting is significantly reduced.\n\nD. Recording of other employees' hours: This exposure might actually be reduced by the system because each employee would need to use their own unique ID to clock in or out, which theoretically prevents one employee from inadvertently recording another's hours.\n\nGiven the options, the new system can be expected to change the exposure \"D. Recording of other employees' hours\" the least. The design of the system inherently addresses this concern by requiring each employee to use their own ID, which should prevent one person from clocking in or out for another."
