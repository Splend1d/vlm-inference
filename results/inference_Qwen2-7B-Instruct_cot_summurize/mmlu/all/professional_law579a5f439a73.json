An assignment of future rights from future contracts is not typically considered an exception to the general rule that contractual rights may be assigned. Future rights refer to rights that will accrue at a later time, and while these might present complexities in terms of timing and fulfillment, they are not usually barred from assignment outright. \n\nIn contrast:\n\nA. An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk is often permissible because it does not fundamentally alter the obligations under the contract.\n\nB. An assignment not allowed by law is clearly an exception, as contractual rights cannot be transferred if such transfer goes against legal prohibitions or restrictions.\n\nD. An assignment that substantially changes the obligor's duty or risk could be seen as problematic because it may alter the fundamental nature of the contract, potentially leading to different expectations and outcomes for the parties involved. Such assignments might require consent from all parties or be subject to specific conditions to ensure fairness and prevent undue hardship on the obligor."
