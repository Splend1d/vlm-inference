This is because the defendant's actions, such as speeding while violating a state law, directly contributed to the death of the victim. Involuntary manslaughter typically occurs when someone unintentionally causes the death of another through reckless or negligent behavior.\n\nVoluntary manslaughter involves a killing that is intentional but done under circumstances that reduce the charge from murder to manslaughter, often due to provocation or a sudden passion that is not premeditated. Murder, on the other hand, involves an intentional and unlawful killing without any mitigating circumstances. Speeding, while illegal, does not usually rise to the level of intent required for murder or voluntary manslaughter."
