A defendant is a service station attendant who knew that the buyer of gasoline was using his product to make explosives for illegal use.\nC. A defendant is a hotel registration clerk who knew that one of his regular guests was using her room for purposes of prostitution.\nD.

As a consequence, the friend is involved in an accident that causes a victim's death.\n\nCriminal liability is least likely to be imposed on the defendant in this situation because it involves civil negligence rather than criminal liability. While the defendant may be liable for damages under civil law, criminal liability (which involves punishment by the state for a violation of criminal law, is less likely to apply here. The actions of the defendant do not directly violate any specific criminal statute that would lead to criminal liability, unless there is also a statute specifically dealing with lending a vehicle to someone knowing they will drive under the influence.\n\nIn contrast, in situations A, B, and C, the defendants had direct knowledge of illegal activities taking place through their businesses or services, making criminal liability more likely as their actions could directly contribute to the commission of the crimes."
