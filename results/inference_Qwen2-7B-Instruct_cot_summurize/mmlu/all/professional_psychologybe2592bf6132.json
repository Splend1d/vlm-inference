If a psychologist becomes aware of an ethical violation of a minor nature by a colleague, they typically have the option to attempt to resolve the problem informally. This could involve discussing the issue with the colleague directly, providing guidance or feedback, and encouraging them to adhere to ethical standards. The goal of informal resolution is to address the issue promptly and privately, potentially avoiding more formal actions like reporting to a professional body or licensing board.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific guidelines and procedures can vary based on the context, such as the severity of the violation, the relationship between the individuals involved, and the specific ethical codes and policies of the relevant professional association or jurisdiction. For definitive advice, one should consult the most recent and detailed guidelines provided by the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA)."
