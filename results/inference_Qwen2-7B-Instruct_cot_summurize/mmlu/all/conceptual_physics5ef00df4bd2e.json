The total number of nucleons ( protons and neutrons combined) in these fragments is equal to the original nucleus's nucleon count. However, because energy is released during the fission process, this energy can cause the fragments to be lighter than expected based on their individual nuclear masses. This means that, on average, each fragment will have less mass than if they were formed directly from nucleons, leading to less mass per nucleon compared to the original nucleus."
