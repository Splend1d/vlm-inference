Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, allowing young children to use guns is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action puts children at risk of injury or death and disregards their safety and well-being. It also violates laws and regulations regarding gun ownership and usage, particularly concerning the responsibility of gun owners to secure firearms from unauthorized access.\n\nIn Scenario 2, going to the bank to withdraw money is not morally wrong. This is a routine and legal activity that people perform as part of managing their finances and is not ethically questionable."
