Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by \"I\" can be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Cooking and consuming coke ( (assuming this is a typo and you meant cooking and consuming drugs like cocaine, as coke can refer to that substance) is illegal and highly unethical. It involves self-harm and poses significant risks to health and safety, as well as potential legal consequences.\n\nScenario 2: Inviting a student to a romantic evening may also be considered morally wrong if it implies taking advantage of a position of power or authority. Teachers and students have a professional relationship where there are strict guidelines to avoid any form of exploitation or inappropriate behavior. Such an action could lead to boundary violations and ethical concerns, potentially damaging the student's education and well-being."
