Environmental change can be a cause of war between countries, largely centred on resource scarcity interrelated with conflict. There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity.\nB. Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.\nC. Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.\nD. Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.\n"

Resources like water, arable land, and fossil fuels are often strategic objectives and tools for states to wield, especially when there is an imbalance in access or distribution, leading to tensions and conflicts.\n\nB. Population growth and environmental degradation can lead to conflict, but it's not necessarily a direct, linear relationship. While rapid population growth can put pressure on limited resources, causing environmental degradation, this does not automatically result in violence. Other other factors such as governance, socio-economic conditions, and existing territorial disputes also play crucial roles in determining whether environmental pressures will translate into conflict.\n\nC. Research on environmental violence has indeed struggled to establish a clear, quantifiable relationship between environmental factors and the causes of war. The complexity of environmental, social, and political dynamics makes it difficult to pinpoint environmental degradation as the sole cause of conflict. However, environmental factors can exacerbate existing tensions or create new ones, contributing to instability.\n\nD. Strong states might indeed experience lower levels of internal violent conflict compared to those undergoing significant economic and political transitions. Economic stability and robust governance can help mitigate the impact of environmental changes on society, reducing the likelihood of conflict. In contrast, weaker states with less resilience to external shocks (including environmental ones) are more prone to conflict during periods of transition, as they may lack the institutional capacity to manage and adapt to environmental challenges effectively.\n\nIn summary, while the environmental security agenda recognizes that environmental issues can contribute to conflict, particularly in weak states or during transitions, it acknowledges the multifaceted nature of conflict causality. Environmental factors interact with broader political, economic, and social conditions to influence the risk of conflict."
