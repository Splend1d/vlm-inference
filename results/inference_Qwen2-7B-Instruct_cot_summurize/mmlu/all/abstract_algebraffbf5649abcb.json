                    "text": "Statement 1 is true. This statement is known as the formula for the index of the product of two subgroups in a group. If \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) are are subgroups of a group \\(G\\), then the number of distinct left cosets of \\(H \\cap K\\) in \\(HK\\) is equal to the ratio of the orders of \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) to the order of their intersection. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\n\\[|HK| = \\frac{|H||K|}{|H \\cap K|}\\]\n\nThis formula comes from the fact that elements of \\(HK\\) can be represented uniquely by products \\(hk\\) where \\(h \\in H\\) and \\(k \\in K\\), but if \\(h_1k_1 = h_2k_2\\), it might be that \\(h_1 = h_2\\) and \\(k_1 = k_2\\) only up to the condition that these elements come from different cosets of \\(H \\cap K\\).\n\nStatement 2 is also true. According to the Sylow Theorems and the properties of groups of order \\(2p\\), where \\(p\\) is an odd prime, such a group is either cyclic ( if there exists an element of order \\(2p\\), which happens when \\(p\\) does not divide the order of any subgroup except itself and the trivial subgroup) or isomorphic to the dihedral group \\(D_p\\) ( which represents the symmetries of a regular \\(p\\)-gon. The dihedral group has order \\(2p\\) and consists of \\(p\\) rotations and \\(p\\) reflections.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
