This subgroup consists of all integer multiples of \\((1,1)\\) under addition modulo 11 and modulo 15. The smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n(1,1) = ( (n,n)\\) is in this subgroup is the least common multiple (LCM of 11 and 15.\n\nSince 11 and 15 are coprime ( they have no common factors other than 1), their LCM is simply their product: \n\n\\[LCM(11,15) = 11 \\times 15 = 165.\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(|(1,1)| = 165\\).\n\nSo the order of the factor group is:\n\n\\[\\frac{11 \\times 15}{165} = \\frac{165}{165} = 1.\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **A. 1**."
