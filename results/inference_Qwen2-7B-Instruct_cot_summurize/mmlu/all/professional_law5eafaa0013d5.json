Although the homeowner and his family lived in the beach house during the summer months, the house was left unoccupied for the remainder of the year. In order to protect the beach house from vandalism while it was vacant, the homeowner installed an automatic spring-gun device. The spring-gun was connected to the front door and calculated to automatically fire at chest level when the door was opened. No warnings were placed on the premises. A local man, knowing that the homeowner's beach house was unoccupied, decided to burglarize the home one evening. When the local man forced open the front door and was about to enter the premises, the spring-gun automatically discharged, killing him instantly. If the homeowner is subsequently prosecuted and charged with the local man's death, the most serious crime for which the homeowner will be found guilty is\n\nA. voluntary manslaughter.\nB. involuntary manslaughter.\nC. murder.\nD. assault with a deadly weapon.\n"

Involuntary Manslaughter.\n\nThe homeowner did not intend to cause harm or death; rather, they intended to deter potential intruders by setting up a device designed to protect their property. However, the use of a lethal device without any warning or reasonable means to avoid unintended harm resulted in the death of the intruder. This scenario typically aligns with the legal definition of involuntary manslaughter, where an individual unintentionally causes someone's death through criminal negligence or reckless behavior."
