N-3 fatty acids\n\nThere is substantial scientific evidence that supports the role of N-3 fatty acids, particularly in the form of omega-3 fatty acids, in the prevention of age-related cognitive decline. These types of fatty acids are found primarily in fish oils and can also be obtained from flaxseeds, walnuts, and other plant sources. Studies have shown that regular consumption of omega-3 fatty acids may help maintain brain health and reduce the risk of cognitive decline associated with aging.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while omega-3 fatty acids may play a role in cognitive health, they are not a cure-all. A balanced diet, regular exercise, mental stimulation, and possibly other lifestyle factors are also crucial for maintaining cognitive function as one ages."
