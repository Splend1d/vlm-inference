During the embryonic period, which typically spans from conception until around the end of the first trimester (about week 12 of pregnancy, the fetus is very vulnerable to external factors. This is when many organs and systems are forming, and exposure to certain substances, such as alcohol, tobacco, or certain medications, can lead to significant developmental issues or even miscarriage.\n\nB. The embryonic period often occurs before a woman knows she is pregnant. Many women do not realize they are pregnant until after the first missed menstrual period, which can be several weeks into the embryonic stage. This makes it crucial for women who might become pregnant to ensure they have adequate nutrition before they know they are pregnant.\n\nC. Interventions made in late pregnancy may indeed be too late to be effective in addressing some preconception issues. For example, if a mother develops gestational diabetes later in her pregnancy, this could potentially have been prevented or managed better with proper nutrition and health practices during the preconception period.\n\nTherefore, all the given options highlight valid reasons for the importance of adequate nutrition during the pre-conception period."
