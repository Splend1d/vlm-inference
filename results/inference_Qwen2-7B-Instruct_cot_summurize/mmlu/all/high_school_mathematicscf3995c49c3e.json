This statement is not always true. A function can be continuous at a point without its derivative existing there. For example, the absolute value function \\(|x|\\) is continuous everywhere, but it does not have a derivative at \\(x = 0\\).\n\nB. This statement is not universally true. The fact that \\(f'(c) = 0\\) indicates that \\(f\\) has a critical point at \\(c\\), which could be a local maximum, minimum, or neither ( (a point of inflection). There are other possibilities for \\(f\\) at \\(c\\) when \\(f'(c) = 0\\).\n\nC. This statement is also not necessarily true. A zero second derivative (\\(f''(c) = 0\\)) only suggests that there might be an inflection point, but it's not definitive. The curvature could change without crossing to the opposite direction, meaning it's not a necessary condition for an inflection point.\n\nD. This statement is true. By definition, if a function \\(f\\) is differentiable at a point \\(x = c\\), it means that the limit defining the derivative \\(\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(c+h) - f(c)}{h}\\) exists. This limit being finite implies that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x = c\\), as continuity requires the limit of the function as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\) equals the function value at \\(c\\), which is exactly what the existence of the derivative guarantees."
