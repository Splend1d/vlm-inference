All of these options.\n\nThe preoccupation with human rights in the human rights-oriented school of liberalism affects it in several ways:\n\nA. **Concern for Self-Determination:** The human rights perspective within liberalism emphasizes the importance of individuals' and communities' autonomy and freedom. This focus often leads to advocacy for self-determination, which means that people should have the right to decide their own political status and freely pursue their economic, social, and cultural development. This principle can be seen as a cornerstone of liberal human rights thinking, influencing policies and international relations.\n\nB. **Advocacy for Separatism:** In situations where there is significant conflict and suffering, the human rights approach might push for separatist movements or solutions if they are seen as necessary to prevent further harm and uphold the rights of marginalized groups. This could manifest in calls for territorial autonomy or independence, especially when such actions are are perceived as a means to protect rights and prevent atrocities.\n\nC. **Focus on Persecuted Groups:** Human rights-oriented liberalism is indeed particularly focused on those who are subject to various forms of persecution, discrimination, and deprivation based on factors such as economic status, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or political beliefs. This focus is driven by the belief that all individuals deserve equal protection under the law and equal respect for their inherent dignity, regardless of their background. It guides the formulation of policies, the design of interventions, and the prioritization of issues in both domestic and international contexts.\n\nThus, each of these options reflects distinct facets of how human rights thinking influences the human rights-oriented school of liberalism."
