The prosecution alleges that he murdered his wife by giving her a massive injection of succinylcholine while she was asleep. Succinylcholine is a drug used in small quantities by anesthesiologists as a muscle relaxant. The prosecution claims that the fatal dose given to the wife so totally relaxed her lung muscles that she suffocated. During the trial, a toxicologist, who had no previous knowledge of the case, sat in court and heard all of the evidence about the wife's death and autopsy. As part of the doctor's defense, his attorney calls the toxicologist to give his opinion on the cause of the wife's death. May the toxicologist so testify?\n\nA. Yes, because he can identify the data upon which his opinion is based.\nB. Yes, because an expert may base his opinion on facts made known to him at the trial.\nC. No, because he has no personal knowledge of the wife's death.\nD. No, because the cause of death is an issue to be decided by the jury.\n"

Yes, because an expert may base his opinion on facts made known to him at the trial.\n\nIn legal proceedings, an expert witness can provide their opinion based on the facts presented during the trial. This includes information about the wife's death and autopsy results, even if the expert did not personally observe or participate in the events leading to the death. The key factor is that the expert has access to sufficient information to form a reasonable opinion, which they can then present to the court. In this case, since the toxicologist has heard all the relevant evidence during the trial, they are within their rights to offer their expert opinion on the cause of death."
