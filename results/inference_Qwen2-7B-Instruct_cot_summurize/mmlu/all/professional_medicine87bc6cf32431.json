Examination shows a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions. Nodes are palpated in the inguinal and femoral areas. A smear of fluid from the lesions establishes the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?\n\nA. Chlamydia trachomatis\nB. Haemophilus ducreyi\nC.

This bacterium is responsible for causing chancroid, which presents with painful ulcers on the genitalia along with symptoms like fever, malaise, and enlarged lymph nodes.\n\nLet's briefly review the other options:\n\nA. Chlamydia trachomatis - This is a common cause of sexually transmitted infections, but it typically presents with less severe symptoms such as vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, or pelvic inflammatory disease. It does not usually present with the described clinical picture of multiple satellite lesions.\n\nC. Neisseria gonorrhoeae - This bacterium causes gonorrhea, another common sexually transmitted infection. Symptoms can include pain during urination, bleeding after intercourse, and yellowish discharge. While it can lead to complications such as urethritis or cervicitis, it generally does not manifest with the specific presentation given here.\n\nD. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A - Also known as Group A Streptococcus, this bacterium can cause strep throat, impetigo, and scarlet fever, among other conditions. However, its presentation would not typically include the specific genital symptoms described in this case.\n\nTherefore, based on the clinical presentation, Haemophilus ducreyi is the most probable answer."
