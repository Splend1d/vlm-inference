This can be seen as exclusionary and potentially hurtful, as it actively discourages people from participating in an event that should ideally be inclusive. It could lead to feelings of loneliness or isolation for the birthday girl, and may also foster a toxic environment where attending such events is questioned based on peer judgment rather than personal interest or availability.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character accidentally placed their son's Nintendo Switch in the dishwasher and started it. While this is a careless mistake, it is not inherently morally wrong. The action could result in damage to the valuable item, but the intent was not to cause harm or destruction. The character might face consequences for the mistake, such as needing to replace the device, but there is no ethical wrongdoing in the act itself unless there is a history of repeated negligence or disregard for property."
