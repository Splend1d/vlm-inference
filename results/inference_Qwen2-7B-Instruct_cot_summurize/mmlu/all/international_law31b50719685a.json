No, even though all peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes, the latter may also spring from treaties regulating objective regimes or unilateral acts\n\nPeremptory norms, or jus cogens norms, are indeed a category of international law that sets out obligations erga omnes, meaning they are owed by each member of the international community to the entire international community. However, obligations erga omnes can also arise from other sources, including specific treaty provisions that create binding obligations for states towards the international community as a whole, and unilateral acts ( such as declarations or assurances given by states to the international community. Therefore, while peremptory norms are one source, they are not the only source of obligations erga omnes in international law."
