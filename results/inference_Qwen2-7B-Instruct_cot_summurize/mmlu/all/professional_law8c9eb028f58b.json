                    "text": "A state has enacted a party affiliation statute prohibiting a person from being an independent candidate in a general election if she had either (1) registered with a political party during the year prior to the immediately preceding primary, or (2) voted in that primary. The state adopted the so-called \"disaffiliation\" statute in order to have intraparty feuds resolved in primary elections rather than in the general election. Moreover, the state's elections director strongly supported the law and argued that it was necessary to avoid voter confusion and to ensure that the general election winner received a majority. A man, who was a registered Democrat in 2008, now wishes to run as an independent candidate in the November, 2009, general election. However, the elections director ruled that his candidacy violated the state's \"disaffiliation\" statute and barred him from appearing on the ballot. If the man files suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state's election statute, which of the following best states the burden of persuasion?\n\nA. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further an important state interest under equal protection analysis.\nB. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further a compelling state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\nC. The man must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\nD. The man must demonstrate under fundamental rights analysis that the state has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position.\n"

The man must demonstrate under fundamental rights analysis that the state has has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position.\n\nWhen a plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of a law affecting fundamental rights, such as the right to vote, they typically bear the burden of proving that the law is unconstitutional. In this case, since the man is challenging the constitutionality of a state election statute that affects his right to run as an independent candidate, he would need to prove that the statute infringes upon his fundamental rights.\n\nUnder a fundamental rights analysis, the man would need to show that the disaffiliation statute places a substantial burden on his ability to exercise his fundamental right to vote and run for office as an independent candidate. He would then need to argue that the state has not provided a compelling justification for the statute and that there are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the same goal without infringing on his fundamental rights. This would involve demonstrating that the statute is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest and that there are reasonable alternatives that would allow independent candidates to participate in the election process without violating the state's interests in resolving intraparty disputes and avoiding voter confusion."
