DVDs are a normal luxury good.\n\nThe income elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a product changes in response to a change in consumer income. A positive income elasticity (like +1.5 indicates that DVDs are a normal good: as people's incomes rise, they tend to buy more DVDs. The magnitude of the elasticity (+1.5) tells us the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to income changes - in this case, a 10% increase in income leads to a 15% increase in consumption of DVDs. This makes DVDs a luxury good because their demand increases at a faster rate than income."
