We want to find the shortest time interval that contains 100,000 out of 150,000 riders, which means we're looking for an interval that contains \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the total riders since \\(100,000/150,000 = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nGiven a normal distribution, the middle \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the data falls within approximately \\(\\pm \\Phi^{-1}(2/3)\\) standard deviations from the mean, where \\(\\Phi^{-1}\\) is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution. The value of \\(\\Phi^{-1}(2/3)\\) is approximately 0.475.\n\nTherefore, the interval around the mean that contains \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the riders is:\n\n\\[ \\mu \\pm \\sigma \\times \\Phi^{-1}(2/3) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ 35 \\pm 10 \\times 0.475 \\]\n\\[ 35 \\pm 4.75 \\]\n\nThis gives us two intervals:\n- Lower bound: \\( 35 - 4.75 = 30.25 \\) minutes\n- Upper bound: \\( 35 + 4.75 = 39.75 \\) minutes\n\nRounding to one decimal place for practical purposes, the interval becomes \\( 31.7 \\) to \\( 39.3 \\) minutes.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. 31.7 to 39.3 minutes**."
