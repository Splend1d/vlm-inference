Therefore, if the original wavelength was \\( \\lambda \\), the new wavelength \\( \\lambda' \\) is \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\).\n\nThe new separation \\( y' \\) between the bright fringes can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ y' = \\frac{D(\\lambda/2)}{d} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{D\\lambda}{d} = \\frac{1}{2}y \\]\n\nSince the original separation \\( y \\) is 1.0 mm, the new separation \\( y' \\) would be half of that, which is:\n\n\\[ y' = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.0 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.5 \\, \\text{mm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 0.5 mm**."
