We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong.\n\nDavid Hume's attack on natural law theory is grounded in his philosophical skepticism, particularly concerning our ability to have objective knowledge of the external world and morality. Hume argues that reason alone cannot justify morality; it can only serve as a guide for our passions and desires. He famously stated that \"reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.\" In other words, according to Hume, moral principles are not derived from reason but from sentiments, feelings, and emotions that we experience.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nB. The directionality of natural law ( (whether it is forward-looking or backward-looking) is not central to Hume's critique. His main point is more about the nature of moral knowledge itself rather than its temporal orientation.\nC. The concept of a social contract is not directly addressed by Hume's attack on natural law. Hume himself did discuss the social contract in his work \"Of the Original Contract,\" but his critique of natural law is more about the epistemological basis of moral claims.\nD. Hume's attack does not specifically address the protection of the state against attacks, which seems to be more related to political philosophy rather than his critique of natural law theory."
