He also has had fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting since he returned from summer camp 2 days ago. His parents say he does not use illicit drugs. On arrival, he is combative and there is evidence of hallucinations. His temperature is 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. A lumbar puncture is performed. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis show cysts and trophozoites. The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is which of the following?\n\nA. Facial nerve\nB. Frontal sinus\nC. Mastoid sinus\nD. Olfactory nerve\n"

Mastoid sinus\n\nThe symptoms described - confusion, agitation, fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting - are typical of meningitis, a condition often caused by bacteria or fungi entering the central nervous system through various pathways. The presence of cysts and trophozoites in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests a parasitic infection such as toxoplasmosis, which can enter the brain through the bloodstream and infect the central nervous system, including potentially through the mastoid sinuses. The mastoid sinuses are small air-filled spaces within the mastoid process of the temporal bone, which can communicate with the bloodstream and thus serve as a potential route for infection.\n\nThe other options listed do not typically serve as primary entry points for pathogens into the central nervous system:\n\nA. Facial nerve - while it can carry some pathogens, it is not typically a significant portal of entry for central nervous system infections.\nB. Frontal sinus - although it is an air-filled cavity that communicates with the nasal cavity, it is less commonly associated with direct entry into the central nervous system than the mastoid sinuses.\nD. Olfactory nerve - serves as a sensory pathway but does not directly contribute to the entry of pathogens into the central nervous system in the same way the sinuses do.\n\nPlease note that medical diagnosis and treatment should always be handled by a qualified healthcare professional."
