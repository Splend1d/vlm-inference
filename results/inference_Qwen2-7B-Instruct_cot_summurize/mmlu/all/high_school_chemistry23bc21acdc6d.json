It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or error in the calculation or the options provided. The correct answer based on the calculation process would be closest to option C (4.4 \u00d7 10^-3 M, but this is an approximation and the precise value calculated here is significantly higher than any of the choices given. Please review the question and the provided options for accuracy."
