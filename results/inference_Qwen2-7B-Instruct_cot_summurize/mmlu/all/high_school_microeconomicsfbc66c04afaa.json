Simultaneously, if the demand for roses rises, it means that consumers want to buy more roses at every given price, shifting the demand curve to the right.\n\nIn this scenario, since both the demand and supply curves have shifted, we need to consider their relative positions to determine the outcome:\n\n1. **Demand Shifts Right, Supply Shifts Left**: This results in a higher equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity because the increase in demand pushes prices up, but the decrease in supply limits how much quantity increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Price rises, but the change in quantity is ambiguous. \n\nThe ambiguity in the quantity comes from the fact that while the demand shift suggests an increase in quantity (since demand has increased, the supply shift suggests the opposite (since supply has decreased. In reality, the actual quantity will be somewhere between the original equilibrium quantity and the new lower quantity due to the decrease in supply, assuming demand eventually adjusts to the new equilibrium. However, without further information on how quickly demand adjusts, we cannot definitively state whether the quantity will rise or fall; thus, the term \"ambiguous\" is used to describe the quantity's direction."
