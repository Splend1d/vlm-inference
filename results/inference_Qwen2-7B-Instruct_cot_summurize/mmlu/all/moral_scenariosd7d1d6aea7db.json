Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, helping a friend escape a POW camp can be seen as a morally right action depending on the context and the specific laws or norms of the situation. If the individual is part of a resistance movement against an oppressive regime, aiding in the escape could potentially be justified under certain moral frameworks, especially if the person being helped is being imprisoned unjustly.\n\nIn Scenario 2, agreeing with your son that he is \"worthless\" is likely considered morally wrong. This type of affirmation can have serious negative impacts on self-esteem and mental health, particularly from a parent figure who should ideally provide support and encouragement. Encouraging such feelings goes against the moral standard that individuals should be treated with respect and dignity, and that one's worth should not be diminished by parental statements."
