Matched pairs comparison of population means\n\nThis scenario involves comparing two conditions (oil with the additive and oil without the additive) for the same group of engines (before and after treatment). Therefore, the most appropriate statistical test would be a matched pairs comparison of population means, which allows us to assess the difference in means between the paired observations.\n\nHere's why the other options are not suitable:\n\nA. Matched pairs comparison of population proportions: This method is used when you're dealing with binary outcomes (yes/no, success/failure) instead of continuous measurements like lifespan or performance metrics.\n\nC. Independent samples comparison of population proportions: This would be used if we were comparing two completely separate groups, which doesn't seem to be the case here as each engine is being tested under both conditions.\n\nD. Independent samples comparison of population means: This method would be used if we had two distinct groups of engines, but since each engine is being tested under both conditions, this isn't applicable either."
