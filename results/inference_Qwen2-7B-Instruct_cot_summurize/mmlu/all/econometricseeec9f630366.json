They use a different method of transforming the model so that the probabilities lie between zero and one\n\nBoth logit ( (logistic regression) and probit models are used for binary response regression analysis, where the dependent variable has two possible outcomes. They transform the linear combination of independent variables into a probability using different link functions: the logit model uses the logistic function and the probit model uses the cumulative normal distribution function.\n\nB. The statement \"The logit model can result in too many observations falling at exactly zero or exactly one\" is incorrect. This issue is more related to data limitations or model specification rather than an inherent property of the logit model itself. Both logit and probit models do not predict exact zeros or ones unless there is perfect prediction in the data or if the model is misspecified.\n\nC. The statement \"For the logit model, the marginal effect of a change in one of the explanatory variables is simply the estimate of the parameter attached to that variable, whereas this is not the case for the probit model\" is also incorrect. In both logit and probit models, the marginal effect of a change in one of the explanatory variables is not equal to the parameter estimate. Instead, it depends on the value of the explanatory variables and requires calculation through the derivative of the link function with respect to the explanatory variable.\n\nD. The statement \"The probit model is based on a cumulative logistic function\" is incorrect. The probit model is based on a cumulative normal distribution function, while the logit model is based on a logistic function.\n\nTherefore, only statement A accurately describes a correct distinction between logit and probit models."
