While humor is subjective, mocking someone's attempt at humor might be considered unkind or hurtful, depending on the context and the relationship between the individuals involved. This action could be viewed as morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThrowing nuts to squirrels from a distance, however, is generally not considered morally wrong. It is an action that could potentially benefit the squirrels by providing them with food. However, it's important to ensure that this action doesn't harm the squirrels or their environment in any way, such as by causing disturbance or pollution. Assuming this action is harmless, it would not typically be considered morally wrong."
