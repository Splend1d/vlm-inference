Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, giving your girlfriend's mom a birthday thong without her consent or knowledge can be considered disrespectful and inappropriate, especially if it's an intimate item. This action might violate her privacy and comfort, which goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, making an effort to speak louder and step closer to your stepmom who is hard of hearing is not only a kind gesture but also a reasonable accommodation for her needs. It shows consideration and respect for her condition, aligning with moral standards that promote inclusivity and support for individuals with disabilities.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 does not."
