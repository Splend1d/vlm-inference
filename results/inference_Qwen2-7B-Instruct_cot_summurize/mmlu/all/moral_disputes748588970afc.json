It assumes that the economic parts of the biotic system will function without the uneconomic parts.\n\nLeopold believed in a holistic approach to conservation that considered not just economic benefits but also ecological health and the intrinsic value of all living things. A system that bases conservation solely on economic motives might overlook the importance of preserving areas or species that do not immediately contribute to human economic gain but are crucial for ecosystem balance and biodiversity. This approach can lead to the neglect of uneconomic parts of the biotic system, potentially causing long-term ecological damage."
