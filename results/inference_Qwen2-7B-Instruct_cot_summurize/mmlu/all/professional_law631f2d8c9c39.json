He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.\n\nA. No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\nB. No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.\nC. Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.\nD. Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.\n"

No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nIn lien theory states, a mortgage does not create a security interest in real property but rather secures a debt based on the value of the property. When two people own property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, upon one's death, the property automatically transfers to the surviving joint tenant(s) without the need for probate or any other legal process. The existence of a mortgage does not change this automatic transfer of property rights at death under lien theory.\n\nThe bank cannot execute on the mortgage to gain possession of the property because the joint tenancy has not been legally severed or altered through the mortgage lien. The property still belongs to the surviving joint tenant(s) by virtue of the joint tenancy agreement and the laws of lien theory in the jurisdiction where the property is located."
