It seems there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting the answer choices or the question itself, as the calculation based on the provided data leads to a different conclusion than what's offered.\n\nGiven the correct interpretation and calculations:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{ROA}}{\\text{Asset Turnover}} = \\frac{10\\%}{4} = 2.5\\% \\]\n\nNone of the options A, B, C, or D directly match this result. However, considering the context and aiming for the closest match under typical business metrics understanding, the correct choice should reflect a percentage close to our calculated 2.5%. Given the format of the question and the options provided, none of them directly matches the precise calculation result.\n\nIf we were to interpret the question or options more broadly, recognizing potential errors in either the question setup or the answer choices, the closest option to our calculation would be:\n\nD. 0.025\n\nThis option represents the decimal equivalent of 2.5%, which could be considered the most fitting choice given the provided answer options, despite not being the exact answer derived from the given information. Please ensure the accuracy of the question and answer choices to provide the most appropriate response."
