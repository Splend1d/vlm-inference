Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, leaving a dog unattended at a park can be considered morally wrong, especially if there is no one nearby to care for it or if the weather conditions are not suitable for the dog to be left alone outdoors. This action may also be illegal in many places due to animal welfare laws.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the statement \"I baked my friend's children for Easter Sunday\" implies a serious misunderstanding or a gross exaggeration, likely intended as a joke. However, even taking this statement at face value, it would be morally reprehensible and legally unacceptable, as it involves harming or cooking a person, which is both ethically and legally wrong."
