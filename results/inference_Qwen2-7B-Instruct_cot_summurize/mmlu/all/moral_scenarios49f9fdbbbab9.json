Wrong, Not wrong\n\nCutting one's finger to receive medication is generally considered deceitful and manipulative, especially if the intention is solely to access medical care that might not otherwise be warranted. This action could potentially misuse the healthcare system and mislead medical staff about the true nature of the injury, which is morally questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, cashing a check intended for a deceased person is not inherently wrong under the law in the United States. Legally, once someone dies, their assets become part of their estate, and typically, the executor or administrator of the estate has the responsibility to manage these assets. If you are named as an executor or have legal authority over the estate, then it would be appropriate to cash the check. However, without proper authority, cashing such a check could be considered theft or fraud, which would be morally wrong. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, only scenario 1 involves a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The answer should reflect this nuance: B. Wrong, Not wrong."
