Surplus food is stored in large, collective facilities: This indicates that there is an increase in agricultural productivity and population size. The ability to store surplus food allows for a stable food supply, which supports larger populations and the development of specialized roles ( such as traders,\u4fdd\u7ba1\u8005, and artisans. This leads to increased social organization and complexity.\n\nB. Crop irrigation requires the construction of dams or canals: The need for irrigation to ensure crop survival in arid regions or during dry seasons necessitates the creation of infrastructure. This includes the construction of dams, canals, and other water management systems. Such projects require planning, coordination, and often a degree of centralized authority to oversee resources and labor. These developments contribute to the establishment of more complex governance structures and social hierarchies.\n\nC. Sedentary communities need to defend themselves: As societies transition from nomadic lifestyles to settled ones, they become vulnerable to external threats such as rival groups, wildlife, and natural disasters. The need for defense leads to the establishment of permanent settlements, the development of military strategies, and the creation of organized defense mechanisms. These factors contribute to the growth of political structures, military organizations, and social stratification.\n\nIn summary, all three factors\u2014storing surplus food, constructing irrigation systems, and defending sedentary communities\u2014play significant roles in driving societal complexity by fostering increased social organization, technological innovation, and the development of governance structures."
