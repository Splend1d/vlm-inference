According to the hotel, the security camera displayed him \"wandering aimlessly\", and at times \"suspiciously\" handling various items offered for sale. They seized the man's paper bags which contained various items sold by the convention vendors; due to being surprised and disoriented, he could not immediately locate his receipts. The officers made him sit on a chair in the hallway until the police arrived 20 minutes later. The man later produced receipts for the items and was released. He sued the hotel for the tort of false imprisonment. Will the court allow the case to go to the jury?\n\nA. No, there was probable cause for an arrest and there can therefore be no false imprisonment.\nB. No, the failure to immediately provide receipts gave the security personnel justification to confine him.\nC. Yes, when one is told to sit in one place until further notice that is always false imprisonment.\nD. Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established \u0080\u0093 there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.\n"

Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established \u0080\u0093 there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.\n\nExplanation:\n\nFalse imprisonment occurs when someone intentionally confines another person without legal authority. In this scenario, the man was confined (told to sit in one place) by the hotel security personnel without any legal basis or probable cause for arrest. The fact that the security officers detained the man based on surveillance footage and their suspicions, without any concrete evidence of theft, suggests an intentional act of confinement that lacks legal justification. \n\nThe man's inability to immediately produce receipts due to surprise and disorientation does not necessarily justify the detention if there was no probable cause for arrest. Moreover, the hotel's actions caused the man harm, which is another element required for a claim of false imprisonment.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely consider these elements and decide that the case should go to the jury, as there appears to be sufficient evidence that the hotel may have violated the man's rights under the doctrine of false imprisonment."
