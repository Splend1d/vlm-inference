This is done to prevent potential complications in future pregnancies where the fetus could have Rh-positive blood, but the mother is Rh-negative.\n\nIn the context provided:\n\nA 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the office for a prenatal visit. She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits.

The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive.\n\nThe recommendation for Rho(D) immune globulin administration is most likely to prevent:\nD. Formation of antibodies to RhD\n\nThis treatment works by introducing antibodies into the mother's bloodstream that can bind to any Rh-positive fetal red blood cells, thus destroying them before they can cause an immune response from the mother's body. This prevents the development of maternal antibodies to RhD, which could lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) if the mother were to become pregnant again with an RhD-positive fetus. HDN can cause serious health issues for the newborn, including anemia and jaundice, and potentially life-threatening complications."
