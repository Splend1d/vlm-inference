His pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Breath sounds are normal on the right and decreased on the left. Abdominal examination shows an entrance wound in the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line below the left costal margin. There is an exit wound laterally in the left axillary line at the 4th rib. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. CT scan of the chest\nB. Intubation and mechanical ventilation\nC. Peritoneal lavage\nD. Left tube thoracostomy\n"

                    "text": "Given the patient's symptoms and the location of the gunshot wounds, the most appropriate next step in management would be:\n\nD. Left tube thoracostomy\n\nThis is because the patient has a significant drop in blood pressure (70/40 mm Hg, which suggests potential hemodynamic compromise due to either blood loss or tension pneumothorax. The decreased breath sounds on the left side suggest possible lung compression from a pneumothorax or hemothorax. A tube thoracostomy can help decompress the lung and manage any air or blood accumulation, potentially stabilizing the patient's condition.\n\nWhile a CT scan of the chest (option A) could provide valuable information about the extent of injuries, it might not be immediately life-saving in this scenario. Intubation and mechanical ventilation ( option B) might be necessary if the patient has respiratory failure, but it's typically performed as part of the initial stabilization process rather than being the first step. Peritoneal lavage ( option C) would be more relevant for managing peritonitis from a penetrating abdominal injury, but without signs of significant peritonitis, it would likely not be the immediate priority.\n\nTherefore, addressing the potential air or blood accumulation in the thoracic cavity with a left tube thoracostomy should be the initial priority to stabilize the patient's condition before further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions."
