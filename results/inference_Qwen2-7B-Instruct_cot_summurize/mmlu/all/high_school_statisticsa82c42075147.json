A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample.\n\nExplanation:\n- **B** is incorrect because while it's true that visual inspection of a sample might not reveal if it was selected randomly, there are methods and statistical tests that can be used to assess if a sample is likely to have been drawn randomly from a population. For example, one could use the Chi-squared test for categorical data or t-tests for continuous data to compare the sample to the known parameters of the population.\n- **C** is also incorrect. While it's possible that a simple random sample might exhibit different attributes than the population due to sampling variability (the natural fluctuation in data when taking samples from a population, it does not mean they will be \"very different\" in all aspects. Simple random samples are expected to be representative of the population, though with some degree of variability depending on the sample size.\n- **D** is correct. In a simple random sample, every element of the population has an equal chance of being picked, which is a fundamental characteristic of this type of sampling method.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is false regarding simple random samples is **A**, as the size of the sample is not inherently related to whether it qualifies as a simple random sample. A small sample can still be randomly selected, and a large sample does not automatically mean it was selected randomly without proper procedures."
