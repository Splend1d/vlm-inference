While the Tang dynasty was known for its expansionist policies, particularly under the reigns of Emperor Taizong and Emperor Xuanzong, the Song dynasty generally adopted a more defensive stance.\n\nThe Song dynasty focused on consolidating its internal strength, maintaining stability, and defending its territories against external threats, most notably from the Liao, Jin, and Mongol dynasties. This is evident in the military campaigns they engaged in, such as the Northern Campaigns against the Jurchen Jin dynasty, and their efforts to secure the borders through fortifications and alliances.\n\nMoreover, the Song dynasty also had to deal with internal rebellions, such as the Rebellion of the Ten Thousand Li ( (\u4e07\u5dde\u4e4b\u4e71), which further strained their resources and military capabilities. The Song's foreign policy was thus characterized by a mix of defensive strategies, diplomatic efforts, and occasional offensive actions, but it was fundamentally different from the more outward-looking policies of the Tang dynasty."
