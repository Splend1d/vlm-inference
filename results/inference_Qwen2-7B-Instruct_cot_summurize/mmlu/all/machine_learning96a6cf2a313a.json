The only examples necessary to compute \\(f(x)\\) in an SVM.\n\nIn a Support Vector Machine (SVM), these are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary and have a direct impact on defining the optimal margin for classification. They are crucial because they determine the position of the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes. Any change in their positions could potentially alter the decision boundary, thus they are pivotal for the model's decision-making process.\n\nA. This statement is incorrect because it describes \"farthest\" examples which is not necessarily true for support vectors. Support vectors can be closest to the decision boundary but not necessarily the farthest.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect because the data centroid refers to the average position of all the data points in a dataset, which does not specifically relate to the concept of support vectors in SVMs.\n\nD. This statement is also incorrect because while it is true that support vectors do have non-zero weights (\\(\\alpha_k\\)) in a SVM, not all examples with non-zero weights are support vectors. Only those examples that lie on the margin or violate the margin ( i.e., the support vectors, contribute to the computation of \\(f(x)\\)."
