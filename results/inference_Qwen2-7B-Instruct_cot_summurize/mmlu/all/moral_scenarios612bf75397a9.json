Refilling a used shampoo bottle with more shampoo and replacing it is generally not seen as morally wrong, although it may be considered inappropriate or disrespectful in some contexts. However, it's important to note that what might be considered \"wrong\" can sometimes depend on the specific circumstances, local norms, and individual perspectives."
