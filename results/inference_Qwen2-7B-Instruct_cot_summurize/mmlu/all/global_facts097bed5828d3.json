However, this percentage does not directly match any of the options you provided. The closest answer would be:\n\nC. 76%\n\nThis might have been an interpretation or aggregation of responses that included perceptions of corruption more broadly, but it's important to note that the precise percentage isn't listed among your options. The actual percentage from the Pew Research Center survey was higher than option A ( 36%, lower than option C 76%, and much lower than options B and D which suggest very high percentages."
