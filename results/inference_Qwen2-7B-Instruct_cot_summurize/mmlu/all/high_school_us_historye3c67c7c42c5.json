Instead, it was a German reparation plan proposed in 1924 after the end of World War I. The Dawes Plan allowed Germany to repay its reparations debt through loans from the international community, particularly from the United States, which helped stabilize the German economy and prevent hyperinflation.\n\nIn contrast, the other options listed ( the War Industries Board, Food Administration, and Espionage Act were all measures taken by the U.S. government during World War I to increase its power:\n\n- The War Industries Board was established to coordinate the production and distribution of war materials.\n- The Food Administration was created to manage food supplies and rationing to ensure they were available for both military and civilian needs.\n- The Espionage Act was amended to strengthen penalties for those who interfered with military operations or conscription efforts, thus increasing the government's authority over public behavior."
