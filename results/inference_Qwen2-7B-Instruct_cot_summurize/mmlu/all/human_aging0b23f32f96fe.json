Inner circles refer to close, personal relationships with people like family members, close friends, and significant others. Outer circles consist of acquaintances or less intimate connections.\n\nResearch suggests that older adults tend to have larger outer circles compared to younger adults. This could be due to several factors, including increased social opportunities through various activities, clubs, or volunteer work, as well as the desire to maintain social connections in retirement. However, the size of inner circles may remain relatively stable or even decrease, as younger adults often prioritize building these close relationships."
