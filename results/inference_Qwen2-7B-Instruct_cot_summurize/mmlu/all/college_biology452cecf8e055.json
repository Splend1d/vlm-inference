Marine birds absorb water from the environment through specialized salt-exchange glands and produce large volumes of dilute urine in the kidneys.\n\nThese birds have evolved several adaptations to cope with drinking seawater, which has a much higher salt concentration than their body fluids. They use specialized glands located in their head and neck region to extract excess salts from their bloodstream while absorbing water directly from the seawater they drink. This allows them to increase their water intake significantly without causing an excessive buildup of salts in their bodies. The resulting dilute urine helps maintain their internal osmolarity, keeping it hypoosmotic to the seawater."
