Always vertical in the long run.\n\nThis is because in the long run, all factors of production are fully adjustable. Thus, changes in price levels do not affect the quantity of output supplied; firms can adjust their inputs (like labor, capital, and technology) to produce more or less output regardless of the price level. Therefore, at any given price level, there is a certain amount of output that the economy can produce based on its productive capacity, which is represented by a vertical AS curve."
