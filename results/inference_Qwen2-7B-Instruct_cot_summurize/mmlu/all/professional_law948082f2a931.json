After performing the gardening services, the homeowner paid him $100. The gardener, who speaks only English, contends that the homeowner, who speaks only Japanese, originally agreed to pay him $200 for the work. When the parties entered into their agreement, the gardener was accompanied by his friend, who is now deceased, who spoke both English and Japanese. This jurisdiction has a typical Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the gardener now seeks to testify to the terms of his agreement with the homeowner as communicated to him by his friend. Upon objection by the homeowner's attorney, the gardener's proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.\nB. admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.\nC. inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\nD. inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.\n"

This statute aims to prevent bias or false testimony by a party with a potential interest in the outcome of the case. In this scenario, since the gardener wishes to testify about the agreement terms communicated to him by his deceased friend ( who was not an agent of either party but simply a witness, the testimony would likely be deemed inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute, as it involves the deceased friend's statements about the contract terms, which could be considered hearsay."
