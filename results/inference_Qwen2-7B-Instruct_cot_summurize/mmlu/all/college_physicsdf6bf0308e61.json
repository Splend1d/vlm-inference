Let's calculate \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{0.6c}{c}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0203 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\n\\[ K = (\\gamma - 1) mc^2 = ( (1.0203 - 1) mc^2 = 0.0203 mc^2 \\]\n\nHowever, the question seems to ask for the total work done to achieve this velocity, which includes both the initial rest energy \\( mc^2 \\) and the additional kinetic energy gained. Thus, the total work \\( W \\) is the sum of the initial rest energy and the kinetic energy:\n\n\\[ W = mc^2 + K = mc^2 + 0.0203 mc^2 = 1.0203 mc^2 \\]\n\nThis result doesn't directly match any of the options provided. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in how the question was framed or the options provided. Based on the calculation and understanding of relativistic mechanics, the closest answer would be:\n\nC. 0.67mc^2\n\nThis option is not exactly correct based on our calculations, but it is the closest among the given choices to the calculated value of approximately 1.0203 mc^2.
