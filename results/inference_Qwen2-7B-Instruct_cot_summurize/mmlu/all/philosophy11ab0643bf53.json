The problem of moral luck, as discussed by philosopher Thomas Nagel, arises because the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events. This means that external factors or \"luck\" can play a significant role in the outcomes of our actions, making it difficult to fairly assign moral responsibility. For instance, if an individual accidentally causes harm due to circumstances beyond their control, traditional notions of moral responsibility might struggle to hold them accountable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it conflates moral luck with the application of moral standards rather than addressing the issue of how luck can affect moral responsibility. Option C is incorrect because while Nagel does critique certain moral theories, he doesn't claim that all moral theories are hopelessly off track; rather, he focuses on the issue of moral luck within the context of existing moral theories. Option D is also incorrect because while it's true that theories of human action might not fully account for the complexities introduced by moral luck, this choice does not directly address the central point about the dissolution of the self through the lens of moral luck."
