Butler's claim alignss with John Locke's philosophy of natural rights, which posits that individuals have inherent rights to life, liberty, and property. However, the concept of \"happiness\" is not typically considered a fundamental right in this context. Therefore, options C (property and D. happiness are not accurate representations of Butler's claim based on the information provided. It's important to note that interpretations of natural rights can vary among philosophers and legal scholars."
