This might be because these interpersonal experiences often leave more vivid and memorable impressions on parents, or they may involve more frequent interaction and observation. However, it's important to note that memory accuracy can vary based on many factors including the time elapsed since the event, the mother's level of involvement in the child's life, and the nature of the information being recalled."
