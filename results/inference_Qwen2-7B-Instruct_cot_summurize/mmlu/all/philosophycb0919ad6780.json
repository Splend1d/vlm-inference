This means considering ethical principles and moral values when evaluating actions, behaviors, or policies decisions. \n\nOption B ( the point of view of virtue, could also be relevant as it focuses on actions aligned with virtues such as honesty, courage, kindness, etc. However, it might not necessarily capture the full spectrum of normative questions.\n\nOption C, the point of view of individual perfection, might be too narrow as it focuses solely on the personal development of an individual rather than broader societal norms, ethical principles, or collective well-being.\n\nOption D, a perspective that is unattached to any well-ordered system of values, seems less likely because normative questions often involve some form of ethical framework or system of values to assess right from wrong, good from bad.\n\nTherefore, option A best fits the claim that normative questions must be assessed from a moral point of view."
