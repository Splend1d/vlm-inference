                    "text": "A buyer purchased a new convertible from an automobile dealership. A few weeks later, the buyer began smelling a pungent gasoline odor in the vehicle. The buyer immediately took the car to the dealership and told the service manager what was wrong. The service manager indicated that he would take care of the problem and contact the buyer when the car was ready. The next day, the buyer was informed that the problem had been corrected and the car was available for pickup. The buyer then went to the dealership, took possession of his car, and drove off. After traveling about five miles, the buyer again smelled gasoline fumes. Irritated that the problem had not been corrected, the buyer decided to drive back to the dealership. As he was doing so, the car suddenly exploded, and the buyer suffered third-degree bums over 90 percent of his body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the explosion was caused by a defective gas tank that had ruptured. This produced a gasoline leak that was ignited by sparks from the car's underbody. A reasonable inspection would have disclosed the defective gas tank. The trouble the buyer had described to the service manager was indicative of such a problem. If the buyer asserts a claim against the manufacturer of the convertible for damages for his injuries, will the buyer prevail?\n\nA. Yes, if the dealership should have replaced the gas tank.\nB. Yes, because the buyer's injury was caused by the defective gas tank.\nC. No, if the buyer should have realized the gasoline smell presented a hazardous condition and stopped the car before the explosion occurred.\nD. No, unless the gas tank was defective when the car left the manufacturer's plant.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. No, unless the gas tank was defective when the car left the manufacturer's plant.\n\nIn a product liability case, particularly one involving a car accident or defect, the key factor is whether the product (in this case, the car and its components, such as the gas tank) was defective at the time it left the manufacturer's control. The manufacturer may be held liable if they failed to produce a product that was safe for its intended use. This can include design defects, manufacturing defects, or failure to provide adequate warnings or instructions for safe use.\n\nThe other options do not necessarily align with legal principles:\n\nA. Whether the dealership should have replaced the gas tank does not directly determine the manufacturer's liability. The manufacturer's responsibility is tied to the condition of the product when it was sold, not necessarily how it was handled after sale.\n\nB. While the buyer's injury was indeed caused by the defective gas tank, this alone does not guarantee a successful claim against the manufacturer. The cause of action must also establish that the defect existed at the time of manufacture and was the direct cause of the injury.\n\nC. The assumption that the buyer should have stopped the car based on the smell presents a subjective standard that does not directly relate to the manufacturer's liability. The focus is on the safety and functionality of the product, not the driver's actions.\n\nD. This option correctly points to the critical factor: the manufacturer's liability hinges on whether the gas tank was defective when the car left their control. If the gas tank was faulty due to a manufacturing defect or a design flaw, the manufacturer could be held responsible for any injuries resulting from that defect, even if the issue was not discovered until after the sale.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as it correctly identifies the fundamental aspect of product liability law in this context."
