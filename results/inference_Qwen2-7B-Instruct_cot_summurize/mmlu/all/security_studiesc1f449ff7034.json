Objective security: when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation.\n\nThis statement is not entirely accurate because objective security can often still depend on context and interpretation. While some aspects of security might be universally agreed upon ( like the physical safety of individuals or the integrity of borders in certain contexts, other elements of security might involve subjective judgments about values, interests, or threats that can vary across different societies or within different cultural or political frameworks. Therefore, while \"objective\" generally implies independence from personal feelings or interpretations, security assessments might still involve subjective evaluations of what constitutes a threat or interest."
