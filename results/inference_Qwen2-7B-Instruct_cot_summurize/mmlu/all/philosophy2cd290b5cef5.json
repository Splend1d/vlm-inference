This crisis led him to adopt a more religious perspective, particularly emphasizing Christian ethics and pacifism. He began to question the materialistic and secular values of his time, which influenced his later works and his lifestyle. He also became more focused on charitable work and the well-being of others, reflecting a shift towards a more spiritually-driven approach to living."
