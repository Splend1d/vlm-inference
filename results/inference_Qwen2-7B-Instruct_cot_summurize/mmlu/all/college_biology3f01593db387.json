Air, being a gas, has more thermal inertia than water, which is a liquid. This means that air takes longer to heat up or cool down compared to water. \n\nLet's examine the other options:\n\nA. Air provides less physical support because it is much less dense than water and does not provide the same kind of buoyancy or structural support.\n\nB. Air has a lower O2 ( concentration compared to water. Oxygen is a dissolved gas in water, and its concentration varies depending on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the amount of organic matter present.\n\nC. Air offers less resistance to motion, not more. Air has low viscosity, which means it flows easily around objects, providing minimal resistance to their movement. Water, on the other hand, has higher viscosity and can provide more resistance to motion due to its greater density."
