Out of these, 9 are white.\n\nSo, the number of soccer balls that are not white is \\(30 - 9 = 21\\).\n\nSince these remaining balls are equally divided into blue, pink, and green, we divide this number by 3 to find how many of each color there are:\n\n\\[21 \\div 3 = 7\\]\n\nTherefore, Coach Wu has 7 green soccer balls.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 7."
