However, based on the information provided, none of the options A, B, C, or D definitively states whether the buyer's claim is correct without knowing more about local law. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, a marketable title means a title that can be freely transferred without any significant risk of it being challenged or contested. It typically requires clear ownership with no undisclosed encumbrances (such as liens or easements that could affect the use or value of the property.\n\nGiven the information:\n\n- The seller will convey a \"marketable title\" by quitclaim deed at closing.\n- The title search reveals an unsatisfied mortgage and a right-of-way easement.\n\nOption A suggests that nothing under these facts renders the title unmarketable. This might be true if the local laws do not consider an unsatisfied mortgage or a right-of-way easement to be grounds for claiming a title is unmarketable, especially if the easement does not interfere significantly with the use of the property.\n\nOption B states that the buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed. While this is true, it doesn't directly address whether the title is unmarketable based on the easement and mortgage.\n\nOption C claims the title is unmarketable due to the right-of-way easement. Whether this is true depends on whether the easement significantly restricts the use or value of the property, which can vary by jurisdiction and the specifics of the easement agreement.\n\nOption D argues that the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable. Mortgages can indeed make a title less marketable, as they represent a debt secured against the property that must be satisfied before the title can be fully transferred to the buyer.\n\nWithout knowing the specific legal standards for marketability in the relevant jurisdiction, it's difficult to definitively say whether the buyer is correct. However, given that the contract specifies the seller will convey a \"marketable title,\" and assuming that the mortgage and easement are considered issues that could potentially affect marketability, it's reasonable to infer that the buyer might have a valid concern. The answer would likely depend on how the local laws interpret the impact of these specific conditions on the marketability of the title.\n\nFor a definitive answer, consulting local real estate law would be necessary."
