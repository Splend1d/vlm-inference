The back-propagation algorithm does not guarantee a globally optimal solution for neural networks with hidden layers. It is an iterative method that minimizes a loss function through gradient descent, but it may converge to a local minimum rather than the global minimum. The optimization landscape of neural networks is often non-convex, making finding the global optimum challenging.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is true. The VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension quantifies the capacity of a statistical classification algorithm, defined as the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can shatter. A line in a two-dimensional space can indeed separate any three points in various configurations, meaning it can shatter a set of three points. Therefore, the VC dimension of a line in a 2D space is actually 3, not 2, because it can shatter any set of three points, but not necessarily any set of four points or more. However, the claim in the statement is about the maximum possible VC dimension of a line being 2, which is incorrect based on the explanation provided. The correct interpretation aligns with the statement's intent: a line cannot shatter a set of three points if they are collinear and form a single line segment, hence the VC dimension of a line is considered to be 2 under the definition that it can't shatter any set of points larger than two without them being lying on the same line."
