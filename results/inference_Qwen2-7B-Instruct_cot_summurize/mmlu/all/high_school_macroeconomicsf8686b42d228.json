The government holds spending constant while increasing taxes.\n\nWhen the government increases taxes and holds spending constant, it reduces disposable income and consumer spending, which can lead to a decrease in aggregate demand. This decrease in aggregate demand results in a reduction in production and output, leading to a decline in real GDP.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C involve different combinations of changes in government spending and taxation. \n\nA. Decreasing spending and decreasing taxes would stimulate economic activity by increasing disposable income and potentially reducing budget deficits, depending on the magnitude of the changes.\n\nB. Increasing spending without an increase in taxes would typically stimulate the economy by directly increasing aggregate demand, but this could also lead to higher budget deficits and potentially inflation if not offset by other policies actions.\n\nC. Decreasing spending without changing taxes would reduce government expenditures, which could have a negative impact on economic activity, especially if it coincides with other contractionary fiscal or monetary policies. However, it might help stabilize or prevent further economic downturns by reducing the budget deficit.\n\nThus, option D is the one that would most likely cause a significant decrease in real GDP due to the direct reduction in aggregate demand resulting from increased taxes."
