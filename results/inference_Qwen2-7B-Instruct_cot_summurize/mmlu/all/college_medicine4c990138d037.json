Similarly, lactate isn't typically converted to glucose in the heart for energy production ( that's more related to the process of gluconeogenesis which occurs in the liver and kidneys, making option B incorrect. Excretion via the kidneys is also not the primary fate of lactate because only a small amount is excreted this way, making option C incorrect. \n\nMost of the lactate produced in muscles is transported to the liver and other tissues where it's oxidized back to pyruvate, which can then enter the citric acid cycle and be used for energy production. This process is crucial for maintaining energy balance during periods of high metabolic demand or when oxygen supply is limited. Therefore, the correct answer is D: uptake and oxidation by other tissues."
