                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of conservation of mass which implies that the volume flow rate remains constant throughout the pipe. The volume flow rate \\( Q \\) can be calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area \\( A \\) and the velocity \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ Q = A \\cdot v \\]\n\nThe cross-sectional area \\( A \\) for a circular pipe can be given by:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the pipe. Since the diameter \\( d \\) is twice the radius \\( r \\), we have \\( r = \\frac{d}{2} \\). Thus,\n\n\\[ A = \\pi (\\frac{d}{2})^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\]\n\nFor the first point, let's denote it as point 1, with a diameter \\( d_1 = 2 \\) cm ( or \\( 0.02 \\) m ( (since the unit is not specified but we assume it to be meters for consistency), and a velocity \\( v_1 = 18 \\) m/s. For the second point, let's denote it as point 2, with a diameter \\( d_2 = 3 \\) cm ( or \\( 0.03 \\) m , and an unknown velocity \\( v_2 \\).\n\nSince the flow rate \\( Q \\) is constant:\n\n\\[ A_1 \\cdot v_1 = A_2 \\cdot v_2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( A \\) into this equation gives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\pi d_1^2}{4} \\cdot v_1 = \\frac{\\pi d_2^2}{4} \\cdot v_2 \\]\n\nWe can cancel out the common factors on both sides:\n\n\\[ d_1^2 \\cdot v_1 = d_2^2 \\cdot v_2 \\]\n\nNow we can solve for \\( v_2 \\):\n\n\\[ v_2 = \\frac{d_1^2 \\cdot v_1}{d_2^2} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ v_2 = \\frac{(0.02)^2 \\cdot 18}{(0.03)^2} \\]\n\n\\[ v_2 = \\frac{0.0004 \\cdot 18}{0.0009} \\]\n\n\\[ v_2 = \\frac{0.0072}{0.0009} \\]\n\n\\[ v_2 = 8 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the flow speed at the second point in the pipe is 8 m/s, which corresponds to answer choice C."
