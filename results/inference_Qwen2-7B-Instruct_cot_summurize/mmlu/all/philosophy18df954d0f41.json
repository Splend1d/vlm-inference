What constitutes a public space: Depending on the context and location of your visual data collection, understanding what is considered a public or private space can be important. For instance, filming or photographing in certain areas might require specific permissions or adhere to local laws regarding privacy and public access.\n\nB. Protecting individuals from potential harm: This includes ensuring that participants are not exposed to physical, psychological, or emotional risks during or as a result of your research. This could involve obtaining informed consent, providing clear explanations of the study, and offering support mechanisms for participants who may experience distress during the research process.\n\nC. Any risk of invasion of privacy: Visual data can often capture intimate details about individuals or their environments, which can lead to privacy concerns. Researchers must ensure they have the necessary permissions, comply with data protection regulations (such as GDPR or HIPAA), and anonymize data where possible to protect identities and sensitive information.\n\nIn summary, when conducting research involving visual methods, it is essential to navigate these ethical considerations alongside legal guidelines to uphold the rights and welfare of participants while maintaining compliance with relevant laws and regulations."
