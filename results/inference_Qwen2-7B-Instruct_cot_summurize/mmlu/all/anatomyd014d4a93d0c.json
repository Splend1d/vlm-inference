Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity.\n\nDuring childhood, as the permanent molars develop, they require more space than their primary ( or \"baby\" counterparts. This space is often provided through the resorption of the maxillary tuberosity, which is a bony prominence on the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. As the tuberosity resorbs, it allows the permanent molars to erupt into the correct position.\n\nTo clarify the other options:\nA. Pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus does occur but typically continues beyond puberty.\nC. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures do not significantly contribute to the increase in height and length of the maxilla; instead, they connect the zygomatic bone ( part of the cheekbone) with the maxilla.\nD. The intermaxillary suture, also known as the palatine process, does not close in a consistent manner at age 8; its closure can vary among individuals."
