This means any power of 3 greater than or equal to 6 will have the same remainder as its equivalent within the first 6 powers when divided by 7.\n\nGiven that \\(10^{10}\\) is an extremely large number, when considering \\(10^{10^{10}} \\mod 6\\) ( (since \\(10^{10} \\mod 6 = 4\\)), we're essentially interested in \\(3^4 \\mod 7\\), which equals 4.\n\nTherefore, \\(10^{10^{10}}\\) days from now, it will be 4 days into the future from Wednesday.\n\nAdding 4 days to Wednesday:\n\n- Thursday\n- Friday\n- Saturday\n- Sunday\n\nSo, the answer is **A. Sunday**."
