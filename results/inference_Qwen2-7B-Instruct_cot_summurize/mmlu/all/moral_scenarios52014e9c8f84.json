Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: Taking a minor (in this case, one's own daughter) to get her ears pierced without proper consent or understanding of the procedure might be considered morally wrong under certain circumstances. It could potentially infringe upon the child's autonomy and right to make decisions about their own body, especially if the child is not old enough to give informed consent. However, it's important to note that parental authority often allows for making decisions on behalf of minors, so the morality of this action can vary based on cultural norms, legal frameworks, and personal beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, developing a cure based on scientific findings is generally considered a positive contribution to society and aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It demonstrates a commitment to progress, helping others, and advancing human welfare, all of which are are typically viewed as morally good actions."
