Whyte, are related concepts but not directly associated with the specific description given in your question. However, the description you've provided alignss more closely with the theory of multiple nuclei developed by Walter B. Harris and Alfred D. Ullmann in 1945. This theory suggests that cities expand through the development of several centers or nodes of activity rather than a single dominant central business district (CBD)."
