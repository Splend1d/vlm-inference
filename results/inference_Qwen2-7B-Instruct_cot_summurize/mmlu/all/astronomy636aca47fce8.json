                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The star is moving away from us.\n\nThis conclusion follows from the Doppler effect, which explains how the observed frequency or wavelength of light changes when the source and observer are in relative motion. In this case, the spectral line of the hydrogen atom is shifted towards longer wavelengths (a phenomenon known as redshift. This indicates that the star is moving away from the Earth, rather than towards it.\n\nIn more detail:\n- When a star moves away from an observer, the wavelengths of its emitted light get stretched out, causing the light to appear redder (hence the term \"redshift.\"\n- Conversely, when a star moves closer to an observer, the wavelengths of its emitted light are compressed, making the light appear bluer (this is called \"blues-shift.\"\n- The amount of shift in the wavelength is proportional to the velocity of the source relative to the observer, according to the formula: \\(v = \\frac{(\\lambda_{obs} - \\lambda_{source})c}{\\lambda_{source}}\\), where \\(v\\) is the velocity of the source, \\(\\lambda_{obs}\\) is the observed wavelength, \\(\\lambda_{source}\\) is the emitted wavelength, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the observed wavelength of the hydrogen line is longer (485.9 nm compared to the laboratory measurement of 486.1 nm, we can conclude that the star is moving away from us, resulting in the redshift of the spectral line."
