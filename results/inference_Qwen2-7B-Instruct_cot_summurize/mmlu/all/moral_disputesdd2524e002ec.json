These arguments may not adequately demonstrate that capital punishment is degrading, which is a key component of the argument for why it is morally wrong. If they do not effectively establish this point, their overall strength is diminished.\n\nB. There's a risk that these arguments might imply that any form of killing, including acts of self-defense, could be morally problematic if it involves taking another life. This would significantly weaken their applicability and relevance to justifiable uses of lethal force.\n\nBoth points highlight significant flaws in the way these arguments are constructed and evaluated within the context of African values and ethics."
