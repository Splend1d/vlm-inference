To find the corresponding negative integer, we note that the sequence of numbers congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$ is linearly spaced by $13$. Thus, the first integer in our range (that is congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$ will be $5 - 13k$, where $k$ is the number of steps of $13$ we take backwards from $5$ until we fall within our range.\n\nSince we're looking for the first integer, let's find it directly:\n\n\\[5 - 13(0) = 5\\]\n\nThus, $5$ itself is the first number in the range $-200$ to $200$ that is congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$.\n\n### Step 2: Find the last integer in the range that is congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$\n\nThe last integer in our range that satisfies the condition is found by determining the largest number less than or equal to $200$ that is congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$. We can do this by finding the largest multiple of $13$ less than or equal to $200$ and adding $5$ to it.\n\nThe largest multiple of $13$ less than or equal to $200$ is $195$ ( since $13 \\times 15 = 195$. Therefore, the last number in our range is:\n\n\\[195 + 5 = 200\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of integers in this sequence\n\nGiven any arithmetic sequence defined by $a_n = a_1 + (d(n-1)$ where $a_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the term number, the number of terms up to a certain value $L$ can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[n = \\frac{L - a_1}{d} + 1\\]\n\nHere, $a_1 = 5$, $d = 13$, and $L = 200$. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[n = \\frac{200 - 5}{13} + 1 = \\frac{195}{13} + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 16\\]\n\nHowever, this calculation gives us the number of steps between the first and last term. Since we're counting both the start and end points, we actually have:\n\n\\[16 + 1 = 17\\]\n\nBut this approach seems to have miscalculated due to an oversight in directly applying the formula without considering the full range properly. Let's correct this by understanding the sequence more directly:\n\nFrom $5$ to $200$ with a step of $13$, we count the actual steps:\n\nStarting from $5$, each subsequent number in the sequence is $13$ units apart. So, if we're counting from $5$ to $200$, the sequence is:\n\n\\[5, 18, 31, ..., 200\\]\n\nTo find the total count directly without misinterpreting the formula application, consider the pattern and the span:\n\nGiven the sequence starts at $5$ and ends at $200$, and knowing the pattern is every $13$ units, the count should directly reflect the span divided by the step, plus one for including the starting point. However, my direct calculation was misleading. The correct approach to directly address the span without confusion:\n\nGiven the sequence starts at $5$ and ends at $200$, considering the span from $5$ to $200$ (and adjusting the explanation for clarity:\n\nTo directly calculate without missteps:\n\n- The first term is $5$.\n- The last term under $200$ congruent to $5 \\pmod{ {1{}1$ is indeed found by checking multiples of $1$ until just below $200$, which is correctly identified as $15$ steps from $5$ leading to $200$ (since $5 + 13(15) = 200$).\n\nThus, the count of numbers"
