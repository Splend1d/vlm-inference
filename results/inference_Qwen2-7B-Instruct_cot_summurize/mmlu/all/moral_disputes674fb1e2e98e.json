This is a central tenet of his philosophy, particularly in the context of his utilitarian ethics and his defense of free speech. Mill argues that for an individual to arrive at true beliefs or moral principles, they must have the opportunity to confront and debate false ones. Through this process of collision and debate, individuals can refine their understanding and discern the truth more clearly.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the impression of truth all the clearer."
