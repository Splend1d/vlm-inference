As a nurse employed by the hospital was pushing the wheelchair through a set of automatic doors at a normal pace, the doors closed on the patient's foot, injuring it. The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further. The patient sued the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. The patient has produced no evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. Should the court grant the hospital's motion?\n\nA. No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.\nB. No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.\nC. Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.\n\nThe decision to grant the hospital's motion for summary judgment would hinge on whether the hospital can be held liable for the incident based solely on the lack of evidence of specific conduct or neglect leading to the malfunction of the doors. In this case, since the patient has not produced any evidence pointing to negligence or misconduct by the hospital that would have caused the doors to malfunction, and given that the hospital has moved for summary judgment, the court is likely to side with the hospital if it believes that the standard for liability has not been met.\n\nProof of an accident alone is generally insufficient to establish negligence without additional evidence linking the defendant's actions or omissions to the cause of the accident. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate choice here. Options A and B suggest possibilities for liability that are not supported by the facts presented ( a latent defect or res ipsa loquitur ( and option D introduces the concept of a superseding cause which, while potentially relevant, is not necessarily applicable without further evidence showing that the nurse's action was so extraordinary as to break the chain of causation between the hospital's potential negligence and the injury."
