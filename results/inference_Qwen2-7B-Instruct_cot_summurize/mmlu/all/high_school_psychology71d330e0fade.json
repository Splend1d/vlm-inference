In this case, the person who has been sunbathing might have adapted to the higher body temperature and thus perceive the pool water as cooler than it actually is. Conversely, the person who has been inside in the air conditioning might not have experienced significant changes in body temperature and would therefore perceive the same pool water as warmer.\n\nThe other options do not explain the difference in perception in this context:\n\nA. Sensory restriction doesn't apply because there's no limitation on the senses that prevents them from perceiving the water temperature.\nB. Perceptual constancy refers to our ability to perceive objects as having certain properties (like size or color) despite changes in the environment. It doesn't address the change in perception due to adaptation.\nC. Relative clarity refers to the perception of how clear or blurred an object appears, which isn't relevant to the explanation of differing perceptions of water temperature."
