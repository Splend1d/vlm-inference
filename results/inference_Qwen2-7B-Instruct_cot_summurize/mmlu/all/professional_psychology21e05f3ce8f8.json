In the context of personnel selection, this would mean how well a selection tool predicts job performance.\n\nThe answer to your question depends on empirical research and data, but generally, objective personality inventories ( option B - like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or the Big Five Personality Traits (are considered to have higher predictive validity compared to other methods such as interviews or projective techniques for certain job roles. These tools are designed to measure personality traits that have been linked to job performance in various studies.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that no single method is universally superior, and the effectiveness often depends on the specific job requirements, the population being tested, and the context of the workplace. \n\nBiographical inventories (option D, which typically include information about past work experience, education, and personal history, can also be useful in predicting job performance, especially when combined with other assessment methods. \n\nIn-person interviews, while subjective, can provide insights into a candidate's interpersonal skills, motivation, and fit within the company culture, which are are crucial aspects for job performance.\n\nProjective techniques, option A, like the Rorschach Inkblot Test, are less common in industrial settings due to their lack of standardized interpretation and questionable reliability and validity.\n\nRemember, the best approach usually involves using multiple methods, not just one, to make a comprehensive decision about hiring. This approach is known as a multi-method or multifactorial selection process."
