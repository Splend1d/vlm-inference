The defendant's attorney calls its first witness, who was standing along the side of the road when the plaintiff's and defendant's cars collided. The defendant's attorney asks the witness: \"Is it a fact that in your estimation, plaintiff was traveling at a speed of 45 m. p. h. in a 35 m. p. h. speed zone at the time of the accident?\" The plaintiff objects. The trial judge should\n\nA. overrule the objection, because the judge may take judicial notice of the speed limit within the jurisdiction.\nB. overrule the objection if the witness has already been shown to be an experienced driver who was able to estimate the approximate speed of moving vehicles.\nC. sustain the objection if the witness has not been qualified as an expert witness.\nD. sustain the objection, because the witness is not an adverse witness.\n"

For the court to consider such an opinion, the witness must first be qualified as an expert. The mere fact that the witness claims to have experience as a driver does not automatically qualify them as an expert witness on the subject of estimating vehicle speeds from the scene of an accident.\n\nWithout proper qualification, the witness's testimony regarding the plaintiff's alleged excessive speed would lack sufficient reliability and relevance for the court to consider it in determining the case. Therefore, the judge should sustain the plaintiff's objection unless the witness is later properly qualified as an expert."
