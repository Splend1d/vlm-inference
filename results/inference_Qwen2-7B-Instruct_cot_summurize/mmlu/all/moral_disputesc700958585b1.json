It suggests that moral actions are those that cultivate good character traits, even if they don't necessarily maximize happiness or follow a set of rules ( as in consequentialism or Kantian theory, respectively. Nathan's emphasis on the moral worth of having a certain attitude towards the environment suggests he values cultivating virtues like environmental stewardship, which would be characteristic of a virtue ethics perspective."
