He argues that eugenics and genetic enhancement might be problematic from a religious perspective because they could lead individuals to believe that they have control over traits that are fundamentally within God's domain. This is based on the idea that humans should not play God by altering essential aspects of life that are considered divine creations. However, it's important to note that religious views on these topics can vary widely among different denominations and interpretations."
