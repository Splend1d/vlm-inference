Because the professor was such a popular and well-respected individual in the bar review industry, there was much speculation and interest concerning his termination. A reporter for the local law journal telephoned the bar review course's administrative director and inquired why the professor had been fired. The director told the reporter that the professor was fired because the president of the bar review course believed that the professor had embezzled money. The next day, the reporter wrote an article that was published by the law journal, which quoted the director and stated that the professor \"was fired because he had embezzled money. \" It was later learned that the professor was not responsible for any unlawful conduct and had not embezzled funds. If the professor asserts a defamation action against the law journal, he will most likely\n\nA. prevail, if the professor proves malice.\nB. prevail, if the newspaper was negligent in notascertaining whether the professor had actually embezzled any funds.\nC. not prevail, because the director was merely providing an opinion about the reason for the professor's termination.\nD. not prevail, because the law journal was merely repeating what it had been told by a source.\n"

This act of negligence can potentially be grounds for a defamation claim. Moreover, if the professor can prove that the statement was made with malice (meaning the publisher knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth), they would likely succeed in their defamation case against the law journal. The fact that the director provided the information does not absolve the law journal of liability, as they have a duty to verify the accuracy of the information they publish."
