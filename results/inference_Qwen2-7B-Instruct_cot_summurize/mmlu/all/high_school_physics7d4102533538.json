The power required to lift a mass \\( m \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{lift}} = mg \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity ( approximately \\( 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\), and\n- \\( m \\) is the mass in kilograms.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{lift}} = 6 \\times 9.81 = 58.86 \\text{ Watts} \\]\n\nSince the motor's power output is greater than the power required to lift the mass, the limiting factor here is the motor's power output, not the mass's weight. However, for the sake of finding the speed, let's proceed with the understanding that the motor can lift the mass with its full power output.\n\nNow, we need to find the speed \\( v \\) at which the motor can lift the mass using the power output and Newton's second law:\n\n\\[ P = mv \\]\n\nS is the force required to lift the mass, which equals the weight of the mass:\n\n\\[ F = mg \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P = mv = m \\frac{m}{t}v = mv \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{P}{mg} \\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{90}{6 \\times 9.81} = \\frac{90}{58.86} \\approx 1.5 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1.5 m/s."
