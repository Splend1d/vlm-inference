The June, July, and August shipments were delivered on time and duly paid for. Then, on August 16, the lumber mill informed the store that the mill would not be able to meet the September 1 delivery date, because its lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill then asked the store to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment failed to arrive, the store immediately brought suit for breach of contract. How would the court hold?\n\nA. Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.\nB. Judgment for the store, because the mill should have foreseen such a contingency occurring.\nC. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.\nD. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.\n"

Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.\n\nIn this scenario, the court is likely to rule in favor of the home improvement store. The lumber mill's performance was not excused due to the forest fire because they did not provide evidence that the destruction of the lumber reserve was unforeseeable or that it made performance commercially impracticably difficult. The mill was still required to fulfill their contractual obligations unless there was a clause in the contract that allowed for such an event to relieve them of their duties ( which does not seem to be the case here. \n\nThe other options do not apply as follows:\nB. While foreseeing the event might be a factor in some cases, the main consideration is whether the event relieved the mill of its contractual duties. In this case, it did not.\nC. Impossibility of performance usually applies when something external occurs that makes it physically impossible to perform the contract, such as the destruction of all means of transportation. Here, the mill could still find ways to source the plywood elsewhere.\nD. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event makes the contract economically or practically worthless, but the purpose of the contract can still be fulfilled. In this situation, the purpose of the contract was to deliver plywood, which could still be accomplished even if the mill's own supply was lost."
