While this action can be considered a positive interaction with an animal, it could also potentially cause harm if the dog chases the ball too aggressively or if the ball is thrown in a way that could hurt the dog. However, in general, it is not considered a morally wrong act unless there is some specific reason for concern about the safety of the dog.\n\nScenario 2 involves ordering food for someone who went to work. This is generally seen as a reasonable and considerate action. The person might appreciate the gesture, especially if they are busy or have no time to prepare a meal. There is no inherent moral wrong in this scenario.\n\nSo, while neither scenario involves clear-cut moral wrongdoing, scenario 2 leans slightly more towards being morally right given the context provided."
