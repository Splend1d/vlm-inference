For an average adult, let's assume a caloric intake of 2000 calories per day. \n\nFirst, calculate the total calories needed per year:\n\n\\[ \\text{Calories per day} \\times \\text{Days in a year} = 2000 \\times 365 = 730,000 \\, \\text{calories/year} \\]\n\nNext, calculate how much kale provides 730,000 calories at 33 calories per 100 grams:\n\n\\[ \\frac{730,000 \\, \\text{calories}}{33 \\, \\text{calories/100g}} = 22,121.21 \\, \\text{grams} \\]\n\nSince there are are 1000 grams in a kilogram:\n\n\\[ 22,121.21 \\, \\text{grams} \\div 1000 = 22.12121 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice to this calculation is **B. 2*10^4 kg/yr**, which is approximately 20,000 kg or 22.1 kg when considering significant figures and rounding. The actual calculated value is closer to 22.1 kg, but given the options, B. 2*10^4 kg/yr is the most accurate choice based on the provided options and rounding rules."
