In this case, the Court recognized that the Convention rights could not be interpreted in an identical manner across all member states due to differences in legal systems, traditions, and social contexts. This recognition laid the groundwork for the development and application of the margin of appreciation doctrine in subsequent cases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Airey v Ireland (1979"
