Moral values are both independent and objective.\n\nRaul Dworkin, in his book \"Justice for Hedgehogs,\" argues that moral values are not dependent on legal interpretations or societal norms. They are considered to be independent and objective, meaning they exist outside of any particular legal system or cultural context and apply universally. This implies that there are certain moral principles that transcend the specifics of law and society, and these principles should guide legal decisions."
