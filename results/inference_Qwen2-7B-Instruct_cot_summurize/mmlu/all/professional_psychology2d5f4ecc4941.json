A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) is appropriate for this type of study design because it can handle both between-subjects factors (like the different treatments given to different groups ( and within-subjects factors, such as the pretest and posttest measurements on the same subjects.\nB. The study design indeed includes one between-subjects factor (the type of treatment received (cognitive behavioral vs. brief dynamic) and one within-subjects factor (the time of measurement (pretest vs. posttest).\nC. Each factor does comprise two levels: for the between-subjects factor, there are two levels corresponding to the two types of treatment ( cognitive behavioral and brief dynamic. For the within-subjects factor, there are two levels corresponding to the two time points: pretest and posttest."
