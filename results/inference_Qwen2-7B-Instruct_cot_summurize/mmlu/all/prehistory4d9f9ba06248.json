While the Aztec Empire was indeed structured with a hierarchical system where the king held significant power, the everyday life of commoners in the rural villages wasn't necessarily dominated by constant military presence or strict tribute systems as portrayed in option B. \n\nAztec society was divided into social classes, but the commoners ( or those below the nobility and the elite priesthood, had their own roles and responsibilities within their communities. They engaged in farming, trade, and other occupations. The Aztecs were known for their extensive agricultural practices, which included maize cultivation. However, it's not accurate to say that they were forced to send half of all maize they grew to the king as tribute. The tribute system was complex and varied, and while some goods were required to be contributed to the state, the specifics varied greatly depending on the region, the time, and the nature of the goods.\n\nOption A exaggerates the level of control the king had over rural villages. While the king did have significant power and authority over the empire, the governance structure was decentralized, with local rulers often having considerable autonomy within their territories.\n\nOption D incorrectly suggests that these villages lacked protection. In reality, the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, and its allies provided a degree of protection against northern invaders through a network of alliances, military conquests, and defensive strategies.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that commoners in the rural Aztec villages were largely left alone to manage their affairs, which could include a decent standard of living given the agricultural prosperity and community organization typical of the time. However, this does not negate the fact that the Aztec society was hierarchical, with the king and the nobility at the top, and that tribute and other forms of contributions to the state were part of the social fabric."
