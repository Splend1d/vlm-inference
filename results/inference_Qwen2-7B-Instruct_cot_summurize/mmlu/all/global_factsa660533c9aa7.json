However, this doesn't directly translate into a percentage of total deaths being due to suicide.\n\nAs per the WHO data, in 2016, the global suicide rate was about 1.4 deaths per 100,000 people, which implies that suicide accounted for about 1.4% of all deaths worldwide. This figure might slightly vary depending on the source and the year.\n\nGiven this information:\n\nA. 0.70% seems too low.\nB. 1.40% seems to align with historical data.\nC. 2.80% and D. 5.60% seem too high based on the typical statistics provided by WHO.\n\nSo, based on the information provided and considering typical global suicide rates, the answer would be closest to:\n\nB. 1.40%"
