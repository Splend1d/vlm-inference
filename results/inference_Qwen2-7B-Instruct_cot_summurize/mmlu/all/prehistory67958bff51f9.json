Cut marks on animal bones: These marks indicate that hominids were capable of using tools to butcher meat. The precision and pattern of these marks suggest that they were made by sharp-edged tools, providing strong evidence for early tool use.\n\nB. The anatomy of Australopithecus africanus hands and analogous studies with living non-human primates: The hand structure of Australopithecus africanus is consistent with the ability to manipulate objects and tools. Studies of modern non-human primates have shown that they can use tools when provided with the necessary training or natural opportunities, supporting the hypothesis that early hominids could also use tools.\n\nC. Simple stone cores, anvil stones, and flakes found at the Lomekwi 3 site in West Turkana, Kenya: These artifacts demonstrate early hominid activity, including the creation and use of stone tools. The presence of these tools suggests that they were used in some form of processing, such as cutting or scraping, which supports the idea of tool-making and use in prehistoric times.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors collectively provide robust support for the argument that hominids were making and using stone tools by at least 3.3 million years ago."
