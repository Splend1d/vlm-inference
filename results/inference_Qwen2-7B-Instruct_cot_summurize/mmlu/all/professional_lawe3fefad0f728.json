The court's negligence instruction was plain error that affected the worker's substantial rights.\n\nIn this scenario, the worker's attorney submitted a proposed negligence instruction, which the court did not adopt. Instead, the court provided its own instruction, which the attorney believed was less favorable and potentially incorrect. Although the attorney did not object to the court's instruction at the time, this lack of objection does not necessarily preclude the worker from raising the issue on appeal or in a motion for a new trial. \n\nThe concept of \"plain error\" refers to situations where there is a clear and obvious error in the proceedings that affects the substantial rights of the party. This type of error may be grounds for relief even in the absence of a timely objection. In the context of this case, if the court's negligence instruction was indeed incorrect and prejudicial to the worker's case, it could qualify as plain error. The worker would have to demonstrate that the error was clear and that it had a significant impact on the outcome of the trial.\n\nTherefore, the argument that the court's negligence instruction constituted plain error affecting the worker's substantial rights is likely the strongest argument for granting the motion for a new trial."
