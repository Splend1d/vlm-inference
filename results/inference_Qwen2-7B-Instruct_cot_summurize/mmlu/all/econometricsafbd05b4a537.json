These methods are used when there are are more instruments than endogenous variables, leading to over-identification.\n\nOLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and ILS (which does not seem to be a standard term in econometrics or statistics, possibly a typo for OLS) are not typically used for estimating over-identified systems because they do not account for the potential correlation between the error terms and the regressors, which is often the case in such systems."
