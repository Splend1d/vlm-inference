His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter \"to share and share alike as tenants in common. \"At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. Now, the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself. If the Midwestern states in which the property is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.\nB. The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.\nC. The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.\nD. The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.\n"

The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.\n\nExplanation: Adverse possession allows a person who does not have legal title to a piece of property to gain full legal title if they possess the land openly, notoriously, continuously, and without permission from the true owner for a statutory period. In most jurisdictions, this period is at least 20 years. Given that the son has occupied the property, paid taxes, and made maintenance payments for 25 years, it is likely that he has met the criteria for adverse possession under the state's laws, especially since there is no evidence of the daughter formally renouncing her rights or taking steps to prevent the adverse possession claim. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, theoretically, one cotenant can acquire title by adverse possession against another under certain conditions, but the specifics of this case and the laws of the state in question would determine whether this applies here. \n\nOption B might seem plausible given the lack of the daughter's active opposition, but the key factor in adverse possession is possession by the adverse party, which appears to be the son's actions. The daughter's passive awareness of the situation and lack of objection does not meet the criteria for ouster or abandonment necessary to challenge an adverse possession claim.\n\nOption C suggests that the sister's passivity indicates her intention to renounce her rights, but there is no explicit statement or action from the daughter that renounces her rights. The lack of formal renunciation, combined with the son's continuous possession, points towards a favorable outcome for the son under the law of adverse possession."
