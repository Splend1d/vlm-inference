Buyclasses.\n\nRobinson, Faris, and Wind ( (1967) identified three main types of buying situations in organizations, which they refer to as buyclasses. These include:\n\n1. **Routine buys**: These are the regular, predictable purchases made by organizations for items that are needed frequently or consistently, such as office supplies, maintenance parts, or raw materials.\n\n2. **New buys**: These occur when an organization needs to acquire something it has never bought before, often due to a new product launch, expansion, or strategic change. This could involve researching, evaluating, and selecting suppliers for new items.\n\n3. **Modified buys**: These happen when an organization needs to replace existing products or services but wishes to make some changes, such as upgrading quality, features, or service levels. This might involve negotiating with current suppliers or exploring new ones for better terms or performance.\n\nThese categories help organizations manage their purchasing activities more effectively by categorizing them based on their nature and complexity."
