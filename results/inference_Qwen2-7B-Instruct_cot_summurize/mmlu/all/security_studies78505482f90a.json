The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.\nB. Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.\nC. Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.\nD. Neither Critical Security Studies nor the Copenhagen School account for the changing nature of society and its impact on the construction of security.\n"

According to Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde, the Copenhagen School's approach to Security Studies differs fundamentally from that of Critical Security Studies in terms of the theory and knowledge that underpin each approach. The Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology, meaning it seeks to understand security through objective, measurable factors. In contrast, Critical Security Studies adopts a post-structuralist and constructivist perspective, viewing security as a social construct that is shaped by the ideas and ideologies within human societies. This difference in epistemology reflects a core divergence in how each approach conceptualizes the nature of security and the methods for studying it."
