If judges have strong discretion, it implies that they can make decisions based on their own judgment or interpretation, which could lead to multiple answers for a single legal question. This contradicts Dworkin's assertion that each legal question has a single, definitive right answer.\n\nIn contrast, propositions A and B emphasize the importance of rights in legal decision-making, which aligns with Dworkin's view that legal questions often revolve around rights. Proposition D suggests that judges consider historical context when making decisions, which might lead to different interpretations but still maintains that there is an underlying \"best fit\" that can be considered the right answer."
