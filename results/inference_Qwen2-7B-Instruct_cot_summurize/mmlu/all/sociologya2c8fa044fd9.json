However, this system did not fully eradicate class inequalities for several reasons. Among these options, choice B is the most accurate explanation of why comprehensive schools did not fully address class inequalities in education during the 1960s.\n\nSelective schools, which were often associated with higher social status and better resources, could still \"cream off\" the most academically able students through their entrance exams or other selection criteria. This left comprehensive schools with a more diverse student body, including those who might have been disadvantaged by social, economic, or cultural factors. \n\nComprehensive schools often grouped students into ability streams or sets, which could inadvertently reinforce existing social hierarchies. Students placed in lower-ability streams might face additional challenges due to less challenging curriculum content and fewer resources dedicated to their education. This practice sometimes led to a self-fulfilling prophecy where students in lower sets were expected to achieve less, leading to lower aspirations and outcomes.\n\nWhile the intention was to create an egalitarian system, the reality was that some aspects of the comprehensive system could inadvertently perpetuate inequalities by focusing on academic achievement and grouping students based on perceived ability. This, combined with societal expectations and the lack of resources in certain areas, meant that class disparities persisted in educational attainment despite the existence of comprehensive schools."
