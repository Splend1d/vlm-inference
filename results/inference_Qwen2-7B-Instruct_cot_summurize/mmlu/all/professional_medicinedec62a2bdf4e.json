She plays field hockey and has noticed she coughs when running up and down the field. The cough is nonproductive and resolves with rest. She has not had chest pain or palpitations. She takes no medications and does not smoke. Her sister has asthma. The patient appears well. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99%. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 90% and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Asthma\nB. Chronic bronchitis\nC. Gastroesophageal reflux disease\nD. Postnasal drip syndrome\n"

Asthma\n\nWhile it's true that her spirometry results show within normal limits, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can sometimes not be detected by standard spirometry, especially if the symptoms resolve quickly with rest. This is a common presentation of exercise-induced asthma.\n\nThe other options are less likely given the information provided:\n- B. Chronic bronchitis typically involves persistent coughing, usually more than three months in duration, and is not usually triggered by exercise.\n- C. Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( (GERD) usually presents with heartburn and regurgitation, not necessarily cough and nasal congestion specifically related to exercise.\n- D. Postnasal drip syndrome often leads to a constant feeling of having something stuck in the throat, but it doesn't usually cause exercise-related symptoms unless there is a secondary airway irritation from the dripping mucus.\n\nTherefore, considering her symptoms and the lack of significant findings elsewhere, asthma seems to be the most plausible diagnosis."
