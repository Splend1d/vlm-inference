This occurs because as the air rises, it expands, and when it expands, its temperature decreases ( this is called adiabatic cooling. As the air descends to lower elevations, the opposite happens, and the air compresses, leading to adiabatic heating. However, in the scenario described where cool air is moving down to lower elevations, the process is one of adiabatic cooling. \n\nA. Increase in moisture content would be more likely if there was an encounter with warm humid air.\nB. Condensation, forming large amounts of dew, could occur if the descending air reached a point where it could no longer hold all the moisture it absorbed during its ascent, but that's not necessarily what always happens, especially if the conditions do not provide enough surface for the dew to form.\nC. Adiabatic warming typically refers to the situation where air ascends, not descends, and is a result of the expansion of the air as it rises."
