Children with an \"Easy\" temperament generally adapt well to new situations, show resilience, and are often social and emotionally balanced. They are responsive to their environment, curious, and generally enjoy exploring and engaging with others.\n\nGiven that the child initially clings to her mother but then shows willingness to help another child within a few minutes with some encouragement from the teacher, this behavior suggests adaptability and a positive response to social interaction, which are are characteristics of an \"Easy\" temperament style."
