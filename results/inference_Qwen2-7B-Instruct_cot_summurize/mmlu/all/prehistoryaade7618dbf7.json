Neandertals used caves in Europe where their remains were preserved.\n\nNeandertals (also known as Homo neanderthalensis) lived in Europe and Western Asia during the Middle and Late Pleistocene epochs, roughly 200,000 to 40,000 years ago. They often utilized caves for shelter, which helped preserve their remains over time. These caves provided protection from harsh climates and predators, and they often contained layers of sediment that accumulated over thousands of years, preserving artifacts and bones.\n\nArchaeologists have discovered numerous Neandertal sites in various caves across Europe, including the famous sites at Shanidar Cave in Iraq, Grotte du Renne in France, and Caves of El Sidr\u00f3n in Spain. These sites have yielded valuable information about Neandertal anatomy, behavior, and culture.\n\nIn contrast, other premodern human species, such as the Denisovans or the various archaic Homo species like Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, and Homo rhodesiensis, had more limited geographical distributions and left fewer archaeological traces. They did not predominantly use caves for habitation, and their remains are less frequentlyly preserved due to factors such as less stable environments, different burial practices, or the fact that they were outcompeted by Neandertals and eventually went extinct.\n\nFurthermore, Neandertals interbred with anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens), particularly in Europe and the Middle East, leaving genetic traces in living humans today. This genetic relationship also contributes to our understanding of Neandertals through studies of ancient DNA.\n\nIt's important to note that our knowledge of premodern humans is still evolving, and ongoing research continues to shed light on these fascinating and enigmatic groups."
