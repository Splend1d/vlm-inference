This includes some monkey species ( (A) and some ape species ( (B). However, it is uncommon for domesticated animals like dogs to exhibit true menstrual cycles, as their reproductive systems are often suppressed or altered by human care. Therefore, the correct answer is D, indicating that only some monkey species and some ape species have menstrual cycles."
