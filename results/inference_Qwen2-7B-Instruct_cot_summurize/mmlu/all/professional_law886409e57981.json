                    "text": "A plumbing company hired a worker to work at various construction sites. The worker used his own truck to travel between the company's warehouse and the construction sites, but the company fitted the truck with a rack for carrying plumbing pipes. The company paid the worker for traveling between the warehouse and the construction sites, but not for his drive to and from work. Because the worker was required to haul pipes on his truck while driving between the warehouse and the construction sites, the company asked the worker, before hiring him, whether he had a valid driver's license. The worker represented that he did, although in fact his license had been suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. The company made no effort to verify the worker's representation. While driving to work one morning in his truck, the worker carelessly caused a collision in which a woman was injured. In her subsequent action against the plumbing company, based on a theory of negligent hiring, is the woman likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.\nB. No, because the worker was an independent contractor.\nC. Yes, because the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack.\nD. Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.\n"

However, based on general principles of negligence law, the answer might be:\n\nD. Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.\n\nThis is because the company, in requiring the worker to haul pipes on his truck and paying him for travel between the warehouse and construction sites, assumed some level of control over the worker's actions during those times. By asking about the worker's driver's license before hiring and failing to verify it, the company potentially created a situation where it could be held liable if the worker's lack of a valid license contributed to an accident. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a complex area of law, and other factors could influence the outcome, such as the nature of the work, the extent of control the company had over the worker's actions, and the specific legal precedents in the jurisdiction. For instance, if the worker was classified as an independent contractor rather than an employee, option B (\"No, because the worker was an independent contractor\") might apply, as the duties to hire competent individuals would generally fall more heavily on the shoulders of the individual contractor under the \"independent contractor\" doctrine."
