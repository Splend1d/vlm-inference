Improper, because it violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to counsel for any individual facing criminal charges. This includes the right to have one's attorney present during interrogations and to be informed of this right. The judge's instruction to the defendant not to speak with anyone during the night could be interpreted as an attempt to gather information from the defendant without their attorney being present, potentially violating this right. \n\nWhile judges do have authority over the conduct of trials and may issue instructions to witnesses or parties, such instructions must comply with constitutional rights, including the right to counsel. The instruction given here seems to go beyond the scope of permissible judicial actions, as it directly impacts the defendant's ability to consult with their attorney."
