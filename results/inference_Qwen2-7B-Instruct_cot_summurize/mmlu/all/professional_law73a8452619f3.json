The leasehold agreement between property owner and shopkeeper provided that the latter was not permitted \"to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an \u0080\u0098A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. \" One month later, the shopkeeper leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The shopkeeper-corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the shopkeeper. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide \"by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper. \"One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a non-profit organization for the balance of the term of the corporation \u0080\u0094shopkeeper lease. The non-profit organization took possession of the said premises the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation \u0080\u0094nonprofit leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The non-profit organization has a \u0080\u0098B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company.

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Privily of estate, but not privily of contract, exists between the property owner and the corporation.\n\nLet's break down the relationships:\n\nA. Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the shopkeeper: This statement is correct because the original lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper establishes both an estate (the right to use the property for the specified duration) and a contract (the legal agreement with the terms and conditions).\n\nB. Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the shopkeeper and the corporation: This statement is also correct. When the shopkeeper leases the premises to the corporation, it creates a new estate (a sublease) and a contract between the shopkeeper and the corporation.\n\nC. Privity of estate, but not privily of contract, exists between property owner and the corporation: This statement is incorrect. The property owner does have a privity of estate with the corporation since the corporation is occupying the property based on the terms of the original lease. However, the property owner does not have a direct privity of contract with the corporation as they only have a contract with the shopkeeper.\n\nD. Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization: This statement is incorrect. Although the nonprofit organization does not have a direct lease with the property owner, it has an estate (the right to occupy the premises) through the corporation, which has a sublease from the shopkeeper. Therefore, there is a privity of estate between the property owner and the nonprofit organization. Moreover, the nonprofit organization indirectly has a contractual obligation to the corporation, which in turn has a contractual obligation to the property owner, creating a chain of contracts (but not directly between the property owner and the nonprofit organization).\n\nSo, the correct answer is C."
