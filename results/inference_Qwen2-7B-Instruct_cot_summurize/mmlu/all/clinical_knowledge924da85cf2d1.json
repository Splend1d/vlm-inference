Expiratory component louder and longer with a gap between expiration and inspiration.\n\nThis type of breathing sound is typically heard during a physical examination when there is a narrowing or blockage in the smaller airways (bronchioles) of the lungs, often due to conditions such as bronchitis, pneumonia, or emphysema. The increased loudness and duration of the expiratory phase compared to the inspiratory phase, along with a noticeable gap between inspiration and expiration, indicates possible airflow obstruction."
