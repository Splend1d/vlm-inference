Therefore, all angles are acute (i.e., less than $90^\\circ$ if the number of sides/nodes is sufficiently small.\n\nHowever, as the number of nodes increases, it becomes impossible for all angles to be acute. This is because the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ$, and as $n$ increases, this sum increases, which implies that at least one angle must exceed $180^\\circ$ for large enough $n$.\n\nTo see why this implies that not all angles can be acute for a $10$-gon, consider that if all angles were acute, they would all have to be less than $90^\\circ$. The smallest sum of $10$ such angles would be $10 \\times 90^\\circ = 900^\\circ$. However, the sum of the interior angles of a decagon ($10$-gon) is $(10-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 1440^\\circ$. \n\nTherefore, since the sum of the interior angles exceeds $900^\\circ$, there must be at least one angle that is greater than or equal to $90^\\circ$.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2\n\nThis is because in a convex $10$-gon, it's possible to have two angles that are are not acute ( (one being right and one obtuse), while the other eight angles remain acute. Any more than two non-acute angles would make the polygon non-convex."
