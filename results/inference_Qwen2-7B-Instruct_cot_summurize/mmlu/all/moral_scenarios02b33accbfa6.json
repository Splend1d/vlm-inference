It involves physical violence and aggression towards another person without any justification, which goes against the principles of respect for others' bodily integrity and the prohibition of assault.\n\nSpraying flea medicine on a cat's fur is generally not considered morally wrong, assuming it is done with the intention of protecting the cat from fleas and following proper usage instructions. However, it could be considered irresponsible or neglectful if the cat has an adverse reaction to the product or if the amount used was excessive, potentially harming the animal. It's important to use pet care products safely and according to guidelines provided by veterinarians or product manufacturers."
