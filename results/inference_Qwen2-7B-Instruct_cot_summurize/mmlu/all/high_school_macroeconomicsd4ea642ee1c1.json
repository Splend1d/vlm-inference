                    "text": "The correct answer is **C. Decreases**.\n\nLet's break down how each scenario would play out:\n\n1. **U.S. Net Exports**: When Japan experiences a deep, prolonged recession, its demand for U.S. goods and services typically decreases. This is because consumers and businesses in Japan have less disposable income to spend on foreign imports. As a result, the volume of goods and services that the United States sells to Japan would likely fall, leading to a decrease in U.S. net exports ( (net exports = exports - imports).\n\n2. **Value of the Dollar**: The value of the U.S. dollar could potentially weaken if there is a decrease in global demand for the dollar due to the economic downturn in Japan. However, it's important to note that this effect might not be immediate or direct. The dollar's value is influenced by a variety of factors including interest rates, inflation, and overall economic health. In the context of a recession in Japan, other factors such as the relative strength of the U.S. economy compared to others globally could still support the dollar's value.\n\n3. **Value of the Yen**: Conversely, when Japan is in a deep recession, there might be capital flight from Japan as investors seek safer havens like the U.S. dollar. This can lead to an increase in demand for the dollar and thus a depreciation of the yen against the dollar ( (the value of the yen decreases when it takes more yen to buy one unit of another currency). Additionally, during recessions, central banks may engage in monetary easing to stimulate their economy, which can further depreciate the currency.\n\nTherefore, considering these dynamics, the correct answer is C. Decreases, Decreases, Increases."
