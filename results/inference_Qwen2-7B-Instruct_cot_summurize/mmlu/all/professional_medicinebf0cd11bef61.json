The absence of abdominal tenderness to palpation, normal findings on ultrasonography of the gallbladder, and a normal serum amylase level help rule out other conditions like calculous cholecystitis ( (inflammation of the gallbladder due to a gallstone) and diverticulitis of the cecum ( (inflammation of a pouch or diverticulum that forms in the wall of the colon).\n\nHowever, without further diagnostic tests such as an abdominal CT scan or MRI, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made. \n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Acalculous cholecystitis - This refers to inflammation of the gallbladder not caused by a gallstone. It's less likely based on the patient's symptoms.\n\nB. Chronic relapsing pancreatitis - This condition fits the patient's symptom description well, especially considering the band-like, burning pain radiating to the back, which is a common symptom of pancreatitis.\n\nC. Diverticulitis of the cecum - This is inflammation of a pouch or diverticulum in the cecum, which would typically present with lower abdominal pain rather than upper abdominal pain.\n\nD. Herpes zoster - Also known as shingles, this condition usually presents with a rash, not the described abdominal symptoms.\n\nThus, the most likely diagnosis for this patient would be:\n\nB. Chronic relapsing pancreatitis"
