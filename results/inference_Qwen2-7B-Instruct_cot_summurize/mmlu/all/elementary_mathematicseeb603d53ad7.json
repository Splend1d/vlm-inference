Kim's position is given relative to Hector's, so let's place Kim first. We don't know her exact position yet, but we will use this information to determine it later.\n\n2. Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim. So, if we have 7 desks in a row, we can represent their positions as follows, starting from the left ( (position 1, position 2, ..., position 7):\n\n   - Kim: _\n   - Hector: __\n\nGiven that Hector is 2 seats to the right of Kim, we can fill these positions knowing that there are only 7 desks in total:\n\n   - Kim: _ \n   - Hector: _ _ \n\nSince Hector must be on one of the desks and cannot occupy both _ positions, he must occupy either the second or sixth desk. However, since there are only 7 desks, and Hector is 2 seats to the right of Kim, the only logical placement for Hector is at desk number 6 ( (assuming desk 1 is the far left). This means Kim is sitting at desk number 3.\n\n3. Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector. Given that Hector is at desk number 6, Tonya would be at desk number 9, which is outside our range of desks ( (since we only have desks numbered 1 through 7).\n\nHowever, let's correct our understanding based on the provided options and re-evaluate:\n\nWe initially placed Hector at desk 6, which was incorrect due to an oversight in considering the total number of desks. Let's correct this:\n\nGiven Hector is 2 seats to the right of Kim, and assuming Kim is not at the extreme ends of the row ( (desk 1 or desk 7), Hector could actually be at desk 4 ( (with Kim at desk 2) or desk 6 ( ( with Kim at desk 4). However, since Tonya needs to be within the available desks, we must ensure Hector is placed correctly to accommodate Tonya's position without exceeding the total number of desks.\n\nCorrecting for this oversight:\n\nLet's assume:\n- Kim is at desk 2 ( (to allow Hector to be placed correctly)\n- Hector is at desk 4, 2 seats to the right of Kim\n\nThen, Tonya, who is 3 seats to the right of Hector, would be at desk 7, which is within the available desks.\n\nNow, to answer the question:\n\nHow many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit?\n\nTonya is at desk 7, and Kim is at desk 2. The distance between them is 7 - 2 = 5 seats.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 5."
