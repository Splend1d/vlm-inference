The maximum order of an element in \\(S_n\\) is achieved when the element's cycle structure consists of cycles whose lengths have the highest possible LCM, considering that their product equals \\(n\\).\n\nFor \\(n = 10\\), to maximize the order, we should aim for prime factors of \\(10\\), which are are \\(2\\) and \\(5\\). The highest order would be obtained by having cycles of these lengths, because the LCM of two numbers is maximized when those numbers are prime to each other.\n\nThus, the maximum order can be achieved with a cycle structure consisting of one \\(2\\)-cycle and one \\(5\\)-cycle, or just two \\(5\\)-cycles, since \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\). However, having two \\(5\\)-cycles would result in an element that is a product of disjoint cycles of length \\(5\\), leading to an order of \\(5^2 = 25\\), which is not listed among the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the best option among those given is:\n\nC. 30\n\nThis is because you can achieve this order by having a single cycle that is a product of a \\(2\\)-cycle and a \\(5\\)-cycle, as the LCM of \\(2\\) and \\(5\\) is \\(10\\), but since we're looking for the maximum order directly related to the number of elements involved, the interpretation here should align more closely with the prime factorization and their combinations within the context of cycle structures in permutation groups. The explanation provided initially might have been a bit misleading in terms of directly mapping to the options given without explicitly considering the cycle structure's impact on the order calculation in the context of the question's options.\n\nGiven the options and aiming for clarity and direct relevance to the question:\n\n- Option A (6 does not represent a maximum achievable order.\n- Option B 12 does not represent a maximum achievable order based on the prime factorization and combination logic.\n- Option C 30 represents the maximum order achievable under the constraint of \\(n=10\\) by considering the prime factorization and aiming for a configuration that maximizes the LCM of the cycle lengths' contribution to the overall order.\n- Option D 105 cannot be directly related to achieving the maximum order for \\(n=10\\) without further clarification on how it was was derived within the context of cycle structures in \\(S_{10} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, considering the options and aiming for a straightforward application of the concept of maximizing order through prime factorization and cycle structure, is **C. 30**."
