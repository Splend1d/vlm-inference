Albert Bandura and social-cognitive personality theorists believe that personality is shaped by the interaction of these three factors. Traits refer to an individual's characteristic patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior. The environment encompasses the external conditions in which an individual lives and operates. Behavior is the actions and responses an individual exhibits in response to these internal traits and external environmental influences. This perspective emphasizes the role of learning and observation in shaping behavior and personality."
