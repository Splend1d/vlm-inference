Before he had completely repaid the loan, the man conveyed the land to an investor, who expressly assumed the loan. The note and mortgage did not contain a due-on-sale clause. After the investor had made several payments on the loan, she defaulted on two payments. The lender notified the man and the investor of its intention to accelerate the loan pursuant to the terms of the note and mortgage unless the default was cured within 60 days. When neither the man nor the investor made the required payment, the lender accelerated the loan and initiated foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the investor as party defendants. The foreclosure sale resulted in a deficiency. The lender has sought a deficiency judgment against only the man, because the investor has become insolvent in the meantime. Will the court likely find the man liable for the deficiency?\n\nA. No, because the investor's express assumption of the loan released the man from liability.\nB. No, because the lender must first seek to obtain a deficiency judgment against the investor.\nC. Yes, because even after the assumption, the man remains liable as a surety of the investor in the absence of a release from the lender.\nD. Yes, because the note and mortgage did not contain a due-on-sale clause.\n"

Yes, because even after the assumption, the man remains liable as a surety of the investor in the absence of a release from the lender.\n\nWhen the investor expressly assumed the loan, she took over the responsibility for repayment. However, the man's liability is not necessarily discharged just by the assumption. Typically, a borrower's liability under a mortgage or note can be affected by such assumptions, but it depends on the specific terms of the agreement, local laws, and whether there was a release of the original borrower. \n\nIn the scenario provided, since there is no mention of a release of the man's liability in the question, and assuming standard legal principles apply, the man would remain liable as a co-debtor or surety for the debt, unless specifically language in the note or mortgage, or applicable law, states otherwise. Therefore, if the lender seeks a deficiency judgment and the investor becomes insolvent, the court would likely find the man liable for the deficiency, unless the lender explicitly released him from liability when the investor assumed the loan. Without such a release, the man's liability generally persists."
