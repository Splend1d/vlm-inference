Hypnosis involves a state where a person becomes more receptive to suggestions and can experience changes in their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This altered state does not necessarily involve a measurable physiological change (A, nor does it imply an artificial sleep state like option D. Increased compliance to situational demands can be a result of hypnosis, but it's not the defining characteristic that distinguishes hypnosis from other states."
