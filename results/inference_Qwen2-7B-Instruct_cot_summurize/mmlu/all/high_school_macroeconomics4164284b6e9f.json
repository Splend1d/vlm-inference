Lower taxes on household income.\n\nSupply-side economics, also known as trickle-down economics, emphasizes stimulating economic growth by reducing taxes and decreasing regulations to encourage work, investment, and production. Lowering taxes on household income can increase disposable income, potentially boosting consumer spending and incentivizing businesses to invest more in their operations, which alignss with the principles of supply-side economics.\n\nA. Increased government spending is typically associated with Keynesian economics, which focuses on stimulating demand in the economy through government intervention.\n\nB. Higher tariffs on imported goods are align with protectionist policies aimed at supporting domestic industries, but they do not necessarily align with the core principles of supply-side economics, which focus on increasing productivity and economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation rather than protectionism.\n\nD. A tax credit on capital investment could stimulate business investment, which is a component of supply-side economics, but it's less directly focused on individual income or consumption compared to lowering taxes on household income."
