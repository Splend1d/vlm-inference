This setup allows for greater flexibility, innovation, and efficiency in managing complex operations across different locations or industries.\n\nLet's clarify why the other options do not accurately describe the alternative form of 'network organization':\n\nB. Business transactions occurring only through electronic communication is a characteristic of e-commerce or digital commerce, not necessarily defining network organization. Network organizations can involve both digital and non-digital forms of communication and transactions.\n\nC. The Japanese model being applied through lateral networks of flexible roles refers more specifically to a type of organizational structure that emphasizes collaboration and fluid role definitions within teams, which might be part of a broader network organization. However, it does not encompass all possible forms of network organizations.\n\nD. Activities being redistributed equally between men and women is a principle of gender equality in the workplace, not directly related to the definition or characteristics of a network organization. While promoting gender equality is important, it does not define how network organizations function or are structured."
