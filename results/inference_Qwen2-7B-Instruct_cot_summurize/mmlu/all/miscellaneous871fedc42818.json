Reciprocal teaching\n\nReciprocal teaching is an instructional strategy where students work in small groups, taking turns leading discussions on a text and guiding each other through comprehension strategies such as predicting, clarifying, question, summarize, and visualize. This method allows teachers to observe how students engage with texts and understand the material, providing insights into their comprehension skills, prior knowledge, and areas needing support. By collecting data through reciprocal teaching, a teacher can tailor future instruction to meet the specific needs of individual students or the class as a whole. \n\nThe other options ( A. Concentric circles, B. K-W-L chart, and C. Book pass - are also useful classroom activities but do not specifically provide data for informing instruction tailored to individual student needs."
