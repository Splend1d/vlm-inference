Fifteen engineers work in the Atlanta office, and 14 engineers work in the New Orleans office. The business manager decided to use a 2-sample t-test to compare the mean salaries of engineers in the two offices. Because there were only 15 engineers in one office and 14 engineers in the other, he used the salaries of all the engineers in the computation. Is the 2-sample t-test an appropriate inferential technique in this situation?\n\nA. Yes, because he is comparing the means of two small groups.\nB. Yes. Both Atlanta and New Orleans are large cities, so the salaries are comparable.\nC. Yes. Because Atlanta and New Orleans are about 500 miles apart, the two groups of engineers can be assumed to be independent.\nD. No, because the entire population information was used from both offices. Because no samples were taken, a t-test should not be used.\n"

Because no samples were taken, a t-test should not be used.\n\nThe rationale for this answer lies in the understanding of what a 2-sample t-test entails and its assumptions. A 2-sample t-test is typically used when you want to compare the means of two independent groups based on a sample from each group. This test assumes that the samples are randomly selected from their respective populations, and it aims to determine whether the observed difference in means could have occurred by chance.\n\nIn the scenario presented:\n\n- The manager has the complete data set for all engineers in both offices (Atlanta and New Orleans. This means that instead of taking a random sample from each location, the entire population of interest (the engineers in these two offices) is being analyzed.\n  \nGiven that the data represents the entire population of interest for each location, rather than a sample, using a t-test would not be appropriate. Instead, one might use methods suitable for analyzing complete population data, such as descriptive statistics or possibly more advanced statistical models if there are additional variables or complex relationships to consider.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly identifies that since the entire population was used, a t-test should not be applied."
