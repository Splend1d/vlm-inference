Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected. \n\nThe Washington Consensus is a set of economic policy prescriptions that emerged from the 1980s onward, primarily promoted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It includes policies recommendations such as market-oriented reforms, fiscal discipline, financial liberalization, trade openness, and privatization. Nationalization, which involves the state taking control over private enterprises, is not typically included among the ten steps of the Washington Consensus. Instead, it often advocates for privatization or reducing the role of the state in the economy."
