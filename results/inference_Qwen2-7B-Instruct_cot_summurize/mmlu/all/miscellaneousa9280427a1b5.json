N_2, H_2O, CO_2, CH_4, and NH_3.\n\nEarth's early atmosphere, which formed about 4.5 billion years ago, was significantly different from the one we have today. It was primarily composed of gases that could exist in the high-temperature and high-pressure conditions of the early Earth. Nitrogen (N_2 made up the majority of this early atmosphere, similar to what it does in our current atmosphere. Water vapor H_2O was also abundant due to the high temperatures and the presence of liquid water on the surface. Carbon dioxide CO_2 was present as the Earth's surface cooled and organic compounds began to break down. Methane CH_4 was produced by biological or geological processes, and ammonia NH_3 could have been present due to the high temperatures and the presence of liquid water. Oxygen O_2 was not a significant component until much later, when photosynthetic organisms started producing it as a byproduct of their metabolism. Chlorine monoxide O_3, while present in small quantities, was not a dominant component of the early atmosphere. Noble gases like Neon Ne, Argon Ar, Krypton Kr, and Radon Rn were also present but were not the primary components of the early atmosphere."
