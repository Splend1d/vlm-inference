The woman continued to take powerful pain medication for several weeks after she returned home. During her recovery, she offered to sell her car for $450 to her neighbor, who owned a house-cleaning service. The neighbor said, \"That's great! I need a car to transport all the people who work for me to their job sites.\" In fact, the woman's car was worth $3,000, and the neighbor knew this. He was also aware that the woman had undergone surgery and noted that she seemed \"out of it\" because of the medication she was taking. Several days later, the woman's son found out about the deal and contacted the neighbor, telling him that the woman would sell him the car, but for $3,450. The next day, when the neighbor tendered $450 and demanded that the woman give him the car, she refused. If the neighbor sues the woman for breach of contract, will he be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the contract was voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity.\nB. No, because the woman put nothing in writing.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor's reliance on the otherwise voidable contract made it enforceable.\nD. Yes, because the woman's offer and the neighbor's acceptance created an enforceable contract.\n"

No, because the contract was voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity.\n\nThe situation presented involves a potential case of undue influence or incapacity, which can render a contract voidable. The elderly woman in question might have been under the influence of medication that affected her mental state, potentially impairing her ability to make sound decisions. This could lead to the contract being voidable at her discretion, meaning she could rescind the agreement if she chooses to do so.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, contracts entered into by a person who lacks the mental capacity to understand the nature and consequences of the transaction are generally not enforceable against that person. This principle is designed to protect individuals who may be vulnerable due to age, illness, or mental impairment.\n\nGiven the context provided, the neighbor's reliance on the deal might not automatically make the contract enforceable, especially if the woman's incapacity is recognized. The son's intervention and the subsequent refusal of the woman to fulfill the contract further suggest that the contract might be voidable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: No, because the contract was voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity."
