Access and Exchange 'Private' Information About Consumers: With the rise of big data, artificial intelligence, and advanced analytics, companies can collect vast amounts of personal data from online activities, purchases, location tracking, and more. This data is then used to create detailed profiles of individuals for marketing, personalized services, or even targeted advertising.\n\nB. Reduce Prison Overcrowding by the Use of Electronic Tagging: Modern technology has enabled the implementation of electronic monitoring systems, which use GPS or other tracking technologies to keep tabs on individuals under probation or parole. These systems help ensure compliance with release conditions while potentially reducing the need for incarceration due to non-violent offenses.\n\nC. Monitor Employees' Activities at Work: Employers increasingly utilize software tools to monitor employee productivity, track time spent on various tasks, and ensure adherence to company policies. This can include email monitoring, keystroke logging, and screen capture software, which may raise privacy concerns among workers.\n\nOverall, these technological advancements in surveillance have expanded the scope and reach of monitoring capabilities across various sectors, impacting privacy, security, and workplace dynamics."
