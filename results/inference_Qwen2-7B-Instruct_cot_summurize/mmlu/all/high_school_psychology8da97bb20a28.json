In this case, despite some Americans disapproving of President Bill Clinton's personal conduct ( which might be seen as a breach of personal ethics or morality, they still supported his political stance and policies decisions during his presidency. This suggests that their political support and views on his policies were separate from their moral or ethical views on his personal life. It indicates a lack of coherence between their personal moral standards and their political endorsement of the president's actions and policies outcomes. \n\nA. External Locus of Control refers to a personality trait where individuals believe that events in their lives are determined by outside forces rather than by their own actions.\n\nB. Internal Validity is a concept used in experimental research to determine whether the results can be attributed to the variables being tested rather than other factors.\n\nC. Self-Representation refers to how people see themselves and how others perceive them. It doesn't directly address the inconsistency between personal morals and political endorsements."
