We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nWhich of the following was most directly a cause of the success of the Populist party?\n\nA. Western farmers and ranchers favored conservation and organized to promote the National Parks system.\nB. The growth of corporate power and banking interests inspired rural activists to lobby for political reform.\nC. Western farmers resisted the mechanization of agriculture and resented government interference in rural affairs.\nD. After the Civil War, westward migration slowed, causing a long-term recession in many Western territories.\n"

The growth of corporate power and banking interests inspired rural activists to lobby for political reform.\n\nThe Populist Party, also known as the People's Party, emerged in the late 19th century in response to the growing influence of corporate interests, banks, and monopolies trusts in American politics and economy. Western farmers, who were often economically vulnerable due to low crop prices and high debt levels, were particularly affected by these developments. The party aimed to address these issues through advocating for reforms such as free silver (to inflate the currency and boost purchasing power, direct election of senators, and an end to the gold standard, which they believed favored wealthy elites at the expense of the working and farming classes. Their platform reflected a desire for a more equitable distribution of wealth and power, hence making the growth of corporate power and banking interests a key cause of their success."
