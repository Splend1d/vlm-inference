Punishments are used with nonhuman animals, and negative reinforcements are used with humans.\nB. Negative reinforcements are used in classical conditioning, and punishments are used in operant conditioning.\nC. Punishments are primarily used when training an organism to perform a behavior and negative reinforcements are used to train an organism to stop performing a behavior.\nD. Punishments decrease the frequency of a behavior and negative reinforcements increase the frequency of a behavior.\n"

Punishments decrease the frequency of a behavior and negative reinforcements increase the frequency of a behavior.\n\nPunishment involves presenting an unpleasant stimulus following a behavior, which decreases the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated. Negative reinforcement, on the other hand, involves removing an unpleasant stimulus following a behavior, which increases the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated."
