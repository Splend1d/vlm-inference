While telling the truth is generally considered a positive moral action, the act itself is not necessarily morally wrong unless there are are specific circumstances that make it so (such as when one's truth-telling could cause harm or significant distress to others without any benefit. However, if the main character is simply avoiding telling the truth because of potential personal repercussions, this behavior can be seen as morally questionable due to its potential for dishonesty and lack of integrity. \n\nScenario 2: \"I kissed my girlfriend at the magic show.\" Assuming both parties involved consented to the kiss and no external factors like public decency laws or social norms were violated (such as public displays of affection being explicitly forbidden in certain situations), this scenario does not typically involve a clear violation of moral standards. It can be seen as a personal choice within a consensual relationship.\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer would likely be:\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nHowever, it's important to note that moral judgments can vary based on cultural, societal, and personal values. The answer provided is based on a general understanding of moral standards as they might apply in the United States in 2020."
