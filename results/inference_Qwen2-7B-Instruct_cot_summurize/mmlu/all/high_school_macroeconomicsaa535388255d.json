Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks.\n\nSelling Treasury securities to commercial banks by the central bank (in this case, likely the Federal Reserve) reduces the amount of money in circulation, which can counteract the stimulative effects of expansionary fiscal policy that aims to increase government spending or reduce taxes to boost the economy. This action increases interest rates and reduces the money supply, potentially dampening economic growth. \n\nThe other options listed would generally be considered more supportive of expansionary fiscal policy:\n\nA. Decreasing the value of the domestic currency can make exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which can stimulate economic growth.\n\nB. Lowering the income tax rate increases disposable income for consumers and businesses, encouraging more spending and investment, which aligns with the goals of expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nD. Lowering the discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the central bank, potentially encouraging them to lend more to consumers and businesses, further stimulating the economy."
