It provides rights to students regarding the privacy of their educational records, including the right to inspect and review those records. This includes the right of parents or legal guardians to inspect their child's school records if they are minors or if the parent has legal custody. \n\nB. The right of patients to have access to their own hospital records is typically governed by HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) rather than the Buckley Amendment.\n\nC. The requirement for employers to make reasonable modifications to tests for applicants with disabilities is covered under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), not the Buckley Amendment.\n\nD. The requirement for schools to provide a \"free appropriate public education\" to students with disabilities is covered under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), not the Buckley Amendment."
