This is due to the fact that liberal egalitarianism:\n\nA. must not conflict with the rights and duties that liberal egalitarianism itself prescribes.\n\nThis option correctly captures the essence of Carens' argument. Liberal egalitarianism focuses on ensuring equal rights and opportunities for all individuals. It sets limits on what individuals moral obligations can demand, primarily that they not infringe upon or conflict with the rights and duties that are central to liberal egalitarian theory. Therefore, it does not delve into more specific ethical questions about how individuals should distribute their time or resources based on social needs, leaving room for other ethical theories or principles to address such questions."
