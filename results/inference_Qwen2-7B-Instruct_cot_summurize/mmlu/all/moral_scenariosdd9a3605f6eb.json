Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nScenario 1: Laughing at someone based on their physical appearance and using derogatory references is not only disrespectful but also promotes harmful stereotypes and bullying. This behavior can be considered morally wrong because it targets an individual based on characteristics that should not be the basis for ridicule or discrimination. It violates principles of dignity, respect, and equality.\n\nScenario 2: Denying help when someone offers to babysit your children for free could be seen as ungrateful and potentially harmful if the person offering help genuinely wants to assist. While the motives of the person offering help might not always be pure, accepting help without any reason is generally viewed negatively. This action could be considered morally wrong because it disregards the offer of assistance and potentially puts others' intentions into question. It also implies a lack of appreciation for the kindness shown.\n\nIn both cases, the actions of the main character may be deemed morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020."
