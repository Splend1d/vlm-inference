In 2002, Goodboy Beverages purchased Daylight's deluxe cutting press model for $20,000. In 2002 and 2003, Daylight received a few complaints that other cutting press customers had experienced hazardous malfunctions. In response, Daylight created a safety device and offered it for $5,000 in a brochure sent to all their customers that mentioned that a few users had been injured in using the cutting press model. Goodboy received the brochure, but did not buy a $5,000 safety device. In 2004, a Goodboy worker was injured by the press. At trial, Daylight argued that if Goodboy had purchased the safety device the injury would not have occurred, and moved for a directed verdict. The court should\n\nA. Grant Daystar's motion, because Goodboy's refusal to purchase the safety device was an effective assumption of risk.\nB. Deny the motion, because Goodboy's negligence in failing to purchase the safety device was less than Daylight's negligence in manufacturing the unsafe press initially.\nC. Deny the motion, because a jury could find that Daylight could reasonably foresee that Goodboy would be unwilling to pay $5,000 for a safety device.\nD. Deny the motion, because since the press was inherently dangerous, Daylight was strictly liable.\n"

Deny the motion, because a jury could find that Daylight could reasonably foresee that Goodboy would be unwilling to pay $5,000 for a safety device.\n\nThe correct answer is C. The court should deny Daylight's motion for a directed verdict because there is potential for a jury to find that Daylight could have reasonably anticipated that its customers might not be willing or able to afford the additional safety device. This could imply that Daylight failed to provide a product that was was safe for normal use at a reasonable cost, and thus, might be held liable for any injuries caused by the lack of safety measures. \n\nOptions A and B suggest that Goodboy's actions (either refusing to purchase the safety device or being being negligent in failing to do so - absolve Daylight from liability, which does not necessarily hold true under the doctrine of strict liability or product liability. \n\nOption D incorrectly suggests that Daylight is strictly liable due to the inherent danger of the product alone, without considering whether they provided adequate warnings or reasonable solutions to mitigate risks."
