This ability to walk upright allowed for more efficient movement and may have contributed to other evolutionary changes in the species.\n\nAs for the other options:\nA. A stable, long-lived species - While Homo erectus did exist for a relatively long period ( approximately 1.9 million years to 400,000 years ago, it's not clear if they were considered \"stable\" as their range and population sizes varied significantly over time.\nB. An unsuccessful, short-lived species - This is not accurate; Homo erectus was one of the longest-lasting hominin species and had a significant geographical range, although its survival was not without challenges.\nC. The first hominid to make and use stone tool - This title goes to earlier hominids like the Oldowan toolmakers, specifically the species Homo habilis, who are considered the first to create simple stone tools around 2.5 million years ago. Homo erectus did, however, develop more complex stone tools technologies, such as the Acheulean handaxe."
