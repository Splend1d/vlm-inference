Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \n\nScenario 1 involves cheering for a car crash, which can be seen as insensitive and potentially glorifying violent or dangerous behavior. This is generally considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2 involves drawing a friend doing something cool, which is a normal and friendly action that doesn't involve any moral wrongdoing. Drawing someone engaging in an activity they enjoy is not harmful and respects their autonomy and dignity."
