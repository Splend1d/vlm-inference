                    "text": "The fractional reserve banking system allows banks to create money by lending out a portion of deposited funds while keeping only a fraction (the reserve requirement - typically set by the central bank - as reserves. The creation of money through lending is possible because each loan leads to new deposits when the borrower deposits the borrowed amount into another bank account.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. If households that borrow redeposit the entire loan amounts back into the banks, this would not decrease the money creation capacity because it simply shifts the deposits within the banking system rather than increasing or decreasing them.\n\nB. Banks holding excess reserves actually decreases their ability to create money. This is because these reserves are not available for lending and thus do not contribute to the expansion of the money supply through the banking system.\n\nC. If banks lend all excess reserves to borrowing customers, this could potentially increase the money supply if the loans lead to further lending cycles ( a process known as the money multiplier effect. However, the term \"excess reserves\" implies that there are reserves beyond what is required by law, so lending all of these could be seen as a way to increase the money creation capacity, albeit limited by the demand for loans and other factors.\n\nD. Households increasing checking deposits in banks does not inherently lessen the money creation capacity. It could be part of a cycle where banks have more reserves, which might allow them to lend more, potentially increasing the money supply through the money multiplier effect.\n\nTherefore, the answer that directly \"lessens\" the fractional reserve banking system's ability to create money from the given options is:\n\nB. banks hold excess reserves."
