Schizophrenia affects individuals of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, and there is no evidence to suggest that white patients are more symptomatic than patients from other racial or ethnic groups. The prevalence and symptoms of schizophrenia can vary across different populations, but this variation is typically attributed to differences in access to healthcare, cultural attitudes towards mental illness, and socioeconomic factors rather than race or ethnicity itself."
