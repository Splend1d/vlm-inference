For each course, there are 10 choices of professors who can teach it (since any of the 10 professors can be chosen. Therefore, for 20 courses, there are \\(10^{20}\\) ways to assign the courses without considering that each professor must teach exactly 2 courses.\n\nHowever, this calculation includes scenarios where some professors might end up teaching more than 2 courses or not teaching at all, which is not allowed by our conditions. We need to subtract these invalid scenarios from our total.\n\nFor each professor, there are \\(\\binom{20}{2}\\) ways to choose which 2 courses they will teach out of the 20 available. This is because the professor has 20 options for the first course and 19 options for the second course, but since the order doesn't matter (it's choosing 2 out of 20, we divide by 2! to get the correct number of combinations. So, \\(\\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\\).\n\nNow, if each of the 10 professors independently chooses 2 courses from 20, the number of valid assignments is given by:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\binom{20}{2} \\right)^{10} = 190^{10} \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is not listed in the provided options directly, but the closest conceptually is:\n\n\\[ C. 10^{20} - 2^{10} \\]\n\nThis option does not directly match the calculation, but it seems to be attempting to subtract some number related to invalid configurations, possibly misunderstanding the direct calculation required for this scenario. The correct approach should lead to \\(190^{10}\\), which isn't explicitly listed in the options. \n\nGiven the options provided, none of them accurately represents the solution based on the explanation above. It appears there might have been a misunderstanding in constructing the options, as they don't align with standard combinatorial calculations for this type of problem."
