Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is\n\nA. inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.\nB. inadmissible, because the best evidence rule requires that the original contract always be used as evidence.\nC. admissible, because the duplicate is a carbon copy.\nD. admissible, because the original contract was lost.\n"

The best evidence rule generally states that the original document should be provided when it is in existence and can be obtained with reasonable diligence. However, if the original is genuinely lost, destroyed, or otherwise unavailable, courts may admit a duplicate, a certified copy, or other secondary evidence of the original document.\n\nThe key factors that would determine admissibility in this case would include:\n\n1. Whether the original contract was genuinely lost and not simply misplaced or discarded.\n2. The circumstances surrounding the loss; for example, if there were any suspicious activities leading to the loss.\n3. The reliability of the duplicate copy, such as its creation process ( in this case, the carbon copy should have been created immediately after the original was signed and before any potential loss.\n4. Any attempts made by the buyer to locate the original contract.\n5. The availability of witnesses who could attest to the original contract's contents.\n\nGiven these considerations, option D seems to be the most appropriate choice, assuming that all the necessary conditions for admissibility are met."
