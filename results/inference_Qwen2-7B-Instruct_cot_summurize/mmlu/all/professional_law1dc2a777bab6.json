A few moments later, a train conductor shouted, \"All aboard!\" to indicate that the train was about to depart the station. At that moment, a man, carrying a large cardboard box, came running through the station toward the train \"Wait for me!\" he shouted as he ran toward the train. The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, \"You can make it,\" and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train. The rocket's collision caused a shelf on the wall to fall. A large container of coffee that was on the shelf fell and hit a customer who was sitting in the shop and enjoying a cup of coffee. The coffee shop customer suffered an injury to her shoulder as a result of being hit by the container of coffee. If the coffee shop customer asserts a negligence claim against the railroad, which of the following elements of her claim will the plaintiff be unable to satisfy?\n\nA. Duty.\nB. Breach.\nC. Cause-in-fact.\nD. Proximate or legal causation.\n"

Proximate or legal causation.\n\nIn this scenario, the coffee shop customer may have a negligence claim against the railroad if they can prove that the railroad owed them a duty of care, breached that duty, and their injuries were both a cause-in-fact and proximately caused by the breach. However, the element that the plaintiff ( the coffee shop customer in this case - might struggle to satisfy is likely:\n\nD. Proximate or legal causation.\n\nThe proximate cause refers to the direct and foreseeable connection between the defendant's actions and the harm suffered by the plaintiff. In this situation, while the train's movement and the subsequent rocket launch could be seen as a cause of the incident, the more immediate and foreseeable cause leading to the injury would be the collision of the shelf and the falling coffee container. The rocket launch, although resulting from the initial incident, occurred several steps removed from the injury to the coffee shop customer. The injury was more directly and foreseeably caused by the shelf's fall due to the impact of the rocket rather than the train's movement itself. Therefore, the plaintiff might find it challenging to argue that the railroad's actions were the proximate cause of her injury, especially considering the intervening act of the shelf falling and the subsequent collision with the coffee container."
