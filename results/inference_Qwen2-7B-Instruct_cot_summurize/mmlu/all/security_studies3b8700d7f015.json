State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\nB. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\nC. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\nD. The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.\n"

Let's analyze each option provided:\n\nA. **State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state.** This statement acknowledges the growing recognition of TNC as a significant threat to national security and sovereignty. It reflects the shift in focus from local or national crime to crimes that cross borders and can undermine the stability and security of individual nations. Bilateral agreements and domestic efforts to combat these threats are crucial components of this approach.\n\nB. **With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking.** This option highlights the growing awareness among states of the need to cooperate internationally to address the challenges posed by TNC. Harmonization of laws, enhancing police capabilities, and strengthening international networks are essential tools in the fight against transnational crimes.\n\nC. **The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat.** The U.S.'s aggressive stance on drug-related crimes has indeed set a precedent for many countries in their approach to TNC. This response often involves a mix of bilateral cooperation, law enforcement efforts, and sometimes sanctions or incentives to encourage other nations to adopt stricter regulations and enforcement mechanisms.\n\nD. **The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.** This statement suggests that the heightened focus on security threats, especially after the 9/11 attacks, led to a more militarized approach in combating TNC. It also indicates the importance of addressing not just the symptoms but also the root causes of these crimes, through institutional reforms and international cooperation.\n\nIn summary, governments have responded to the threat of TNC through a combination of strategies including:\n1. Enhancing national security measures and cooperation across borders.\n2. Harmonizing legislation to create a more uniform legal framework.\n3. Increasing police capacity and networking to improve detection and prevention.\n4. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation, including sanctions and incentives.\n5. Addressing the terrorism-organized crime nexus through a militarized approach to law enforcement.\n6. Focusing on both enforcement and addressing underlying issues through international institutionalist responses.\n\nEach of these approaches plays a role in the multifaceted strategy to combat TNC effectively."
