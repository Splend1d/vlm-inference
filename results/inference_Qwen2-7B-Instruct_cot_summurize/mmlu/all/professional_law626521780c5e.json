                    "text": "The United States Congress passed, and the President signed, a law called the \"American Morality Leadership Act\" which limits the amount of makeup that women or men can wear in public and precludes the wearing of short dresses. Men over 65 must wear only brown or grey attire, while those under 65 must wear button down dress shirts with neckties, except for when they are exercising or working physically. The Act has other restrictions and specifications for dress and grooming mandates for men and women. A class action was filed to challenge the Act based on a constitutional attack. Which argument listed below more closely reflects the constitutional argument that is most likely to succeed in court?\n\nA. The law is unconstitutional because it violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\nB. The law is unconstitutional because it is primarily discriminatory against women's rights.\nC. The law is unconstitutional because it violates procedural due process.\nD. The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n"

The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n\nThis argument is most likely to succeed in court because it directly challenges the constitutionality of the law based on its potential violation of individual liberties enshrined in the Constitution. Fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression (which includes personal appearance and style, could be argued to be infringed upon by laws that mandate specific forms of dress or grooming.\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act deals with employment discrimination, not personal dress codes in public spaces. While discrimination might be an issue if the law disproportionately affects certain groups, this alone would not necessarily make the law unconstitutional. Similarly, procedural due process concerns might arise if there were inadequate legal procedures for challenging the law or its enforcement, but this is not the primary focus of the argument given the context provided.\n\nDiscrimination against women's rights is certainly a serious concern, but without specifics showing how the law discriminates against women beyond what is required for a gender-neutral application of law, this argument may not be as strong. The focus on individual fundamental rights is more likely to align with broader constitutional principles regarding personal liberty and autonomy, which are are more central to arguments about the constitutionality of laws that mandate specific forms of dress or grooming."
