Under this method, the most recently acquired items are considered to be the first ones sold.\n\nThe company's transactions for the month of January are:\n\n- **Beginning Inventory:** 20,000 units at $13 each.\n- **First Purchase:** 30,000 units at $15 each.\n- **Second Purchase:** 40,000 units at $17 each.\n- **Sales:** 50,000 units.\n\nGiven the LIFO method, the last units purchased (40,000 units at $17 each and then the first purchase's remaining units (10,000 units at $15 each are would be considered as sold first, in order to match the most recent costs to revenues.\n\n**Calculating Cost of Goods Sold (**\n\n1. **From the Second Purchase:** 40,000 units * $17 = $668,000\n2. **From the First Purchase:** 10,000 units * $15 = $150,000\n\nTotal **Cost of Goods Sold** = $668,000 + $150,000 = $818,000\n\nHowever, none of the options exactly matches this calculation. There might be a slight error in the options provided or in the interpretation of the question.
