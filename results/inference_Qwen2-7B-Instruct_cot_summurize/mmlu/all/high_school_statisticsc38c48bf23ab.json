This involves considering the two possible weather conditions and their respective probabilities.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(P(\\text{Dry}) = 1 - P(\\text{Wet}) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80\\)\n- \\(P(\\text{Accident|Dry}) = 0.002\\) ( (since 0.2% is equivalent to 0.002 when expressed as a decimal)\n- \\(P(\\text{Accident|Wet}) = 0.01\\)\n\nThe probability of an accident given the weather condition is known, so we multiply the probability of each weather condition by the probability of an accident occurring under that condition, and then sum these products:\n\n\\[P(\\text{Accident}) = P(\\text{Accident|Dry}) \\times P(\\text{Dry}) + P(\\text{Accident|Wet}) \\times P(\\text{Wet})\\]\n\n\\[P(\\text{Accident}) = ( 0.002 \\times 0.80 + 0.01 \\times 0.20\\]\n\n\\[P(\\text{Accident}) = 0.0016 + 0.002\\]\n\n\\[P(\\text{Accident}) = 0.0036\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48 today is 0.0036, which corresponds to option D."
