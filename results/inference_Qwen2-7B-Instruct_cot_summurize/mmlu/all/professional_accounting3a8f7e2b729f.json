The child does not have to consider the original giver's basis ($40,000) since it is not relevant for calculating the child's gain or loss upon disposition.\n\nHere's how to calculate the gain or loss:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gain or Loss} = \\text{Sale Price} - \\text{Child's Basis} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Gain or Loss} = \\$36,000 - \\$30,000 = \\$6,000 \\]\n\nSo, the child recognizes a gain of $6,000 upon selling the stock.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. $6,000 gain."
