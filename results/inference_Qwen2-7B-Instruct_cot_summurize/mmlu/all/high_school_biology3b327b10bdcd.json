Which of the following correctly states which phase of cellular respiration harvests the most energy and the correct explanation why?\n\nA. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.\nB. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively.\nC. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\nD. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2.\n"

The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\n\nTo elaborate:\n\nA. While the Krebs cycle does break down pyruvate into CO2, the majority of the energy released from this process is captured in the form of NADH and FADH2, not directly in the breakdown of pyruvate itself.\n\nB. Although FADH2 and NADH do indeed produce additional ATP in the electron transport chain (a part of oxidative phosphorylation), the statement incorrectly attributes this directly to the Krebs cycle rather than the subsequent stages of cellular respiration.\n\nC. This option is correct. Oxidative phosphorylation, which occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane, is where the majority of ATP is synthesized during cellular respiration. It takes advantage of the proton gradient generated by the electron transport chain, which drives the synthesis of ATP through a process called chemiosmosis. The energy stored in NADH and FADH2, which are produced in earlier stages like glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, is indeed fully utilized to create ATP in this phase.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect. Water is not \"broken down\" during cellular respiration; instead, oxygen is used in the final step of the electron transport chain, where protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient. This gradient then powers ATP synthase to synthesize ATP, not through breaking down water but through utilizing the energy from the flow of protons back across the membrane."
