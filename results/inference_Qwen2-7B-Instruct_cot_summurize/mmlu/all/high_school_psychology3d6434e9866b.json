In this case, after initially feeling the coldness of the water, your body adapts and your perception of the temperature becomes less noticeable.\n\nA. enjoying a song the more you hear it - This is an example of positive reinforcement, not sensory adaptation.\nB. responding immediately every time the fire alarm is sounded - This is an immediate response to a stimulus, not an adaptation to it.\nD. relying heavily on your hearing when you are walking down a dark corridor - This is an example of relying on one sense (hearing) over another in a specific environment, not sensory adaptation."
