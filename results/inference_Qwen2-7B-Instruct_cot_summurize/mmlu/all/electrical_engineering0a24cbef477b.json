Snubber circuit. \n\nSnubber circuits are are commonly used in SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier protection from high dv/dt (voltage rise rate) and dv/dt can cause unwanted switching events or damage to the device. The snubber circuit typically consists of a combination of a resistor and capacitor connected across the SCR, which helps to dissipate the energy and reduce the voltage spike."
