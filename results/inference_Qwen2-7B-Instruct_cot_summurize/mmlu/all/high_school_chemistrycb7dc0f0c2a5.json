Therefore, for the equation to hold true, either \u0394H ( (the enthalpy change) must be positive or \u0394S ( (the entropy change) must be negative, or both. This indicates that the reaction is endothermic ( (\u0394H > 0) and/or the system becomes less ordered ( (\u0394S < 0) when the reaction occurs. \n\nTherefore, under standard conditions, we can conclude that \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0. \n\nOptions A, C, and D are not correct because they imply that the reaction would be spontaneous under standard conditions ( which contradicts the initial statement that the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions."
