The formula to calculate the partial pressure of a given gas is:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{partial}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{gas}}}{M} \\cdot RT \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( m_{\\text{gas}} \\) is the mass of the gas,\n- \\( M \\) is the molar mass of the gas,\n- \\( R \\) is the ideal gas constant ( \\( 0.0821 \\, \\text{L} \\cdot \\text{atm} / (\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{K}) \\),\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin,\n- \\( P_{\\text{total}} \\) is the total pressure.\n\nHowever, since the volume is constant ( and the temperature is assumed to be constant for all gases, the ratio of the partial pressures is equal to the ratio of their masses ( because \\( P_{\\text{partial}} \\propto m_{\\text{gas}} \\).\n\nLet's first calculate the molar masses:\n- Nitrogen (N\u2082: \\( 28 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)\n- Argon Ar: \\( 40 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)\n- Water vapor H\u2082O: \\( 18 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)\n\nThe total mass of the gases is:\n\\[ m_{\\text{total}} = 28.0 + 40.0 + 36.0 = 104.0 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nSince the total pressure is 2.0 atm, and we need to find the partial pressure of nitrogen, we can use the fact that the partial pressure of nitrogen \\( P_{\\text{N}_2} \\) is proportional to its mass compared to the total mass:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{N}_2} = \\frac{m_{\\text{N}_2}}{m_{\\text{total}}} \\cdot P_{\\text{total}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{N}_2} = \\frac{28.0}{104.0} \\cdot 2.0 \\]\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{N}_2} = \\frac{28}{104} \\cdot 2.0 \\]\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{N}_2} = \\frac{7}{26} \\cdot 2.0 \\]\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{N}_2} = \\frac{14}{26} \\]\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{N}_2} = \\frac{7}{11} \\]\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{N}_2} \\approx 0.65 \\, \\text{atm} \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice to 0.65 atm is **not listed among your options**. It seems there might have been an error in either the calculation or the provided choices. However, based on the calculations, the correct partial pressure of nitrogen would be approximately 0.65 atm."
