It involves gathering information about target markets, consumer preferences, and competitor activities to inform strategic choices in marketing. For example, a company might conduct market research to decide on the best product features, pricing, promotion strategies, or distribution channels.\n\nB. **Is the collection and analysis of data from a sample or census of individuals or organizations.** This refers to the methods used within marketing research. Researchers collect data through various means such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, observational studies, and secondary data analysis. A census would involve collecting data from every member of the population, whereas a sample involves collecting data from a subset of the population to make inferences about the whole.\n\nC. **Includes all forms of market, opinion, and social research such as consumer and industrial surveys.** This statement highlights the scope of marketing research. It covers a wide range of studies designed to gather insights into various aspects of the market, including consumer behavior, market trends, customer satisfaction, brand awareness, and more. Industrial surveys might include research focused on B2B markets or specific industries.\n\nD. **Is work undertaken to determine either structural characteristics of the industry of concern.** This aspect of marketing research focuses on understanding the broader context of the industry, such as market size, growth rates, competitive landscape, regulatory environment, and technological trends. This type of research helps companies understand where they fit within their industry and what external factors might impact their operations and strategies.\n\nIn summary, marketing research is a comprehensive process that combines various methodologies and objectives to provide actionable insights for making informed marketing decisions. It can encompass both internal and external factors affecting a business, helping to guide strategy development and execution effectively."
