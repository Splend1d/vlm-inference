The epidemiological evidence shows that there are programmed differences in physiology that are linked to events both before birth and in early postnatal life. This concept is often referred to as \"Developmental Origins of Health and Disease\" ( or DOHaD. It suggests that the health and development of an individual during the prenatal period and immediately after birth can have long-lasting effects on their health throughout adulthood, potentially influencing the risk of developing conditions like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. This theory challenges the traditional view that such diseases are are solely determined by adult lifestyle factors, highlighting the importance of early life experiences."
