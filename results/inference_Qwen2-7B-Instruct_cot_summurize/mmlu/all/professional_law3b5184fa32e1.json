In 1960, the shopkeeper conveyed the property by general warranty deed as follows: \"The grantor hereby conveys the vacant lot to my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25. \" At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single. Thereafter, the sister married and had two sons. Subsequently, one son died in an automobile accident. Three years after that son's death, the sister had a daughter. In an appropriate action to determine the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented, title is in\n\nA. the friend only.\nB. the friend, the son, and the daughter.\nC. the friend, the son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born during her lifetime.\nD. the friend, the son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son.\n"

The deed further specifies that if one of these children dies before reaching the age of 25, then their estate should pass the remaining children of the sister. \n\nGiven the timeline:\n\n- The sister had two sons after marrying.\n- One of those sons died in an automobile accident.\n- Three years later, the sister had a daughter.\n\nAt the current time, assuming the sister has survived this entire period, she would have two surviving children: one son and one daughter. Any future children born to the sister after the death of the deceased son would not be entitled to inherit under the terms of the deed because they were not alive at the time of the death of the deceased son.\n\nThus, under the conditions set forth in the deed, the ownership rights to the vacant lot would be in the friend, the son, and the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son. This is because the deed specifies the inheritance within 21 years of the death of the deceased child, which is satisfied by the daughter being born three years after the son's death."
