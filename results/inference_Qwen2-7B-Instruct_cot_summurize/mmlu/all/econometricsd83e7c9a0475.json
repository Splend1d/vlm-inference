The difference between the actual value, y, and the fitted value, y-hat.\n\nTo clarify further:\n- A is incorrect because it refers to the difference between the actual value and the overall mean, not specifically to the fit of the model.\n- B is incorrect for the same reason as A; it refers to the difference between the fitted value and the overall mean, which is not how residuals are typically defined.\n- D is incorrect because while squaring the residuals ( i.e., calculating the squared differences ( is often done in regression analysis (specifically in the context of calculating the sum of squares error or when using metrics like the root mean squared error), this does not define what a residual itself is. The residual is simply the raw difference before squaring.\n\nIn a regression model, the fitted value \\( \\hat{y} \\) is the predicted value based on the model, and the actual value \\( y \\) is the observed value. The residual is thus \\( y - \\hat{y} \\)."
