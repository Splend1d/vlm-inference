Phosphocreatine ( (PC) is stored in the muscles and can rapidly donate a phosphate group to ADP (adenosine diphosphate), forming ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This process does not require oxygen and occurs very quickly, making it an efficient way to resynthesize ATP during the initial seconds of high-intensity exercise."
