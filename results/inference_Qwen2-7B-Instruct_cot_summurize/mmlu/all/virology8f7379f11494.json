Long filamentous threads\n\nThese viruses have a rod-like or filamentous shape, with their nucleocapsids (the core composed of viral RNA and proteins - extending into long fibers. This morphology is quite distinct from other types of viruses which might appear as spherical (icosahedral, for instance, or enveloped with a more complex morphology. Filoviruses do not possess floppy membranes without defined morphology (option D, and they are not typically described as very large ball-like structures (option A. Their elongated shape is a key feature in their taxonomy and contributes to their pathogenicity."
