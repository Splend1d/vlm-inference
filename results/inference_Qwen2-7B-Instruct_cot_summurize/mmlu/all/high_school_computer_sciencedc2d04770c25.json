Only elements that appear in both inputListl and inputList2\n\nExplanation: \nThe code segment iterates through each item in `inputList1` and checks if the item exists in `inputList2`. If the item is found in `inputList2`, it is appended to the `resultList`. Therefore, the final content of `resultList` will only contain elements that are present in both `inputList1` and `inputList2`."
