Cheating undermines fair play and trust in games and activities.\n\nIn Scenario 2, filling up the gas tank with gasoline is not inherently wrong unless there is an intent to cause harm or damage (such as by leaving the gas in a way that could lead to a fire or explosion. Without such intent, this action is not morally wrong; it's simply a safety issue."
