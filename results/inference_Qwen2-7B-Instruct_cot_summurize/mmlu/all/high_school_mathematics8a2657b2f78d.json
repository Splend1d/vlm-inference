We've correctly identified that \\(f(x) = 25\\) leads to \\(x = 3\\) or \\(x = -3\\), and thus, \\(g(25)\\) yields the same result regardless of the \\(x\\) value because it's directly evaluated as \\(g(25\\), not through \\(x\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation of the question's intent might have been misunderstood in the explanation above. The key insight is recognizing that once we find \\(f(x) = 25\\), we directly apply this to \\(g\\), which means:\n\nGiven \\(f(x) = 25\\), we found \\(g(25) = 13\\) when considering \\(x = 3\\) (or equivalently \\(x = -3\\) due to the nature of the problem setup.\n\nThe sum of all possible values of \\(g(25\\) is thus simply \\(13\\), as it's the only value computed based on the problem's constraints.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 13."
