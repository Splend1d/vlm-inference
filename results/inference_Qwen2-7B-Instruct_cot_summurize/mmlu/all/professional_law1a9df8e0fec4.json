                    "text": "Late one evening, a police department received a telephone call from an unidentified woman who reported hearing loud shrieks and screams from a neighboring home. The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city. After questioning several of the victim's friends and relatives, the police concluded that the husband was a prime suspect in the murder. Thus, two detectives went to question the husband about the killing. When they arrived at his apartment, the detectives persuaded the landlord to let them into his apartment. Finding no one inside, they searched the apartment. Before leaving, the detectives took a box of cereal, which they planned to use for a fingerprint comparison. The prints from the cereal box matched those found on the baseball bat. The police provided the grand jury investigating the murder with the fingerprint comparison. The husband is subsequently subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Before his scheduled appearance, the husband files a motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison, contending that the evidence was illegally obtained. His motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the warrantless search of the husband's apartment was unconstitutional.\nB. granted, because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.\nC. denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.\nD. denied, because the landlord had the apparent authority to authorize the search of the husband's apartment.\n"

Generally, if a person with apparent authority ( like a landlord, permits law enforcement onto private property, that consent can be considered valid. The fact that the prints from the cereal box matched those on the baseball bat does not automatically invalidate the search; it merely serves as evidence that could have been obtained legally under the circumstances described.\n\nThe exclusionary rule, which typically prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence in court, does not apply to grand jury proceedings. Therefore, option C (\"the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings\") is incorrect.\n\nOption A (\"the warrantless search of the husband's apartment was unconstitutional\") might seem plausible, but the key here is the landlord's apparent authority to allow the police entry. This means that the search could have been lawful under certain circumstances.\n\nOption B (\"the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence\") is also incorrect, given the lack of applicability of the exclusionary rule to grand jury hearings.\n\nThus, the most appropriate response is D, which acknowledges that the search was potentially lawful due to the landlord's consent, and the subsequent evidence obtained does not necessarily render it inadmissible in a grand jury proceeding."
