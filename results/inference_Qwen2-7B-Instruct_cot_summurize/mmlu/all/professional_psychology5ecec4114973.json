                    "text": "Option A is correct: During the second half of the first year, normal children increase the variety of sounds they produce, whereas deaf children may not show the same progression in vocalization variety. This difference can be attributed to the hearing abilities and the natural development of language skills in these two groups of children.\n\nTo further explain:\n\n- **A** is correct because hearing plays a crucial role in the development of speech and language. Normal children's ability to hear allows them to model sounds around them, leading to an expansion in the variety of sounds they can produce. Deaf children, who may not have the auditory feedback necessary for this process, might not show the same level of sound variation as their hearing peers.\n\n- **B** is incorrect because it incorrectly suggests that deaf children vocalize more than normal children during the first 6 months, which does not align with typical developmental patterns or research findings.\n\n- **C** is also incorrect because babbling is a common stage in speech development for both deaf and hearing infants. Babbling involves repeating sounds and syllables and is not exclusive to hearing infants.\n\n- **D** is incorrect because it contradicts the understanding that hearing infants typically show greater vocalization and sound development during the first 6 months compared to deaf infants due to the lack of auditory feedback for the latter.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for educators and caregivers working with deaf children, as it informs strategies for supporting their communication development, often through visual, tactile, and other non-auditory means."
