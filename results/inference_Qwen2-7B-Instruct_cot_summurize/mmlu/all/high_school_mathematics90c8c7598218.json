                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the product of the divisors of an integer relates to the integer itself. For any positive integer \\(n\\), if its prime factorization is given by:\n\n\\[ n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k^{e_k}, \\]\n\nthen the number of divisors of \\(n\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ (d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\ldots (e_k + 1). \\]\n\nMoreover, the product of all divisors of \\(n\\) can be expressed as \\(n^{d(n)/2}\\), because each divisor pairs with another divisor to multiply to \\(n\\), and there are \\(d(n)\\) such pairs.\n\nWe are given that the product of the divisors of \\(n\\) is \\(n^6\\), which means:\n\n\\[ n^{d(n)/2} = n^6. \\]\n\nFrom this, it follows that:\n\n\\[ d(n) = 12. \\]\n\nThis implies that the exponents in the prime factorization of \\(n\\) must be chosen so that their incremented values multiply to 12. The prime factorization of \\(n\\) could thus take various forms, but we aim for the smallest \\(n\\).\n\nThe prime factorization of 12 is \\(2^2 \\cdot 3\\), suggesting that \\(n\\) could be structured around these factors. To minimize \\(n\\), we should aim to keep the exponents small while still achieving the product of divisors being \\(n^6\\).\n\nLet's consider the possible configurations for \\(n\\) based on the prime factorization:\n\n- If \\(n = p^5\\), then \\(d(n) = 6\\), which doesn't satisfy our condition.\n- If \\(n = p^2q\\), where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct primes, then \\(d(n) = 3 \\times 2 = 6\\), which also doesn't satisfy our condition.\n- If \\(n = p^3q\\), then \\(d(n) = 4 \\times 2 = 8\\), which doesn't satisfy our condition.\n- If \\(n = p^2q^1r^1\\), where \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) are distinct primes, then \\(d(n) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12\\), which satisfies our condition.\n- If \\(n = p^4q\\), then \\(d(n) = 5 \\times 2 = 10\\), which doesn't satisfy our condition.\n- If \\(n = p^3q^2\\), then \\(d(n) = 4 \\times 3 = 12\\), which satisfies our condition and provides the smallest such \\(n\\) compared to others we've considered.\n\nConsidering the simplicity and the fact that \\(p=2\\) and \\(q=3\\) yield the smallest \\(n\\), the configuration \\(n = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 = 24\\) initially seems promising, but it does not directly fit our condition based on the direct calculation of divisors' product without proper consideration of the requirement for \\(n^6\\) being the product of its divisors.\n\nUpon closer examination, realizing the oversight, the correct approach involves directly addressing the requirement \\(d(n) = 12\\), aiming for minimal \\(n\\):\n\nFor \\(n = p^a \\cdot q^b\\), with \\(d(n) = (a+1)(b+1) = 12\\), considering minimal primes and aiming for the smallest \\(n\\) that meets the criteria:\n\n- Choosing \\(a=2, b=3\\) ( thus \\(n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^3 = 4 \\cdot 27 = 108\\) would indeed meet the criteria for \\(d(n)\\) being 12, providing a valid path forward but not necessarily minimal.\n\nThe key insight is recognizing the direct relationship between \\(n^6\\) being the product of its divisors and the divisor count formula. The minimal \\(n\\) that fits the criteria directly from the divisor count \\(d(n)=12\\) considering minimal primes and their powers aligns with the understanding of \\(n\\) being structured around its prime factors to meet the divisor product requirement directly.\n\nUpon reevaluation, considering the prime factorization directly leading to \\(d(n)=12\\) with minimal primes and their powers, the smallest \\(n\\) that meets the requirement directly, considering the divisor product equating to \\(n^6\\), aligns with configurations that efficiently utilize prime powers to achieve the divisor count of 1 12 without unnecessary steps or misinterpretation.\n\nCorrecting the oversight and focusing on achieving \\(d(n)=1"
