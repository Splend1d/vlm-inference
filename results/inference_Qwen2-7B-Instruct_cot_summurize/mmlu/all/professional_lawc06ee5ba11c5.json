Solicitation, attempted sale of narcotics, and false pretenses.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Solicitation**: By offering to sell marijuana (even if it's a controlled substance, which in many jurisdictions is illegal), the defendant has solicited or encouraged another person to commit the crime of selling marijuana.\n\n2. **Attempted Sale of Narcotics**: The defendant took steps toward completing the sale of marijuana, as evidenced by accepting money from the partygoer and providing something in exchange. Even though it turned out to be oregano, the intent and action taken were towards the completion of a narcotics sale.\n\n3. **False Pretenses**: The defendant misrepresented the contents of the bag, knowing it contained oregano instead of marijuana. This act of deception falls under the category of false pretenses, where someone misleads another with false statements to gain their property or trust.\n\nTherefore, all three charges apply in this scenario: solicitation, attempted sale of narcotics, and false pretenses."
