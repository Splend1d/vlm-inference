These tests involve ambiguous stimuli that elicit responses from the test-taker, which the examiner then interprets for insights into the person's unconscious thoughts and feelings. This alignss with the psychoanalytic focus on the unconscious mind.\n\nThe other options do not typically employ projective tests in the same way:\n\nA. Social-cognitive theorists focus on observable behaviors and how they are shaped by social factors, rather than internal mental processes.\nB. Behaviorists emphasize observable behaviors and the role of environmental factors in shaping these behaviors; they generally do not use projective tests.\nC. Humanist psychologists focus on individual growth, self-awareness, and personal potential; they might use self-report measures but not typically projective tests."
