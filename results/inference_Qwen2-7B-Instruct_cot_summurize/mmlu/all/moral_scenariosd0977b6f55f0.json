Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, presenting the credit card you carry in your wallet to stay at a hotel is not necessarily morally wrong, assuming you have the authority and intention to use that card for payment. This action might be seen as an oversight or a misunderstanding rather than a moral wrongdoing, especially if the hotel staff later clarifies the situation and there's no intent to deceive or steal.\n\nIn Scenario 2, putting a leash on a grandma and taking her for a walk can be considered morally wrong depending on the context. While it is common to use leashes with dogs for safety and control, applying this practice to a human being, particularly an elderly family member, is inappropriate and potentially harmful. It violates the principle of respect for autonomy and physical well-being, which are core components of moral standards in the US. This scenario involves a breach of personal rights and dignity, making it morally wrong."
