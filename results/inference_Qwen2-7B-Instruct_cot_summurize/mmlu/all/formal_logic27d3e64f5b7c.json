This accurately captures the statement \"No artifacts are people\". \n\nA. ~Pa - This only negates that a specific artifact (a is not a person, which doesn't generalize to all artifacts.\n  \nC. ~Ap - This states that there is no person who is an artifact, but it doesn't assert that all artifacts are not people, just that one particular artifact is not a person.\n\nD. (\u2200x)(Ax \u2022 ~Px) - This states that for all x, x is an artifact and x is not a person. While this is logically equivalent to the correct answer, it's often considered less readable or intuitive because of the conjunction '\u2022' being used instead of an implication '\u2283'."
