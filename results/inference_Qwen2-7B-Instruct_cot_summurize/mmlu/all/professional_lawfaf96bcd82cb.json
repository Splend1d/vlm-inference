He was permitted to borrow law books and legal treatises to take home for his own personal use. One afternoon, the law student was preparing a brief in the firm's law library when he noticed a book lying on the conference table. Making sure no one was watching him, he took the book and placed it in his briefcase. He planned to take the book home that night with the intention of not returning it. If the law student is subsequently charged with larceny of the book, which of the following claims, if true, would LEAST aid him in his defense?\n\nA. The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.\nB. He intended to return the book after reading it.\nC. The law firm had given him possession of the book.\nD. The law firm had given him custody of the book.\n"

He intended to return the book after reading it.\n\nThis claim would least aid the defense because it still acknowledges the act of taking the book without permission, but with the intent to return it. Larceny typically involves taking property without the owner's consent and with the intent not to return it. Even if the intent was to return the book, the initial act of taking it without permission constitutes the crime of larceny."
