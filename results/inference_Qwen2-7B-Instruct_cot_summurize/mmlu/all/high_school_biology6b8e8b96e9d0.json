Among the options given:\n\n- A. Long loops of Henle help in maximizing water reabsorption from the urine, which is beneficial for water conservation.\n- B. Storage of water in fatty tissues is another way for animals to retain water in environments where it's scarce.\n- C. Large ears aid in heat dissipation by increasing surface area for evaporation, thus helping to cool the body temperature.\n- D. However, short loops of Henle would actually minimize water reabsorption, leading to increased water loss through urine. This is counterintuitive to survival in a hot arid environment, where conserving water is crucial.\n\nTherefore, option D is the least likely adaptive feature to be found in an animal living in such an environment."
