But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nThe policy described most immediately led to\n\nA. peace between Indian tribes and white settlers.\nB. the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.\nC. the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.\nD. a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years.\n"

                    "text": "The passage you've quoted is from Benjamin Franklin's examination before Parliament in 1776, where he discusses the issues surrounding taxation and representation for the American colonies. This context suggests that the policy being discussed is the British taxation policies leading up to the American Revolution.\n\nNone of the options A, B, C, or D directly refer to the events or policies described in Franklin's quote. However, the quote reflects the broader tensions between the British Parliament's taxation policies and the colonists' rights, particularly regarding the Stamp Act, which Franklin mentions. \n\nThe Stamp Act (1763) was indeed one of the key acts that led to colonial unrest and protest, including the Boston Tea Party. It imposed a direct tax on the colonies and required them to pay taxes on various printed materials, such as newspapers, legal documents, and playing cards. The act was designed to raise revenue from the colonies, but it was highly unpopular because it was seen as a violation of the principle that \"no taxation without representation\" meant that the colonists should not be taxed by a Parliament in which they had no elected representatives.\n\nGiven this context, none of the provided options (A, B, C, or D directly correspond to the immediate effects of the policy described in Franklin's quote. However, the quote itself reflects the broader historical backdrop leading up to significant events like the American Revolution. Therefore, the most fitting answer would be a conceptual acknowledgment that the policy described contributed to the growing discontent among the American colonists that ultimately led to significant conflict with Britain."
