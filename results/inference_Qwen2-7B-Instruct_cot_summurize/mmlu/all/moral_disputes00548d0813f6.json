Hooks and others have critiqued the notion that legality automatically implies morality or safety, especially in contexts where laws may not adequately address systemic issues of oppression, such as racism, sexism, and violence against women. In the United States, this can manifest in situations where laws do not sufficiently protect against harmful practices, and societal norms might overlook or normalize these issues because they are deemed legal."
