                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The domestic purchasing power of a currency is inversely related to the price level. This means that as the price level (or inflation) increases, the purchasing power of the currency decreases. Conversely, if the price level decreases, the purchasing power of the currency increases.\n\nTo elaborate further:\n- A: The cost of living does influence purchasing power, but it's not the direct factor that determines the purchasing power in terms of currency value. The cost of living can change due to various factors, including changes in prices, which are also affecting purchasing power.\n- B: The savings rate might affect an individual's ability to purchase goods and services, but it doesn't directly determine the overall purchasing power of a currency in the economy.\n- C: Correct. The purchasing power of a currency is inversely proportional to the price level. When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, the purchasing power of the currency has decreased. Conversely, when the price level falls, the purchasing power of the currency increases because each unit of currency buys more goods and services.\n- D: Economic growth can increase the purchasing power of a currency indirectly by increasing the overall production and income levels in the economy. However, this effect is not direct and depends on several other factors such as inflation, interest rates, and how the growth is distributed among the population. Also, rapid economic growth without corresponding productivity gains or stable prices could lead to inflation, decreasing the purchasing power of the currency.\n\nTherefore, the key relationship determining the purchasing power of a currency domestically is its inverse relationship with the price level."
