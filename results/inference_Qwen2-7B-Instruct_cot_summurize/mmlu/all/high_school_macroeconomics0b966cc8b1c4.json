A decrease in the required reserve ratio\n\nWhen the required reserve ratio decreases, banks are required to hold less of their deposits as reserves and can lend out more. This leads to an increase in the money supply as more money circulates in the economy. \n\nB. An increase in the discount rate: This usually has the opposite effect - it discourages banks from borrowing from the central bank, leading to a decrease in the money supply.\n\nC. The selling of bonds by the Federal Reserve: This is typically done when the Fed wants to reduce the money supply ( it takes money out of circulation.\n\nD. An increase in the fraction of deposits that must be held by banks: This would also decrease the money supply as banks have less funds available for lending."
