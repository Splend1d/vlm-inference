The Battle of Badr.\n\nThe Battle of Badr, fought in 624 CE, was a significant early victory for the Muslims against the Quraysh tribe, who were the main opponents of Prophet Muhammad and his followers in Mecca. This battle boosted the morale of the Muslim community and solidified their resolve in their religious mission. It also led to negotiations between the Muslims and the Quraysh, which resulted in the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah.\n\nHowever, the conversion of Mecca itself occurred later, after several years of further conflict and negotiations, culminating in the conquest of Mecca in 630 CE. This event, known as the Conquest of Mecca, marked a significant turning point in Islamic history, as it brought about the end of the pagan practices associated with the Kaaba (the most sacred site in Islam) and solidified the dominance of Islam in Arabia."
