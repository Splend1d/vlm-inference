This acceleration does not affect its horizontal velocity. Therefore, one second after being fired, its horizontal velocity remains 10 m/s.\n\nHowever, during that same time, the cannonball also falls vertically under the influence of gravity. The formula for the vertical displacement \\(y\\) due to free fall under gravity with an initial velocity of zero is:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\]\n\nwhere \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity ( approximately \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\), and \\(t\\) is the time elapsed.\n\nAfter one second, the vertical displacement is:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 1^2 = 4.9 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nThe total speed \\(v\\) of the cannonball can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, considering the horizontal velocity (\\(v_x = 10 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)) and the vertical velocity (\\(v_y = gt = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)):\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 + 9.8^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 96.04} = \\sqrt{196.04} \\approx 14 \\, \\text{m/s}\\]\n\nSo, the cannonball's speed one second after being fired is approximately 14 m/s."
