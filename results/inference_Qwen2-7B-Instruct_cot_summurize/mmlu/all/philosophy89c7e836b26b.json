It's a foundational concept in discussions about justice and fairness in ethics.\n\nOptions A and C incorrectly suggest that moral rules must always apply universally or only to certain members of a group, respectively, without exception. This overlooks the complexity of moral decision-making, where context and individual circumstances can necessitate exceptions to general rules.\n\nOption D asserts that moral rules are the same in every society, which is not accurate. While there are universal ethical principles that most societies recognize, such as the wrongness of harming others or telling the truth, the specific moral rules and their application can vary significantly across different cultures due to differing historical, social, and religious contexts."
