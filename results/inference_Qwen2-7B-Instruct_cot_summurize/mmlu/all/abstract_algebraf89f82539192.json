This statement is correct because one of the definitions of a basis in a finite-dimensional vector space \\(V\\) is that it is a linearly independent set of vectors that spans \\(V\\). Therefore, any linearly independent set of vectors in \\(V\\) can be extended to a basis of \\(V\\), meaning that it can be expanded by adding more vectors (which must be linearly independent to maintain the basis property) until it spans the entire space.\n\nStatement 2: True. This statement is also correct. The number of elements in any basis of a finite-dimensional vector space is the same. This number is called the dimension of the vector space. So, if \\(B_1\\) and \\(B_2\\) are both bases for the same vector space, they must have the same number of vectors, hence \\(|B_1| = |B_2|\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
