                    "text": "To find the least perfect square with three different prime factors, we need to understand what makes a number a perfect square and what prime factors mean.\n\nA perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself. For example, \\(16 = 4 \\times 4\\), so \\(16\\) is a perfect square. A prime factor of a number is a prime number that divides that number exactly, without leaving a remainder.\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square and have three different prime factors, each of those prime factors must appear in the factorization of the number an even number of times (because it's squared to contribute to the perfect square nature.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n- **A. 300**  \n  The prime factorization of \\(300\\) is \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2\\). Here, \\(2\\) and \\(5\\) appear twice, but \\(3\\) only once, making it not a perfect square with three distinct prime factors squared.\n\n- **B. 9**  \n  This is \\(3^2\\), which has only one prime factor squared, so it doesn't meet the criteria of having three distinct prime factors.\n\n- **C. 900**  \n  The prime factorization of \\(900\\) is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2\\). This number does have three distinct prime factors, and each appears at least twice, making it a perfect square. It is also the smallest number among our options that fits this description.\n\n- **D. 666**  \n  The prime factorization of \\(666\\) is \\(2 \\times 3^2 \\times 37\\). This number has three distinct prime factors, but it is not a perfect square because not all prime factors are squared.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 900**, as it is the least perfect square with three different prime factors."
