It does not directly increase the speed of muscle contractions (A) or significantly affect the breakdown of phosphocreatine stores  (B), although it can improve overall energy production systems in muscles. Anaerobic energy generation is typically associated with short bursts of high-intensity activity rather than endurance exercises, which generally focus on aerobic metabolism  D)."
