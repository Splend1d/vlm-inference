Paget's disease, also known as Paget's osteopathy or Paget's bone disease, is a chronic disorder that affects the bones. It is characterized by abnormal bone remodeling leading to weakened and deformed bones. Symptoms can include bone pain, deformities of long bones (which may give a bowing appearance (option A), and fractures (option D). However, heart failure is generally not considered a recognized complication of Paget's disease. While it can affect individuals with severe bone loss due to the increased risk of falls and fractures, heart failure is more commonly associated with other conditions such as coronary artery disease or hypertension."
