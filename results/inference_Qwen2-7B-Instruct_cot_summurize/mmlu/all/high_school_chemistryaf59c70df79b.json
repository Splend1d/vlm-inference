                    "text": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we first need to calculate the mass of oxygen in the compound. We can do this by subtracting the masses of carbon and hydrogen from the total mass:\n\nMass of Oxygen = Total Mass - (Mass of Carbon - Mass of Hydrogen\n= 29.05 g - 18.02 g - 3.03 g\n= 7.998 g\n\nNext, we convert each mass to moles using their respective molar masses:\n\n- Molar mass of Carbon (C = 12.01 g/mol\n- Molar mass of Hydrogen (H = 1.008 g/mol\n- Molar mass of Oxygen O = 16.00 g/mol\n\nMoles of Carbon = Mass of Carbon / Molar mass of Carbon\n= 18.02 g / 12.01 g/mol\n= 1.500 mol\n\nMoles of Hydrogen = Mass of Hydrogen / Molar mass of Hydrogen\n= 3.03 g / 1.008 g/mol\n= 3.002 mol\n\nMoles of Oxygen = Mass of Oxygen / Molar mass of Oxygen\n= 7.998 g / 16.00 g/mol\n= 0.567 mol\n\nNow, we divide each mole value by the smallest number of moles to get the simplest whole number ratio:\n\n- For Carbon: 1.500 mol / 0.567 mol \u2248 2.68\n- For Hydrogen: 3.002 mol / 0.567 mol \u2248 5.32\n- For Oxygen: 0.567 mol / 0.567 mol = 1\n\nWe round these numbers to the nearest whole number, which gives us a ratio of approximately 3:5:1 for Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the empirical formula of the compound is C3H5O.\n\nHowever, it seems that none of the provided answer choices exactly match this empirical formula. It's possible there might be a slight error or rounding discrepancy in the calculation or the given options. Based on the calculation process and results, the closest answer choice would be:\n\nB. C3H6O\n\nBut note that the calculated empirical formula (C3H5O) does not exactly match any of the provided choices."
