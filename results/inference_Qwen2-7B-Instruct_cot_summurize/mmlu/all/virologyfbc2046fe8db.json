As negative strand RNA viruses\n\nCalciviruses, such as the Norwalk virus and hepatitis A virus, are indeed negative-strand RNA viruses. This means that their RNA genome serves as a template for the synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) during the replication process. The viral RNA is first replicated using the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which synthesizes a complementary RNA strand. Then, this complementary RNA is used to synthesize a DNA strand through a process called reverse transcription catalyzed by the same enzyme. This DNA is then integrated into the host cell's genome or transcribed back into RNA, which can be translated into viral proteins."
