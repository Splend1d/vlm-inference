Increases    Increases    Decreases\n\nExplanation: Contractionary monetary policy is used by central banks to reduce the money supply in an economy, typically when there is concern about inflation or economic overheating. This is achieved through various measures, one of which can be increasing the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate that commercial banks pay when they borrow from the central bank ( in this case, it's the central bank lending to them at a higher cost, thus making borrowing more expensive for banks. Banks then tend to pass on these higher costs to consumers and businesses, leading to an increase in the nominal interest rates across the board.\n\nHigher interest rates discourage borrowing and spending, which directly impacts aggregate demand - the total demand for goods and services in an economy. As borrowing becomes more expensive, consumers and businesses are less likely to take out loans for investments or purchases, thereby decreasing the overall demand in the economy. The goal of contractionary monetary policy is to cool down an overheated economy by reducing spending and inflation pressures."
