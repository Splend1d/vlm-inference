This leads to a persistent shortage of the good (in this case, good X. The other options do not directly result from an effective price ceiling on good X:\n\nA. A surplus would occur if the price ceiling were set above the equilibrium price, allowing more units to be supplied than demanded.\n\nC. An increase in the demand for good Y, a substitute for good X, could happen as consumers switch to a cheaper alternative due to the shortage of good X, but this is not a direct effect of an effective price ceiling on good X.\n\nD. The demand for good Z, a complement with good X, would likely not change directly because of a price ceiling on good X; however, if good X becomes scarce or expensive due to the price ceiling, the overall demand for goods that pair well with X might indirectly decrease if consumers reduce their consumption of X and its complements. But this is a complex economic relationship and not a guaranteed outcome of a price ceiling on X alone."
