                    "text": "As a result of the increasing northward movement of the population from a nearby city, a town enacted a zoning ordinance restricting present and future land use in the town to single family dwellings, except in the downtown commercial shopping area, and except for a small area in which multifamily dwellings not over 40 feet in height were permitted. In addition, all new construction or exterior modifications of existing buildings required prior approval of an aesthetic control board. The zoning ordinance defined the term \"family\" in the context of single family dwellings to mean only one or more persons related by marriage, blood, or adoption, thereby excluding unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single residence unit. The enabling legislation contained the following provision:\"This enactment is necessary to preserve the physical and social homogeneity of this community, and preserve and protect the quality of life of its citizens. \"A town resident owns a single family residence with five bedrooms. Prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance, the resident leased the premises on a month-to-month basis to a boyfriend and girlfriend and three other male law students. The five individuals are all unmarried and attend the nearby law school. The resident now brings suit to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance against himself. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance provision that prohibits unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single family residence?\n\nA. The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The zoning ordinance would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the resident's rights under the contract clause.\nD. The zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power.\n"

The zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power.\n\nThe police power is a fundamental aspect of state authority that allows states and municipalities to enact laws aimed at promoting public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. Zoning ordinances are a common exercise of this power, allowing local governments to regulate land use and development within their jurisdiction.\n\nIn assessing the constitutionality of such a zoning ordinance, courts typically consider whether the regulation serves a legitimate government interest and whether it is rationally related to that interest. In the context of zoning, this often involves determining if the regulation promotes a significant governmental interest, such as maintaining community character, preserving property values, or preventing overcrowding.\n\nGiven the nature of the police power, courts have generally been deferential to zoning decisions made by municipalities, especially when they aim to maintain certain standards of community living, such as family composition. The fact that the ordinance defines \"family\" in a way that excludes unrelated, unmarried persons does not automatically make it unconstitutional, but rather depends on the justification provided by the municipality and the specific circumstances of the case.\n\nFor instance, if the town argues that maintaining a \"physical and social homogeneity\" supports the well-being and quality of life of its citizens, this might be considered a legitimate goal. However, the application of this goal through the exclusion of unrelated, unmarried persons could still be scrutinized to ensure it does not amount to discrimination or is otherwise unreasonable or arbitrary.\n\nWithout delving into the specifics of the case law or the exact reasoning applied by courts in similar cases, it's reasonable to conclude that the provision could potentially be upheld under the state's police power, given the broad scope of this authority and the potential justifications municipalities may offer for such zoning practices. However, each case is unique, and the final determination would depend on the specific facts and legal arguments presented."
