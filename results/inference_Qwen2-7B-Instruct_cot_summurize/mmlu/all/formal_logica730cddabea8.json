J \u2261 ~K ( (Equivalence between J and the negation of K)\n2. J \u2228 L ( (Disjunction between J and L)\n3. ~K / L ( (Implication from the negation of K to L)\n\nLet's start by creating the truth table:\n\n| J | K | L | ~K | J \u2261 ~K | J \u2228 L | ~K / L |\n|---|---|---|----|--------|-------|--------|\n| T | T | F | F  |  F     |  T    |  F     |\n| T | T | T | F  |  F     |  T    |  T    |\n| T | F | F | T  |  T    |  T    |  T    |\n| T | F | T | T  |  T    |  T    |  T    |\n| F | T | F | F  |  F    |  F    |  T    |\n| F | T | T | F  |  F    |  T    |  T    |\n| F | F | F | T  |  T    |  F    |  F    |\n| F | F | T | T  |  T    |  T    |  T    |\n\nNow let's analyze the argument:\n- The first two statements are premises, and the third statement is the conclusion.\n- The argument claims that if J is equivalent to the negation of K, and J is either true or L is true, then it follows that if K is not true, then L must be true.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion is true whenever all the premises are true.\n\nLooking at the truth table, we can see that there are no rows where:\n1. J \u2261 ~K is true ( (i.e., J has the same truth value as ~K)\n2. J \u2228 L is true ( (i.e., either J is true or L is true)\n3. ~K / L is false ( (i.e., if K is not true, then L must be true)\n\nIn every row where both J \u2261 ~K and J \u2228 L are true, the implication ~K / L is also true. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: A. Valid"
