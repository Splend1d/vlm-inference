Economic, Legal, Ethical, and Philanthropic.\n\nThese four categories encompass the various dimensions of Corporate Social Responsibility ( (CSR) as outlined by John Elkington in his concept of the \"Triple Bottom Line\" in 1994, which was later expanded to include the fourth pillar - Philanthropy. Each category represents a different aspect of how a company can contribute positively to society:\n\n- **Economic**: This refers to a company's responsibility to generate profits for its stakeholders while also considering the economic impact on the community and environment.\n- **Legal**: It involves ensuring compliance with all laws and regulations related to labor rights, environmental protection, and other legal obligations.\n- **Ethical**: This pertains to a company's commitment to acting responsibly and morally, beyond just legal requirements, in terms of issues like fair trade, human rights, and transparency.\n- **Philanthropic**: This category focuses on charitable activities and contributions to the welfare of society, often through donations or volunteer work."
