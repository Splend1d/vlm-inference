This means that the same amount of money buys fewer goods and services than before. As prices increase, the value of their income decreases, leading to a decline in their standard of living. Debtors with fixed interest rates ( and property owners may also be affected, but not necessarily more so than those with fixed money incomes. Investors in gems, coins, and stamps might benefit if their investments appreciate at a rate higher than inflation, but this is not guaranteed and depends on various market conditions."
