According to Faraday's law of induction, a voltage will be induced in a wire loop whenever there is a change in the magnetic flux through the loop. The magnetic flux is defined as the product of the magnetic field strength and the area enclosed by the loop, typically perpendicular to the field. Thus, if the magnetic field changes (increases or decreases, for example, a voltage will be induced in the wire loop."
