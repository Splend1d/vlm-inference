                    "text": "When expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are used simultaneously, it typically aims to stimulate economic growth. Expansionary fiscal policy involves actions like decreasing taxes or increasing government spending, which can directly boost consumer purchasing power and encourage investment. Expansionary monetary policy, often referred to as \"easy money\" policy, involves lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply, making borrowing cheaper and encouraging more spending and investment.\n\nGiven these policies goals, the correct answer to how these policies combinations would likely affect unemployment and real GDP in the short term is:\n\nC. Interest rates will remain relatively constant.\n\nThis is because while monetary policy might initially lead to lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, the simultaneous use of fiscal policy could counteract this effect by potentially raising government spending or reducing taxes, thus stimulating the economy without necessarily pushing interest rates up significantly, depending on various economic conditions and the effectiveness of each policy.\n\nUnemployment and real GDP would likely decrease, as the combined effect of increased spending and lower borrowing costs could boost economic activity. However, inflation could increase if demand grows faster than the economy's ability to produce goods and services, but this is not guaranteed and depends on the specifics of the economy and the policies implementation. Therefore, none of the options A, B, or D accurately captures the nuanced effects of these policies combinations, with option C being the most accurate based on the information provided."
