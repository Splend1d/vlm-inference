Diagnostic Algorithm: This is a set of rules or procedures used to determine whether a condition or disease is present based on various data inputs such as symptoms, test results, or other relevant information.\n\nB. Staff Members: These are the individuals who operate and maintain the surveillance system, collect and analyze data, and ensure that the system functions correctly and provides accurate information.\n\nC. Sampling Frame: This refers to the complete list of elements or units from which the sample is drawn. In the context of surveillance systems, it's crucial to have a comprehensive and representative sampling frame to ensure that the collected data accurately reflects the population being studied.\n\nTherefore, all three components (a diagnostic algorithm, staff members, and a sampling frame\u2014are essential for an effective surveillance system."
