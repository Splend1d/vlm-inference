There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas.\nC. U.S. markets will have access to less expensive beef.\nD.

There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas. \n\nClear-cutting of tropical rainforests can lead to significant changes in local climates, including reduced rainfall. This is because trees play a crucial role in the water cycle by absorbing moisture from the soil, transpiring it through their leaves, and releasing it into the atmosphere. When large numbers of trees are removed, this process is disrupted, potentially leading to decreased humidity and rainfall in the area, as well as increased temperatures (a phenomenon known as the \"urban heat island effect\" but applicable to deforested areas as well. This can have cascading effects on local ecosystems, water availability, and weather patterns."
