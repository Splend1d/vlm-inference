It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich of the following presidents was most involved in Latin American politics in the twentieth century?\n\nA.

Theodore Roosevelt, as he was active during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Roosevelt played a significant role in Latin American affairs through his \"Big Stick\" diplomacy, which included the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, supporting U.S. intervention in the Caribbean and Central America, and backing the construction of the Panama Canal.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt's actions, particularly his support for the Panama Canal and his interventions in Latin American politics, set a precedent for future U.S. involvement in the region. However, it's important to note that none of the presidents listed were most involved in Latin American politics specifically during the 20th century, as they all served before that period."
