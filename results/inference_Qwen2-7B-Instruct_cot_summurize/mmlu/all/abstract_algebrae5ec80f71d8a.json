                    "text": "To address these statements, let's consider the properties of groups and their elements' orders in detail:\n\n### Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The order of an element \\(g\\) in a group is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(g^n = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element of the group.\n- An element of order 10 means \\(g^{10} = e\\) but \\(g^k \\neq e\\) for any \\(1 \\leq k < 10\\).\n- By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup (and thus the order of any element) must divide the order of the group. However, this statement does not directly provide a guarantee about the existence of elements of specific orders based on the existence of one element of order 10.\n- While the existence of an element of order 10 does not automatically imply the existence of elements of orders 1, 2, and 5, it's worth noting that:\n  - An element of order 1 corresponds to the identity element, which always exists in any group.\n  - For an element of order 2, consider \\(h = g^5\\). Then \\(h^2 = (g^{10} = e\\), so \\(h\\) has order 2.\n  - For an element of order 5, we can take \\(k = g^2\\). Since \\(g^{10} = e\\), \\(k^5 = (g^{10} = e\\), and \\(k\\) cannot be the identity or have order 2 ( (because \\(g^2\\) squared is not the identity, and \\(g^2\\) to the power of 4 would give us \\(g^8\\), which is also not the identity). Therefore, \\(k\\) has order 5.\n  \n**Conclusion for Statement 1:** This statement is **True** because given an element of order 10, we can construct elements of orders 1, 2, and 5 using powers of the original element.\n\n### Statement 2: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Let \\(a\\) be an element of order 2 and \\(b\\) be an element of order 3.\n- We know that \\(a^2 = e\\) and \\(b^3 = e\\).\n- Consider the element \\(ab\\). The order of \\(ab\\) might not be immediately clear, but if \\(ab\\) has order 6, then \\((ab)^6 = e\\).\n- To show that \\(ab\\) indeed has order 6, we need to demonstrate that no smaller positive integer \\(n < 6\\) satisfies \\((ab)^n = e\\).\n- We can check:\n  - \\((ab)^1 = ab\\)\n  - \\((ab)^2 = abab\\)\n  - \\((ab)^3 = ababab\\)\n  - \\((ab)^4 = abababab\\)\n  - \\((ab)^5 = ababababab\\)\n  - \\((ab)^6 = abababababab = e\\) because \\(a^2 = b^3 = e\\).\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 2:** This statement is **True** because given elements of orders 2 and 3, their product indeed has order 6 under certain conditions (specifically, when \\(ab \\neq ba\\), which is common in non-commutative groups).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct answer is **C. True, False**. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in interpreting the options provided since both statements are actually true based on the analysis. Given the structure of the question, the intended correct answer might have been misinterpreted. Based on the detailed analysis, both statements are indeed true."
