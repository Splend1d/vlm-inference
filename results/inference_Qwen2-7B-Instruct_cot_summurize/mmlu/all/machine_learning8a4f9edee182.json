It's useful in scenarios like customer segmentation, image recognition, anomaly detection, etc., but not for tasks like predicting continuous values (A), detecting fraud (which usually requires supervised learning and anomaly detection techniques), or training robots (which involves reinforcement learning or other forms of machine learning).\n\nFor A) Predicting the amount of rainfall, regression models would be more appropriate.\nFor B) Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, anomaly detection algorithms could be used.\nFor C) Training a robot to solve a maze, reinforcement learning algorithms might be more suitable.\n\nSo, the correct answer is that none of the tasks listed can be best solved using clustering."
