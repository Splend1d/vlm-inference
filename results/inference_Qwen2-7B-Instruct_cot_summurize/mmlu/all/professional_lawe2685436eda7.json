Each of these powers must be used in conjunction with other powers granted to Congress by the Constitution or in accordance with the principles of the Constitution to create federal law. \n\nFor example, Congress may use its taxing power to generate revenue for the government, but this revenue cannot be used to support federal law without also using its spending power to allocate funds to specific programs or initiatives. Similarly, Congress may use its commerce power to regulate interstate commerce, but this regulation cannot be used to support federal law without also using other powers such as the necessary and proper power to carry out the regulation effectively."
