Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \nIn Scenario 1, paying for someone to give you the answers to your homework is generally considered cheating and goes against academic integrity. It undermines the purpose of education, which is to learn and understand the material, not just pass tests. This action can also negatively impact the tutor, who might be violating their ethical or contractual obligations by providing such assistance.\n\nIn Scenario 2, using an automated program to complete a Mechanical Turk ( (MTurk) HIT is typically not considered morally wrong, assuming that the use of automation is within the terms and conditions set by Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. MTurk allows users to post tasks (or \"HITs\") that anyone with an account can complete for payment. There is no explicit prohibition against automating these tasks, although it depends on the specific rules and guidelines provided by the task poster. However, it's important to ensure that any automation respects copyright laws, does not violate privacy, and complies with all relevant regulations."
