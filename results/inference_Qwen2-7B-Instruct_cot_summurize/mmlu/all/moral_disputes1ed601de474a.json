The value of autonomy is often associated with the making of significant life decisions, such as those involving personal relationships, career choices, or major lifestyle changes. However, autonomy can also be relevant to decisions about one's health and well-being, including the choice to undergo treatment or to forgo it.\n\nB. Terminally ill patients may face physical limitations that can affect their capacity to make decisions, especially if they are experiencing severe pain, cognitive impairment, or are in a state of unconsciousness. This argument suggests that the patient's autonomy might be compromised due to their medical condition, making their choices potentially less valid or less reflective of their true wishes.\n\nC. The act of killing a person does indeed destroy their ability to make autonomous decisions. From this perspective, autonomy-based justifications for euthanasia conflict with the ethical principle that life is inherently valuable and should be preserved. The destruction of a person's life means the end of their capacity for self-determination.\n\nTherefore, all three options contribute to the complexity and controversy surrounding autonomy-based justifications for euthanasia."
