The city manual requires that newcomers pay a higher contribution to the city's employee betterment fund for the first three years of employment. Newcomer refuses to pay a higher contribution than other employees, whereupon she is terminated. Can she make a successful equal protection argument to fight for her job?\n\nA. No, she is not a member of a suspect class as there cannot be a \"class-of-one\" in the employment law context.\nB. No, the request for the contribution was not unreasonable and cannot support an equal protection argument.\nC. Yes, she can claim a class of one who is being discriminated against.\nD. Yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are coming and are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would likely be C. Yes, she can claim a class of one who is being discriminated against.\n\nIn the United States, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This clause has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to apply to discrimination based on race, national origin, alienage, gender, and certain fundamental rights. However, it does not explicitly provide protection against discrimination based on individual characteristics or status, such as being a newcomer, unless that individual can show they are being treated differently from others similarly situated.\n\nIn this scenario, the newcomer argues that she is being being treated differently from other employees due to her status as a newcomer, specifically because she is being required to pay a higher contribution to the city's employee betterment fund for the first three years of employment. She claims this treatment constitutes unequal protection under the law. \n\nA \"class-of-one\" theory allows for an individual to argue that they have been treated differently from others without regard to their membership in a particular group. This theory holds that if an individual has been treated differently from others under similar circumstances, they may have standing to sue for equal protection violations. In this case, the newcomer could argue that she is being being treated differently from other employees under similar circumstances (those who started working in the city after her and before the three-year period expired.\n\nHowever, the outcome of such a case would depend on the specific facts and the application of law by the relevant court. It would require proving that the differential treatment was not justified by a legitimate government interest or was motivated by discriminatory intent. Without more information about the context and specifics of the situation, it is challenging to determine the exact legal outcome."
