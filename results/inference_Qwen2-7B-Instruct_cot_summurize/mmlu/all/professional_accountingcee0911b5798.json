However, this provision is limited to the lesser of $50,000 or the amount invested in the business.\n\nGiven that Summer has already used up her net operating loss of $20,000 ( which comprised three-fourths of the original $20,000 loss ( from three years ago, she would have $5,000 worth of loss left ( since one-fourth ($20,000 * 1/4 = $5,000) was of that loss was cannot be claimed as a Code Sec. 1244 loss due to the limitation on the amount that can be deducted under this provision.\n\nIn the current year, Summer sustains another loss of $50,000 on Code Sec. 1244 stock. Since the Code Sec. 1244 loss is limited to $50,000, and Summer has already used up her $5,000 of loss from the previous year, she can fully utilize the $50,000 limit of Code Sec. 1244 loss deduction for the current year. \n\nTherefore, Summer can deduct the full $50,000 loss as an ordinary loss under Code Sec. 1244, assuming there are no other limitations or restrictions that apply in her specific situation."
