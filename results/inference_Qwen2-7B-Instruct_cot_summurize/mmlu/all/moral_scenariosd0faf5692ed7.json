Not wrong, Wrong\n\nCollecting your neighbor's mail while they are on vacation is generally considered acceptable under the \"good Samaritan\" principle or simply being helpful, especially if you have been explicitly asked to do so or it's part of a pre-existing arrangement like a house-sitting agreement. It's also a common practice in some communities where neighbors help each other out when someone is away.\n\nLaughing at the antics of happy monkeys behind bars, however, is typically seen as morally wrong. This behavior can be interpreted as insensitive and potentially harmful to the animals' well-being and dignity, especially if it involves mocking or exploiting their natural behaviors for amusement. Animals, including monkeys, are capable of experiencing emotions and should be treated with respect and compassion."
