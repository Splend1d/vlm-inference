According to the characteristic equation, the sum of the roots (which are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) when \\(\\lambda\\) is set to zero ( is equal to the coefficient of \\(-\\lambda^{n-1}\\) (in this case, for a cubic polynomial, it would be the coefficient of \\(-\\lambda^2\\), but considering the sign convention in the characteristic polynomial, it actually corresponds to the coefficient of \\(\\lambda^2\\)). Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of eigenvalues} = 3\n\\]\n\nGiven that the trace of \\(A\\) is the sum of its eigenvalues, we can conclude that:\n\n**Statement I is true.**\n\n### Statement II: The determinant of \\(A\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\nThe constant term of the characteristic polynomial gives us the product of the eigenvalues ( when \\(\\lambda = 0\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Product of eigenvalues} = -3\n\\]\n\nThe determinant of \\(A\\), \\(\\det(A)\\), is also equal to the product of its eigenvalues ( when they are are all considered. Hence:\n\n**Statement II is also true.**\n\n### Statement III: The matrix \\(A\\) has eigenvalues \\(-3\\) and \\(1\\).\n\nFrom the characteristic polynomial \\(-\\lambda^3 + 3\\lambda^2 + \\lambda - 3\\), we can factorize it to find its roots (the eigenvalues). This polynomial does not directly factorize into simple expressions that would easily reveal the eigenvalues as \\(-3\\) and \\(1\\). Instead, we should look at the coefficients to infer the sum and product of the roots (using Vieta's formulas). However, without explicitly finding the roots, we cannot conclusively state that \\(-3\\) and \\(1\\) are among them based solely on the information provided. \n\nGiven that the sum of the roots is \\(3\\) ( (which matches the coefficient of \\(\\lambda^2\\) with an opposite sign) and the product of the roots is \\(-3\\), these conditions do not uniquely specify the individual eigenvalues. Without further calculation or specific factorization, we cannot definitively say that \\(-3\\) and \\(1\\) are among the eigenvalues of \\(A\\).\n\n**Therefore, Statement III is false based on the information given.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- **Statement I** is true because the trace of \\(A\\) is indeed \\(3\\).\n- **Statement II** is true because the determinant of \\(A\\) is indeed \\(-3\\).\n- **Statement III** cannot be conclusively proven true based on the given characteristic polynomial alone.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **D. I and II only**."
