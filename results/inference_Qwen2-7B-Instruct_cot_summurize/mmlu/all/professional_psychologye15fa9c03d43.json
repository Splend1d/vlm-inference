They help children in various aspects such as physical coordination, cognitive skills, emotional development, and social interaction. Play allows children to explore their surroundings, understand rules, and learn about cause and effect. It also helps them develop problem-solving skills and creativity. Unlike adult play, which often serves as a means of relaxation or stress relief, child play is primarily focused on learning and development."
