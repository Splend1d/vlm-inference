This is not morally wrong according to standard US moral norms.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character intentionally ignores pleas for help, specifically towards starving children in Africa. This action can be considered morally wrong because it involves a deliberate choice to ignore humanitarian appeals and suffering of others, which goes against the principles of empathy, compassion, and social responsibility that are generally accepted in the US."
