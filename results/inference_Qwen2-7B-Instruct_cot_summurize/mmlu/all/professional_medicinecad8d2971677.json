Some of the components in the vaccine, such as yeast used in production, can cause allergic reactions in individuals with egg allergies. It's important to assess for any history of egg allergy in the patient before administering the vaccine.\n\nThe other options listed are not typically contraindications for DtaP immunization:\n\nB. Apgar scores at birth: These scores measure the newborn's vital signs but do not indicate a risk for vaccine reactions.\n  \nC. Gestational age at birth: This does not affect the eligibility for DtaP immunization.\n  \nD. Previous seizures: While a history of seizures might suggest a need for caution in certain immunizations due to potential anaphylactic reactions, it is not specifically mentioned as a contraindication for DtaP vaccination. However, it's always best to consider the patient's medical history comprehensively when deciding on vaccinations."
