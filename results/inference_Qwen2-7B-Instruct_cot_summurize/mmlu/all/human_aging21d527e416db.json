It focuses on recognizing and responding to the emotional and psychological needs of the individual. The goal is to enhance their quality of life by treating them with dignity and respect, engaging them in meaningful activities, and addressing behavioral symptoms in a supportive way. This approach does not involve monitoring them day and night, leaving them alone to die peacefully, or giving them higher doses of medication without medical justification."
