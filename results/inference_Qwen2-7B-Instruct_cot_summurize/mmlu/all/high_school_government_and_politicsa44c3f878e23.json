This was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the case of New York v. United States (1998), as it was seen as an infringement on Congress's legislative powers. The Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to make laws, and the line-item veto was deemed an unauthorized delegation of legislative authority to the Executive Branch."
