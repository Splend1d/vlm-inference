                    "text": "To find Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold, we need to calculate the total cost of these shares initially and then adjust for the stock split.\n\n**Initial Purchase:**\nLemon bought 2000 shares at $10.50 each:\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 2000 \\times \\$10.50 = \\$21,000 \\]\n\n**Year 4 Dividend:**\nReceived a 5% non-taxable dividend of Spectrol common stock. This means he received an additional 5% of his original investment in stock. Since the original investment was was $21,000, the value of the dividend received (in stock) would be:\n\\[ \\text{Dividend Value} = 0.05 \\times \\$21,000 = \\$1,050 \\]\nThis dividend received in stock does not affect the basis of the original shares since it is a non-taxable dividend.\n\n**Year 5 Stock Split:**\nThe stock split 2-for-1, which means each share was before the split becomes two shares after the split. Lemon originally had 2000 shares, so after the split, he has:\n\\[ 2000 \\times 2 = 4000 \\text{ shares} \\]\nThe basis per share remains the same because he did not pay anything extra for the additional shares due to the stock split. So, the new basis per share is:\n\\[ \\frac{\\$21,000}{4000} = \\$5.25 \\text{ per share} \\]\n\n**Sale of 800 Shares:**\nLemon sold 800 shares at the current market price (which isn't specified, but since this question focuses on calculating the basis, let's consider the calculation based on the adjusted cost per share post-split.\n\\[ \\text{Cost Basis for 800 Shares} = 800 \\times \\$5.25 = \\$4,200 \\]\n\nHowever, the question seems to imply that we should consider the original purchase price and apply it to the sold shares without accounting for the stock split correctly in the context of calculating the basis for sold shares. Let's correct that misunderstanding:\n\nSince Lemon originally bought 2000 shares at $10.50 each, the basis per share remains the same even after the stock split. Therefore, the basis for each share is still $10.50, regardless of the number of shares outstanding or the split.\n\nWhen Lemon sold 800 shares, the basis for those shares would be calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Cost Basis for 800 Shares} = 800 \\times \\$10.50 = \\$8,400 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. $8,400**."
