A beach then formed where previously there had been a lake bottom.\n\nWhen the water level of a lake lowers, it can expose sedimentary layers that were previously submerged. As the water recedes, the exposed sediments become part of the shoreline, which over time can evolve into a beach. Over time, this beach material, such as sand, gets transported by wind or waves, accumulates, and eventually becomes compacted and cemented together, forming sandstone. This process does not involve volcanic activity, direct contact metamorphism, or the development of one-celled organisms creating shells that lithify into sandstone."
