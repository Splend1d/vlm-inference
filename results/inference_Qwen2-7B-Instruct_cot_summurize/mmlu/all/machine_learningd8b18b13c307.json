High entropy indicates a high degree of disorder or unpredictability in the data. This means that the partitions (or subsets) created from the data are not pure, i.e., they contain instances belonging to multiple classes rather than being dominated by one class. \n\nThe goal during the training of a decision tree is to minimize this entropy, aiming to create partitions where each subset is as \"pure\" as possible, meaning most of the instances belong to a single class. Therefore, high entropy implies that the partitions are not pure."
