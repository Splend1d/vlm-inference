Ensure that all of the non-stationarity is taken into account.\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller test is used to test for stationarity in a time series dataset, which is a fundamental step in many time series analyses. When we augment the Dickey-Fuller test, we typically add laggedged of the dependent variable to the test regression. This augmentation helps ensure that any serial correlation (i.e., autocorrelation) and other forms of non-stationarity present in the data are accounted for. This is crucial because standard errors and p-values from the test can be biased if these issues are not properly addressed. Therefore, option D accurately reflects the purpose of augmenting the Dickey-Fuller test."
