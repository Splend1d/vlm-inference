However, according to various legal studies and reports, the overturn rate for capital cases due to serious errors can vary widely depending on the country's legal system and the specific criteria for overturning convictions. Without current data, it's difficult to provide an exact percentage from options A through D.\n\nFor instance, some jurisdictions may see a higher rate of overturned convictions due to procedural errors, while others might have more stringent requirements for appeals. In the United States, for example, studies suggest that between 1-2% of death row inmates were later found innocent and had their convictions overturned, which indicates that the actual percentage could be quite low compared to the options provided.\n\nTo get the most accurate answer, you would need to consult recent legal databases or reports that detail the statistics on overturned capital cases."
