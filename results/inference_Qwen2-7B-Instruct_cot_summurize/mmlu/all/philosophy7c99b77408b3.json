However, based on typical philosophical inquiries, Stevenson might aim for one of these objectives:\n\nA. Providing an account of what makes right actions right: This alignss with Stevenson's work in ethics, particularly in his theory of ethical naturalism and his critique of ethical statements as expressions of preference rather than claims about objective facts.\n\nB. Establishing which things are good in themselves: This could be related to Stevenson's exploration of intrinsic value or his critique of consequentialist views of goodness.\n\nC. Developing a theory of good moral character: This would fit with Stevenson's focus on character traits and their role in ethical decision-making, emphasizing virtues and the importance of personal character over mere adherence to rules.\n\nD. Making ethical questions clear: Stevenson was known for his clarity in ethical discourse, aiming to refine language and concepts in ethics to make them more precise and understandable.\n\nGiven Stevenson's contributions to ethical theory, options A, C, and D seem more aligned with his work than option B, which might be more associated with deontological or utilitarian approaches to defining goodness. Without more context about the specific paper, it's difficult to definitively state Stevenson's primary aim, but options A, C, and D are likely closer to his interests and contributions to the field of ethics."
