However, without proper damping, the system may oscillate for a short period before coming to rest. This oscillation is due to mechanical energy being converted into heat through friction within the instrument.\n\nTo prevent these oscillations and provide a smooth stop to the pointer, a damping mechanism is used. In an air-tight chamber, a damping vane ( or damping plate, is often used. As the coil moves past this vane, it encounters resistance from the air, which slows down its motion and ultimately stops the pointer at the desired reading. The damping effect is achieved due to the friction between the vane and the moving coil, as well as the resistance of the air against the moving coil."
