A free abelian group is defined as an abelian group that has a basis, meaning every element can be uniquely written as a linear combination of the basis elements with integer coefficients. Since there are no elements of finite order ( (which would imply the presence of torsion), every free abelian group is indeed torsion free.\n\nStatement 2 is false. While it's true that every finitely generated free abelian group is torsion-free, not every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is necessarily free. There exist examples of torsion-free abelian groups that are not free, such as the Pr\u00fcfer p-group for any prime \\(p\\), which is torsion-free but not free because it does not have a basis in the sense required for a free group."
