Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.\n\nThe Oregon Territory dispute between the United States and Great Britain was resolved through the Oregon Treaty of 1846. This treaty was the result of negotiations that aimed to settle the boundary dispute between the two countries along the 49th parallel north. Under the terms of the treaty, the United States received the land west of the 49th parallel north, including present-day Washington, Oregon, and parts of Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. In exchange, the United Kingdom received compensation for the lands it lost and control of the Fraser River and the Pacific Northwest ports. The treaty also established the border between the United States and Canada at the 49th parallel, which included the boundary of the Rocky Mountains, except for Vancouver Island, which remained British territory."
