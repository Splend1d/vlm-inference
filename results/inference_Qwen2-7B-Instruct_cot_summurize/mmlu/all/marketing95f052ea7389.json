In this business model, the parent company ( McDonald's or KFC in these cases - grants the rights to use its brand, business systems, trademarks, and other intellectual properties to independent operators who pay a fee for the privilege. These operators then open and run their own individual locations under the larger company's name and standards. This allows for rapid expansion and standardization across different geographic regions while sharing the risk with multiple independent owners."
