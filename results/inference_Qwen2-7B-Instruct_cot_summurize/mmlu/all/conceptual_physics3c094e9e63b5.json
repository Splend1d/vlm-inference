It would also have no weight since weight is a result of the force of gravity acting on mass, and in a vacuum, there is no mass to experience that force. Additionally, an object in a vacuum would have no weight as mentioned, which means it also lacks the gravitational pull associated with weight. Therefore, all three options A, B, and C are correct, making the answer D. All of these."
