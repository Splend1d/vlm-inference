                    "text": "The situation with inelastic demand is when a change in price does not significantly affect the quantity demanded. This is typically seen when consumers perceive the good as a necessity and do not alter their consumption much despite price changes.\n\nThe formula to calculate price elasticity of demand (PED is:\n\n\\[ PED = \\frac{\\%\\ change\\ in\\ quantity\\ demanded}{\\%\\ change\\ in\\ price} \\]\n\nFor inelastic demand, the absolute value of PED should be less than 1.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. \\( PED = \\frac{3\\%}{5\\%} = 0.6 \\) - This indicates elastic demand since the PED is greater than 1.\n\nB. \\( PED = \\frac{6\\%}{4\\%} = 1.5 \\) - Also indicates elastic demand since the PED is greater than 1.\n\nC. \\( PED = \\frac{4\\%}{4\\%} = 1 \\) - This exactly equals 1, indicating unitary elastic demand, not strictly inelastic.\n\nD. The scenario described is about the effect of a price decrease on quantity demanded, which doesn't directly answer the question about inelastic demand since it's typically discussed in terms of price increases. However, if we consider this as a hypothetical scenario for understanding, it seems to suggest elastic demand because an increase in quantity demanded more than proportionally to the decrease in price, implying that demand is responsive to price changes.\n\nGiven the direct question about inelastic demand based on price increases, the correct answer would be C, where a 4% price increase results in a 4% decrease in the quantity demanded, indicating that the demand is relatively insensitive to price changes, thus being inelastic."
