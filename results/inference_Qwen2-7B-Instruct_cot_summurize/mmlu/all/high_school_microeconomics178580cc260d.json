It looks at how these entities make decisions regarding production, consumption, and distribution of goods and services. While money plays a significant role in transactions within an economy, economics is broader than just financial transactions. It also considers factors like labor, natural resources, and capital in its analyses. The scientific method is often used in economic research, but it is not the sole method; economists use various approaches depending on the context and the question being addressed. Maximizing spiritual well-being is not typically a focus or goal of economic study."
