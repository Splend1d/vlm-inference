The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\nA. Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\nB. Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\nC. No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\nD. No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.\n"

However, based on common legal principles:\n\nD. No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.\n\nExplanation: In most jurisdictions, property rights and inheritance laws generally do not automatically revoke or alter based solely on the criminal actions of a deceased individual, especially posthumously. Ownership rights and property titles typically do not change merely due to the death of a person or their criminal actions unless specifically laws or court rulings state otherwise. Therefore, the murderer's status as a convicted felon does not automatically strip him of his property rights, nor does it necessarily transfer those rights to the victim's estate. \n\nHowever, if there are specific laws in your jurisdiction dealing with forfeiting property to the state or the victim's estate under certain circumstances ( such as murder, you would need to consult those laws to determine the outcome. Additionally, the concept of \"murderer's rights\" or \"criminal's rights\" in property law is generally non-existent, so option A would not apply. Options B and C are also unlikely to be correct without specific laws or judicial decisions supporting such an interpretation, which is uncommon."
