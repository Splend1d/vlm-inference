If an object reflects all the light, we see it as white ( if it reflects all colors equally), and if it only reflects some colors and absorbs others, it can appear in various shades of grey or color depending on what wavelengths of light it reflects. So, the statement \"objects that absorb light appear\" directly corresponds to option A, black."
