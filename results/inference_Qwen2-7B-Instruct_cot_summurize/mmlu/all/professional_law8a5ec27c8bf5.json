Prior to the date of closing, the purchasers noticed peeling paint and plaster erosion in a corner of a ceiling near the fireplace. They also noticed water marks lining the interior wall in the basement. The sellers explained that these were old problems that had been fixed and they just didn't get around to doing the cosmetic repairs and painting. The parties went to closing and finalized the deal. On their first week in the house, the purchasers found a virtual flood plain in their basement and they confronted water gushing in at the corner areas near the fireplace. They hired a contractor who reported the need for extensive structural repairs. They sued the sellers for fraud, misrepresentation, and implied warranties of habitability, and they asked for the funds to fix the property. Do they have a valid cause of action against the sellers?\n\nA. No, because the facts do not indicate an intention to deceive by the sellers.\nB. No, because buyers must always buy a used house in \"as is\" condition and they assume the risk of any hidden defects under the caveat emptor rule.\nC. Yes, the evidence indicates that the sellers made knowingly false representations of material fact to induce the buyers to rely thereon and buy the property.\nD. Yes, the sellers breached the contract of sale and must pay damages.\n"

Yes, the evidence indicates that the sellers made knowingly false representations of material fact to induce the buyers to rely thereon and buy the property.\n\nIn this scenario, the sellers initially represented that they are aware of any structural defects in the home when they signed the contract to sell their home. However, the buyers later discover significant issues such as peeling paint, plaster erosion, water marks on the basement wall, and eventually a flood-like situation in the basement. This suggests that the sellers' initial affirmation of no structural defects might have been misleading or false, especially considering the extent of the problems that were later uncovered.\n\nThe sellers' explanation about the old issues being previously fixed does not negate the fact that they initially misled the buyers regarding the condition of the property. The buyers relied on the sellers' statements in making their decision to purchase the home, and subsequently suffered damages due to the undisclosed defects. \n\nGiven that the buyers sued for fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of the implied warranty of habitability, it appears that they have a valid cause of action against the sellers based on the information provided. The key elements for these claims include:\n\n- Fraud: The sellers intentionally misrepresented the condition of the property.\n- Misrepresentation: The sellers made false statements about the property's condition.\n- Implied Warranty of Habilitability: The property was supposed to be fit for human habitation, which was breached due to the structural issues.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most accurate answer."
