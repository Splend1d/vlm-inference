The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing\u2026the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack\u2026.The attack yesterday\u2026has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas\u2026.As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.\"\nPresident Franklin D.

                    "text": "The most immediate consequence of the events described in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's radio address on December 8, 1941, would be:\n\nD. The bombing of Nagasaki is not correct, as this event occurred during World War II but after the date mentioned in the excerpt ( and refers to one of the atomic bombings of Japan, not directly related to the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbor.\n\nC. The internment of Japanese-Americans also did not happen immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor; it took place later in 1942 as a response to the perceived threat of espionage and sabotage by Japanese-Americans.\n\nA. Trade embargoes with Japan extending up through the 1980s is not accurate because trade relations between the U.S. and Japan were subject to various policies and agreements over time, including wartime restrictions, post-war normalization, and subsequent trade agreements, but it does not describe an immediate consequence of the attack.\n\nB. The Battle of Normandy occurred in June 1944, several years after the events described in the excerpt. Therefore, it is not the most immediate consequence of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nGiven the options provided, the most immediate consequence described in the context of President Roosevelt's address is the declaration of war by the United States against Japan. However, since this option is not listed, and considering the context of the question and the available choices, there might be some misunderstanding in the question formulation or answer choices. Based on the information provided and assuming the question intends to identify an action directly influenced by the events described, the closest answer would be implied by the declaration of war, which is not explicitly listed among the options. \n\nIf we must choose from the given options, none of them accurately represents the most immediate consequence described in the excerpt. The excerpt indicates that the United States was at peace with Japan until the surprise attack, and as a result, President Roosevelt declared that \"As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.\" This implies a direct military response and mobilization of resources for defense, which is not explicitly listed in the options."
