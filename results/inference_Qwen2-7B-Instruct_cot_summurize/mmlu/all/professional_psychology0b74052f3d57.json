This is because work sample tests are designed to measure an individual's ability to perform specific tasks that are relevant to the job in question. They typically require candidates to complete actual or simulated job tasks, which directly assesses their practical skills and knowledge related to the position. \n\nIn contrast, projective tests (A) are open-ended and interpretive, often used to uncover underlying personality traits, making them more subjective and potentially harder to justify legally. Empirically keyed tests (B) are based on established criteria and norms, but they may still be subject to bias if the norming groups do not adequately represent the population. Multiple-choice tests (D) can also inadvertently perpetuate biases if the questions are culturally or linguistically biased.\n\nWork sample tests, by focusing on actual job performance, are more likely to be considered fair, relevant, and less prone to legal scrutiny regarding discriminatory impacts. However, it is always recommended to conduct thorough job analysis, use valid and reliable measures, and ensure that the selection process is fair and non-discriminatory to withstand legal challenges."
