If you have the original message (m) and the encrypted message (c), and you also have the key (k, then you can use the following equations:\n\nEncryption: c = m xor k\n\nDecryption: m = c xor k\n\nSo, if you have both the original message and the encrypted message, you can easily compute the key by doing:\n\nk = m xor c\n\nThis works because XOR is its own inverse, so applying it twice will get you back to the original value."
