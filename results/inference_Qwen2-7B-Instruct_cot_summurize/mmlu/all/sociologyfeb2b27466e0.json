These acts are frequently carried out by groups that are well-organized and may have a specific ideological or political agenda. In contrast, crimes studied by the Chicago School, such as prostitution, drug dealing, and theft, are typically more localized and less systematically organized.\n\nB. **Political Conflict**: Terrorism is often linked to political conflict between states and their citizens, or between different groups within a state. It seeks to influence or intimidate governments or populations through fear, often to achieve political change. Chicago School studies focused on crime in urban areas were more about understanding the social dynamics and economic factors influencing criminal behavior within those communities, rather than its broader political implications.\n\nC. **International Relations**: The effects of terrorism can extend beyond national borders, impacting international relations and global security. This includes diplomatic consequences, changes in foreign policy, and the coordination of responses across multiple nations. The Chicago School's focus was primarily on local and regional crime trends within the United States, which do not typically have the same global repercussions as terrorist actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, encompassing all three points mentioned."
