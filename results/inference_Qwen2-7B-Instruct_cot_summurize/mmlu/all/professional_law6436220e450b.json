                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Apply the punitive damage rule in California since that is where the accident occurred.\n\nUnder the principle of \"lex loci delicti commissi\" or \"the law of the place of the wrong,\" when a tort (or wrongful act) occurs, the law of the jurisdiction where the wrongful act took place (in this case, California) generally governs the substantive rights and remedies available to the plaintiff. This includes determining whether punitive damages are available and under what circumstances.\n\nHowever, there is a conflict of laws issue here because the choice of law depends on the specific legal principles applied in Washington and California regarding the application of their respective laws to a situation where a tort occurred in one state but the plaintiff resides in another. \n\nIn such cases, the court typically follows the \"most significant relationship\" approach, which examines the connections between the parties and the relevant facts and determines which state's laws have the most substantial relationship to the matter at hand. This can involve considering factors like where the injury occurred, where the defendant is domiciled, where the plaintiff resides, and where the defendant can be served with process.\n\nGiven that the incident occurred in California, it is likely that California's laws would be considered more significant. However, the court may also consider the Washington resident's domicile and residence, which could suggest a closer connection to Washington. Ultimately, the court would need to analyze these factors to determine the appropriate law governing punitive damages.\n\nOption D, letting the jury decide, is not how conflicts of laws are typically resolved in courts. It's the role of the judge to determine the applicable law, not the jury."
