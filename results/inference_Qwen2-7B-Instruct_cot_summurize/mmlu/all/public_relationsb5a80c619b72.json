The findings generate qualitative data that can be used to develop surveys.\n\nFocus groups are typically used to gather qualitative data through discussion with a group of people, usually between 6-12 participants. The data generated from focus groups can indeed provide insights that help in developing or refine surveys and other quantitative research tools. However, it's important to note that the results from focus groups may not always be easily generalizable to a larger population due to the nature of group dynamics and voluntary participation biases. Therefore, while option D is correct, it's crucial to consider the limitations of generalizability when interpreting focus group findings."
