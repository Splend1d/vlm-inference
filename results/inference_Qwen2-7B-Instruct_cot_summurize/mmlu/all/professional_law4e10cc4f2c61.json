                    "text": "The Native American Party was founded and chartered in a state to promote the political power of Native Americans. Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poll. A former non-Native American member of the Party is now challenging his exclusion from the Party. Which of the following constitutional provisions would furnish the former member's best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party?\n\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\nC. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.\n"

                    "text": "The best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party would likely be based on the **equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment** ( (Option C). \n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within their jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. If the former member can argue that the exclusion policy discriminates against him solely because he is not a Native American, this might be seen as a violation of the equal protection clause. The party's policy, which restricts membership and voting rights to Native Americans, potentially denies the former member equal treatment under the law compared to other citizens.\n\nThe other options do not directly address the issue of discrimination or exclusion based on membership criteria:\n\n- **A. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment** deals with procedural fairness and the rights of individuals when the government acts against them. While it could apply if the former member argues that the process of being excluded violated fair procedures, it does not directly address the discriminatory nature of the exclusion policy.\n\n- **B. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment** pertains to freedom of association, but it generally applies to the government's restrictions on the ability of individuals to associate with one another, not to the specific policies of private organizations like a political party.\n\n- **D. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment**, which prohibits the denial of voting rights based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude, seems less applicable here because it specifically addresses voting rights and not membership in a political party, which is a separate issue."
