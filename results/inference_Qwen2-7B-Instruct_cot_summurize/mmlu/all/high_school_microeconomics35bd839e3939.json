The firm may earn positive, negative, or normal profits.\n\nIn the short run, a perfectly competitive firm can earn positive profits, suffer losses, or break even ( earning normal profit. This depends on the market price and the firm's average total costs. If the market price is above the average total cost, the firm will earn a profit. If it's below the average variable cost, the firm will shut down to minimize losses ( option B is incorrect as it refers to the long-run condition for shutdown). If the price equals the average total cost, the firm earns normal profit, which means it covers all its costs but does not earn any additional profit ( eliminating option A). Positive economic profit ( option C) is not guaranteed and depends on the specific circumstances of the market and the firm's costs."
