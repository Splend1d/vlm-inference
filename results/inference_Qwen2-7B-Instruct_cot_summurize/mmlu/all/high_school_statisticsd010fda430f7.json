A t-test for a difference in means.\n\nThis is because you are comparing the mean recovery times of two independent groups (the standard technique group and the new technique group. The t-test for a difference in means is specifically designed to compare the means of two groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. Since the conditions for inference were met, this test would be suitable to determine if the observed difference in mean recovery times is likely due to the surgical technique or if it could have occurred by chance."
