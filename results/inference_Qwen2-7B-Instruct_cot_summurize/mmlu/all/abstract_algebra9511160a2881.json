This is because:\n\n1. **Closure**: The product of two non-singular matrices is always another non-singular matrix. This follows from properties of determinants: if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are both non-singular, then \\(\\det(A) \\neq 0\\) and \\(\\det(B) \\neq 0\\). Thus, \\(\\det(AB) = \\det(A)\\det(B) \\neq 0\\), implying \\(AB\\) is non-singular.\n\n2. **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative, meaning for any matrices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), \\((AB)C = A(BC)\\).\n\n3. **Identity Element**: The \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix \\(I\\) acts as the multiplicative identity, since for any \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), \\(AI = IA = A\\).\n\n4. **Inverses**: Every non-singular matrix \\(A\\) has an inverse \\(A^{-1}\\) such that \\(AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I\\), where \\(I\\) is the identity matrix.\n\nHowever, \\(G\\) is not abelian ( (commutative). In general, matrix multiplication does not commute, i.e., for two matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), it may be that \\(AB \\neq BA\\). \n\nLastly, \\(G\\) is infinite because there are infinitely many different \\(n \\times n\\) matrices with rational entries, each potentially being non-singular. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
