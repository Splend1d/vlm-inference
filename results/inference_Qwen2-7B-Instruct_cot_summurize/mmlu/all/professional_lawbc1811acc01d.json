The Secretary has the discretion to implement \"deferred action,\" which temporarily postpones the exportation of certain groups of undocumented immigrants. With 11.3 million people now here illegally, the Secretary implemented a program called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The program deferred removal for two years of individuals who came to the United States as children, met certain eligibility criteria, and cleared a background check. A Sheriff in a county near the Mexican border, sued the Secretary, claiming that the policy would increase crime and drain resources in his county. The U.S. District Court dismissed the Sheriff's claim for lack of standing. On appeal, will the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals likely affirm the dismissal?\n\nA. Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\nB. Yes, because the Sheriff, as a part of the executive branch himself, is not legally qualified to bring a claim against the executive.\nC. No, because anyone has the right to object to the executive branch when it tries to legislate its own opinion into the existing law.\nD. No, because the Sheriff's county is near the border and it will in fact suffer an ingestion of more immigrants from the policy.\n"

Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn order to have standing in court, a plaintiff must demonstrate that they have suffered an injury-in-fact that is fairly traceable to the defendant's actions and that the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. In this case, the Sheriff argues that the implementation of the DACA program will increase crime and drain resources in his county. However, the U.S. District Court dismissed the case for lack of standing because the Sheriff's claims were speculative. The Circuit Court of Appeals is likely to affirm this decision because the Sheriff's arguments do not provide concrete evidence of imminent harm or a direct connection between the DACA program and the claimed increase in crime and resource drainage. The potential consequences are considered too speculative and indirect to meet the standard of standing."
