Price guarantee schemes - aim to provide customers with the peace of mind of knowing that the company they are purchasing from is competitive in price:\n\nA. **Price competitiveness** refers to a company's ability to offer products or services at prices that are comparable to those of its competitors. This encourages customers to choose their products over others by offering value for money.\n\nB. **Price assurance** can be understood as a commitment by a retailer or service provider to match or beat the price of a competitor's offer. This helps reassure customers that they are getting a fair deal.\n\nC. **Reference prices** involve setting a price point that is significantly higher than the actual price but still lower than competitors' prices, creating an illusion of high-quality or luxury, while actually offering good value. This can make the actual price seem more attractive.\n\nD. **Price guarantee schemes** typically promise to refund the difference if a customer finds a lower price elsewhere within a specified period. This directly addresses price concerns by mitigating the risk of price regret.\n\nIn essence, these strategies work together to ensure that consumers perceive a company's offerings as competitively priced, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty."
