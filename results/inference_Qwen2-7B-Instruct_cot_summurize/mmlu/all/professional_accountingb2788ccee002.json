There are specific rules for AMT preferences, which include items like certain types of income and deductions that are not allowed under the regular tax rules.\n\nFor the given scenario:\n\n- **Long-term capital gain**: This is not typically considered an AMT preference item.\n- **Percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis**: This can be an AMT preference item if it exceeds 15% of the adjusted basis of the property. However, without knowing the specific adjusted basis of the property, we cannot determine if this is indeed an AMT preference item or not.\n- **Dividends from publicly-held companies**: These are generally not considered AMT preference items.\n\nGiven the information provided, the only potential AMT preference item mentioned is the \"Percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis\", which is stated as $9,000. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. $9,000"
