The American Psychological Association (APA) Ethics Code states that psychologists should clarify their roles with all relevant parties to avoid any confusion or conflict of interest. This includes making it clear whether they are acting as a fact witness or an expert witness. Therefore, as long as the psychologist clarifies her roles with all parties involved, she can act in both capacities ethically.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of this situation may also depend on local laws and professional guidelines of the jurisdiction where the trial is taking place. It's always advisable to consult with legal or professional ethics experts in those specific contexts."
