By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?\n\nA. They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.\nB. They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\nD. They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.\n"

Given this threat, the use of early gunpowder weapons, which were unwieldy and thus less suitable for mobility, would have been less effective compared to developing units like horse archers that could effectively counter these threats. Therefore, logically, China decided to invest resources into improving horse archer units, which were more suited to their immediate military needs at the time."
