This process can then lead to further lending by other banks, creating more money.\n\nThe formula to calculate the total money created (M is:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{D}{RR} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the initial deposit ($1000 in this case),\n- \\( RR \\) is the reserve requirement ( (0.20 or 20% when expressed as a decimal).\n\nPlugging the values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{1000}{0.20} = 5000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money created in new loans from all banks after this bank receives a deposit of $1000 is $5,000. The correct answer is D. $5,000."
