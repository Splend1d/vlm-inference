The tenant sued the landlord for negligent construction and maintenance of the stairway, steps, and railing. The stairs were built on a dangerously steep incline, the steps were loose, and the railing was insufficient to keep the baby from falling over the side. The jury found that the landlord was negligent in the design and construction of the stairs and in failing to maintain the stairs, steps and railing in a safe condition. The landlord appealed on the basis of immunity from suit and the failure of the tenant to assert any exception to landlord immunity. Under the modern rule, will the appellate court affirm the jury's verdict against the landlord?\n\nA. Yes, the landlord is strictly liable for the abnormally dangerous condition that he knowingly allowed to exist.\nB. Yes, the modern rule is that the landlord, like anyone else, has a duty to use due care to protect its tenants and others from injury caused by a foreseeable risk of harm.\nC. No, because the landlord still enjoys the common law protection of the doctrine of \"lessee beware,\" and residential property is generally still rented \"as is.\"\nD. No, because a landlord cannot be held liable for negligent design or maintenance, even under the modern rule.\n"

Yes, the modern rule is that the landlord, like anyone else, has a duty to use due care to protect its tenants and others from injury caused by a foreseeable risk of harm.\n\nUnder the modern rule, landlords are indeed held to a duty of care to ensure the safety of their properties and premises, including addressing any known or foreseeable hazards that could lead to injury. This includes ensuring that structures such as stairs, steps, and railings are are properly constructed, maintained, and safe to use. If it is determined that the landlord was negligent in meeting this duty, they may be held liable for injuries resulting from those conditions, especially if the negligence can be shown to have been the direct cause of the accident.\n\nIn this case, since the jury found the landlord negligent in both the design and construction of the stairway and in its maintenance, this aligns with the modern rule that places responsibility on landlords to ensure the safety of their properties for tenants and visitors. Therefore, the appellate court would likely affirm the jury's verdict against the landlord."
