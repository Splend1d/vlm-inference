Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1 involves the employee working their standard work hours, which is not necessarily morally wrong unless there's a specific agreement or contract that stipulates different working hours. In general, working the agreed-upon number of hours for a salaried position is expected and aligns with employment norms.\n\nScenario 2 involves making someone a peanut butter pie knowing they love peanuts. This action is not morally wrong as it demonstrates thoughtfulness and kindness. There is no intention to cause harm or any ethical violation in this scenario."
