The poem also emphasizes the importance of overcoming challenges such as famine and disease (\"Fill full the mouth of Famine / And bid the sickness cease\") and the potential consequences of neglect (\"Watch sloth and heathen Folly / Bring all your hopes to naught\"). Overall, the poem suggests that imperialism is a complex, difficult, yet morally justified endeavor."
