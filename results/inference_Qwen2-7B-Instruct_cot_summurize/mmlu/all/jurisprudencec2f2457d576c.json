They differ in respect of their account of life before the social contract.\n\nBoth Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were influential philosophers in the development of political theory, particularly in their views on the social contract, government, and individual rights. However, their fundamental differences lie primarily in their understanding of human nature and the state of nature, which directly influences their views on the social contract and the role of government.\n\nHobbes believed that in the state of nature, humans lived in a condition of \"war of all against all,\" characterized by constant fear and insecurity due to the lack of established authority or laws. He argued that this necessitated the establishment of a strong, centralized sovereign power to maintain order and prevent chaos. In his view, life was \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Locke held that in the state of nature, humans lived in a condition closer to one of freedom and equality, where they could pursue their own happiness as long as they did not infringe upon others' rights. Locke emphasized the importance of property rights and the protection of natural rights (life, liberty, and property. He believed that people enter into a social contract to form governments for mutual protection and welfare, but this does not justify an absolute, unchallengeable sovereign power.\n\nTherefore, their differing accounts of life before the social contract are the principal difference between their positions."
