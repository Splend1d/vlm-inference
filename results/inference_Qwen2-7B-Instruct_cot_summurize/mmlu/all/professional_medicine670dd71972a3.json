The patient sits quietly while his mother answers questions about his health. She says her son seems healthy, although he does not seem to be as active as other children his age. He has said his head hurts three or four times during the past 2 weeks. He has not had fever, sweats, or chills. She says he has a good appetite but has had a habit of eating sand and dirt since age 3 years. She says, \"I don't know where he gets that habit. I used to eat dirt, but I stopped years ago. I try to stop him from eating dirt, but I'm not around much since I work two jobs.\" The patient takes no medications. Vaccinations are upto-date. Height, weight, and BMI are at the 50th percentile. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities except for symmetrical nontender cervical adenopathy. Results of laboratory studies, including serum zinc, lead, and iron concentrations, are within the reference ranges. Serologic testing confirms toxoplasmosis. In addition to prescribing pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Prescribe fluoxetine\nB. Prescribe methylphenidate\nC. Prescribe risperidone\nD. Refer the patient to a child psychiatrist\n"

Refer the patient to a child psychiatrist.\n\nThe presence of toxoplasmosis, along with the history of eating dirt, suggests that the child might have been exposed to the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which can cause neurological symptoms like headache in immunocompetent individuals. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are used to treat toxoplasmosis.\n\nGiven the patient's history of inattention and lack of activity compared to peers, it may also suggest the possibility of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( (ADHD). However, the symptoms described do not necessarily require immediate medication such as fluoxetine (an antidepressant), methylphenidate (a stimulant typically used for ADHD), or risperidone (an antipsychotic). \n\nReferring the patient to a child psychiatrist would provide a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate treatment plan tailored to the specific needs of the child. This could include further assessment for ADHD, behavioral interventions, and possibly medication if needed after a thorough evaluation. It would also allow for a discussion of strategies to manage the habit of eating dirt and address any underlying issues related to the mother's absence due to work."
