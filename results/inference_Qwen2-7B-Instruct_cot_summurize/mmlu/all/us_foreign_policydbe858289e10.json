Reciprocity across multiple issues: This mechanism involves countries agreeing to reduce or eliminate tariffs and other barriers on certain goods or services in exchange for similar concessions from trading partners. This reciprocal nature encourages mutual benefits and cooperation among nations.\n\nB. Reputational concerns of the actors: In addition to formal agreements, reputational factors can play a significant role in the behavior of countries participating in international trade agreements. Nations may seek to maintain a positive image as reliable and fair trading partners to attract investment, foster economic growth, and enhance diplomatic relations.\n\nC. Side payments for adjusting to the organization: This refers to mechanisms that help countries adapt to new trade rules or policies changes imposed by international organizations or trade agreements. For example, the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy provides subsidies and support to farmers to help them cope with the impacts of free trade agreements and market liberalization. Such side payments aim to alleviate the costs of adjustment and ensure that all member states can benefit from the agreement.\n\nIn summary, international trade agreements typically employ a multifaceted approach that includes reciprocity, reputation management, and transitional assistance to ensure fairness and effectiveness in global trade relationships."
