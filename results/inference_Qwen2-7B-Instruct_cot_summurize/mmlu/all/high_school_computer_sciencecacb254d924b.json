The number of computers launching the attack\n\nA Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack involves multiple compromised computer systems attacking a target simultaneously, whereas a Denial of Service (DoS) attack typically involves a single system or a small number of systems attacking the target. The key difference is that in a DDoS attack, the traffic comes from many different sources, making it harder to defend against and trace."
