                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Income is transferred from domestic steel consumers to domestic steel producers.\n\nWhen a protective tariff is imposed on imported steel, it makes imported steel more expensive compared to domestically produced steel. This leads to an increase in the price of steel for consumers, which can reduce their purchasing power and overall expenditure on steel products. As a result, the demand for domestically produced steel increases because it becomes relatively cheaper and more competitive. This benefits domestic steel producers by increasing their sales and potentially allowing them to charge higher prices due to reduced competition. Therefore, income is transferred from domestic steel consumers to domestic steel producers through this mechanism. \n\nA. Net exports fall - While the country may experience an improvement in its trade balance due to reduced imports, net exports could still fall if the increase in the price of steel leads to a decrease in the overall volume of goods exported, especially if those goods rely heavily on steel as a component.\n\nC. Allocative efficiency is improved - This is not necessarily true. While the domestic steel industry might benefit from higher prices and possibly increased production, allocative efficiency refers to the allocation of resources in the most efficient way possible. A protective tariff can distort markets, leading to overproduction in certain sectors (steel in this case, and underproduction in others, which can lead to allocative inefficiency.\n\nD. Income is transferred from domestic steel to foreign steel producers - This is incorrect because the tariff actually makes it more expensive for domestic consumers to buy foreign steel, thereby reducing the demand for foreign steel and potentially harming foreign steel producers."
