After settling with the hotel, the guest sued the manufacturer of the carpet that was in her room and elsewhere in the hotel. The carpet caused the fire to spread rapidly due to its easy flammability. Evidence proved that the manufacturer knew of the product's flammability and that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures. The manufacturer argued that the hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist were both superseding causes, thus abrogating the manufacturer's liability as a matter of law. How did the trial court most likely rule on that issue?\n\nA. The intervening causes relieved the manufacturer of liability.\nB. The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability.\nC. The intervening causes were irrelevant due to the strict liability of the manufacturer.\nD. By not suing the arsonist first, the guest waived her right to sue the manufacturer.\n"

The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability.\n\nThe concept of \"superseding cause\" refers to an unforeseeable event that breaks the chain of causation and relieves the defendant of liability. In this case, the manufacturer knew of the product's flammability and that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures. This knowledge implies that they should have taken steps to mitigate risks or warned against the use of their product in such conditions. The hotel's lack of safety measures and the arsonist's actions, while significant, may not be considered unforeseeable or independent enough to constitute a superseding cause if the manufacturer's actions contributed significantly to the harm. Therefore, the trial court is most likely to rule that the manufacturer's liability was not relieved by these intervening events."
