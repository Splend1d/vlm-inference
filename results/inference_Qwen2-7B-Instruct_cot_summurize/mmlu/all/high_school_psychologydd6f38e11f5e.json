A thirty-six-year-old man who experiences damage to his hippocampus and can't transfer information into his long-term memory\n\nAnterograde amnesia is a condition characterized by the inability to form new memories after the onset of the condition. This typically involves damage to the hippocampus, a part of the brain crucial for forming new memories.
