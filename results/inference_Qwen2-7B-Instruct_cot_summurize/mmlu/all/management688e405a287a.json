They encourage companies to go beyond legal requirements, engage with stakeholders, and contribute positively to society and the environment. Retaining the status quo does not align with the proactive and forward-thinking nature of CSR initiatives. Instead, it would imply maintaining current practices without seeking improvement or change."
