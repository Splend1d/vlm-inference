                    "text": "Pursuant to a newly enacted statute, Congress created a nine-member agency empowered to promulgate rules governing air quality standards for the nation. In accordance with the statute, the President was authorized to appoint a majority of six members to the agency, and the other three positions were to be filled by the Senate. The nine members were duly appointed to the agency, and all appointees were subsequently approved in confirmation hearings. Thereafter, the agency issued the following regulations:(a) Requiring each motor vehicle operating in the United States to be equipped with a specified air/fuel control device;(b) Requiring each gas or oil furnace located in the United States to be fitted with a specified device to reduce emissions;(c) Requiring each State to establish and maintain a program under which each vehicle and each furnace shall be tested annually for compliance with federal emissions standards. Which of the following arguments would provide the strongest constitutional grounds against the authority of the statute?\n\nA. The President does not have the constitutional power to appoint a majority of members to an administrative agency.\nB. Congress does not have the executive authority to appoint members to an administrative agency.\nC. An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to promulgate regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce.\nD. An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to require states to supervise federal regulatory guidelines such as those enumerated in Subsection (c).\n"

An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to require states to supervise federal regulatory guidelines such as those enumerated in Subsection (c).\n\nThis is because the Constitution establishes a system of federalism where powers are divided between the federal government and the states. The Tenth Amendment specifically reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. Regulations requiring states to establish and maintain programs to test vehicles and furnaces for compliance with federal emissions standards could potentially infringe on state sovereignty and the states' reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment. This type of requirement might not only impose significant costs on state governments but also limit their ability to regulate within their own borders without interference from federal mandates.\n\nArguments A and B relate more to the process of appointment and do not necessarily address the substantive constitutional issues regarding the scope of federal authority versus state autonomy. Argument C focuses on the impact of the regulations on interstate commerce, which is generally within the purview of Congress under its Commerce Clause powers. However, the issue here is more specifically about the extent to which Congress can compel states to administer federal regulations rather than the regulation's effect on commerce."
