The contract contained a provision that clearly stated: \"This contract may not be assigned, and any violation of this prohibition voids the contract.\" After the contract was signed, the seller informed the buyer that the toasters would be manufactured by a competitor of the seller. Citing the non-assignment provision, the buyer claimed that it was no longer bound by the contract. Toasters manufactured by the competitor were of equal quality to toasters manufactured by the seller. Is the buyer bound by the contract?\n\nA. No, because \"this contract may not be assigned\" means that duties may not be delegated, and the seller delegated a duty.\nB. No, because the seller assigned a right despite the contractual prohibition.\nC. Yes, because even though the seller breached the contract, there are no damages since the competitor's toasters are of equal quality to the seller's toasters.\nD. Yes, because the non-assignment provision is not enforceable since public policy favors free assignment and delegation.\n"

No, because the seller assigned a right despite the contractual prohibition.\n\nIn this scenario, the contract explicitly states that it cannot be assigned, and any violation of this prohibition will void the contract. By informing the buyer that the toasters manufacturing would be done by a competitor, the seller has essentially assigned its contractual obligations to another party without the consent of the buyer. This action violates the non-assignment clause in the contract, making the contract void according to its own terms. Therefore, the buyer is not bound by the contract anymore due to the seller's breach of the contract conditions."
