Very restricted replication in the gut\n\nAstroviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that predominantly cause gastrointestinal infections in humans and animals. They are not known to cause infection of the central nervous system (B, infection in the upper respiratory tract D, or have their replication significantly influenced by sequence diversity C. Their pathology is primarily associated with symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain, which are localized to the gastrointestinal tract due to their tropism for intestinal epithelial cells."
