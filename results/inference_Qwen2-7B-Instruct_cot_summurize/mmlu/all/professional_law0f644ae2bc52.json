The newborn calves need constant attention and care. One day one of the employees inadvertently leaves the fence door open and a newly-born calf breaks free and goes to his neighbor's land. The breeder went to the neighbor's land to retrieve the calf for its safety and to make sure it was unharmed. However, he was arrested on a trespass charge after entering the land. The breeder appealed. Will the court dismiss the charge?\n\nA. Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\nB. Yes, because the tender pet doctrine allows temporary entry to retrieve baby animals.\nC. No, because the neighbor had a right to keep any living chattels that crossed onto his land.\nD. No, because his status as a breeder made him unqualified for a limited license.\n"

Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\n\nIn most legal systems, a person has a limited privilege or duty to prevent harm to their property or possessions. This includes preventing the loss or damage of their livestock, such as a calf that has wandered onto someone else's land. The breeder's actions were likely justified under this principle, especially since he was attempting to retrieve the calf for its safety and to ensure it was not harmed by being on another's property. Therefore, the court may dismiss the trespass charge given the circumstances."
