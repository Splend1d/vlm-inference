It is a way of visualizing the trophic structure of an ecosystem, where different organisms occupy various trophic levels based on their role in the food chain. This concept allows one to understand and appreciate the complex relationships between living organisms and their environment, thus providing a mechanism that people can see, feel, understand, and have faith in when considering the health and sustainability of natural systems."
