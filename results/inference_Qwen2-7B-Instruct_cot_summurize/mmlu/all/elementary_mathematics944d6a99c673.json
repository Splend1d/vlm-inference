This year, she plans to make twice that amount.\n\nSo, she will make \\(32 \\times 2 = 64\\) one-cup servings this year.\n\nSince each serving is one cup, and there are 4 cups in a gallon, to find out how many gallons she will make, we divide the total number of cups by 4:\n\n\\[64 \\div 4 = 16\\]\n\nTherefore, Chesa will make 16 gallons of soup this year.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 16."
