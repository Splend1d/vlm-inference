Nicotine, a major component in cigarettes, can pass through the mother's bloodstream and reach the baby, potentially affecting the hormones that regulate milk production.\n\n2. **Alters the composition of breast milk**: Studies have shown that smoking can change the chemical composition of breast milk. For instance, it has been observed to increase levels of nicotine and other chemicals like acrylamide and acrylaldehyde, which may not be beneficial for the infant.\n\n3. **Increases the risk of early cessation of breastfeeding**: Smoking can lead to mothers experiencing more stress and discomfort, which might discourage them from continuing breastfeeding. The effects of smoking on the mother's health can also indirectly impact her ability or willingness to continue breastfeeding.\n\nTherefore, all of these options are correct regarding the potential negative impacts of smoking on breastfeeding."
