The reactions at the electrodes can be represented as follows:\n\nAt the cathode (negative electrode):\n\\[ \\text{Mg}^{2+} + 2e^- \\rightarrow \\text{Mg} \\]\n\nAt the anode (positive electrode):\n\\[ 2\\text{Br}^- \\rightarrow \\text{Br}_2 + 2e^- \\]\n\nThis indicates that magnesium is produced at the cathode and bromine is produced at the anode. Therefore, option B correctly describes this process."
