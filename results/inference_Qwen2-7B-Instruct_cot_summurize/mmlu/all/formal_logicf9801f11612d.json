F \u2283 G: Similarly, there's no direct relationship between F and G provided by the premises that would allow us to infer F \u2283 G.\n\nC. H \u2283 ~E: We can derive this as follows:\nFrom premise 3, we have H \u2228 ~E.\nUsing disjunctive syllogism, if we assume H is true (and it leads to a contradiction with premise 5 (~I), because if H were true, then I would also be true due to premise 4 ( (H \u2283 I). Therefore, the only way for the disjunction to hold without leading to a contradiction is if ~E is true. Hence, we can infer H \u2283 ~E.\n\nD. ~H: This is not necessarily a consequence from the premises. While we know that if H is true, then I must be true ( and if I is not true, then H cannot be true.
