Chlorine has a higher dipole moment than fluorine.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in Cl2 are much weaker than those in F2.\nC. The Cl2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the F2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\nD. The mass of chlorine is much greater than the mass of fluorine.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The Cl2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the F2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\n\nLondon dispersion forces are induced-dipole interactions that occur between any two non-polar molecules or atoms due to fluctuations in their electron clouds. The more polarizable an electron cloud is, the more it can induce a dipole in another molecule, leading to stronger London dispersion forces. Since the atomic radius of chlorine is larger than that of fluorine, the electron cloud around each chlorine atom is more diffuse and thus more polarizable than the electron cloud around each fluorine atom. This results in stronger London dispersion forces in Cl2 compared to F2, which contributes significantly to the higher boiling point of chlorine despite its larger size relative to fluorine."
