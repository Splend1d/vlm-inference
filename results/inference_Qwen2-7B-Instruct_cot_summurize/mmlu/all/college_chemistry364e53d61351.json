This implies that the volume scales with the molecular weight as V \u221d M^a, where 'a' is an exponent. However, in this case, we're interested in the rotational correlation time, which is given by:\n\n\\[ \\tau_c = \\frac{4\\pi\\eta r^3}{3k_B T} \\]\n\nThe rotational correlation time depends on the radius \\(r\\) of the molecule, which is proportional to the square root of its volume. Since the volume scales with the molecular weight, we can express \\(r\\) as proportional to the square root of the molecular weight:\n\n\\[ r \\propto \\sqrt{M_r} \\]\n\nTherefore, if we want to compare two different molecules with molecular weights \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\), their correlation times will be related as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\tau_{c1}}{\\tau_{c2}} = \\left( \\frac{M_1}{M_2} \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\]\n\nGiven \\(M_1 = 100\\) and \\(M_2 = 8400\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\tau_{c1}}{\\tau_{c2}} = \\left( \\frac{100}{8400} \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{84} \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{84} \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\approx 0.0066 \\]\n\nSo, if the correlation time for the small molecule is 50 ps, then the correlation time for the protein would be:\n\n\\[ \\tau_{c2} = \\frac{\\tau_{c1}}{0.0066} = \\frac{50}{0.0066} \\approx 7692 \\text{ ps} \\]\n\nThis result does not match any of the provided options, indicating there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the question or the options. Given the calculations and the options, none directly matches the derived result based on the information provided. It's important to ensure that all steps and interpretations align correctly with the question's requirements and available data. If the goal was to find a ratio or a comparison, the calculation above provides insight into how the correlation times would relate based on molecular weight scaling assumptions.
