This is because if \\(f: G \\rightarrow H\\) is a surjective (homomorphism, then the kernel of \\(f\\), denoted by \\(\\ker(f)\\), is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\). By the First Isomorphism Theorem, \\(H\\) is isomorphic to the factor group \\(G/\\ker(f)\\).\n\nStatement 2, however, is false. While it's true that the homomorphic images of a group \\(G\\) and its factor groups are related through isomorphism, they are not the same \"up to isomorphism\". Specifically, the set of all homomorphic images of \\(G\\) includes not only the factor groups but also potentially other groups that can be obtained as homomorphic images of \\(G\\) which might not be isomorphic to any of its factor groups. For example, consider \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}\\), the group of integers under addition. Its factor groups are essentially cyclic groups of finite order, while \\(G\\) itself has homomorphic images that include infinite cyclic groups and possibly others depending on the homomorphism chosen. Thus, the set of all homomorphic images of \\(G\\) is more extensive than just the set of its factor groups up to isomorphism."
