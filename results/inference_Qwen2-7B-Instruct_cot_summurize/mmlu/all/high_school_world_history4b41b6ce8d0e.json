Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India.\n\nThe presence of Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia can be attributed largely to the country's strategic position along major trade routes that connected it with India. This facilitated not only the exchange of goods but also the spread of ideas, including religious beliefs. Buddhist monks and traders likely brought their faith to Persia, leading to the establishment of Buddhist communities within the region."
