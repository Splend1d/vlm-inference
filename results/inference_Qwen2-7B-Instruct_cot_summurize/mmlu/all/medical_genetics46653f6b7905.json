Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC.\n\nMicrosatellite instability (MSI is a genetic alteration that occurs when the DNA repair mechanism fails to maintain stability in repetitive sequences within the genome, leading to mutations. This is particularly significant in the context of HNPCC, also known as Lynch syndrome, where it is often associated with an increased risk of colorectal and other types of cancer. The other options listed do not typically exhibit marked microsatellite instability as a defining feature."
