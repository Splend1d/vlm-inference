This can be broken down into its component parts as follows:\n\n- The first '4' from the left represents \\(400\\) meters ( (this is the hundreds place),\n- The second '4' represents \\(40\\) meters ( (this is the tens place),\n- The third '4' represents \\(4\\) meters ( (this is the ones place),\n- And finally, the last '4' represents \\(0.4\\) meters ( (this is the tenths place).\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this breakdown:\n\nA. The value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4 meters) is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place (40 meters). Since \\(0.4 \\div 40 = 0.01\\), this is not true.\n\nB. The value of the 4 in the hundredths place does not exist in this number, so this statement cannot be evaluated based on the given number.\n\nC. The value of the 4 in the hundreds place \\(400\\) meters is not 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place \\(4\\) meters because \\(400 \\div 4 = 100\\), not 10. Therefore, this statement is also false.\n\nD. The value of the 4 in the tenths place \\(0.4\\) meters is indeed 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place, which doesn't actually exist here, but considering the hypothetical hundredths place to be \\(0.04\\) meters ( (if there was't a fourth decimal place), then \\(0.4 \\div 0.04 = 10\\). This makes statement D true under the assumption that there should be a hundredths place with a value of \\(0.04\\), which is not explicitly given but logically inferred for the sake of evaluating the statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D**."
