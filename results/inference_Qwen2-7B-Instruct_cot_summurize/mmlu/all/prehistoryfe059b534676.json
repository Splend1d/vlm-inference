This process was part of a complex set of rituals that were believed to maintain the balance of the cosmos and ensure the well-being of the empire. Captives taken in war or individuals deemed necessary for sacrificial rites would undergo various forms of preparation before being offered to the gods. These practices were integral to Inca religious and political life, reinforcing the authority of the emperor and the importance of the divine order."
