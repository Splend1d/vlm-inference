This relationship is described by Wien's displacement law, which states that the product of the temperature and the wavelength at which the maximum intensity occurs is a constant value, approximately 28970 \u03bcm\u00b7K. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n\u03bb_max * T = 28970 \u03bcm\u00b7K\n\nGiven a blackbody with a surface temperature of 300 K, we can rearrange the equation to solve for \u03bb_max:\n\n\u03bb_max = 28970 \u03bcm\u00b7K / T\n\nPlugging in the temperature:\n\n\u03bb_max = 28970 \u03bcm\u00b7K / 300 K = 96.57 \u03bcm\n\nConverting this to millimeters (1 \u03bcm = 0.001 mm:\n\n\u03bb_max \u2248 96.57 \u03bcm * 0.001 mm/\u03bcm = 0.09657 mm\n\nTherefore, the thermal spectrum of a body with a surface temperature of 300 K would reach a maximum around 0.09657 mm or 96.57 \u03bcm, which corresponds to option D. 100 mm, considering that the options seem to be presented in a non-standard format."
