Here's why:\n\nA. **The reporting status of the internal auditor within the organization** is important because it affects the independence and objectivity of the internal audit function. If the internal auditor reports directly to the board or a similar independent body, it suggests a higher degree of independence.\n\nB. **The educational level and professional experiences of the internal auditor** are crucial because they provide insight into the technical skills and knowledge base of the internal auditor. Higher qualifications and relevant experience typically correlate with greater competence.\n\nC. **Whether policy prohibits the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed** addresses the issue of potential conflicts of interest. Policies that prevent auditing of relatives' departments ensure the integrity and impartiality of the internal audit process.\n\nD. **Whether the board of directors, audit committee, or owner-manager oversees employment decisions related to the internal auditor** is significant because it impacts the independence and control over the internal audit function. External oversight ensures that employment decisions do not compromise the internal auditor's ability to perform audits objectively.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors could be considered by an external auditor when assessing the competence of an internal auditor."
