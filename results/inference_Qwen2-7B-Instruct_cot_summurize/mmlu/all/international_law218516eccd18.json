Yes, it has been consistently held by the Court since the La Grand case in 2001 that they are binding.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) can issue provisional measures in any case pending before it. These measures are intended to preserve the respective positions of the parties until the court renders its final judgment. The purpose of provisional measures is to prevent irreparable harm or the aggravation of the situation while the court deliberates on the substantive issues. Once provisional measures are adopted, they are binding upon the parties involved. This principle was affirmed in the 2001 La Grand case, where the ICJ held that the purpose of provisional measures is to ensure compliance with international obligations and to maintain the status quo, thus the parties are under an obligation to comply with them."
