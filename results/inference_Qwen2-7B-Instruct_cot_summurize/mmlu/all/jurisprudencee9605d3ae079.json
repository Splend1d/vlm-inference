It is misleading to pigeon-hole judges in this way.\n\nLlewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning was an attempt to describe different approaches that judges might take when making decisions. However, critics argue that this distinction oversimplifies the complexity and nuance of judicial decision-making. Judges often use a combination of both formal and informal methods, and it can be misleading to assume that all judges consistently adhere to one style over the other. Therefore, labeling judges based on this dichotomy might not accurately reflect their decision-making processes."
