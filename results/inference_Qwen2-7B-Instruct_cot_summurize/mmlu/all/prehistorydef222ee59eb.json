This could involve opulent feasts, lavish decorations, or the acquisition of luxury goods. The other options do not accurately reflect the behavior or mindset of many ancient elites in relation to resource consumption:\n\nA. \"A penny saved is a penny earned\" is a maxim emphasizing the value of frugality and saving money.\nC. \"Look before you leap\" is a phrase that advises caution and prudence before making decisions or taking actions.\nD. \"The last shall be first and the first shall be last\" is a biblical verse from the New Testament that speaks to humility and reversal of social hierarchy in the afterlife, rather than consumption attitudes."
