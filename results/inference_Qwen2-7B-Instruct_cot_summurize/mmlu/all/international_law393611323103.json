This type of immunity is typically associated with the protection afforded to individuals, particularly those holding high-ranking positions within governments or international organizations, from being sued or prosecuted under certain circumstances.\n\nThe correct answer would be a combination of B and C, but this option isn't provided in your list. Here's why:\n\nB. Personal immunity is indeed that which is afforded in a personal capacity and thus does not cover conduct of the State as such. It means that when a person holds a specific role (like a diplomat, head of state, or international official), they have immunity that protects them from legal action related to their duties in that role, but it doesn't extend to actions taken by the state itself.\n\nC. Personal immunity is often afforded to specific individuals regardless of whether their conduct was undertaken in a private or public capacity. However, it's important to note that this immunity can vary greatly depending on the jurisdiction and the specific role of the individual.\n\nD. While it's true that personal immunity can apply to State officials for conduct undertaken in a public capacity, this alone doesn't fully capture the essence of personal immunity as it relates to the concept of \"ratione personae.\" \n\nTherefore, a more accurate description would involve understanding that personal immunity is a specific form of immunity granted to individuals based on their personal status, not their role as representatives of a state. This immunity applies to actions taken in their personal capacities and not necessarily in their official capacities unless specifically mentioned."
