This measure helps organizations evaluate the efficiency of their selection process in terms of identifying the right candidates for the job.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The ratio of successful to unsuccessful workers does not provide an accurate measure of the selection process's effectiveness because it only considers the outcome of hiring, not whether the right people were chosen from the pool of applicants.\n\nB. The ratio of the number of successful selected workers to the difficulty level of the job doesn't directly assess the quality of hires; rather, it focuses on the performance of the selected workers relative to the job's demands. It does not consider whether the right people were chosen for the positions.\n\nD. The ratio of the number of workers needed to the number of applicants available measures the efficiency of the recruitment process but does not indicate how well the selected candidates will perform in their roles. It's more about meeting staffing requirements than ensuring the right fit."
