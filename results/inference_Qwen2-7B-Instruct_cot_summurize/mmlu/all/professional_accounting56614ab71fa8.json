Collusion of employees in circumventing internal controls.\n\nInherent limitations refer to the natural constraints that exist within any internal control system due to human nature and the complexities of business operations. Collusion among employees can lead to the circumvention of internal controls, as individuals may work together to bypass established procedures for personal gain or to hide fraudulent activities. This can undermine the effectiveness of controls designed to prevent or detect errors and irregularities."
