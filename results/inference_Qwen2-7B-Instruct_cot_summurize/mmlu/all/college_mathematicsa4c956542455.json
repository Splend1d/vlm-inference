So, **I** is true.\n\n### II. \\(v\\) is also an eigenvector of \\(A^2\\).\n\nNow, let's consider \\(A^2v\\):\n\n\\[A^2v = A(Av) = A(\\lambda v) = \\lambda Av = \\lambda(\\lambda v) = \\lambda^2v\\]\n\nThus, \\(v\\) is indeed an eigenvector of \\(A^2\\) with the eigenvalue squared. So, **II** is true.\n\n### III. \\(v\\) is also an eigenvector of \\(A^{-1}\\).\n\nWe know \\(Av = \\lambda v\\). Let's see if \\(v\\) can be an eigenvector of \\(A^{-1}\\):\n\n\\[A^{-1}Av = A^{-1}(\\lambda v) = \\lambda A^{-1}v\\]\n\nSince \\(Av = \\lambda v\\), we can substitute \\(Av\\) for \\(\\lambda v\\) in the equation above:\n\n\\[A^{-1}(Av) = \\lambda A^{-1}v\\]\n\n\\[A^{-1}(\\lambda v) = \\lambda A^{-1}v\\]\n\n\\[v = \\lambda A^{-1}v\\]\n\nRearranging gives us:\n\n\\[A^{-1}v = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}v\\]\n\nThis means \\(v\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A^{-1}\\) with the eigenvalue being the reciprocal of \\(\\lambda\\). So, **III** is true.\n\nTherefore, all statements **I**, **II**, and **III** are necessarily true, making the correct answer **D. I, II, and III**."
