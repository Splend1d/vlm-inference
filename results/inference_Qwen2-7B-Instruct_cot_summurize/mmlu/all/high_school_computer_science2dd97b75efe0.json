Multifactor authentication requires the use of at least two different types of credentials from independent categories of evidence to verify the user's identity. These categories typically include something the user knows (like a password, PIN, or answer to a question), something the user has (such as a security token or smart card), and something the user is, like a biometric characteristic (like a fingerprint or iris scan). The option provided describes a type of lockout policy, which is a form of account protection rather than multifactor authentication."
