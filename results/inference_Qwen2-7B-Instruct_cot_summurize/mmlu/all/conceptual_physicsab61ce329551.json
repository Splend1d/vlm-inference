After each second, the charge on the capacitor is halved. \n\nAfter the first second, the charge would be \\(q/2\\).\n\nAfter the second second, it would be \\((q/2)^2 = q/4\\).\n\nFollowing this pattern, after the fifth second, the charge would have been halved 5 times, which means:\n\n\\[q_{final} = q \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^5 = q \\times \\frac{1}{32}\\]\n\nSo, if after five seconds its charge is \\(q\\), then its initial charge must have been \\(32q\\)."
