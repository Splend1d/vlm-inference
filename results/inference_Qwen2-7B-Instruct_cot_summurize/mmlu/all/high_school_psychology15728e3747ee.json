People are more likely to recall information that is congruent with their prior schemas.\n\nThis option aligns with the concept of schema theory in psychology, which suggests that our understanding and recall of information is heavily influenced by our existing knowledge structures or schemas. When new information aligns with these schemas, it's easier for us to remember and integrate the information.\n\nLet's briefly address why the other options are not typically true:\n\nB. While working memory plays an important role in processing and manipulation of information, people can still recall information that is stored in long-term memory even if it is not currently in working memory. Working memory capacity is limited, but long-term memory has virtually unlimited storage capacity.\n\nC. This statement is false because extinction refers to the process of forgetting through repeated exposure to stimuli without reinforcement. People do have the ability to recall information that has been extinguished, but it might require additional cues or strategies to facilitate retrieval.\n\nD. This statement is also generally false. The speed at which people recall information depends on various factors such as familiarity with the material, interest, and context, rather than just whether the information consists of nonsense syllables or sets of numbers. In many cases, people might find recalling sets of numbers more challenging than nonsensical strings due to the lack of meaningful associations."
