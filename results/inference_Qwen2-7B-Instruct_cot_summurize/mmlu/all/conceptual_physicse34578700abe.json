This force does not change the magnitude of the particle's velocity (conservation of kinetic energy), but it does change the direction of the velocity vector, thus changing the direction of motion. Therefore, the magnetic force can alter both the speed (in terms of its direction, not its magnitude, since the force only changes direction, not the speed itself (and not in terms of decreasing or increasing it, just altering the path) and the direction of the particle's motion."
