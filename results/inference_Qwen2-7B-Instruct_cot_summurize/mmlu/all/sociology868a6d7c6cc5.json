Society's levels often refer to broader groupings such as family units (households), economic and political entities like nations, or conceptual groupings like the global community. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the categorization of societal levels can vary depending on context and perspective. Some may argue that specific types of organizations like schools, businesses, or even online communities could also be considered levels of society."
