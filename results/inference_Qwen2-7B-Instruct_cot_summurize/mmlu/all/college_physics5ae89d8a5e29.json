In this case, the heat source is at 7\u00b0C and the heat sink is at 27\u00b0C. The COP can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{COP}_{HP} = \\frac{T_{sink}}{T_{source} - T_{sink}} \\]\n\nwhere \\(T_{sink}\\) is the temperature of the heat sink (27\u00b0C or 300 K in Kelvin, and \\(T_{source}\\) is the temperature of the heat source 7\u00b0C or 300 K in Kelvin.\n\n\\[ \\text{COP}_{HP} = \\frac{300}{300 - 27} = \\frac{300}{273} \\approx 1.1 \\]\n\nGiven that the COP is approximately 1.1, and knowing that 15,000 J of heat is delivered indoors, we can solve for the work input (\\(W\\)):\n\n\\[ \\text{COP} = \\frac{\\text{Heat Delivered}}{\\text{Work Input}} \\]\n\n\\[ 1.1 = \\frac{15,000}{W} \\]\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{15,000}{1.1} \\approx 13,636.36 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nThis value represents the work input required for the heat pump to deliver 15,000 J of heat indoors. However, looking at the options provided, the closest answer to this calculation is not directly listed. Based on the calculation and the options given, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in presenting the choices as they don't align precisely with the derived result. Given the closest option to our calculated work input, the correct choice would be C. 1,100 J, which was seems to be an approximation or a misinterpretation based on the context provided in the question and the options. The actual calculation suggests a significantly higher value, indicating a potential error in the options or the interpretation of the question."
