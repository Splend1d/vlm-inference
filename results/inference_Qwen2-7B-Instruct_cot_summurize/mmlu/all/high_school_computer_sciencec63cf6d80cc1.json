Both algorithms work correctly on all input values.\nB. Algorithm I always works correctly, but Algorithm II only works correctly when the maximum value is not the first value in the list.\nC. Algorithm II always works correctly, but Algorithm I only works correctly when the maximum value is greater than or equal to -l.\nD. Neither algorithm will correctly identify the maximum value when the input contains both positive and negative input values.\n"

Algorithm I always works correctly, but Algorithm II only works correctly when the maximum value is not the first value in the list.\n\nAlgorithm I starts by setting `max` to -1, which ensures that any integer from the list will be larger than the initial value of `max`. As it iterates through the list, it updates `max` whenever it encounters a value larger than the current `max`. This guarantees that by the end of the iteration, `max` holds the largest value found in the list.\n\nOn the other hand, Algorithm II sets `max` to the first element of the list. If the maximum value happens to be the first element, then Algorithm II will correctly identify it. However, if the maximum value occurs later in the list, Algorithm II might incorrectly conclude that the first value is the maximum, since it does not iterate through the entire list to find the largest value. Therefore, Algorithm II only works correctly when the maximum value is not the first value in the list."
