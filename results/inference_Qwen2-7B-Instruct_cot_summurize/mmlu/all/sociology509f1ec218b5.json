                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Queer theory argues that all sexualities are pluralistic, fragmented, and frequently reconstructed. This means that sexual identities and orientations are not fixed or singular but are constructed through social, cultural, and personal processes. Queer theory challenges binary understandings of sexuality (such as strictly heterosexual versus homosexual) and instead embraces a more fluid and diverse spectrum of sexual identities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because queer theory does not endorse heterosexuality as the norm or the most desirable way to be. In fact, it often critiques heteronormativity, which is the assumption that heterosexuality is the default or ideal sexual orientation.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because queer theory does not base sexual categories on true, underlying biological differences. Instead, it posits that societal norms, cultural expectations, and power dynamics significantly influence how we perceive and categorize sexualities.\n\nOption C refers to a concept sometimes observed in societal responses to gender non-conformity, where certain expressions of masculinity may be viewed more critically than similar expressions of femininity due to historical gender biases and stereotypes. However, this is not a central claim of queer theory, which focuses more broadly on the diversity and fluidity of sexual identities rather than the specific dynamics of masculinity and femininity."
