The deed of conveyance contained the following clause:\"The parties hereby covenant that if the grantor (the lawyer) proposes to sell any or all of the remaining 55 acres of the tract during (the friend's) lifetime, then the grantee shall have the right of first refusal to purchase said parcel on the same terms and conditions as proposed; and, in the alternative, if grantee (the friend) proposes to sell any or all of the 15 acres of his parcel during (the lawyer's) lifetime, then (the lawyer) shall have the reciprocal right of first refusal. \"The friend was approached by a co-worker who offered to purchase his 15-acre parcel for $100,000. The friend did not afford the lawyer an opportunity to exercise his right of first refusal, and he went ahead and sold the property to the co-worker. After the co-worker took possession, the lawyer then learned about the sale. The lawyer immediately brought suit against the friend and the co-worker to enforce the right of first refusal in the deed. Based on the facts as presented, the lawyer will\n\nA. win, because the friend has a reciprocal right of first refusal.\nB. win, because the lawyer's right of first refusal does not violate the Rule against Perpetuities because it is limited to his lifetime.\nC. lose, because the rights of first refusal are unreasonable restraints on alienation.\nD. lose, because the rights of first refusal relate only to land that is not conveyed by deed.\n"

However, in this case, the right of first refusal is tied specifically to the lifetime of the lawyer, which means it has a definite end point. Therefore, it doesn't violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nAdditionally, under the terms of the deed, the friend had to offer the property to the lawyer before selling it to someone else. Since the friend did not provide the lawyer with the opportunity to exercise his right of first refusal, the lawyer has grounds to sue for breach of contract. The lawyer can argue that the friend violated the covenant in the deed and thus must honor the reciprocal right of first refusal granted to the lawyer."
