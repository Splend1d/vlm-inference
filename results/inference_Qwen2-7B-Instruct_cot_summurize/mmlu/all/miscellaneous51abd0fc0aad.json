Cattle are generally larger than sheep and can reach higher, while sheep tend to be smaller but might jump more easily.\n\nGiven this:\n\n- A height of 6 inches ( (Option I) would likely not deter either species effectively.\n- A height of 18 inches ( (Option II) might be too low for cattle to easily jump over but could be high enough for most sheep, depending on their size and the type of fence used.\n- A height of 40 inches ( (Option III) is significantly higher and would likely deter both cattle and sheep effectively, as they would find it challenging to jump over such a height.\n- A height of 60 inches ( (Option IV) is even higher and might serve as a more effective deterrent for cattle due to their size and strength, though it might also be considered excessive or unnecessary depending on the specific needs and resources available.\n\nConsidering the above, the best choice that covers a range suitable for both cattle and sheep without being unnecessarily high for sheep would be **C. II and III only**. This option provides a reasonable compromise, offering a height that is likely sufficient for both species to respect the boundary of the fence."
