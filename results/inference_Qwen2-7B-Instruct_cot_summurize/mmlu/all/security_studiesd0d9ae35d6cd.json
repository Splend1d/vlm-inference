There can be instances of securitization where the perceived threat is acknowledged without the necessity of taking extraordinary measures.\n\nThat being, it's important to note that the effectiveness and appropriateness of measures taken after securitization depend on various factors such as the nature of the threat, the political climate, and the response strategies of the securitizing actor."
