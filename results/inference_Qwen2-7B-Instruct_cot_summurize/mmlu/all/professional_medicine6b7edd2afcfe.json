Splitting\n\nThe patient's behavior, characterized by politeness towards the physician and disrespect towards nurses and other staff, as well as his negative assessment of one of his children, can be indicative of the psychological defense mechanism known as \"splitting.\" This involves viewing people or situations in an overly simplified manner, categorizing them into absolutes as either all-good or all-bad. In this case, the patient seems to treat different groups of people (doctors and himself on one side, and nurses and other staff on the other, as well as judging his child as either valuable or worthless without any middle ground. \n\nProjection, on the other hand, involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or motives to another person. Projective identification involves using others as a means to project and internalize feelings about oneself. Reaction formation is when someone acts in the opposite way to their true feelings due to social or moral pressures. While these mechanisms might also play a role in the patient's behavior, splitting seems to be the most directly applicable based on the description provided."
