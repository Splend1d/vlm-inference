Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, putting on a movie without your parents' permission while they are away could be seen as disrespectful or neglectful, especially if it involves using resources (like electricity or Wi-Fi) that you didn't authorize to use. This action might be viewed as morally wrong because it could imply that you are not considering the consequences of your actions on others, particularly those who have provided for you.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking off your hat at the playground and waving at the kids is generally a harmless action. Unless there's some context that suggests otherwise (like if the hat has a symbol that could potentially cause offense, or if you're doing something disruptive by removing it suddenly in a way that alarms the children), this would typically not be considered morally wrong. It's a friendly gesture that doesn't involve any harm or wrongdoing."
