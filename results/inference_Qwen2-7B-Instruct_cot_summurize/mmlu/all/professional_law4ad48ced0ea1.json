                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.\n\nIn a life estate created by a transfer from a fee simple owner, the life tenant (the person receiving the life estate) has the right to possess and use the property during their lifetime. However, the life estate is subject to the fee simple owner's right to revoke the life estate at any time before their death. Once the fee simple owner dies, the life estate ends, and the property reverts back to the heirs of the fee simple owner unless there is a different disposition in the deed or will.\n\nIf the life estate owner then conveys their interest to their children, this is generally permissible under property law, assuming the conveyance is valid and enforceable according to state laws. The children would thus hold a vested remainder interest in the property, which would come into effect upon the termination of the life estate.\n\nIn this scenario, if the deceased fee simple owner's son sues the children claiming they do not have an enforceable interest because the life estate was broken when the fee simple owner died, the court would likely rule against the son based on the principles of property law discussed above. The children would have an enforceable interest as the beneficiaries of the life estate owner's conveyance."
