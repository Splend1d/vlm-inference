This separation was indicative of a shift in power dynamics from the hands of owners to those of professional managers. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in large corporations where specialized management teams took on the operational responsibilities, allowing the owners ( often absentee or minority shareholders - to retain control primarily through corporate governance mechanisms such as boards of directors. \n\nThis separation was seen as a response to the complexity and scale of modern business operations, necessitating expertise beyond what individual owners could provide. It also paved the way for the development of more sophisticated corporate governance structures and management practices aimed at maximizing efficiency and shareholder value."
