He denies any trauma but reports that he had been doing a lot of painting over the past week. He denies any radicular pain or numbness. Cervical range of motion is moderately limited in all fields. He is treated with articulatory springing technique. Four hours later the physician receives a call from the local emergency department, where the patient presented confused, nauseated, and vertiginous. The physician may be found liable if\n\nA. the motion barrier was articulated more than 3 times\nB. the motion barrier was met with a vectored force from the direction of ease\nC. the neck was treated in simultaneous hyperrotation and extension\nD. the patient was previously treated for osteoarthritis of the cervical spine\n"

The neck was treated in simultaneous hyperrotation and extension.\n\nArticulatory springing technique involves moving the joints through their full range of motion while applying gentle force to promote mobility. However, performing this technique on a patient who has a motion barrier ( i.e., experiencing pain or discomfort at certain points during the range of motion) can lead to complications if not done carefully. \n\nSimultaneously performing hyperrotation ( (neck turning to one side) and extension ( (neck bending backward) can create an excessive strain on the cervical spine, especially in an elderly individual with pre-existing conditions such as osteoarthritis. This could potentially result in vertebral artery dissection, stroke, or other serious complications, which might explain the patient's symptoms after the treatment session.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to recognize the motion barrier, avoid exacerbating existing conditions, and monitor patients closely following manipulative therapy."
