Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, entering an ancient pyramid with a tour guide is not considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020, assuming that there are no specific laws or ethical concerns about doing so, and the individual is respecting any cultural or historical significance associated with the site.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pulling out someone's eyes and leaving them dangling so they are forced to watch you is considered morally wrong. This action involves causing extreme physical harm and emotional distress to another person, which goes against the principles of respect for bodily integrity and basic human rights.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is morally wrong."
