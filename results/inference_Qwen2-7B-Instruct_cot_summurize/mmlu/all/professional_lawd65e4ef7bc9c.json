Yes, the seller has a duty to make adequate disclosure of the known facts with respect to material defects.\n\nIn real estate transactions, sellers generally have a legal obligation to disclose any material defects or issues they are aware of regarding the property. This includes issues like flooding and structural damage. By concealing these issues, the seller could be held liable for damages or potentially even required to rescind the sale if it's proven that the buyer relied on false information provided by the seller.\n\nIt's important to note that laws surrounding real estate disclosure can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another, so this answer is given based on general principles. For specific legal advice, consulting with an attorney who specializes in real estate law would be necessary."
