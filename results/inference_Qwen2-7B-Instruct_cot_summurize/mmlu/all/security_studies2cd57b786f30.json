Technological developments do not affect the majority of the world's population and so the advancement of telecommunications and digital media are not of concern to peace studies.\nB. Digital information, media, and communications technology is likely to inspire greater harmony in the international system as the global population learns more about the world in which they live, and the lives of others around them.\nC. With access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution.\nD. Technological change and development is likely to strengthen the power of already dominant international players, and to reinforce the status quo of international relations.\n"

With access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution.\n\nThis answer choice reflects one perspective within peace studies that examines how technological advancements can have significant impacts on social dynamics, particularly in terms of information access and its potential consequences for societal stability and conflict. The advent of digital information, media, and communications technology has indeed broadened the reach of information across the globe, enabling previously marginalized communities to gain access to a wider range of viewpoints and information. However, this increased access can also expose these communities to stark realities about inequality and injustice, potentially fueling feelings of frustration and dissatisfaction if they perceive a disparity between their situation and that of others who may benefit from different forms of privilege or power.\n\nIt's important to note that peace studies consider multiple factors influencing conflict and peace, including economic disparities, political structures, historical legacies, and cultural differences. Technological changes are often seen as a double-edged sword, capable of both exacerbating existing issues and facilitating new opportunities for dialogue, cooperation, and understanding. Therefore, while increased awareness through digital information might contribute to revolutionary sentiments in some contexts, it can also serve as a catalyst for progressive change and social justice movements in others."
