Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, the desire to \"catch the predator of little kids\" implies a willingness to engage in vigilantism or take the law into one's own hands, which is generally considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The proper course of action would be for the individual to report concerns to the authorities rather than attempting to act independently.\n\nIn Scenario 2, ripping a page out of a library book to write a message on it is clearly morally wrong. This action damages public property and deprives others of the full use of the resource, which is against the principles of respect for property and communal resources."
