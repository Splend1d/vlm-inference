Common activities involving all-round relationships.\n3. Collective action based on common interests.\n\nThey do not specify that communities must have a fixed geographical location. While many communities do have a defined physical space, there are also communities that can be more loosely connected and not necessarily bound to one specific geographic area. For example, online communities or communities of interest that are not tied to a particular place."
