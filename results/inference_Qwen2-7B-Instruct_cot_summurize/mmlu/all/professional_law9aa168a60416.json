She took it home with her, intending to return it the next day. The following morning, however, the defendant decided to keep the watch, and did so.

In this case, when the defendant initially took the watch home with the intention to return it, it could be seen as larceny because she temporarily took the property without permission.\n\nEmbezzlement typically involves an individual who has been entrusted with someone else's property or funds and misappropriates it for their own use. By keeping the watch after deciding not to return it, the defendant is guilty of embezzlement since she had no right to retain possession of the watch after finding it and intending to return it.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific legal definitions and distinctions between larceny and embezzlement can vary by jurisdiction, but based on the common understanding of these terms, the defendant's actions fulfill the criteria for both crimes."
