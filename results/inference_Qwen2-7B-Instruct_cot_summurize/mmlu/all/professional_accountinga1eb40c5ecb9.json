This is because the inventory remains the property of Stone Co. even though it is physically located at Omega Co. The cost of this inventory, $36,000, is thus part of Stone Co.'s assets.\n\nThe freight paid by Stone Co. to ship the inventory to Omega Co. is an expense and not part of the inventory value. Therefore, it does not affect the amount of consigned inventory that should be included in the balance sheet.\n\nThe inventory received on consignment from Gamma Co. is not Stone Co.'s inventory, so it should not be included in their balance sheet. Similarly, the freight paid by Gamma Co. for receiving the inventory is also an expense and not part of the inventory value.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $36,000"
