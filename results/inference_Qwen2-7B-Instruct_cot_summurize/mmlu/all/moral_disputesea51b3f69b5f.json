Torture is permissible in the \"ticking bomb\" case: Dershowitz has famously proposed that under certain extreme circumstances, such as when there's an imminent threat to many lives and no other viable options exist, it might be morally justifiable to use torture.\n\nB. No democratic society should allow public officials to engage in illegal actions \"off the books\": Dershowitz is known for his advocacy of transparency and accountability in government actions, arguing that even if an action may be necessary, it should not be conducted secretly or without legal authority.\n\nC. \"Torture warrants\" should be part of a legal system regulating the practice of torture: He has suggested the idea of having a warrant process similar to those used in traditional law enforcement, but for the use of torture, which would require a high-level approval and justification before such measures could be taken.\n\nIt's important to note that these views have been highly controversial and debated among ethicists, legal scholars, and policymakers."
