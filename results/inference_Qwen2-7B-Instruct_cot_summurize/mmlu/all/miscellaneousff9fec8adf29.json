Project your voice by relaxing the rib cage and maintaining good posture\n\nThis option directly addresses the issue of the audience being unable to hear the presenter. By projecting their voice, the presenter can ensure that everyone in the room, including those in the back, can clearly hear what is being said. Relaxing the rib cage and maintaining good posture helps the presenter to use their diaphragm effectively for breathing, which in turn enables them to project their voice more efficiently."
