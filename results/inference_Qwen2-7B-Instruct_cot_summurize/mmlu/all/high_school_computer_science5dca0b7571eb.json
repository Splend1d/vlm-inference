To find out the ID number for the next student, we simply need to add 1 to this binary number.\n\nIn binary, adding 1 to a number works similarly to how it works in decimal, but carries occur every 2 digits instead of every 10. So, let's add 1 to 1001 0011:\n\n```\n  1001 0011\n+        0001\n---------\n  1001 0100\n```\n\nTherefore, the binary number that will be assigned to the next student who enrolls is 1001 0100.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 1001 0100."
