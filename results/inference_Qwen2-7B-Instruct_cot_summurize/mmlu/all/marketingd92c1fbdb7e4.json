Intangibility, value, variability, inseparability, and a lack of ownership.\n\nLet's break down each characteristic:\n\n1. **Intangibility**: Services cannot be touched or held; they are not physical objects. For example, consulting services or hairdressing cannot be seen or touched before the service is provided.\n\n2. **Value**: The value of a service can be subjective and varies from one customer to another. It depends on the customer's perception of the service quality, their needs, and expectations.\n\n3. **Variability**: Service delivery can vary greatly even when the same service is provided multiple times for the same customer. This is due to factors like the skill level of the service provider, customer behavior, or environmental conditions.\n\n4. **Inseparability**: The production and consumption of a service are inseparable. This means that the service provider must be present to deliver the service. For instance, a customer cannot buy a haircut in a grocery store because the act of cutting hair is performed by a hairdresser, who must be there to provide the service.\n\n5. **Lack of Ownership**: Unlike tangible goods, services cannot be owned by customers after the purchase. Once a service is delivered, it is consumed and cannot be returned or stored for future use.\n\nThese characteristics distinguish services from goods and require specific strategies in marketing, management, and delivery of services."
