Net exports fall and there is no change in GDP.\n\nWhen an American buys an entertainment system manufactured in China, it leads to a decrease in the value of net exports for the United States because the country is importing goods instead of exporting them. However, the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP of the US doesn't change because the purchase of the product is accounted for within the consumption component of the GDP formula, which represents domestic spending on goods and services produced domestically or imported. Therefore, the transaction impacts net exports negatively but has no direct effect on GDP."
