It involves the removal of one or more exons from the mature mRNA transcript. This can be caused by various types of mutations, including those that affect the splicing signals, leading to the inclusion or exclusion of certain exons. This mechanism allows for alternative splicing and can lead to different protein isoforms, which can have different functions."
