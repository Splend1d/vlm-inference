Which of the following statements about this law is most accurate as a matter of constitutional law?\n\nA. The one-year residence requirement is valid because it does not affect any fundamental right or suspect class.\nB. State durational residence requirements that are estab-lished for publicly funded services are constitutional because they relate to government operations reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Because publicly funded education is a fundamental constitutional right, a state may not deny it to any class of persons who reside in that state.\nD. State durational residence requirements established for this kind of publicly funded service solely for the purpose of reducing state expenditures violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

State durational residence requirements established for this kind of publicly funded service solely for the purpose of reducing state expenditures violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within their jurisdiction \"the equal protection of the laws.\" In the context of public education, which is considered a fundamental right and is typically provided through state action, a state's law that discriminates based on residency (and presumably the intent to reduce expenditures) could potentially violate this clause if it does not serve a compelling state interest and is not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. \n\nIn this case, the law appears to be designed to save money by excluding certain students, which would likely be seen as an impermissible discriminatory practice unless there was a compelling state interest that justified such discrimination and the law was narrowly tailored to meet that interest. Given that public education is generally seen as a fundamental right, and the exclusion based on residency is not justified by a legitimate state interest (such as ensuring educational resources are available to residents), the law would likely be found unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause."
