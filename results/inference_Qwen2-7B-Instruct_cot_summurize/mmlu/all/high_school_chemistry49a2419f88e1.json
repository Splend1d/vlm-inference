It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.\nB. It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask.\nC. It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask.\nD.

It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.\n\nEntropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. When you evacuate helium from a 2.0 L flask into a larger container while keeping the temperature constant, the volume that the helium gas molecules can occupy increases. This leads to a greater dispersion of the gas molecules throughout the larger space, resulting in a higher degree of disorder and thus an increase in entropy. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the entropy changes due to the increase in volume, not because the number of molecules changes ( since none are added or removed. Option B is incorrect because increasing the volume typically leads to more disorder rather than less. Option C is incorrect because, although the frequency of collisions with the walls might change, the overall increase in disorder due to the increased volume leads to an increase in entropy."
