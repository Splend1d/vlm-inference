Continuing to use the current spreadsheet process might seem satisfactory now, but it lacks scalability, security, and may not integrate well with other systems, increasing the risk of data inconsistencies and making future updates or changes more difficult.\n\nB. Developing a new fixed asset system could be costly and time-consuming, especially if the new system is not designed to integrate seamlessly with existing systems or processes. This could lead to additional costs for maintaining two separate systems or integrating them later.\n\nC. Purchasing a stand-alone fixed asset program might provide a dedicated solution for managing assets and depreciation, but it might not necessarily integrate smoothly with the broader enterprise system, potentially causing issues with data synchronization and workflow management.\n\nD. Integrating the fixed asset module into the new enterprise-wide system offers several advantages:\n   - **Integration**: Ensures seamless communication with other systems within the organization, reducing the risk of data discrepancies and improving overall operational efficiency.\n   - **Scalability**: Allows for easier expansion as the company grows or as business needs evolve.\n   - **Security**: Might offer better protection against data breaches and unauthorized access compared to a standalone spreadsheet.\n   - **Maintenance and Support**: Often comes with ongoing support and updates from the vendor, which can be more efficient and cost-effective than maintaining an in-house solution.\n   - **Audit Trails**: Provides better documentation and tracking capabilities, which can be crucial for financial reporting and compliance purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, while option D requires careful planning and consideration of the new system's capabilities, it is likely the most sustainable and efficient approach to managing fixed assets and related depreciation in the long term."
