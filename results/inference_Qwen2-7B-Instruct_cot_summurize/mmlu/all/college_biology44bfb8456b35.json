Instead, their metabolic rate can fluctuate in response to factors such as food availability, temperature, and activity levels. \n\nIn contrast, mammals do maintain homeostasis for:\n\nA. Body temperature - through mechanisms like sweating, shivering, and adjusting blood flow to the skin.\nB. Blood glucose concentration - by regulating the release of insulin and glucagon from the pancreas.\nC. Blood pH - by the action of buffers, respiratory adjustments, and renal excretion of acids or bases."
