In the deed, the grantee and her assigns were required by covenant to share proportionately in the paving of a road that abutted the property. The grantee conveyed the property to a married couple by special warranty deed that did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. The buyers did not have an attorney and did not do a title search. When the road was completed, the married couple buyers refused to pay the share that was demanded of them. The original sellers of the parcel sued the couple in an equity claim without a jury. The judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving. On appeal, will the appellate court affirm the trial judge's order?\n\nA. Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns\".\nB. Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.\nC. No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.\nD. No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.\n"

Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns\".\n\nExplanation: A covenant running with the land refers to a provision or condition that binds not only the initial parties involved in the transaction but also subsequent owners of the property. In this case, the covenant obligates the grantee and her assigns to share in the cost of paving the road. This means that the obligation continues to bind all future owners of the property, including the married couple who purchased the land from the grantee. Therefore, the appellate court would likely affirm the trial judge's order requiring the couple to pay their share of the paving costs.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. While a landowner may be responsible for maintaining or contributing to improvements on an abutting road, the specific covenant here was not binding on the current owners due to its nature as a covenant running with the land, which is a separate consideration from the typical responsibility of a landowner.\n\nC. The original sellers' general warranty deed did indeed convey the covenant to the first purchaser, the grantee. However, this covenant then ran with the land and bound subsequent owners, including the married couple.\n\nD. The paving requirement was included in the deed given to the grantee, who then conveyed the property to the married couple. Thus, the lack of the covenant in the deed to the married couple does not negate the fact that they are bound by the covenant due to its nature as a covenant running with the land."
