Shrinkage of the thymus gland\n\nExplanation: Cohort differences refer to variations in characteristics among different generations or groups of people born around the same time period. The shrinkage of the thymus gland is often associated with aging, but it can also vary between different cohorts due to factors like differences in nutrition, health care, and environmental exposures during childhood and adolescence. For example, studies have shown that the thymus may atrophy more rapidly in certain cohorts exposed to higher levels of radiation or chemicals.\n\nOn the other hand, options A (Differences in weight, C Enlargement of the heart, and D Increasing size of nose and ears, while they can be influenced by aging, are also factors that can vary significantly across different cohorts for various reasons such as changes in lifestyle, diet, medical treatments, and genetic predispositions."
