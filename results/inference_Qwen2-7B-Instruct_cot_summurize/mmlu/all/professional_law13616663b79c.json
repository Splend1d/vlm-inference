He contacted a government agency to state that the company for which he worked was submitting false safety reports on newly built aircraft. When the company learned that the engineer was leaking this information to the government agency, he was fired from his job. Afterward, the engineer sued the company for wrongful termination of employment. During the discovery stage of litigation, the engineer was deposed by the company's attorney. In his deposition, the engineer stated that the company submitted false safety reports to the government agency to cover up structural defects in its aircraft. A pilot was injured when one of the company'sairplanes he was piloting crashed. The pilot asserteda strict products liability tort against the company. At thal, the pilot seeks to introduce into evidence portions of the engineer's deposition from his wrongful termination lawsuit against the company. Assume that the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial. Upon objection by the company, the trial court judge should rule the engineer's deposition testimony\n\nA. admissible as former testimony.\nB. admissible as a vicarious admission.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered.\n"

This is known as \"former testimony.\" The Federal Rules of Evidence provide for the admissibility of such testimony under certain conditions, including that the party against whom the testimony is being offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony through cross-examination in the prior proceeding. In this case, since the engineer's deposition occurred during the discovery stage of the wrongful termination lawsuit and the company had the opportunity to cross-examine him regarding the safety reports, the testimony should be considered admissible as former testimony.\n\nThe other options are not as fitting:\n- B. \"vicarious admission\" typically refers to statements made by one person that are attributed to another, which is not the situation here.\n- C. While the testimony might be considered hearsay, the Federal Rules of Evidence allow for the admissibility of former testimony under Rule 807, which covers exceptions to the hearsay rule when the declarant is unavailable and there was a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\n- D. Although the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer specifically on the liability issue at the time of the wrongful termination suit, this does not automatically disqualify the testimony under Rule 807, which allows for the admissibility of former testimony provided there was a prior opportunity for cross-examination on related matters."
