During the 20th century there was an increasingly sense of panic about the potential damage of a serious pandemic disease outbreak in the newly globalised world. Medical advances and a series of successful contained outbreaks have largely allayed these fears.\nB. Since the early 20th century there has been growing recognition of the success in medical and technological advancements that have the ability to keep infectious diseases at bay in the modern population.\nC. Pandemic disease is a relatively new threat to security, emerging only in the early 19th century. Therefore, human populations are still formulating and testing new ways of controlling outbreaks and minimising their impact on security.\nD. During the 20th century, security analysts were predisposed to focus on the potential threat of nuclear confrontation and military combat. Since the reduction in these threats, there has emerged a series of pandemic diseases, and a sense of growing unease at the future impact of more serious outbreaks in an increasingly globalised population.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would be D. During the 20th century, security analysts were indeed predisposed to focus on the potential threat of nuclear confrontation and military combat, given the backdrop of World War II and the subsequent Cold War with its nuclear arms race. This period saw security primarily defined in terms of national defense against external threats. However, with the reduction in these traditional military threats, there has emerged a new awareness and concern over the potential impact of non-traditional security issues, including public health crises.\n\nThe increasing interconnectedness of the global community and the rapid spread of information have contributed to a growing sense of unease regarding the potential for serious pandemic disease outbreaks. Advances in medical technology and global health initiatives have significantly reduced the scale of many diseases historically considered major threats to security. Yet, the emergence of new and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, Ebola, and most recently COVID-19, have underscored the vulnerability of global populations and economies to health-related shocks.\n\nThis shift reflects a broader recognition of the interdependence between health and security, where the well-being of individuals and communities can have profound implications for geopolitical stability and economic prosperity. The concept of \"health security\" now encompasses not just the protection against disease but also the resilience of societies to withstand and recover from health emergencies. This includes preparedness, response capacity, and the integration of health systems into broader national security strategies.\n\nIn summary, while the conceptualization of health as a security issue has evolved over time, the 20th century's focus on nuclear and military security gave way to an increased awareness of the need to address public health threats as part of comprehensive security frameworks, driven by the changing nature of global risks and the interconnectedness of the international community."
