According to the given information, we have:\n\n\\[ \\binom{n}{3} = \\binom{n}{2} + 14 \\]\n\nThis equation comes from the fact that the number of ways to choose 3 elements out of \\(n\\) is 14 more than the number of ways to choose 2 elements out of \\(n\\).\n\nWe can use the formula for combinations, which is \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), to rewrite our equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} = \\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} + 14 \\]\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 14 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} - \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 14 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{n(n-1)}{6}(n-2) - \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 14 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{n(n-1)}{6}(n-2) - \\frac{3n(n-1)}{6} = 14 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{n(n-1)}{6}(n-2 - 3) = 14 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{n(n-1)}{6}(n-5) = 14 \\]\n\n\\[ n(n-1)(n-5) = 84 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find a value of \\(n\\) such that \\(n(n-1)(n-5) = 84\\). We can do this by trial and error or by considering factors of 84. \n\nThe prime factorization of 84 is \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\). Considering the constraints of the form \\(n(n-1)(n-5)\\), we look for a sequence of three consecutive numbers (multiplied by something that would give us 84. \n\nGiven the prime factorization, one potential set of values could be \\(n = 7\\), because if \\(n = 7\\), then \\(n-1 = 6\\) and \\(n-5 = 2\\), which gives us \\(7 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 84\\).\n\nThus, the total number of elements in the set \\(X\\) is \\(n = 7\\).\n\nTo find how many subsets of \\(X\\) contain exactly 4 elements, we use the combination formula again:\n\n\\[ \\binom{7{4} = \\frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets of \\(X\\) that contain exactly 4 elements is 35.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 35**."
