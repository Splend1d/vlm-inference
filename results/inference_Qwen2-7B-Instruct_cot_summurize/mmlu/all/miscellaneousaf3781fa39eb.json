Investment levels diminish\n\nRaising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, which can discourage businesses and individuals from taking out loans for investments or large purchases like homes. This reduction in borrowing and spending can lead to a decrease in investment levels.\n\nThe other options are less likely under most circumstances:\nB. Employment increases - Higher interest rates can sometimes lead to increased borrowing by businesses for expansion, which might create jobs, but this effect is not guaranteed and depends on various factors.\nC. The value of the U.S. dollar increases - While higher interest rates can make a country's currency more attractive to investors due to potentially higher returns on investments denominated in that currency, the impact on the dollar's value is complex and influenced by multiple economic indicators.\nD. Mortgage rates decline - Typically, mortgage rates move in the same direction as long-term bond yields, which are influenced by central bank policies rates. An increase in policy rates would likely lead to an increase in mortgage rates, not a decline.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Investment levels diminish."
