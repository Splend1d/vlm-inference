Generally cheaper to gather than primary data and takes less time to find.\n\nSecondary data is pre-existing information that was collected for other purposes. It can be more cost-effective and quicker to use compared to collecting primary data, which involves gathering new information directly from sources. However, it may not always perfectly fit the specific needs or dimensions of your current research problem, and its availability and completeness can vary. Additionally, secondary data might not be able to adapt as quickly to rapidly changing environments or technical advancements if the original data collection was not designed with these considerations in mind."
