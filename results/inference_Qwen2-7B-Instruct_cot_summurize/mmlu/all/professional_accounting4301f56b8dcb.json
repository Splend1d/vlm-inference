Receiving reports for items received before year end but not yet recorded.\n\nUnrecorded liabilities typically refer to obligations that have been incurred but not yet reflected in the company's financial records. These might include purchases made but not yet invoiced, services received but not yet billed, or any other expenses that have been incurred but not yet recorded due to timing differences or oversight.\n\nA. Cutoff bank statements can help identify deposits that have been recorded in the company's books but not yet processed by the bank, which could indicate potential errors or omissions, but it does not specifically target unrecorded liabilities.\n\nB. Confirmations from accounts receivable that are classified as \"exceptions\" might indicate discrepancies between what the company has recorded and what its customers owe, but this doesn't directly address unrecorded liabilities.\n\nC. Files of purchase requisitions for items ordered near the year-end can provide insight into planned expenditures, but they don't necessarily reveal liabilities that have already been incurred but not yet recorded.\n\nTherefore, receiving reports for items received before the year-end but not yet recorded are the most likely source of finding unrecorded liabilities, as these reports would typically reflect goods or services received but not yet entered into the accounting system, potentially indicating liabilities that have not yet been recognized."
