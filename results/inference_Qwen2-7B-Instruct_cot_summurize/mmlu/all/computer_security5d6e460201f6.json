True, False\n\nOKWS ( or OpenSSH's Web Interface, relies on file descriptor passing for several aspects of its functionality:\n\n1. **True**: It would indeed be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to the client web browser. In OKWS, when a user connects through a web interface, the connection is established via a TCP port on the server. This connection is then passed down to the SSH daemon running in the background, allowing it to handle the secure shell session. Without file descriptor passing, there would be no mechanism for the web server to pass the network connection details to the SSH daemon.\n\n2. **False**: It would not necessarily be impossible for `okd` ( the Kubernetes API server, to run as a non-root user. The ability to run a process as a non-root user has more to do with the permissions and capabilities set by the operating system and the security model of the application itself rather than the ability to pass file descriptors. While it might require additional configuration or mechanisms to ensure that the necessary resources (like network sockets) are accessible to the non-root user process, it's not directly dependent on file descriptor passing."
