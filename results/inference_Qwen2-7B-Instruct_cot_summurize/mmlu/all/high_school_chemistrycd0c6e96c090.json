Atomic radius is smaller than that of Carbon ( suggesting moving rightward, but the first ionization energy is higher than that of Carbon, suggesting moving upward in the periodic table. This contradicts the general trend for Carbon.\n\nB. Atomic radius is larger than that of Carbon ( suggesting moving downward, but the first ionization energy is lower than that of Carbon, suggesting moving leftward in the periodic table. This also contradicts the general trend for Carbon.\n\nC. Atomic radius is larger than that of Carbon, indicating moving downward, and the first ionization energy is lower than that of Carbon, indicating moving leftward. This alignes with the general trend for Carbon.\n\nD. Atomic radius is much smaller than that of Carbon, indicating moving rightward, but the first ionization energy is lower than that of Carbon, suggesting moving downward in the periodic table. This contradicts the general trend for Carbon.\n\nTherefore, based on the trends in the periodic table, option C (135 pm, 523 kJ/mol is the most consistent with the given properties of Carbon."
