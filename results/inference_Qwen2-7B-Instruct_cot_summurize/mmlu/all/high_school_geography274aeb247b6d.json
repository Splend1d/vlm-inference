The first law states that \"the total amount of migration from any given area is proportional to the volume of the population.\" This means that larger populations tend to migrate more than smaller ones.\n\nRavenstein also theorized that \"migration tends to occur over a short distance and in steps.\" This implies that people tend to move within their own region or country rather than crossing large distances in a single move. This is because individuals are generally more familiar with their local environment and have stronger social ties there."
