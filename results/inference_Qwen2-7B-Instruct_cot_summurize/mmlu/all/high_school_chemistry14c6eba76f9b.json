In this case, if tripling the concentration of reactant A triples the reaction rate, it means that the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of A. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n\\[rate = k[A]^n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(rate\\) is the reaction rate,\n- \\([A]\\) is the concentration of reactant A,\n- \\(k\\) is the rate constant, and\n- \\(n\\) is the order of the reaction with respect to reactant A.\n\nGiven that tripling \\([A]\\) triples the rate, we can deduce that \\(n = 1\\). This means that the rate law for this reaction with respect to reactant A is:\n\n\\[rate = k[A]^1\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. 1**."
