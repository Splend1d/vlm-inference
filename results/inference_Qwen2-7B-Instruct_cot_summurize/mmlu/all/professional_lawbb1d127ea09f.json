He believed that the driver was acting irritable and fidgety, but he had no articulable reason to think anything was wrong. He searched the car anyway and found two cartons of freshly canned peaches, which were owned by the driver's neighbor and reported stolen off of her porch 24 hours earlier. Authorities charged him with theft under the state criminal code. His motion to suppress the evidence because of an unlawful search was denied. On appeal, will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court decision denying the motion to suppress?\n\nA. Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.\nB. Yes, because when a car is pulled over for speeding, the officer must always obtain a search warrant prior to making any search.\nC. No, the stop and the search were within the normal bounds of propriety for a speeding stop.\nD. No, because driver being fidgety is enough for a probable cause full search of the vehicle.\n"

Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.\n\nIn this scenario, the officer lacked an articulable reason or reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver was involved in criminal activity, which is a prerequisite for conducting a lawful search without a warrant. The fact that the driver appeared irritable and fidgety is not sufficient to justify a search of the vehicle. Searches conducted solely on the basis of such subjective observations without any objective evidence or articulable facts are generally considered unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court would likely reverse the lower court's decision denying the motion to suppress the evidence, as it would find that the search violated the defendant's constitutional rights."
