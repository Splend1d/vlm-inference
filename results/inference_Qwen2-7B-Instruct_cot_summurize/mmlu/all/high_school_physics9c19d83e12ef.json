                    "text": "The correct answer is B. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1v^2.\n\nTo understand why, we can use the continuity equation and Bernoulli's principle. Since the flow is streamline and the fluid has negligible viscosity, the continuity equation holds, which states that the volumetric flow rate is constant throughout the pipe:\n\n\\[ Q_1 = Q_2 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( Q = A \\cdot v \\), where \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the pipe and \\( v \\) is the velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ A_1 \\cdot v_1 = A_2 \\cdot v_2 \\]\n\nKnowing that the area of a circle ( \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\), and the radius is half the diameter, we can express the areas in terms of the diameters:\n\n\\[ \\pi (\\frac{d}{2})^2 \\cdot v_1 = \\pi (\\frac{d}{6})^2 \\cdot v_2 \\]\n\nSolved for \\( v_2 \\):\n\n\\[ v_2 = \\frac{d^2}{3^2} \\cdot \\frac{v_1}{(\\frac{d}{2})^2} = 4v_1 \\]\n\nSo, \\( v_2 = 4v_1 \\).\n\nNext, we apply Bernoulli's principle, which relates the pressure, velocity, and elevation in a moving fluid. For this problem, since the pipe is horizontal and there's no change in elevation, we can simplify Bernoulli's equation to:\n\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 \\]\n\nRearranging for \\( P_2 \\):\n\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (v_1^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (v_2^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( v_2 = 4v_1 \\):\n\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (16v_1^2 \\]\n\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (15v_1^2 \\]\n\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (5 \\cdot 3v_1^2 \\]\n\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (5 \\cdot (4v_1)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (5 \\cdot 16v_1^2 \\]\n\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 - 40 \\rho v_1^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure at Point 2 is less than the pressure at Point 1 by \\( 40 \\rho v_1^2 \\), which corresponds to option B."
