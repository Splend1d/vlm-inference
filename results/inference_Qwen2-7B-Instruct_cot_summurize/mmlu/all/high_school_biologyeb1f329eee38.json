Which of the following statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose?\n\nA. Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\nB. Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\nC. DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly.\nD. Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.\n"

Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\n\nThis explanation suggests that there was a pre-existing genetic variation in the mosquito population for resistance to DDT. When DDT was introduced, it eliminated or significantly reduced the susceptible mosquitoes, allowing the resistant ones to survive and reproduce more easily, thus expanding their population. This is an example of natural selection."
