A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a convalescent home on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the real estate developer's subsequent application for approval for a proposed home on the grounds was rejected because the rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. In an action brought in state court seeking a judgment declaring the city charter amendment invalid, the court will most likely declare the amendment\n\nA. unconstitutional, as violation of the real estate developer's due process rights.\nB. unconstitutional, as an unlawful delegation of legislative power to a regulatory body.\nC. constitutional, as a valid exercise of the city's police power.\nD. constitutional, as a valid exercise of a power reserved by the people to themselves.\n"

This amendment allows the people of the city to have a direct say on decisions made by their local government regarding land use and zoning changes. This is typically seen as a valid exercise of the police powers of the municipality, as it enables the community to participate in and influence decisions that impact their local environment and development.\n\nIt's important to note that the specifics of this case would depend on the exact wording of the city charter amendment, the state's constitution, and relevant laws, which aren't provided here. However, based on the general principles described in the question, option D seems the most appropriate answer."
