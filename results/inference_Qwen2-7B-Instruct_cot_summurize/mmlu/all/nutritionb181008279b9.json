The digestibility of plant proteins is generally less good compared to animal proteins.\n\nThis statement is correct because, in general, animal proteins are more easily digested by humans than plant proteins. This is due to several factors including the presence of anti-nutritional factors in plants, such as phytates and lectins, which can interfere with protein digestion and absorption, and the lower levels of certain amino acids in some plant proteins that may require supplementation (like lysine in legumes or tryptophan in grains. However, it's important to note that the digestibility can vary significantly depending on the specific type of plant protein and processing used. For example, some plant proteins like soy can be highly digestible when processed correctly."
