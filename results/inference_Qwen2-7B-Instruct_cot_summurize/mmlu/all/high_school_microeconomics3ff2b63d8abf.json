When the elasticity is less than 1 (in this case, 0.78, it means that demand is inelastic. In other words, a change in price will not lead to a proportionally large change in the quantity demanded. For an inelastic product, increasing the price can actually lead to an increase in total revenue because the percentage drop in quantity sold is less than the percentage increase in price. \n\nSo, if a business knows that the demand for its product is inelastic, it might consider raising prices to boost revenue."
