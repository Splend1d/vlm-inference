This monumental achievement was largely due to the global vaccination campaign that involved millions of people worldwide. The eradication of smallpox is one of the greatest public health successes in history.\n\nB. **Eradication of polio**: While polio has not yet been completely eradicated globally ( with some recent outbreaks in certain regions like Afghanistan and Pakistan, significant progress has been made. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, launched in 1988, has seen a dramatic decrease in polio cases from over 350,000 in 1988 to just a few dozen cases in 2021. The vaccine used against polio targets three of its four strains.\n\nC. **Increased hygiene**: The need for good hygiene practices has been underscored by various viral outbreaks, including those caused by coronaviruses ( such as SARS-CoV-2 ( (which causes COVID-19), influenza, and others. Regular hand washing, wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and cleaning surfaces are all measures that have been emphasized to prevent the spread of viral diseases. These practices are have become more commonplace in our daily lives since the early 2000s.\n\nD. **Better understanding of how cellular genes aid virus replication and so become a target for new drugs development**: Viruses have driven research into understanding cellular processes and gene functions at a deeper level. For example, understanding how viruses hijack host cells to replicate has led to the development of antiviral drugs therapies and vaccines. Research into viral genetics and how they interact with human cells has been crucial in developing treatments and preventive measures for diseases like HIV, hepatitis, and influenza.\n\nIn summary, viruses have indeed prompted significant changes in our world, from global health initiatives to advancements in medical science and public health practices."
