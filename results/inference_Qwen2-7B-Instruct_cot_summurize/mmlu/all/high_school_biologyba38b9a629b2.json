Minimizing artificial lighting in the area\n\nMinimizing artificial lighting in the area surrounding sea turtle nest sites is the most environmentally sound practice to ensure that hatchling sea turtles orient towards the sea. Artificial lights can disorient hatchlings, causing them to head towards the light source instead of the sea. This can lead to a higher mortality rate as they may end up in areas where they cannot survive, such as roads or urban areas. The other options either do not address the orientation issue (like scattering food which could attract predators or animals that might disturb the hatchlings) or introduce new potential issues (like digging troughs or building fences which could physically harm the hatchlings or alter their natural environment."
