In this case, the treetop-nesting birds have adapted to nesting in treetops because of the presence of a more aggressive bird species on the cliff ledges. This adaptation reflects a strategic choice based on the local environment and the presence of competitors, which defines their ecological niche.\n\nFundamentally, every species has a fundamental niche, which is the full range of environmental conditions under which they could potentially survive and reproduce. However, due to various constraints such as competition, predation, and resource availability, the realized or ecological niche is often smaller than the fundamental niche. In this scenario, the treetop-nesting birds are not necessarily constrained by their fundamental niche ( they are simply utilizing it given the circumstances imposed by the presence of another bird species."
