This makes it cheaper for businesses to invest and for consumers to spend, which in turn increases the overall demand for goods and services in the economy (aggregate demand). Higher demand often leads to increased production and thus an increase in domestic output. Additionally, by stimulating economic activity, unemployment tends to decrease as more jobs are created. However, it's important to note that while expansionary monetary policy can help boost the economy during downturns, it may also lead to inflation if not managed carefully."
