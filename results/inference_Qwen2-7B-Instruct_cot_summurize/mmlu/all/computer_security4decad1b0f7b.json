When an operation on an integer value results in a value that cannot be represented within the allocated number of bits for that integer type, the value \"wraps around\" to the other end of the representable range. For example, in a 16-bit signed integer, adding 1 to the maximum value will cause the value to wrap back to the minimum value.\n\nThe other options you provided refer to different types of errors or issues:\n\nB. An integer being used as if it was a pointer is a common mistake but not an integer overflow per se. Mixing integer and pointer arithmetic can lead to undefined behavior or segmentation faults, depending on the programming language and context.\n\nC. An integer being used to access a buffer outside of the buffer's bounds is an example of an array or buffer overrun, which is related to memory safety rather than integer overflow. It can lead to crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.\n\nD. There is no more space to hold integers in the program refers to a situation where the program runs out of memory, which is not an integer overflow. It means that the program has exhausted its available memory resources and cannot allocate any more memory to store integers or other data."
