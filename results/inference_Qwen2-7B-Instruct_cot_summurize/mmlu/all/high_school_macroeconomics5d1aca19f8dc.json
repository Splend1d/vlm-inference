This means that each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. As a result, the same amount of money will buy less than it did previously, and households may need more money to maintain their standard of living. \n\nB. Household incomes generally do not rise with prices is also true but not directly related to why rising prices are a problem. Inflation can erode the real income of households if their wages or salaries do not increase at the same rate as the prices of goods and services.\n\nC. The economy could run out of money is not a valid concern. An economy does not literally run out of money; rather, it runs into issues related to how money circulates and the value of its currency.\n\nD. Borrowers have to repay loans with more dollars refers to the concept of real interest rates. While this is technically true, it's not the primary reason rising prices are a problem for households. It does affect borrowers, particularly those with fixed-rate loans, as the nominal amount they owe remains the same, but the real value of that debt increases over time due to inflation."
