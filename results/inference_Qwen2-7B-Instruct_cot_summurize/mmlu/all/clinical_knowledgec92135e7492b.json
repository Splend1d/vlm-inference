Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution\n\nIn peripheral neuropathy, sensory loss typically follows a stocking-and-glove distribution, meaning that sensation is lost starting from the tips of the fingers and toes (distally) and moving up towards the wrists and ankles (proximally). This pattern reflects damage to the peripheral nerves.\n\nB. The tone is increased bilaterally in the legs - This statement is not generally true for peripheral neuropathy. In fact, muscle weakness (D. Weakness is more marked proximally than distally, is a common feature due to nerve dysfunction. Increased tone (hypertonia) may occur in some cases as a result of secondary changes such as muscle atrophy or spasticity but it's not a typical finding in all cases of peripheral neuropathy.\n\nC. Reflexes are very brisk with reinforcement - While reflexes can be increased in some peripheral neuropathies due to upper motor neuron involvement or secondary changes, this isn't a universal finding. Peripheral neuropathy primarily affects lower motor neurons leading to decreased or absent reflexes rather than increased ones.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution."
