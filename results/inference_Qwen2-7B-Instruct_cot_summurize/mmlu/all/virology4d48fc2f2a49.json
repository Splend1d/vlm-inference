Annual influenza vaccines are designed to protect against the most prevalent strains of the virus expected to circulate during the upcoming season. These vaccines work by stimulating an individual's immune system to produce antibodies that can fight off the specific strains of the flu virus contained within the vaccine. \n\nWhile hygiene practices (like frequent hand washing and avoiding contact with sick individuals, antiviral medications, and humanized monoclonal antibodies can help reduce the spread or severity of illness, vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to control the spread of the influenza virus."
