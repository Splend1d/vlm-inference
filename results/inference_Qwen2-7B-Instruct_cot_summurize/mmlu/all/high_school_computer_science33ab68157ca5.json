It includes people who are are at least 16 and under 18, so it does not specifically exclude those who are exactly 18.\n\nII. `(age \u2265 16) AND ( NOT(age \u2265 18)`\n- This expression checks that the person is at least 16 years old but not 18 or older. Therefore, it correctly identifies those who are old enough to drive (at least 16) but not old enough to vote (not 18 or more).\n\nIII. `(age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 11))`\n- This expression checks that the person is younger than 18 and not younger than 11. Since being younger than 11 is always false, this expression simplifies to `age < 18`, which is true for all people under 18. However, since the question asks for someone who is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, this expression would evaluate to true for anyone under 18, including those who are 17 but not 18, which doesn't meet the criteria of being not old enough to vote.\n\nGiven the criteria, **Option II** is the correct answer because it correctly identifies individuals who are old enough to drive (at least 16) but not old enough to vote (not 18 or more). Option I also includes people who are 18, which does not meet the \"not old enough to vote\" criterion, while option III incorrectly includes anyone under 18 without considering the specific age ranges for driving and voting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. II only**."
