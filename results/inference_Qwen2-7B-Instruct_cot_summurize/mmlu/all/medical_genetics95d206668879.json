This means that the gene for G6PD is located on the X chromosome, and the condition is more commonly found in males because they have only one X chromosome. If a male inherits an affected X chromosome from his mother and a normal Y chromosome from his father, he will have the condition. For females, who have two X chromosomes, they need to inherit the affected gene from both parents to show symptoms of G6PD deficiency. However, sometimes females can be carriers of the gene without showing symptoms themselves."
