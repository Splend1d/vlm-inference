He was subsequently convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. Following his conviction, the drug dealer was sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. After being sentenced, the drug dealer's attorney appealed the conviction, citing jury misconduct. While his appeal was pending, the drug dealer was then indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. The drug dealer's attorney filed motions to dismiss each of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy. In all likelihood, double jeopardy requires the dismissal of\n\nA. both indictments.\nB. the state indictment, but not the federal indictment.\nC. the federal indictment, but not the state indictment.\nD. neither of the indictments.\n"

However, the situation described involves two separate jurisdictions ( federal and state. In the United States, the Double Jeopardy Clause is found in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and applies separately to state and federal proceedings. Therefore, if the defendant has already been convicted or acquitted in one jurisdiction, a retrial in that same jurisdiction would violate double jeopardy. But, a defendant can be tried in both federal and state courts for the same conduct without violating double jeopardy because each court has jurisdiction over its own territory and laws.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\n- The state conviction might not necessarily bar the state indictment since it's within the same jurisdiction but could likely bar any further state proceedings for the same offense based on the principle of res judicata ( which prevents a matter from being tried twice in the same jurisdiction.\n\n- The federal indictment would likely not be barred by the state conviction due to the separate jurisdictional authority of federal courts.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome would be that the state indictment would be dismissed based on double jeopardy concerns, while the federal indictment would stand. \n\nThe answer would be: B. the state indictment, but not the federal indictment."
