However, it is usually frowned upon and may be considered theft if the tag is attached to the product with the intent to deceive (for example, making someone believe they are purchasing a new item when it has already been used. \n\nOn the other hand, having answers to a test in your possession without intending to share them or allowing others to use them, especially if this gives you an unfair advantage over other students, is clearly morally wrong. This action undermines academic integrity and fairness in education. It not only deprives other students of an honest assessment of their knowledge but also potentially disqualifies you from the true value of achieving good grades through personal effort and learning."
