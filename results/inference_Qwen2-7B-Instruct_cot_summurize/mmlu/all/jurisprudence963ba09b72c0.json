While American Realism can be seen as having some overlapping interests with Critical Legal Studies, particularly in their skepticism towards formal legal principles and their focus on how law operates in practice rather than in theory, American Realism itself does not necessarily adopt a liberal ideology. American Realists critique the overly optimistic view of law that assumes it is a neutral arbiter of justice, often highlighting the role of personal biases, politics, and social power dynamics within the legal system. This critique can be applied across various ideological lines, including those beyond liberalism. CLS, on the other hand, emerged from a post-structuralist and critical theory perspective, challenging the notion of law as a neutral mechanism for social justice and often advocating for a more radical transformation of legal structures. Therefore, while both movements critique traditional legal formalism, they do not necessarily share the same ideological framework."
