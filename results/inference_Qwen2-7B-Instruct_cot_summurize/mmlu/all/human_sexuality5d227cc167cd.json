Transvestites, also known as cross-dressers, often wear clothing associated with the opposite sex for personal enjoyment or sexual arousal, but their gender identity remains consistent with being male or female. It's important to note that labels can be complex and personal, and individuals may not identify with any of these terms or may use a combination of them."
