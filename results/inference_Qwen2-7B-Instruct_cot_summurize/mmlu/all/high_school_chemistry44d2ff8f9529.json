Since there are two chromium atoms in the dichromate ion, the sum of their oxidation states must equal -2. Thus, 2 * (+3) = +6, and to achieve a net charge of -2, oxygen (O, which typically has an oxidation state of -2, must be present in such a quantity that its total contribution balances out the +6 from the chromium atoms. This means there are 7 oxygens in the dichromate ion, contributing a total of -14 to the overall charge, allowing the dichromate ion to have a net charge of -2.\n\nGiven this, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 6+, reduction\n\nWhen dichromate ion forms Cr3+, it undergoeses reduction because the oxidation state of chromium decreases from +6 in dichromate ion to +3 in Cr3+. \n\nTherefore, option C correctly identifies the oxidation state of chromium in dichromate ion as +6 and indicates that reduction occurs when dichromate ion forms Cr3+."
