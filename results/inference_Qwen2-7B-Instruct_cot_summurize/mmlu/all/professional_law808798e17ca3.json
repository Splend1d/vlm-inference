When the crane was manufactured, some of the welding of its parts was done improperly. No one had ever noticed this manufacturing defect in the crane. The defect caused the crane to break and topple over. Part of the crane fell on the doctor's car. The doctor's car was completely destroyed. The car was valued at $35,000. The doctor had auto insurance, and the insurance company promptly paid the doctor $35,000 under the insurance policy. If the doctor brings suit against the manufacturer of the crane, will the doctor prevail?\n\nA. No, because the doctor had auto insurance, so she suffered no loss.\nB. No, because the manufacturer was unaware of the defect in the crane.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer sold a product with a dangerous defect.\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer failed to inspect the crane adequately before selling it.\n"

Yes, because the manufacturer sold a product with a dangerous defect.\n\nThe doctor would likely prevail in this case based on product liability laws, which hold manufacturers responsible for defects in their products that cause harm or damage. The fact that the doctor had auto insurance and suffered a complete loss of her car does not negate her ability to sue the manufacturer for damages. The key points here are:\n\n1. The crane had a manufacturing defect: This means that the product was not reasonably safe for its intended use when it left the manufacturer's hands.\n2. The defect caused the crane to fall and destroy the doctor's car: This directly links the manufacturer's negligence to the harm suffered by the doctor.\n3. The manufacturer was aware of the potential for such defects: Although they may argue that they were unaware of this specific defect, as a manufacturer, they are responsible for ensuring that their products meet safety standards and undergo proper quality control checks.\n\nGiven these points, the doctor would have grounds to argue that the manufacturer's failure to produce a safe product led to her loss. The insurance payment received does not preclude her from seeking additional compensation through a lawsuit against the manufacturer."
