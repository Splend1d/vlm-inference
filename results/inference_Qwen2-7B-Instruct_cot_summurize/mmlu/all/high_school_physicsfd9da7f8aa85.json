Therefore, regardless of whether the frequency is \\(f\\) or \\(4f\\), as long as the conditions (like temperature and pressure in the case of air) remain constant, the speed \\(v\\) at which the sound wave travels will be the same.\n\nSo, if a sound wave with frequency \\(f\\) travels through air at speed \\(v\\), a sound wave with frequency \\(4f\\) will also travel through the air at speed \\(v\\).\n\nThe correct answer is B. v"
