                    "text": "A. Inbreeding and loss of genetic variation threaten a population.\n\nThis statement is correct because in small populations, inbreeding ( or mating between closely related individuals - can lead to a higher rate of homozygosity ( which means that individuals have two copies of the same gene variant. This can increase the frequency of recessive deleterious mutations, leading to decreased fitness and potentially extinction. Additionally, loss of genetic variation makes the population more susceptible to environmental changes and diseases, as there is less genetic diversity to provide resistance or adaptability.\n\nThe other options either inaccurately describe the effects of certain factors on a population or present misconceptions:\n\nB. Migration of new individuals into the population does not necessarily threaten it. In fact, it can help by introducing new genetic material, reducing inbreeding, and increasing genetic diversity, which can be beneficial for the population's long-term survival.\n\nC. Mutations do occur in all populations, but they can be either harmful, neutral, or beneficial. While some mutations can reduce the health of a population if they are harmful, not all mutations reduce health. Moreover, some beneficial mutations can actually improve the population's resilience.\n\nD. Breeding with individuals from a different population ( or hybridization - doesn't inherently cause the extinction of the first population due to a decrease in diversity. Instead, it can lead to hybrid vigor if the two species have complementary traits or it can lead to reproductive isolation if the hybrid offspring are not viable or fertile, which can eventually lead to speciation. However, if the original population becomes too genetically similar due to inbreeding, this can indeed increase the risk of extinction."
