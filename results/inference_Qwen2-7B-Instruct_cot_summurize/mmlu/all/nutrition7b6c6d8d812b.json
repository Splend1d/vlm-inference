It posits that early life exposure to \"germs\" or microbes is necessary for the proper development of the immune system.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. Living on a working farm will help reducing the development of atopic diseases\n\nThis is because farms typically have a greater variety of microorganisms than more sanitized environments, which can potentially stimulate the immune system and help prevent allergies and other immune-related disorders. However, it's important to note that the relationship between the hygiene hypothesis and these conditions is still being researched, and the results are not universally consistent across all studies."
