This is a straightforward calculation of his salary change.\n\nHowever, when considering real income, which adjusts for inflation or changes in the price level, we need to take into account the tripling of the average price level in Sherwood. Since Robin's income doubled but the prices tripled, his purchasing power decreased. This means that even though he makes more money, he can buy fewer goods and services than before, because each dollar buys less.\n\nTherefore, Robin's real income stayed the same or decreased, depending on how strictly you interpret \"stayed the same.\" If it must be an increase, then option D is incorrect because his real income did not stay the same; it actually decreased relative to the previous purchasing power. So, the closest correct answer would be:\n\nD. (D) Increased   Stayed the same"
