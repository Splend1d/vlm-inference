While some mutations can lead to cancer by increasing tumor growth (as stated in option C, not all mutations are harmful. In fact, many mutations do not affect an organism's health at all. Some can even be beneficial, providing new traits that may help the organism survive and thrive in its environment. Therefore, options A and B oversimplify the complex nature of mutations."
