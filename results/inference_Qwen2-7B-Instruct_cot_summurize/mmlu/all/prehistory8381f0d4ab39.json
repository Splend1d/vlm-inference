The structure of the innominate bone, which includes the ilium (the part that forms the front of the hip socket, and the ischium, one of the bones forming the back of the hip socket. In bipedal organisms, the ilium is typically oriented vertically or nearly so, and the ischium is relatively broad.\n\nB. The position of the foramen magnum, which is the opening through which the spinal cord passes into the skull. In bipedal organisms, this opening tends to be positioned more centrally in the skull, closer to the base, compared to the more lateral position found in quadrupedal animals.\n\nC. The absence of a divergent big toe, often referred to as hallux valgus. This is a characteristic seen in many quadrupedal mammals where the big toe points outward, but in bipedal humans and their ancestors, the big toe is typically aligned with the other toes when standing upright.\n\nBy examining these features together, a paleoanthropologist can make a more informed conclusion about whether an extinct species was capable of bipedal locomotion."
