                    "text": "The correct and practical method to measure the wavelength of the sound wave produced by a guitar string using a meterstick involves understanding the physics behind resonance and standing waves.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nA. **Lightly touch the guitar string in the middle such that a single node is created. Measure the length of the string; this is the wavelength.** This method is incorrect because creating a single node at the midpoint actually measures the length of the string that's not contributing to the standing wave pattern. For a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends, the nodes are found at these endpoints, and the wavelength (\u03bb) would be twice the distance from one node to the next, not the length of the string itself.\n\nB. **Measure the length of the guitar string; this is half the wavelength.** This statement is also incorrect. The length of the guitar string is not directly related to the wavelength. For a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends, the length of the string (L = \u03bb/2, meaning the length of the string is half the wavelength, but not the other way around.\n\nC. **Adjust the length of a pipe placed near the string so that resonances are heard. Measure the difference between the pipe lengths for consecutive resonances; this is half the wavelength.** This is the correct answer. When you adjust a pipe to resonate with the sound wave, you're essentially setting up a situation where the pipe's length matches a multiple of the wavelength ( (n*\u03bb), where n is an integer (1, 2, 3, etc.). The difference between two consecutive resonant pipe lengths corresponds to the wavelength because each step in resonance represents an additional full wavelength within the pipe. Thus, the difference between two consecutive resonant pipe lengths gives you the full wavelength.\n\nD. **Measure the peak-to-peak distance of the wave as it passes; this is the wavelength.** This method is incorrect because the peak-to-peak distance refers to the total amplitude of the wave, not its wavelength. The wavelength is a spatial measurement and does not directly correlate with the amplitude or peak-to-peak distance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
