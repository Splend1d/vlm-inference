The mean is the midpoint of the distribution.\n2. Standard deviation tells us how spread out the values are from the mean.\n\nGiven:\n- 60% of parts last over 3 years. This means that 40% last less than or equal to 3 years. In terms of a normal distribution, this corresponds to the 40th percentile.\n- 70% of parts last less than 6 years. This corresponds to the 70th percentile.\n\nWe can use z-scores to relate these percentiles to the mean and standard deviation. The z-score formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWhere \\( X \\) is the value of interest ( (3 years and 6 years in our case), \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFrom standard normal distribution tables or using a calculator, we can find that:\n- The z-score corresponding to the 40th percentile is approximately -0.253.\n- The z-score corresponding to the 70th percentile is approximately 0.524.\n\nLet's set up two equations based on these z-scores:\n\nFor 3 years ( (40th percentile):\n\\[ -0.253 = \\frac{3 - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\\[ -0.253\\sigma = 3 - \\mu \\] \n\\[ \\mu - 0.253\\sigma = 3 \\] ( ...equation (1)\n\nFor 6 years ( (70th percentile):\n\\[ 0.524 = \\frac{6 - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\\[ 0.524\\sigma = 6 - \\mu \\]\n\\[ \\mu + 0.524\\sigma = 6 \\] ...equation (2)\n\nNow, we solve these two equations simultaneously for \\( \\mu \\) and \\( \\sigma \\).\n\nAdding equation (1 and equation (2:\n\\[ (\\mu - 0.253\\sigma) + (\\mu + 0.524\\sigma) = 3 + 6 \\]\n\\[ 2\\mu + 0.271\\sigma = 9 \\]\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{9 - 0.271\\sigma}{2} \\]\n\nSubstituting this expression for \\( \\mu \\) into either equation (1 or equation 2. We will use equation 1 for simplicity:\n\\[ \\frac{9 - 0.271\\sigma}{2} - 0.253\\sigma = 3 \\]\n\\[ 9 - 0.271\\sigma - 0.506\\sigma = 6 \\]\n\\[ 9 - 0.777\\sigma = 6 \\]\n\\[ 0.777\\sigma = 3 \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{3}{0.777} \\approx 3.861 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( \\sigma \\) back into the equation for \\( \\mu \\):\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{9 - 0.271(3.861)}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{9 - 1.052}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{7.948}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 3.974 \\]\n\nThus, the closest option is B. \u03bc = 3.977, \u03c3 = 3.861."
