In such collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved (some of it is converted into other forms of energy like heat or sound. However, linear momentum is always conserved in any collision, whether elastic or inelastic.\n\nSo immediately after the collision, both carts will have the same linear momentum because the total momentum before the collision (which is the momentum of the 1.5 kg cart since the 0.5 kg cart was at rest, must equal the total momentum after the collision, which is now the combined mass of the two carts moving with some common velocity. \n\nThe velocities and kinetic energies may be different for the two carts post-collision depending on their masses, but the total linear momentum remains the same. The mass of the carts also remains constant throughout the collision, so it does not change after the collision, but it doesn't answer the question directly."
