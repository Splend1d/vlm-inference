The widgets had to have the buyer's logo imprinted on them. The manufacturer ordered the raw material and made a new widget mold that contained buyer's logo. The buyer wanted quick delivery of at least 10,000 right away. The manufacturer rushed the order and sent 10,000 conforming widgets two days later. The buyer paid for the widgets but rejected delivery on the remaining 90,000 widgets. The manufacturer filed suit and claimed damages for breach of contract. Defendant buyer filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the statute of frauds was violated in that it was a contract for over $500 that was unenforceable under state law. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, the statute of frauds must be enforced when it involves goods over $500.\nB. Yes, the manufacturer did not protect its interests by agreeing to an oral contract and it must pay for its bad business practices.\nC. No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\nD. No, the law will enforce the \"benefit of the bargain\" rule.\n"

No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn most jurisdictions, contracts for the sale of goods worth more than a certain amount (often $500 or another specified threshold) generally need to be in writing to be enforceable, as per the Statute of Frauds. However, there is an exception to this rule when the goods are specifically manufactured or altered for a particular buyer. In this scenario, since the manufacturer ordered raw materials and created a new widget mold with the buyer's logo, the goods were indeed specially made for the buyer. This would fall under the exception to the Statute of Frauds, allowing the oral agreement to be enforceable.\n\nTherefore, the court is unlikely to grant a motion to dismiss based solely on the violation of the Statute of Frauds, given that the goods were specially made for the buyer. The court would consider the specifics of the case and the exception provided by the Statute of Frauds in determining whether the manufacturer has a valid claim for breach of contract."
