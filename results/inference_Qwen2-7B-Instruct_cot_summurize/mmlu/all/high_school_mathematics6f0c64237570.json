Therefore, the measure of $\\angle C = 110^\\circ$.\n\nHowever, if the question is asking for the measure of an angle adjacent to $\\angle B$ ( which would be $\\angle A$ or $\\angle D$, then we use the property that adjacent angles are supplementary:\n\n\\[ \\text{Adjacent angle} + \\angle B = 180^\\circ \\]\n\nSo, for $\\angle A$ ( which is adjacent to $\\angle B$:\n\n\\[ \\angle A + 110^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\]\n\\[ \\angle A = 180^\\circ - 110^\\circ \\]\n\\[ \\angle A = 70^\\circ \\]\n\nSince the question seems to ask for the measure of $\\angle C$, which is directly given as $110^\\circ$ ( based on the property of opposite angles in a parallelogram being equal, none of the provided options exactly match this answer. \n\nHowever, interpreting the question to ask for the measure of an angle that is supplementary to $\\angle B$, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. 70\n\nThis corresponds to the measure of an angle adjacent to $\\angle B$, not $\\angle C$ directly as per the original interpretation of the question. If the intention was to clarify the measure of an angle supplementary to $\\angle B$, then option D correctly represents that measure. For the original question's intent regarding $\\angle C$, the correct understanding is that its measure is 110 degrees, which isn't listed among the options."
