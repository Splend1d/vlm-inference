Hieroglyphics were indeed one of the earliest forms of writing, so option C is not incorrect but it doesn't cover the full scope of the statement given. Hieroglyphics did use pictographs and symbols to represent words and sounds, which means option A is false.\n\nAs for option B, while hieroglyphics might seem like they appeared suddenly when compared to other ancient scripts, their development was likely a gradual process over several centuries. The complexity and sophistication of hieroglyphics suggest that they evolved over time, rather than being created in a single moment.\n\nTherefore, none of the options provided is correct based on our understanding of the development of hieroglyphics. A more accurate statement would be: \"Hieroglyphics used pictographs and symbols, did not develop suddenly, and were among the earliest forms of writing.\""
