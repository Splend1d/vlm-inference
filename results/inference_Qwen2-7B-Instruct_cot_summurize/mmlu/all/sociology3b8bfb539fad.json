It posits that the oppression of women is not just about personal or social attitudes, but is deeply rooted in economic relations and power structures. In this view, society is divided into two main \"sex classes\": those who have power ( (usually men) and those who do not ( (usually women). The power imbalance between these two groups is seen as perpetuating gender inequality, including through exploitation, control, and violence.\n\nThis perspective highlights that women's oppression is not only about their personal position within the family or society, but also about their exploitation in the workplace, political exclusion, and sexual subjugation. It aims to understand how these different forms of oppression are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, and seeks to challenge and dismantle these systems of power."
