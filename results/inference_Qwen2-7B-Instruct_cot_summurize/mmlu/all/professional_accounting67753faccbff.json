The fiscal multiplier is calculated by dividing 1 by (1 - marginal propensity to consume ( (MPC). In this case, the MPC is 0.8, so the fiscal multiplier (K is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{1}{1 - MPC} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5 \\]\n\nThis means that for every dollar increase in government spending, the total output increases by 5 dollars.\n\nThe difference between the full-employment GDP and the actual GDP is:\n\n\\[ Full Employment GDP - Actual GDP = $1.3 trillion - $1.2 trillion = $0.1 trillion \\]\n\nSince the fiscal multiplier is 5, the required increase in government expenditures to achieve full employment is:\n\n\\[ Required Increase = \\frac{Full Employment GDP - Actual GDP}{F} = \\frac{$0.1 trillion}{5} = $0.02 trillion \\]\n\nConverting this into billions of dollars:\n\n\\[ $0.02 trillion = $20 billion \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $20 billion."
