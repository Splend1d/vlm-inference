This refers to the principle of sources of international law as outlined in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ considers this source when interpreting or applying international law if it does not contain provisions applicable to the case before it. These principles are not necessarily found within the legal systems of the most civilised nations but are rather universal legal norms that are part of the fabric of international law."
