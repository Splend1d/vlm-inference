She was smoking marijuana, blowing it out the open window, and not sharing it with the driver. The driver fell asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and go into a ditch where it landed upside-down. Both the driver and passenger were seriously injured. She sued the operator for negligence. The operator filed a counterclaim asking for damages against the passenger by arguing that the passenger was herself negligent by \"smoking weed\" and causing him to fall asleep. Is the court likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim?\n\nA. Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\nB. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.\nC. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.\nD. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.\n"

No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.\n\nIn this scenario, the concept of a \"joint enterprise\" might apply. A joint enterprise exists when two or more people undertake an activity together, and each person is responsible for the actions of the other within the scope of that activity. In the context of the case presented, the driving on the highway can be considered an \"activity\" where both the driver and the passenger are engaged, even if the passenger is not physically operating the vehicle. The passenger's act of smoking marijuana, which contributed to the driver falling asleep and ultimately causing the accident, could be seen as a shared responsibility within this joint enterprise. Therefore, the court is likely to consider the passenger's action as contributing to the cause of the accident and may not dismiss the counterclaim."
