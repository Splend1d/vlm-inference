This is because MRI provides detailed images of the brain's structure, including its various regions and their connections. By analyzing these images, researchers can identify which parts of the brain are active during specific tasks or functions, which directly contradicts the notion that only a small portion of the brain is utilized.\n\nWhile other options like CAT (Computed Axial Tomography), EEG (Electroencephalogram), and PET (Positron Emission Tomography) have their uses in studying the brain, they do not provide the same level of detail about brain function and structure as MRI does."
