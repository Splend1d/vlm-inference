It involves the process of unlearning unwanted behaviors (or emotions) by replacing them with new, healthier responses. This is often achieved through various techniques such as relaxation training, positive reinforcement, and exposure to the feared object or situation in a controlled environment. The goal is to reduce the emotional response associated with a particular stimulus and replace it with a more desirable one.\n\nThe other options do not specifically refer to a therapy that combines both behavioral and cognitive interventions:\n\nB. Symptom substitution refers to a strategy where one symptom is replaced by another, but does not involve a combination of behavioral and cognitive interventions.\n\nC. Primary prevention refers to strategies aimed at preventing the onset of a problem before it occurs, rather than treating an existing issue through a combination of behavioral and cognitive interventions.\n\nD. Systematic desensitization is a behavioral therapy technique that involves gradual exposure to a feared stimulus while practicing relaxation techniques, but does not inherently combine cognitive interventions."
