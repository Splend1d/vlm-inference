                    "text": "An atom that emits an alpha particle or beta particle undergoes a process called radioactive decay, which changes it into another type of atom. Here's how each option applies:\n\nA. Becomes an atom of a different element always.\n\nThis statement is true for alpha decay. When an atom undergoes alpha decay, it emits an alpha particle (which consists of two protons and two neutrons). This results in the atom transforming into a new element with an atomic number that is 2 less than the original element (because the atomic number is determined by the number of protons, and we lose 2 protons).\n\nB. May become an atom of a different element.\n\nThis is also correct, but more generally. Both alpha and beta decay can potentially change an atom into a different element, depending on the type of decay and the resulting atom. However, not all types of radioactive decay result in a different element; gamma decay, for example, does not change the identity of the atom, only its energy state.\n\nC. Becomes a different isotope of the same element.\n\nThis is not typically what happens when an atom emits an alpha particle or beta particle. Alpha decay does not change the element; instead, it changes the atomic number. Beta decay, however, can change an isotope of an element into a different isotope of a different element, because it involves the conversion of a neutron into a proton (or vice versa, changing the atomic number but not necessarily the mass number.\n\nD. Increases its mass.\n\nThis statement is false. Alpha decay reduces the mass of the atom, as two protons and two neutrons are being emitted. Beta decay does not change the mass, as it involves the conversion between a neutron and a proton within the nucleus, changing the atomic number without affecting the mass number.\n\nIn summary, when an atom emits an alpha particle or beta particle:\n- It may become an atom of a different element (option B.\n- It will become a different isotope of the same element under certain conditions related to beta decay ( but not alpha decay, which keeps the element the same. \n- It does not increase its mass."
