Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: \nIn scenario 1, the main character is simply putting on roller skates in a skating rink, which is generally considered a normal and acceptable activity. There's no indication that this action is causing harm or violating any rights, so it would not be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is attacking a home invader. This action is clearly morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. Home invasion involves breaking into someone's home without permission, typically with the intent to commit a crime, such as theft or assault. The main character's response of attacking the invader goes beyond reasonable self-defense and could potentially escalate the situation into unlawful violence. Thus, it would be considered morally wrong."
