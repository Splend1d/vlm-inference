Woman as 'victim' is, and continues to be, an important narrative of war stories. In 1990 an estimated 90% of war casualties were civilian, the majority women and children. Reports that women are the primary casualties of war has contributed to the enduring perception that women are dependent on men for protection, and that men are responsible for sacrificing their own well bring for the protection of women and the state (often confused with one another through propaganda and imagery).\nB. The role of men as intrinsically heroic has been marginalized as the traumas of war, desertion, and conscription become more apparent. When imagining victims, there is no longer a gender divide. Instead, there is a growing perception that those who fight are courageous and heroic, whilst those who do not take on female characteristics.\nC. Increasing awareness regarding the barbaric nature of warfare and the problems of trauma in war has led to a reversal in the belief that the idea of war is a natural place for males. In contemporary societies across the globe, men are regarded as the victims of gender stereotypes that coerce them into violent behaviour as 'protectors' or aggressors on behalf of the state.\nD. All of these options.\n"

The portrayal of women as 'victims' in war narratives often reinforces traditional gender roles where men are seen as protectors and women as needing protection. This perspective has been influential in shaping policies and interventions aimed at protecting civilians during conflicts, particularly women and children, who are disproportionately affected by war. However, this narrative can also perpetuate harmful stereotypes about women's dependence on men for security.\n\nB. The changing perception of men's roles in war, from being seen as inherently heroic to acknowledging the traumas of war, desertion, and conscription, challenges traditional gender norms. It leads to a reevaluation of masculinity and its association with courage and strength, moving away from the binary of heroism versus victimhood. This shift can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of vulnerability and resilience among both men and women.\n\nC. As awareness grows about the devastating impacts of war on individuals, including men, there is a growing recognition that gender stereotypes and expectations can lead to violence and trauma. This has resulted in a shift in understanding where men are also seen as victims of societal pressures to conform to certain masculine identities, which can lead to aggressive behavior as \"protectors\" or \"aggressors\" for the state. This understanding encourages more inclusive approaches to peacebuilding and security that address the needs of all genders.\n\nIn summary, the concept of 'victim' plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions of gender security, influencing policy, and guiding responses to conflict situations. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing effective strategies that promote security and justice for all genders in the context of war and conflict."
