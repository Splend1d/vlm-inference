A reward tends to increase the probability of recurrence of the response that it follows.\n\nThorndike's Law of Effect, also known as the law of effect or the law of consequences, states that behaviors followed by positive outcomes (rewards) are more likely to be repeated, while behaviors followed by negative outcomes (punishments or aversive stimuli) are less likely to be repeated. This principle forms the basis for operant conditioning, a learning process where the strength of a behavior is increased or decreased based on its consequences."
