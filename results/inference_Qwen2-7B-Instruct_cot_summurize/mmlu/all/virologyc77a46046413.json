Members of many families can cause the same sort of disease.\n\nThis statement is correct because viruses are can belong to different families, but different species within the same family may cause similar diseases due to having similar structures and mechanisms of infection. For example, influenza viruses (all belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae) can cause various types of flu-like illnesses. \n\nA. Each member of the 'family' causes the same disease. \nThis statement is incorrect. Different members of a viral family can cause different diseases depending on their specific characteristics and host range.\n\nC. Most virus disease are now controlled by vaccines.\nThis statement is partially correct. Vaccines have been effective in controlling many viral diseases, such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and smallpox. However, there are still many viral diseases for which no vaccine exists or where the vaccine coverage is insufficient to control the disease globally, such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and certain strains of influenza.\n\nD. Most viruses can cross placenta and be teratogenic.\nThis statement is not universally true. While some viruses, like Zika virus and cytomegalovirus ( can cross the placenta and potentially cause harm to the fetus leading to birth defects (teratogenic effects), it is not a characteristic of all viruses. The ability of a virus to cross the placenta depends on its specific properties and how it interacts with the human immune system."
