The Constitution, which was adopted in 1787, did not explicitly address the issue of slavery, leading to a situation where it was effectively \"postponed\" or left unresolved. This law shows how individual states tried to deal with the complexities and moral dilemmas posed by the institution of slavery within their borders, even as the nation as a whole struggled to find a consensus on its future."
