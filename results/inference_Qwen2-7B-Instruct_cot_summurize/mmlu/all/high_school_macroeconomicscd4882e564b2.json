This means that more goods and services are being purchased from other countries than what is sold abroad. To correct this deficit, the country might need to take various economic measures such as increasing exports, decreasing imports, or implementing policies that encourage domestic production. It's important to note that a country doesn't necessarily have to ship gold to its creditors in response to a trade deficit; instead, it could involve adjusting monetary policy, fiscal policy, exchange rates, or trade agreements."
