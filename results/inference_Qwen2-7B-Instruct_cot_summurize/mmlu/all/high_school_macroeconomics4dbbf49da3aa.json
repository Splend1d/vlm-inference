This indicates that the value of the euro has decreased relative to the dollar, or in other words, the euro has depreciated. \n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they suggest the U.S. dollar has changed in value, which is not the case here. Option C is also incorrect because the question does not provide enough information about interest rates; changes in exchange rates are typically not directly linked to changes in interest rates unless there's a broader economic context being considered."
