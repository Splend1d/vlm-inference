This action is considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. Typically, tipping or accepting compensation for services rendered is expected and appropriate, but the scenario suggests that the driver is paying the passenger for being being late, which reverses the usual expectation and could be seen as taking advantage of the passenger or misusing the transaction for personal gain.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character refuses to break rules to become the best at something. This action aligns with ordinary moral standards, as it upholds integrity, honesty, and fairness. Cheating or breaking rules is generally viewed as morally wrong, as it undermines the values of competition, such as skill, effort, and sportsmanship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: \"Wrong, Not wrong.\""
