The packets must be re assembled upon receipt.\n\nThis option accurately describes the process used by modern networks. When you request a webpage or any other file from a web server, the server breaks the file into smaller units called packets. Each packet contains some data and a unique identifier (the header. These packets travel through the network, potentially taking different routes, until they reach your device. Upon arrival, the packets are reassembled in the correct order by your device's operating system to reconstruct the original file. This method ensures that even if one or more packets get lost during transmission, the rest can still be used to rebuild the complete file."
