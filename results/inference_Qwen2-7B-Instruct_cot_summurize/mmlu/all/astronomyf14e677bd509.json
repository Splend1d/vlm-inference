The probability of impact is the same next year as it is for any later year.\n\nWhile we cannot predict exactly when the next major impact will occur, it's important to note that the Earth is constantly at risk from meteoroids and asteroids. The probability of an impact does not decrease over time; rather, it's based on the number of potentially hazardous objects (PHOs) in our solar system that could collide with Earth. According to NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office, there are thousands of PHOs that have not been fully tracked yet. \n\nThe risk of a major impact is also influenced by factors such as the size of the impacting object, the speed at which it strikes the Earth, and where on the planet it lands. Scientists estimate that an impact by a large asteroid or comet could happen at any time, given the ongoing presence of these objects in our solar system. However, the likelihood of such an event occurring in the near future is considered low due to the vast distances involved and the complexity of predicting celestial events accurately."
