Relationship pricing.\n\nRelationship pricing involves understanding the specific needs and requirements of each customer and then setting prices based on this understanding, with the goal of fostering a long-term, mutually beneficial partnership. This strategy often leads to personalized pricing models that reflect the value the product or service provides to the individual customer, rather than relying on market averages or standard pricing structures. \n\nIn contrast:\n- A. Geographical pricing refers to setting different prices for products based on their location due to factors such as transportation costs, local demand, or competition.\n- B. Discount pricing involves setting lower prices for products or services to attract more customers or move excess inventory.\n- D. Value-in-use pricing, also known as usage-based pricing, charges customers based on how much they use the product or service, which can vary significantly from one user to another."
