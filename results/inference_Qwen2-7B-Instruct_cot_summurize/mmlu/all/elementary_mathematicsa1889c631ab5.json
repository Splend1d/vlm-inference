In this case, Malik wants to divide his 240 CDs into 12 equal groups, so we use division to find out how many CDs are in each group. \n\n- Option B (240 \u2013 12 would give the result if you were subtracting 12 from 240 repeatedly until you reached zero, which doesn't apply here.\n- Option C 240 + 12 would simply increase the total by adding 12, which isn't relevant to the problem.\n- Option D 240 \u00d7 12 would give the product if you were multiplying 240 by 12, which also doesn't fit the scenario."
