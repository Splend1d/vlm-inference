                    "text": "The correct answer is D. BBee will be yellow.\n\nIn Labrador retrievers, the gene for coat color is influenced by two factors: the presence of melanin (determined by the genes B (black) and b (brown), and the deposition of pigment into the hair, determined by the genes E (pigment deposition) and e (no pigment deposition). The alleles for pigment deposition (E or e) are said to be epistatic to the gene that codes for black or brown pigment.\n\nHere's how each option would affect the coat color:\n\nA. BBEe: This individual has one dominant allele B for black pigmentation and the dominant allele E for pigment deposition. Therefore, it will express black fur because the dominant allele B masks the effect of the recessive allele b for brown pigment.\n\nB. BbEe: This individual also has one dominant allele B for black pigmentation and the dominant allele E for pigment deposition. It would also express black fur, similar to option A.\n\nC. Bbee: This individual has one dominant allele B for black pigmentation and a recessive allele b for brown pigment. However, since the dominant allele B masks the effect of the recessive allele b, it would still express black fur.\n\nD. BBee: This individual has two dominant alleles B for black pigmentation and the dominant allele E for pigment deposition. Since both alleles are dominant and functioning, there is no need for the E allele to \"mask\" any recessive allele. Therefore, regardless of the presence of the b allele, the dominant B allele ensures that the fur will be black. However, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question's options as none of them directly states a yellow fur color based on the given genotypes. According to the information provided, an individual with the genotype BBee should have black fur, not yellow. It's possible there was an error in the question's intent or in interpreting the answer choices. Based on the information and typical genetic principles, the correct answer for the yellow fur color would actually be an individual without the dominant E allele for pigment deposition, which would make all other genotypes (BB*, Bb*, or bb* result in black fur, except if the question intended to refer to a scenario where the E allele is absent from the start, which is not clearly represented among the options provided."
