Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?\n\nA. If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.\nB. If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.\nC. If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.\nD. If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.\n"

If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result**.\n\nWhen a file is deleted by its owner, the links to that file become invalid or \"dangling\" because they no longer point to an existing resource. This can cause problems for other users who have shared access to the file, as their system will still believe the file exists at the given location but will not be able to access it since it has been removed from the storage. This issue affects the integrity and reliability of the shared file system, potentially leading to data loss or inaccessible resources for non-owner users."
