The end of the Cold War created the space for security policy and security studies to be re-considered in light of growing environmental consciousness underlined by multilateralism in policy action.\n\nThe conclusion of the Cold War significantly altered the global geopolitical landscape. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the bipolar world order, there was a shift in priorities for many nations. This period allowed for a reevaluation of traditional security paradigms, which were largely centered around military confrontation and nuclear deterrence during the Cold War. As a result, environmental concerns started to gain prominence within the realm of international security. The growing awareness of environmental issues and their potential impact on global stability encouraged a more holistic approach to security, incorporating environmental factors into foreign policy and defense strategies. Multilateral cooperation became more prevalent as countries worked together to address environmental challenges, recognizing the interconnectivity between environmental degradation and broader security concerns.\n\nB. In 1973 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC) restricted oil supplies which underlined the industrial capacity of the military leaving a profound psychological impact requiring that security be linked to national interests: the securing of energy deals and the environment became related to military capability diplomacy.\n\nWhile the actions of OPEC in 1973 led to significant oil price increases and energy crises, it is not accurate to claim that this event specifically linked security to national interests in terms of energy deals and environmental considerations through military capability diplomacy. The oil crisis of 1973 highlighted the vulnerability of economies to disruptions in oil supply, leading to increased efforts to secure stable energy sources and reduce dependence on imported oil. This event contributed to the development of energy security policies, which aimed to protect countries from future disruptions in oil supply. However, the direct link to military capability diplomacy and environmental considerations in this context is overstated. The primary focus at the time was on economic stability and energy independence rather than integrating environmental sustainability into military strategy or diplomacy.\n\nC. Ideologically driven military security was replaced by a need to preserve territorial integrity in wake of the collapse of communism. Military security was a high priority given the threat of spill-over. The environment remained a peripheral concern to the security institutions occupied with the new security environment post-Cold War.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union indeed marked a significant change in the global security landscape, with the end of the Cold War leading to a shift in focus from ideological-driven military security to other security concerns. Territorial integrity became a crucial issue as newly independent states emerged and faced challenges related to sovereignty and state-building. However, this does not necessarily mean that environmental concerns were completely sidelined; rather, they might have been perceived as less immediate threats compared to other security issues such as regional conflicts, terrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Environmental issues, particularly those related to pollution, resource depletion, and climate change, gradually gained recognition as long-term security threats that required international cooperation and policy attention. Nonetheless, they were often seen as secondary to more pressing security challenges in the early post-Cold War era.\n\nD. The end of the Cold War order create the intellectual space for the broadening of security issues beyond Cold War military mentalities. Research among political and environmental scientists discussed ways in which new security issues could be addressed. The plethora of publications produced, however, had little effect on policy.\n\nThe conclusion of the Cold War indeed facilitated a broader discussion about the nature of security beyond traditional military concerns. Political and environmental scientists began exploring the implications of environmental issues for international relations and national security, highlighting how environmental degradation could lead to instability, conflict, and migration. This intellectual discourse contributed to a growing understanding of the interconnectedness between environmental health and societal well-being. However, the translation of these ideas into concrete policy changes was often slow and limited, especially in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War. While there was an increase in academic research and awareness, translating this knowledge into actionable policies required overcoming various political and institutional barriers. The lack of direct impact on policy indicates that while the intellectual groundwork was laid, practical implementation lagged behind, reflectinging the complexity of integrating environmental considerations into existing security frameworks."
