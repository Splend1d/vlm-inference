Late one afternoon, two defendants were walking down the street when they noticed an open window at a doctor's office. The defendants crawled through the window, broke open his medicine cabinet, and stole various drugs.\n\nBurglary is typically defined as entering a building or dwelling unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime inside. In this case, the defendants entered the doctor's office through an open window without permission, and their intent was to commit theft by breaking open the medicine cabinet and stealing drugs items. This meets the criteria for burglary under most legal definitions. \n\nFor reference:\n- In California, Penal Code 459 states that burglary involves entering a building or inhabited dwelling \"with the intent to commit any felony or any theft.\"\n- In New York, Penal Law 140.20 defines burglary as \"entering a building or occupied structure or an enclosed vehicle with intent to commit a crime therein.\" \n\nPlease note that specific laws may vary by jurisdiction."
