Complex foragers rely on a wider range of food sources. \n\nThis is because complex foragers, often found in human societies, have developed sophisticated methods to exploit various types of resources including plants, animals, and even processed foods. They may also engage in trade or agriculture, which allows them to access a diverse array of nutrients and food items. Simple foragers, on the other hand, typically rely more narrowly on natural resources available in their immediate environment."
