The formula to calculate the volume of the stock solution needed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of stock solution} = \\frac{\\text{Desired concentration} \\times \\text{Desired volume}}{\\text{Stock concentration}} \\]\n\nGiven that we want 100 mL (or 0.1 L) of 4.0 M sulfuric acid, and the stock solution is 12.0 M, we substitute these values into our formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of stock solution} = \\frac{4.0\\,M \\times 0.1\\,L}{12.0\\,M} = \\frac{0.4}{12.0} = 0.0333\\,L = 33.3\\,mL \\]\n\nThis means you need 33.3 mL of the 12.0 M sulfuric acid stock solution and the rest should be water to reach the desired final volume. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask, and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water.**"
