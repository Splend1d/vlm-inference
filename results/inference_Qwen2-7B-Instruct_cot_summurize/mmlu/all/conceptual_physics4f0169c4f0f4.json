However, without knowing the exact volumes or heat capacities of the samples, we cannot determine an exact temperature. \n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 19\u00b0C ( - This is too low as it would require one to have a larger volume of colder water compared to the warmer water to achieve such a temperature.\n\nB. 22\u00b0C - This seems like a plausible answer because if you mix equal volumes of 20\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C water, the final temperature would be around the average, which is 22\u00b0C.\n\nC. 30\u00b0C - This is unlikely because you would need more of the warmer water to reach this temperature compared to the amount of cooler water.\n\nD. Higher than 30\u00b0C - This is not possible given that the highest initial temperature is 28\u00b0C.\n\nTherefore, the most likely temperature would be **B. 22\u00b0C** if equal volumes of both water types are mixed."
