                    "text": "Christopher Heath Wellman, a philosopher known for his work in political philosophy and ethics, has indeed presented arguments that touch on several of these points. However, it's important to note that Wellman's views are complex and multifaceted, and they might not neatly align with these options as presented. Here's a brief overview of Wellman's stance on some related topics:\n\nA. Anti-Egalitarianism and Liberal Cosmopolitanism: Wellman is often associated with a form of cosmopolitanism that he argues is compatible with liberal principles. In his work, he explores the idea that while states have rights and responsibilities within their own jurisdictions, there are also global responsibilities that transcend national boundaries. This perspective suggests that liberal cosmopolitanism could potentially accommodate anti-egalitarian elements if they do not infringe upon fundamental human rights or violate the basic principles of justice that are upheld within liberal societies.\n\nB. Closing Borders and Racism: Wellman does discuss immigration policies, but his views are nuanced. He critiques some forms of strict immigration control, suggesting that such policies can sometimes be used as a pretext for racism or xenophobia. While he acknowledges that certain restrictions may be justified under specific circumstances ( like national security concerns, he generally argues against blanket prohibitions without exceptions.\n\nC. Obligation to Open Borders to Least Well-Off Immigrants: This statement aligns more closely with the view that Wellman has critiqued. He argues against the idea that states have a duty to admit the poorest immigrants from other countries. Instead, he supports the notion that states should focus on their own citizens' welfare first and foremost, given the principle of prioritizing the well-being of one's own population. However, this does not necessarily mean that states have no obligations towards immigrants; rather, those obligations should be grounded in principles of justice and reciprocity.\n\nD. Presumptive Right to Close Borders: Wellman's views on immigration policy suggest a more cautious approach than option D. He recognizes that states have legitimate reasons to control their borders, including considerations of public safety, economic stability, and cultural preservation. Yet, he argues that these justifications must be balanced against the global responsibilities that states owe to humanity as a whole. This balance often leads him to advocate for more humane and just immigration policies, which respects both state sovereignty and global solidarity.\n\nIn summary, Wellman's philosophical arguments are intricate and context-dependent, often advocating for a balance between state sovereignty and global ethical responsibilities. His views on immigration and cosmopolitanism reflect a nuanced understanding that seeks to reconcile liberal principles with broader moral obligations."
