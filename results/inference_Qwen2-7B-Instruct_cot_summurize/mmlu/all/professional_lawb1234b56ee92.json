Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man's land. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The man, because the easement was extinguished.\nB. The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\nC. The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.\nD. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n\nIn this scenario, the easement over the man's property was properly recorded, which means it became part of the public record and was therefore accessible to anyone acquiring property adjacent to or near the easement. The purchaser, when buying the house from the woman, should have conducted a title search which would have revealed the recorded easement. Since the easement was recorded, the purchaser can claim that they had constructive notice of its existence, even if they were unaware of it during the purchase process. This constructive notice is sufficient for the purchaser to assert their rights under the easement, despite not having actual knowledge of it at the time of acquisition.\n\nThe man's actions to erect a barricade might be considered a legal attempt to terminate the easement, but without the proper legal procedures ( such as a court order or mutual agreement with the other party involved in the easement, these actions may not legally terminate the easement. In most jurisdictions, a physical obstruction of an easement is not enough to extinguish it unless it is done through a lawful termination process recognized by law.\n\nTherefore, the man is unlikely to prevail because the easement was properly recorded and the purchaser could argue that they had constructive notice of the easement."
