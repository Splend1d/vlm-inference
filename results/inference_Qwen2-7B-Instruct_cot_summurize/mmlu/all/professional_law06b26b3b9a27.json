The deed states they own it as tenants by the entirety.\n\n2. **Second Transaction,** Ann sells the remaining half-interest in the land to Hunter and Brandon on August 1, 2002. The deed indicates they own it as joint tenants.\n\n3. **Death of Hunter and Willa,** Hunter's will and Willa's will devise their interests to their son. Since they owned the land as tenants by the entirety, upon Hunter's death, his share would pass to his son under the laws of intestacy or according to his will ( (if any) which devotes his interest to his son. Similarly, Willa's share would also pass to her son under similar circumstances.\n\n4. **Death of Brandon,** Brandon's share of the land passed to him under the same principles as Hunter's and Willa's, since he was also a joint tenant with right of survivorship.\n\nGiven these facts:\n\n- **Hunter's Interest:** Hunter owned 1/2 of the land as joint tenant with Brandon.\n- **Willa's Interest:** Willa owned 1/2 of the land as tenant by the entirety with Hunter.\n\nUpon Hunter and Willa's deaths, their shares would pass to their respective sons:\n- Hunter's son inherits 1/2 of the joint tenant share ( (which was 1/2 of the total land).\n- Willa's son inherits all of her tenant by the entirety share ( (also 1/2 of the total land).\n\nNow, Hunter and Brandon together owned 1/2 of the land as joint tenants. When Hunter died, his share passed to his son, making the total interest held by the son:\n\n- Hunter's son's share from the joint tenancy = 1/2 ( (of the joint tenant portion)\n- Brandon's share from the joint tenancy = 1/2\n\nTogether, these two shares equal the entire 1/2 of the land. Therefore, Hunter's son now holds the equivalent of 1/2 of the land.\n\n**Answer:** C. an undivided one-half interest in the land."
