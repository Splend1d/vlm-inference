The virus is so antigenically variable\n\nThe reason there is no vaccine against HIV yet is largely due to its high genetic variability, especially in the envelope protein (gp120, which is a key target for vaccines. This variability makes it difficult to create a vaccine that can consistently recognize and neutralize all strains of the virus. Additionally, HIV has a unique ability to establish latency, where infected cells can remain inactive for long periods, complicating efforts to eliminate the virus from the body. However, cost and feasibility are factors in vaccine development, and changes in sexual habits can help reduce the spread of HIV but do not address the need for a vaccine. Latency does pose a challenge for vaccine efficacy, but it's not the primary reason why an HIV vaccine hasn't been developed yet."
