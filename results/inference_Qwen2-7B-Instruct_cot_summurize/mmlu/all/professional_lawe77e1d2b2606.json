                    "text": "The strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise might be unenforceable in this scenario is:\n\nA. It was not supported by new consideration.\n\nExplanation:\n- **B. Violative of the statute of frauds:** While the debt might have been barred by the statute of limitations, this does not necessarily make the oral promise unenforceable. The statute of limitations affects the creditor's ability to enforce the debt legally, but it doesn't directly impact the enforceability of the oral promise itself.\n- **C. The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations:** This argument suggests that because the debt was barred by the statute of limitations before the oral promise was made, the promise should also be unenforceable. However, once a promise is made to pay a debt that is otherwise barred, it can revive the debt if certain conditions are met, such as new consideration or mutual assent.\n- **D. There was no mutuality of obligation:** This refers to the principle that both parties must agree to the terms of the contract. In this case, the creditor must also agree to the new arrangement for it to be enforceable. However, the absence of mutuality does not necessarily mean the promise is unenforceable, especially if the creditor is aware of the promise and accepts payment.\n\n**A. It was not supported by new consideration** is the most compelling reason here. Consideration is something of value exchanged between parties to form a binding contract. In this case, the oral promise to pay the debt on September 1st is not backed by any new exchange of value (the creditor did not give anything in return for the promise to pay the debt). Without new consideration, the promise may be seen as lacking the necessary element to form a legally binding contract, making it potentially unenforceable."
