It is typically associated with the defense against armed aggression by other states. This approach tends to emphasize the role of military power, intelligence, and diplomacy in maintaining a state's security.\n\nIn contrast, human security encompasses a broader range of concerns beyond just military threats. It considers the safety and well-being of individuals, including their economic, health, environmental, and personal security. Human security recognizes that people's lives, human rights, and human dignity are threatened by various non-military issues such as poverty, disease, environmental degradation, and political oppression.\n\nTherefore, the statement that characterizes the traditional concept of national security, as opposed to human security, would be:\n\nD. The concept of national security is too narrow to be useful when analyzing the broad threats that currently exist.\n\nThis option highlights that the traditional focus on military threats alone does not adequately address the multifaceted challenges that can impact a population's security and well-being."
