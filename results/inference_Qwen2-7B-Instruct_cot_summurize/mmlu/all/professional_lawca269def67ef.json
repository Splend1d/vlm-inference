As part of its investigation, the police placed an electronic tracking device on the pharmacist's car. The tracking device was attached to the underbody of the pharmacist's car while it was parked outside his home. The police did not secure a warrant before installing the device. By means of the tracking device, the police were able to trail the pharmacist's movements. The police followed the pharmacist every day for almost a month. Finally, one day the police tracked the pharmacist's car to a vacant warehouse on the outskirts of town. While the pharmacist was inside the building, the police peered in the window and saw drug paraphernalia and equipment used in the manufacture of synthetic cocaine. Based on these observations, the police secured a search warrant and gained entry into the building. Once inside, the police arrested the pharmacist and confiscated a large quantity of synthetic cocaine that had just been produced. At his trial for illegal possession and manufacture of a controlled dangerous substance, the pharmacist moves to suppress the cocaine confiscated by the police. The pharmacist's motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the information upon which the search warrant was based was illegally obtained by means of the tracking device.\nB. granted, because the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search.\nC. denied, because the police could have discovered the location of the warehouse simply by following the pharmacist's car.\nD. denied, because the electronic surveillance of the pharmacist's car did not exceed 30 days.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. denied, because the electronic surveillance of the pharmacist's car did not exceed 30 days.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when law enforcement has probable cause to believe a crime has occurred and can justify the use of certain investigative techniques without a warrant.\n\nIn this case, the police had an anonymous tip suggesting the pharmacist was involved in illegal activity. They then placed an electronic tracking device on the pharmacist's car without obtaining a warrant. This action itself might raise concerns about the legality of the surveillance, but since the tracking device was attached to the car for only 30 days ( which is within the legal limit for such surveillance in some jurisdictions), and the police observed no illegal activities during this period, they obtained a search warrant based on their observations through the tracking device when the pharmacist entered a warehouse.\n\nOnce inside the warehouse, the police saw drug paraphernalia and equipment indicative of the manufacture of synthetic cocaine. This led to the pharmacist's arrest and the confiscation of a large quantity of synthetic cocaine. Since the police had probable cause for the search warrant based on their observations through the tracking device, and the evidence obtained after securing the warrant was not the direct result of the initial illegal surveillance ( the motion to suppress the cocaine would most likely be denied.\n\nOptions A and B suggest that the evidence should be suppressed due to illegal actions taken by the police. However, the key factor here is that the evidence was obtained after a proper search warrant was issued, based on the police's legitimate observations, which nullifies the basis for these options.\n\nOption D suggests that the motion to suppress would be denied because the surveillance did not exceed 30 days. While this is true, the critical point is that the police had probable cause to obtain a warrant based on their subsequent observations, making the duration of the surveillance irrelevant to the ultimate decision regarding the admissibility of the evidence."
