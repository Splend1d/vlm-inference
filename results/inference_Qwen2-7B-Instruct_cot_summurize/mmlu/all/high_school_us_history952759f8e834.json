O'Sullivan's statement emphasizes the idea that America was destined for greatness due to its vast geographical scope and the belief that it would embody divine principles. He envisions a future where the nation would expand across a hemisphere, symbolized by a \"floor\" of the Earth's surface, and its \"roof\" as the heavens. This expansion would supposedly lead to the establishment of a society based on equality and brotherhood, governed by natural and moral laws. The reference to a \"Union of many Republics\" and \"hundreds of happy millions\" indicates his view of an expansive and inclusive nation. The term \"divine principles\" suggests that this destiny is sanctioned or guided by a higher power, aligning with the notion of divine sanction."
