                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Smaller cells avoid excessive osmosis and subsequent lysis.\n\nExplanation: \n\nCells need to maintain their internal environment ( known as the cytoplasmic milieu, which has a different concentration of solutes compared to the external environment or extracellular fluid. This difference in solute concentration causes a continuous process called osmosis where water molecules move from an area of high water concentration (extracellular fluid) to an area of low water concentration (the cell's cytoplasm). If a cell is too large, it would have a large volume relative to its surface area. This large volume would result in a greater amount of solute inside the cell than outside, leading to an influx of water through osmosis, potentially causing the cell to swell excessively and eventually burst or lyse. Therefore, smaller cells minimize the risk of excessive osmosis and subsequent lysis by having a smaller volume relative to their surface area."
