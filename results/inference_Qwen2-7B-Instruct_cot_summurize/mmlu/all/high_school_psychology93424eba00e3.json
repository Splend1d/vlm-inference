I and II only.\n\nLongitudinal developmental research, which involves studying the same subjects repeatedly over a long period, has several advantages, including the ability to track changes and developments over time, observe cause-and-effect relationships, and reduce attrition bias. However, it also has some disadvantages:\n\nI. Greater cost and time commitment: Longitudinal studies require substantial resources, including funding, personnel, and time. Researchers must maintain contact with participants over extended periods, which can be challenging and costly.\n\nII. Attrition: Participants may drop out of the study over time, leading to attrition bias where the remaining participants might differ from those who dropped out in ways relevant to the research question.\n\nIII. Changes in the environment or context: While this can be seen as an advantage (as it reflects real-world conditions, it can also be a disadvantage if the external environment significantly impacts the results, making it difficult to isolate the effects of the variables being studied.\n\nTherefore, options I and II are typically considered disadvantages of longitudinal developmental research."
