                    "text": "A. Fluoxetine is considered of benefit: This statement is correct. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, is often used as a first-line treatment for bulimia nervosa. It helps in reducing binge eating and purging behaviors by balancing neurotransmitters in the brain.\n\nB. The first approach is to discuss body image: This statement is partially correct but can be misleading. While addressing body image is crucial in treating bulimia nervosa, it's not necessarily the first step. Treatment usually starts with a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition, followed by establishing a therapeutic relationship. Discussing body image becomes more relevant after initial stabilization and when the patient is ready to explore deeper emotional and psychological aspects of their illness.\n\nC. It is not useful to discuss weight with patients: This statement is incorrect. Discussing weight and body size is an integral part of treatment for bulimia nervosa. It helps the patient understand the impact of their eating disorder on their health and assists in setting realistic goals for recovery. However, this discussion should be done sensitively, focusing on health indicators rather than just weight.\n\nD. Treatments should target exclusively on purging practices: This statement is incorrect. Treatment for bulimia nervosa should not focus exclusively on purging behaviors. It should address a range of issues including binge eating, emotional regulation, distorted body image, and underlying mental health conditions like depression or anxiety. A holistic approach involving psychotherapy, medication, and sometimes nutritional counseling is typically recommended.\n\nIn summary, option A is correct, while options b, c, and d contain inaccuracies regarding effective treatment strategies for bulimia nervosa."
