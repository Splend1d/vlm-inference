With the man sitting in the passenger seat, the friend pulled the car over. They were feeling drunk and aggressive from the drinks. After discussing it, they decided it was a safe bet to enter the home and see what they could take. They broke in and took several bags of jewelry. While driving away, they were stopped and arrested for burglary. The passenger used the defense that he was too intoxicated to form the specific intent to enter the home for the purpose of committing a felony therein. Do the facts described here indicate that the defense will likely prevail at a trial on the merits?\n\nA. Yes, because he was in fact too intoxicated to form the intent needed to prove burglary.\nB. No, because intoxication is never a defense to the commission of a felony.\nC. No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.\nD. Yes, because the feeling of being drunk and aggressive were not his natural mental state and therefore mens rea was defeated.\n"

No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.\n\nThe defense of intoxication as a complete defense to criminal liability is not universally accepted in legal systems. In many jurisdictions, while intoxication may be considered when assessing a defendant's mental state (which is part of establishing the elements of a crime like burglary, it is typically not an absolute defense to proving the specific intent required for crimes such as burglary. The specific intent in burglary involves intending to commit a felony or theft upon unlawful entry into a dwelling. If the evidence shows that the defendant had the requisite intent despite being under the influence of alcohol, the defense may not succeed. Therefore, without more detailed information about the laws in the jurisdiction where this incident occurred, it is generally assumed that the defense would likely fail."
