                    "text": "To determine the validity of these statements, let's first understand what an \"element of order 15\" means in the context of group theory. An element \\(g\\) in a group has order 15 if \\(g^{15} = e\\) ( (where \\(e\\) is the identity element), and there is no positive integer \\(k < 15\\) such that \\(g^k = e\\).\n\n### Statement 1\nThe statement claims that if a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- **False**: This statement is false because the existence of one element of order 15 does not imply anything about the multiplicity or number of other elements of the same order within the group. The order of an element is a property that is specific to that element and does not inherently suggest any particular number of occurrences of elements with the same order in the group. For example, a cyclic group generated by an element of order 15 would indeed contain exactly one element of order 15, while other groups might contain additional elements of order 15, but their number cannot be determined solely from the presence of one such element.\n\n### Statement 2\nThe statement claims that if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- **False**: This statement is also false for similar reasons. The number of elements of a certain order in a group depends on the structure of the group and the nature of its elements, not just on whether there are more than a certain number of such elements. For instance, a group could have 9, 10, 11, etc., elements of order 15 without necessarily having at least 16. The structure of the group ( including whether it is cyclic, abelian, or non-abelian, and the relationships between its elements, would determine the exact number of elements of any given order.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the reasoning above, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
