So, it hashes to bucket number 3.\n- **Key 8**: \\(h(8) = 8 \\mod 5 = 3\\). Since bucket 3 is already occupied by the key 13, we resolve the collision using linear probing. We check bucket number 4 next: \\(h(8) + 1 = 9 \\mod 5 = 4\\), which is empty. Thus, key 8 goes into bucket 4.\n- **Key 24**: \\(h(24) = 24 \\mod 5 = 4\\). Since bucket 4 is occupied by the key 8, we continue with linear probing. Bucket number 5 (\\(h(24) + 1 = 5 \\mod 5 = 0\\)) is empty. Therefore, key 24 goes into bucket 0.\n- **Key 10**: \\(h(10) = 10 \\mod 5 = 0\\). Bucket 0 is already occupied by the key 24. Continuing with linear probing, we check bucket number 1 next: \\(h(10) + 1 = 11 \\mod 5 = 1\\), which is empty. Key 10 goes into bucket 1.\n- **Key 3**: \\(h(3) = 3 \\mod 5 = 3\\). Bucket 3 is already occupied by the key 13. We continue with linear probing, checking bucket number 4 next: \\(h(3) + 1 = 4 \\mod 5 = 4\\), which is occupied by the key 8. Finally, we check bucket number 0 (\\(h(3) + 2 = 5 \\mod 5 = 0\\)), which is empty. Key 3 goes into bucket 0.\n\nNow, let's summarize the final state of the hash table:\n- Bucket 0 contains keys 3 and 24.\n- Bucket 1 contains key 10.\n- Bucket 2 is empty.\n- Bucket 3 contains key 13.\n- Bucket 4 contains key 8.\n\nThe question asks for the content of the bucket numbered 2, so the answer is:\n\n**A. 3**"
