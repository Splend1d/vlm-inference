While some scientists have speculated about potential risks associated with cloning, such as the possibility of accumulating genetic mutations over generations, these are not objections explicitly raised by Kass in his arguments against cloning. Kass's main concerns typically revolve around ethical, moral, and social implications, such as the issues of identity, individuality, and the sanctity of life."
