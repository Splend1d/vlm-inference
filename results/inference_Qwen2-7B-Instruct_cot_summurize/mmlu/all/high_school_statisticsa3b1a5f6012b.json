If the population is normally distributed, then as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes closer to a normal distribution.\n\nThis theorem states that regardless of the shape of the underlying population distribution, if you take sufficiently large random samples from that population and calculate the mean of each sample, the distribution of these sample means will approximate a normal distribution. This approximation becomes more accurate as the sample size increases.\n\nOptions A and B describe related concepts but are not the precise statement of the Central Limit Theorem.
