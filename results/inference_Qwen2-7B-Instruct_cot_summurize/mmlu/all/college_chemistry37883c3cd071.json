The principal quantum number, \\( n \\), describes the energy level or shell of an electron.\n\nFor an electron in the \\( n = 4 \\) shell, the orbital angular momentum quantum number, \\( l \\), can take values from 0 to \\( n - 1 \\). Thus, for \\( n = 4 \\), \\( l \\) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe electrons with the highest energy and thus the easiest to remove are those in the subshell with the highest \\( l \\) value, as they have the largest angular momentum and occupy higher energy levels. Therefore, the electron that is most easily removed would belong to the \\( l = 3 \\) subshell.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 3"
