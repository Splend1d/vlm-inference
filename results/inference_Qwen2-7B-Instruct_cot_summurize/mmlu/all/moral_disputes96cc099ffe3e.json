Ross, who developed a non-consequentialist ethical theory that shares some similarities with Kantian ethics. Ross emphasized the importance of prima facie duties, which are obligations that may sometimes conflict and require us to consider which duty has greater claim in a given situation. This aligns more closely with Kantian ethics, which focuses on the intrinsic value of actions based on the motives behind them rather than their consequences or adherence to a set of rules."
