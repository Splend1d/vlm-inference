In the given Bayesian network:\n\n```\n    H -> U <- P <- W\n```\n\nWe have four nodes: H, U, P, and W.\n\nFor each node with n states, we need (n-1 parameters to specify its conditional probability distribution (CPD) given its parents in the network. This is because once we know the probabilities of all but one state, the last state's probability can be determined by ensuring that the sum of all probabilities equals 1.\n\n1. Node H has 2 states (T (True) and F (False). So, we need 1 parameter for H.\n2. Node U has 2 states, and it depends on H. So, we need 1 parameter for U given H.\n3. Node P has 2 states, and it depends on W. So, we need 1 parameter for P given W.\n4. Node W has 2 states. So, we need 1 parameter for W.\n\nAdding these up gives us a total of 4 parameters needed for this Bayesian network. \n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. 4**."
