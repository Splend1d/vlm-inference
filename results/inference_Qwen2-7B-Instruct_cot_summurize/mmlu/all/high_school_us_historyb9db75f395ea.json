After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nA settlement house worker was most likely to be motivated by which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "A. The Social Gospel\n\nThe Social Gospel movement, which Jane Addams was associated with, sought to apply Christian principles to social problems, particularly those related to urban poverty and inequality. This movement inspired many settlement house workers, including Addams, to address issues like labor rights, education, and housing for the poor. Therefore, a settlement house worker would most likely be motivated by the Social Gospel.\n\nB. Social Darwinism is not a motivating factor for settlement house workers as it promotes the idea of survival of the fittest, which often justifies social inequalities rather than addressing them.\n\nC. While some social reformers might have been influenced by socialist ideologies, Communism specifically refers to a particular form of socialism that emphasizes collective ownership of property and a classless society. The focus of settlement houses was more on providing immediate relief and reform within existing capitalist structures, so Communism is not the primary motivation for a settlement house worker.\n\nD. While urban political machines did provide funding and political support for various social reform efforts, their primary motivation was usually self-interest, such as securing votes or maintaining power, rather than altruistic social reform. Thus, while political support might have been beneficial, it is not the primary motivating factor for a settlement house worker."
