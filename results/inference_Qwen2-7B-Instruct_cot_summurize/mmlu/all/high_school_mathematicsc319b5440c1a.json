The prime factorization of 120 helps us in this:\n\n\\[120 = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\]\n\nFrom the prime factorization, we can see that the factors of 120 include powers of 2, 3, and 5. However, we're interested in the greatest odd integer factor, which means we should exclude any power of 2 since they make the number even.\n\nThe factors of 120 derived from its prime factors would include numbers like \\(3^1 = 3\\) and \\(5^1 = 5\\), but not \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. 5\nB. 3\nC. 15 ( (which is \\(3 \\times 5\\))\nD. 31\n\nThe greatest odd integer factor from these options is **C. 15**. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
