The population of SAT scores from each group is normally distributed.\n\nFor a t-test to be valid, one of the key assumptions is that the data should be normally distributed within each group being compared. This is particularly important when sample sizes are are small ( as they often are in such studies. The Central Limit Theorem provides some relief for larger samples sizes, suggesting that the sampling distribution of the mean will approach normality regardless of the population distribution, given a sufficiently large sample size. However, for smaller samples, the normality assumption is more critical.\n\nOptions A and B relate to knowledge of the population variances, which is not directly relevant to the choice of statistical test. An independent t-test does not require prior knowledge of the population variances; it estimates these variances from the sample data. Option C pertains to the equality of variances between the two groups, which is another assumption for certain types of t-tests, notably the pooled t-test. However, this is not a necessary assumption for all t-tests, especially when using versions like Welch's t-test, which do not assume equal variances."
