To achieve a higher level of confidence, you typically need to widen the interval. This is because a wider interval gives you more room to be confident that the true population parameter falls within it.\n\nThe exact percentage increase depends on the standard error and the z-scores associated with each confidence level. The z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645, while for a 99% confidence interval, it's about 2.576. \n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, we can compare the widths of the two intervals. Let's assume the width of the 90% confidence interval is \\(W_{90}\\) and the width of the 99% confidence interval is \\(W_{99}\\). The formula to find the percentage increase in width is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{W_{99} - W_{90}}{W_{90}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(W_{99} = W_{90} \\times \\frac{2.576}{1.645}\\), we can substitute this into our formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{W_{90} \\times \\frac{2.576}{1.645} - W_{90}}{W_{90}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 57.3\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the interval size increases by approximately 57%, making option C the correct choice."
