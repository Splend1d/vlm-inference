This can lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency against foreign currencies. An appreciating domestic currency makes exports more expensive for foreign buyers and imports cheaper for domestic consumers. Therefore, exports tend to decrease while imports increase, resulting in a worsening of the balance of trade."
