Specialization of labor can only exist in a society which produces a food surplus. This is because when a society has enough food to feed its members without overworking them, there is extra time and energy that can be devoted to other activities. In prehistoric times, when food production was largely dependent on hunting and gathering, there wasn't enough time or resources to develop specialized skills. However, as societies began to farm, they could produce more food than what was needed for survival, freeing up individuals to focus on tasks other than food production. This led to the development of specialized labor.\n\nB. Allows for sophisticated craft work, such as weaving, metalworking, pottery manufacturing. Specialization of labor enables individuals to become experts in their field by repeatedly performing specific tasks. This repetition leads to increased skill and efficiency, which in turn allows for the creation of more complex and intricate products. For example, a weaver who spends years mastering the craft will be able to create beautiful textiles with intricate patterns and designs that would be impossible for someone who has not specialized in that task.\n\nC. Is a characteristic of civilization. The development of specialization of labor is one of the key indicators that a society has reached a level of complexity associated with civilization. As societies become more complex, they tend to divide labor into more specialized roles, which allows for greater productivity, innovation, and cultural development. This specialization can lead to the establishment of distinct professions, institutions, and social hierarchies, all of which are are hallmarks of civilization.\n\nIn summary, specialization of labor emerged when societies produced a food surplus, allowing individuals to focus on developing expertise in specific tasks, leading to the creation of sophisticated craft work and being a defining characteristic of civilizations."
