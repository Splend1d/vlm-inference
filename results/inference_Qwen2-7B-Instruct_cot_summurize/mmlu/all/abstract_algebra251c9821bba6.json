                    "text": "Statement 1 is indeed true. In the context of ring theory, a maximal ideal \\(M\\) in a ring \\(R\\) is an ideal that is not properly contained in any other ideal of \\(R\\) except \\(R\\) itself. A prime ideal \\(P\\) in a ring \\(R\\) is defined by the property that if the product of two elements \\(a, b \\in R\\) is in \\(P\\), then at least one of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) must also be in \\(P\\). It can be shown that every maximal ideal is a prime ideal because if \\(ab \\in M\\) and \\(a, b \\notin M\\), then \\(M\\) would properly contain the ideal generated by \\(M\\) and \\(a\\), contradicting the maximality of \\(M\\).\n\nStatement 2 is also true. If \\(I\\) is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring \\(R\\), then the quotient ring \\(R/I\\) is a field. This is because, in \\(R/I\\), every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Given any non-zero element \\(x + I \\in R/I\\), since \\(I\\) is maximal, there exists an element \\(y \\in R\\) such that \\(xy \\in I\\). Since \\(I\\) is maximal, the ideal generated by \\(I\\) and \\(xy\\) equals \\(R\\), implying \\(1 = r(xy) + i\\) for some \\(r \\in R\\) and \\(i \\in I\\). Thus, \\(x(r(y)) = 1 + i\\) shows that \\(r(y) + I\\) is the multiplicative inverse of \\(x + I\\), making \\(R/I\\) a field.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
