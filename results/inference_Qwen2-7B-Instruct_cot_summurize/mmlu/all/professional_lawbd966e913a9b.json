In 1990, a homeless couple occupied the crumbling cabin. They restored it, fenced the perimeter, and maintained the grounds. They started paying the taxes, despite knowing there was an absentee owner. In 2000, the owner appeared and demanded that they pay rent. They agreed but stopped the payments two years later after consulting an attorney. The required statutory period in the state is 20 years. In 2011 the owner filed an ejectment action, asserting his ownership rights. Leaving aside any other theories or equities, can the couple prevail on a theory of adverse possession?\n\nA. Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.\nB. No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.\nC. No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.\nD. Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.\n"

Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.\n\nAdverse possession typically requires several elements to be met, including possession of the land openly, notoriously, continuously, and without permission from the true owner for a specific statutory period (which varies by jurisdiction. The length of time (in this case, 20 years) is one key factor, though not the only one. The possession must be hostile, meaning it is claimed as one's own, and it must be without permission. \n\nIn this scenario, the homeless couple occupied the property, restored and maintained it, and paid the taxes on it for over 20 years. These actions suggest they were in open and notorious possession of the land, claiming it as their own. Even if they paid rent at one point, which could potentially interrupt the continuous possession requirement, it is not clear that this payment was made voluntarily and under the owner's authority. The question does not specify that the payment of rent was done willingly or that it was part of a formal lease agreement, which would typically be required for such an interruption to count against the claim of adverse possession.\n\nThe fact that they continued to pay taxes suggests they considered themselves the owners, further supporting their claim of adverse possession. Assuming the law in the relevant state recognizes these actions as sufficient for adverse possession, the couple would likely prevail based on the duration of their possession alone, especially since the period exceeds the statutory requirement.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of adverse possession laws can vary significantly by jurisdiction, and additional details about the legal framework in this hypothetical state might affect the outcome. For instance, some states might require the possession to be uninterrupted for the entire statutory period, while others might consider voluntary payments of rent as breaking the chain of adverse possession. Without more information, option A is the most plausible answer based on the given facts."
