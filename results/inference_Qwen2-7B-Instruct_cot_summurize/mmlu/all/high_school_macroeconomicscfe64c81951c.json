In this scenario, when the Federal Reserve buys $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks, it injects $1 million into the banking system.\n\nHowever, because the reserve ratio is 10 percent (this implies that for every dollar deposited in a bank, only 90 cents can be lent out as loans (because 10% must be kept as reserves. \n\nGiven that money demand is perfectly elastic, if the Fed increases the money supply, banks will lend out the additional funds, and people will immediately deposit those funds back into their accounts, thereby keeping the overall money supply constant. Since there's no change in the amount of money people wish to hold at any given interest rate, increasing the money supply does not lead to an increase in the interest rate or aggregate demand (AD).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Money supply remains constant, the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase."
