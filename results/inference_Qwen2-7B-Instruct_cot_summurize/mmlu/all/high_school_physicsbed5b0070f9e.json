Collision B: the ball and the rod each experience the same torque, time of collision, and change in angular momentum.**\n\n### Explanation:\n\n**Collision A (** In a perfectly elastic collision between two identical carts, the total momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. This means that:\n- Each cart experiences the same force during the collision because the force exerted by one cart on the other is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction ( (Newton's Third Law).\n- The time of collision is a given duration during which these forces act.\n- The change in linear momentum for each cart is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, as required by conservation of momentum.\n\n**Collision B** ( When a ball sticks to a rigid rod, causing it to rotate about their common center of mass, the key dynamics involve angular motion rather than linear motion:\n- The ball and the rod experience the same torque because the force ( due to the collision imparts an equal and opposite moment around their center of mass. The torque depends on the perpendicular distance from the center of mass and the magnitude of the force.\n- The time of collision is relevant here in understanding when the force is applied, affecting the duration of the torque.\n- Angular momentum is conserved in this system if no external torques act on it. Thus, the change in angular momentum of the ball and the rod together ( considering them as a single system rotating about their center of mass - is determined by the initial conditions and any external torques acting after the collision.\n\nTherefore, option B accurately captures the dynamics of both collisions with respect to forces, time of collision, changes in momentum or angular momentum, depending on whether we are discussing linear or rotational aspects."
