However, given the sentence \"They are too irrational and uncodified,\" I can infer that you're possibly referring to certain aspects of systems, behaviors, or principles that lack structure (i.e., they are not codified) and do not follow logic (i.e., they are irrational).\n\nAssuming each option represents something different (like steps in a process, reasons, conditions, etc.), the answer could vary widely depending on what those numbers represent. Without specific definitions for A, B, C, D, and the numbers within them, I can't accurately match the sentence to an option.\n\nIf we interpret this as a general question about which pair best fits the description (\"irrational\" and \"uncodified\"), the answer would be:\n\nC. 2,3\n\nThis assumes that \"2\" and \"3\" represent elements that are both irrational and uncodified, which aligns with the characteristics described in the sentence. However, this interpretation is speculative since the exact context is missing."
