Christianity and Buddhism\n\nBoth Christianity and Buddhism aim to provide spiritual guidance and enlightenment to followers around the world, transcending geographical and cultural boundaries. Christianity seeks to spread the teachings of Jesus Christ, while Buddhism focuses on the path to enlightenment as outlined by the Buddha.\n\nThe other options do not consist of universalizing religions:\nA. Islam and Judaism: While Islam has a global following, it does not universally spread its teachings beyond Muslim communities. Judaism is largely confined to Jewish communities.\nB. Judaism and Buddhism: Both religions have distinct and localized followings and do not universally spread their teachings globally.\nC. Hinduism and Buddhism: Hinduism is widespread in India and neighboring countries but does not universally spread its teachings globally like Christianity or Buddhism. Buddhism, although having a global presence, is not as universally spread as Christianity."
