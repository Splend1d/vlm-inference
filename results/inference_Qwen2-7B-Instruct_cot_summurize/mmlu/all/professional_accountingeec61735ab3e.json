Let's denote the number of DVD players sold as \\(x\\), so the number of home entertainment systems sold would be \\(\\frac{x}{4}\\).\n\n**Overall Contribution Margin:**\nSince the sales mix is such that for every four DVD players sold, one home entertainment system is sold, the overall contribution margin can be calculated by considering the contribution from both products in this ratio.\n\n- Total Contribution Margin per Four Units Sold = ( (Number of DVD Players * Contribution Margin per DVD Player) + (Number of Home Entertainment Systems * Contribution Margin per Home Entertainment System)\n  = ($x * $64) + (\\(\\frac{x}{4}\\) * $140)\n\n**Total Contribution Margin Formula:**\n\\[= x * 64 + \\frac{x}{4} * 140\\]\n\n**Fixed Costs:**\nThe company has fixed costs of $90,000.\n\n**Break-even Point Calculation:**\nTo find the break-even point, we set the total contribution margin equal to the fixed costs and solve for \\(x\\).\n\n\\[x * 64 + \\frac{x}{4} * 140 = 90000\\]\n\n\\[x * (64 + 35x = 90000\\]\n\n\\[99x = 90000\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{90000}{99}\\]\n\n\\[x = 909.09\\]\n\nSince you can't sell a fraction of a product, and given the options provided, the closest number of DVD players that can be sold to break even based on this calculation is approximately 909 units. However, none of the options exactly matches this calculation. \n\nGiven the choices:\n\n- **Option A ( 300** does not match our calculation.\n- **Option B. 500** also does not match.\n- **Option C. 1200** does not match either.\n- **Option D. 1500** seems too high based on our calculation, but without a precise match among the options provided, we might infer that the closest answer based on the context of the question (considering typical break-even analysis principles and the nature of the options given (is likely intended to represent a scenario where the total quantity exceeds the direct calculation result due to rounding or approximation in the question setup.\n\nGiven the nature of the question and the provided options, **Option C. 1200** could be interpreted as an approximation for the total number of units (DVD players and home entertainment systems combined) that would be needed to reach the break-even point based on the given information, though strictly speaking, our calculation suggests a different quantity. Without further clarification on the specific intent behind the options, option C could be considered based on a broad interpretation aiming to align with the concept of reaching the break-even point through cumulative sales volume."
