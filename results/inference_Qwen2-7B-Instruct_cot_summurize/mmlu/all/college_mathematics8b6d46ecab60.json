The reason is rooted in the definition of compactness in metric spaces like \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). A set \\(K\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is compact if it is both closed and bounded. The Heine-Borel theorem tells us that in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), this equivalence holds: a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Moreover, a fundamental result in real analysis is that any continuous function defined on a compact set is automatically bounded and attains its bounds. Thus, Statement I is correct.\n\n**Statement II**: \"If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\"\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. While it's true that if a set is compact, then every continuous function on that set is bounded ( (which we've already established with Statement I), the converse is not always true. There exist non-compact sets where all continuous functions are bounded. For example, consider an open interval \\((0, 1)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\); it is not compact, yet every continuous function defined on it is bounded. Therefore, Statement II does not hold universally.\n\n**Statement III**: \"If K is compact, then K is connected.\"\n\nThis statement is true. Compactness and connectedness are related properties in topological spaces, including subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). In fact, for subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), compactness implies that the set is not only closed and bounded but also has the property that any continuous function from it to the real numbers is bounded and attains its bounds. Additionally, in Euclidean space, compactness implies connectedness, meaning there are no proper subsets of \\(K\\) which are both open and closed in \\(K\\). This follows directly from the definitions and properties of these concepts in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. I and III only**."
