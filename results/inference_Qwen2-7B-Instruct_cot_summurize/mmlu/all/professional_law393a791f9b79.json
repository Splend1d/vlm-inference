Under the relevant state statute, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum of one year in jail and/or a fine of $500. At trial, the defendant pleaded not guilty and requested that an attorney be appointed to represent him. The trial judge refused to honor the defendant's request for an attorney. If the defendant is subsequently found guilty, which of the following is the most severe sentence that can constitutionally be imposed?\n\nA. A $500 fine.\nB. Six months in jail.\nC. One year in jail.\nD. No sentence, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.\n"

No sentence, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.\n\nIn the United States, the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right to counsel for defendants in criminal cases. This means that if a defendant cannot afford an attorney, the court must appoint one to represent them. If a defendant is denied this right and subsequently found guilty, the conviction may be unconstitutional, and the sentence cannot stand. The court would need to either retry the case with proper representation or dismiss the charges entirely. Therefore, under these circumstances, the most severe sentence that could constitutionally be imposed would be no sentence at all due to the violation of the defendant's constitutional rights."
