These polls can give an indication of how different candidates are faring in terms of support and popularity. However, it's important to note that relying solely on television network news for election coverage may not provide a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of the election, such as endorsements from special interest groups or detailed policy positions on various issues. For a more complete picture, it's recommended to consult multiple sources of information."
