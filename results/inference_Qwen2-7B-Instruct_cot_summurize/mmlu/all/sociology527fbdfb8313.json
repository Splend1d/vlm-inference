This approach led to the decentralization of decision-making, giving local education authorities (LEAs) more autonomy over budgets and policies implementation. This was part of a broader movement towards greater privatization and competition within public services.\n\nA. More funding for students in higher education: While some reforms might have allocated more resources to certain areas or institutions types, the focus on market principles also included efforts to reduce government spending in some contexts.\n\nC. A reduction in parental choice of school: The opposite is generally true. Market principles often emphasize expanding parental choice by encouraging the creation of charter schools, private schools, and other options that parents can choose from.\n\nD. Increased state regulation through national testing and inspections: While there may have been an increase in standardized testing and inspection as a way to monitor and enforce standards, this is not a direct result of introducing market principles. Market principles typically advocate for less regulation, but in practice, governments often find it necessary to set standards to ensure fairness and equity.\n\nIt's important to note that the impact of these policies changes varies widely depending on the specific context, implementation details, and subsequent reforms."
