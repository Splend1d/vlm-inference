On numerous occasions the collector had rejected offers to sell his prized collection. Finally, on December 1, the collector sent his cousin, who was also a stamp collector, the following letter:\"I've decided to part with my stamp collection. Since I want to keep it in the family, I'll sell you my entire collection for $75,000. \"The collector had dictated this letter to his secretary, who mistakenly typed \"$75,000,\" instead of $78,000 that the collector had specified. After typing the letter, the secretary gave it to the collector, who hastily signed it without noticing the mistaken price. The cousin received this letter on December 3. On December 5, the cousin sent a letter accepting the collector's offer. Which of the following correctly states the agreement's price term and its legal effect?\n\nA. The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.\nB. The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.\nC. The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.\nD. The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.\n"

The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.\n\nIn this scenario, both parties, the collector and his cousin, have made a mistake regarding the agreed-upon price ($75,000 instead of $78,000). This constitutes a mutual mistake, which is generally grounds for rescindinging the contract under certain legal principles, such as the doctrine of mistake in contract law. Therefore, either party could potentially argue for the rescission of the contract based on the mutual mistake concerning the price term. However, whether or not they would successfully rescind the contract would depend on various factors, including applicable state laws and the specific circumstances surrounding the contract formation."
