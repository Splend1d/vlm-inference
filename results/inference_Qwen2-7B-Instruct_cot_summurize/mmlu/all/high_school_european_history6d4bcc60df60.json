A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above?\n\nA. The elimination of the Black Plague in Europe during the seventeenth century\nB. The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century\nC. The creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work\nD. A declining population during the seventeenth century that led to better food yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized\n"

The description of widespread famine, death, and desperation due to starvation suggests that a significant factor contributing to the situation was a severe shortage of food caused by some kind of catastrophic event or events, such as a pandemic (like the Black Plague, which had devastating effects on European populations in the past.\n\nOptions B, C, and D focus more on structural changes within agriculture and the economy, which might have helped alleviate the symptoms of famine once the immediate cause (such as the plague) was no longer present. However, without addressing the root cause of the famine (i.e., the sudden loss of population and subsequent strain on food resources, these solutions would not have been effective in the context described in the report.\n\nTherefore, the elimination of the Black Plague, which would likely result in a recovery of population and stabilization of food resources, would be the most responsible action for ending the problems of hunger mentioned in the report."
