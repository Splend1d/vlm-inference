Their contractual agreement provided that the photographer was to supply the actress with twelve glossy prints \"designed to capture and convey the actress as a gifted dramatic actress with varied talents. \" Their contract further stipulated \"said twelve prints to be delivered on or before November 15; with payment of $1,500 thirty days thereafter. \" Another contractual provision recited that the photographer \"guarantees that the prints will be fully satisfactory and delivered on time. \"The following day, the photographer accidentally fell down a flight of stairs, and sustained a broken leg. As a result of his injury, the photographer was unable to photograph the actress until October 31. At that time he informed the actress that because of the delay, \"I am going to need a few more days beyond November 15 to make delivery. \" The actress responded, \"Please hurry with the pictures, because I need to submit my promotional portfolio for the leading role in an upcoming movie. \"The photographer diligently worked to speed production and delivered the prints to the actress's manager on November 18. After the manager looked over the photographs, she told the photographer, \"I'm sure these will be acceptable to my client. \" However, the following day the photographer received a telephone call from the actress, who said, \"These prints are just awful. They make me look horrible. I'm sending them back to you and not paying anything. Besides, these prints were two days late. \"If the actress initiates an action against the photographer for breach of contract, which of the following would be the photographer's best defense?\n\nA. The photographs, if subjectively viewed, were not satisfactory.\nB. The photographs, if objectively viewed, were not satisfactory.\nC. The photographs were not delivered on time, thereby resulting in a failure of condition precedent to the actress's liability.\nD. The photographer's injury constituted a temporary impracticability of performance, which excused his duty to perform for a reasonableperiod of time.\n"

                    "text": "The best defense for the photographer in this scenario would likely be option D: The photographer's injury constituted a temporary impracticability of performance, which excused his duty to perform for a reasonable period of time.\n\nThis defense is based on the concept of \"impracticability,\" which generally refers to situations where unforeseen events make it extremely difficult or impossible to fulfill one's contractual obligations. In this case, the photographer's accident leading to his inability to complete the photoshoot on time due to his broken leg can be considered an unforeseen event that made the performance of the contract temporarily impracticable.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of this defense would depend on the jurisdiction's laws and the specific terms of the contract between the photographer and the actress. Some legal systems may require proof that the impracticability was not foreseeable, that there were no reasonable alternatives to fulfill the contract, and that the non-performance was only temporary. Additionally, the defense might also involve showing that the breach was not due to any fault or negligence on the part of the photographer.\n\nIn this particular case, the photographer's delay was caused by an accident that occurred after the contract was signed, which could potentially fall under the category of temporary impracticability. If the photographer can demonstrate that the delay was unforeseeable, unavoidable, and that he made efforts to mitigate the consequences ( such as working diligently to deliver the prints as soon as possible after the accident, the court might consider this a valid defense."
