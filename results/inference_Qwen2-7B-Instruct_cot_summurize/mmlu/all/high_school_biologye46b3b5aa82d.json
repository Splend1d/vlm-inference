Charles Lyell\n\nCharles Lyell's work, particularly his book \"Principles of Geology,\" presented the idea that the Earth was much older than previously thought and that geological processes were slow and steady over vast periods of time. This concept was crucial for Darwin as it supported the notion of gradual evolutionary change over long periods, which was central to his theory of natural selection."
