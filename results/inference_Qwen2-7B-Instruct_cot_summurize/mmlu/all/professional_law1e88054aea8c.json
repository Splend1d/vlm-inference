The neighbor who owns property adjacent to the farm knows of the friends' use of the property during the hunting season. One day during the hunting season, without the farmer's knowledge or permission, the neighbor took a shortcut across the farm to visit an acquaintance. The neighbor was wounded by a shot fired by one of the farmer's friends, who was shooting at quail and carelessly failed to see the neighbor. Traditional rules of landowners' and occupiers' liability apply. In an action by the neighbor against the farmer to recover for the injuries, will the neighbor be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the farmer is not responsible for his friends' conduct.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing.\nC. Yes, because the careless friend was permitted to hunt without safety training.\nD. Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.\n\nUnder traditional rules of landowners' and occupiers' liability, if someone engages in an activity that is considered \"abnormally dangerous\" ( such as the use of firearms, they may be held liable for injuries caused to others even if the injured party was not on the landowner's property with permission. This is because the risk of harm from the activity itself is so great that the landowner should take extra precautions to prevent accidents, including educating users on safety practices.\n\nIn this case, the farmer allowed his friends to hunt on his property without providing instructions about gun safety. This lack of safety measures could be seen as contributing to the dangerous nature of the situation, especially since the careless friend failed to see the neighbor. The neighbor was injured due to this dangerous activity, and under the principle of abnormally dangerous activities, the farmer might be held liable for the injuries, regardless of whether the neighbor was trespassing or not."
