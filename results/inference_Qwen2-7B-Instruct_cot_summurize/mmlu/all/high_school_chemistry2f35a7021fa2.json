This is because the overall reaction rate is limited by the slowest step in the reaction mechanism. The other steps can occur at much faster rates, so they do not limit the overall reaction rate.\n\nThe equilibrium constant (A) refers to the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium and does not determine the reaction rate. \n\nC) Reaction vessel pressure may affect the rate of certain reactions, especially those involving gases where volume changes impact the collision frequency and energy of collisions, but it does not determine the reaction rate for all reactions.\n\nD) Intermediates formed in the first step might be important in a reaction mechanism, but they do not necessarily determine the overall reaction rate unless they represent the slowest step in the mechanism."
