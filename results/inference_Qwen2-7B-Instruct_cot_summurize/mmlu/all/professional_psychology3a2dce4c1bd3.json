This is because schizophrenia tends to run in families and is influenced by genetic factors.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the risk for an individual not sharing a twin with someone with schizophrenia would be lower than this number. The exact risk can vary based on many factors including environmental influences, other genetic predispositions, and more."
