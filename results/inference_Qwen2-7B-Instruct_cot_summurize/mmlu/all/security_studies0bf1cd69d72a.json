Deterrence theory and game theory became highly influential within the academic world and gained centrality politically because the nature of the object allowed for a high degree of normative theorization which was accompanied by a mood of technological pessimism that fostered an ethos of critique.\n\nExplanation: During the 'golden age' of security studies, the threat posed by nuclear weapons and the Cold War's bipolar structure created a unique environment where strategic interactions could be analyzed using game theory. This period saw the rise of deterrence theory as a key strategy to prevent nuclear conflict. The complexity and uncertainty of these interactions led to a focus on norms and ethical considerations in strategy and policy-making. The perceived technological inevitability of catastrophic outcomes also fueled a critical discourse around the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\nB. The progressive research programs produced theories that actually form their own reality of abstractions, the world of \"secure second strike capability\", \"extended deterrence\" and \"escalation dominance\".\n\nExplanation: While this statement is true in terms of how these theories influenced the conceptualization of security, it doesn't fully capture the intellectual development aspect or the broader impact on policy and international relations during the 'golden age'. These concepts emerged from the application of deterrence and game theory to nuclear strategy and were indeed influential in shaping the behavior of major powers during this time.\n\nC. Game theory and deterrence theory as an intellectual development resulted in the trade-off between policy relevance/utility and theoretical abstraction/sophistication.\n\nExplanation: This statement acknowledges one of the key challenges faced by these theories. While they provided valuable insights into strategic interactions and decision-making processes, they often required a high level of abstraction that could make them difficult to apply directly to real-world policy decisions. This trade-off between theoretical elegance and practical applicability was a central concern during the 'golden age' of security studies.\n\nD. None of the above. The influence of deterrence theory was illusory. The build-up of nuclear weapons and first strike-oriented policies was driven by the internal logic of maximizing firepower. Theory served as the smokescreen that belied the intent.\n\nExplanation: This statement is overly simplistic and ignores the complex interplay between theory, policy, and historical context. While it's true that the buildup of nuclear weapons and first-strike strategies were rooted in the pursuit of military advantage, the role of deterrence theory and game theory cannot be dismissed. These theories not only provided justifications for certain policies choices but also influenced the strategic calculations and risk assessments made by states. Moreover, they contributed to a broader discourse about the ethics and implications of nuclear warfare, which had significant political and diplomatic consequences."
