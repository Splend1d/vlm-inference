However, if no trial or action has occurred within 180 days (or 175 days in this case considering the date provided, the defendant has the right to file a motion for discharge. Upon such a motion being made, the court must hold a hearing within three days and order a trial to commence within 90 days of the filing of the motion. Therefore, option C correctly reflects the legal requirement in this scenario."
