These processes include differentiation, where lighter materials float to the surface while heavier materials sink to the center, and melting or partial melting during impacts or heat from the early solar system. \n\nComets are generally composed of ice, dust, and some rocky material, and have relatively low metal content compared to meteorites. Pieces of Mars could contain metals, but they would likely not be significantly higher in metal content than typical differentiated asteroids. Leftover chunks of rock from the earliest period in the formation of the solar system might also have high metal content, as these could be part of the primordial building blocks of the solar system. However, among the given options, option B best fits the description for meteorites with high metal content."
