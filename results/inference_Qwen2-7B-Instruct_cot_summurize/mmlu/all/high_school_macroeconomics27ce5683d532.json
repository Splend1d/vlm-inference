This transaction has no direct effect on GDP.\n\nWhen you buy shares, you're engaging in a financial market transaction, not a consumption or investment in goods and services that contribute to GDP. The money you pay for the shares comes from your savings or another source of funds, but this does not increase the overall value of goods and services produced in the economy. GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. Buying stocks is considered part of financial transactions, which are do not directly affect GDP unless they lead to increased spending on goods and services."
