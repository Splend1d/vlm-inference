They also differ in that they release the nitrogen waste urea instead of ammonia. Which of the following statements correctly explains how this is an advantage for lungfish?\n\nA. Urea is insoluble in water and sinks to the bottom of the small pools. Thus the poisonous substance is isolated from the fish.\nB. Ammonia, which is highly toxic, would endanger lungfish that inhabit the small pools.\nC. Other fish in the small pools can use urea as an energy source.\nD. The highly toxic urea makes the pool uninhabitable to competitors.\n"

Ammonia, which is highly toxic, would endanger lungfish that inhabit the small pools. \n\nThis is because ammonia is indeed highly toxic to most aquatic organisms, including fish. By excreting urea instead of ammonia, lungfish are able to reduce the concentration of a potentially lethal substance in their environment, allowing them to survive in small, stagnant pools where the concentration of toxic substances might otherwise be too high for many other forms of life."
