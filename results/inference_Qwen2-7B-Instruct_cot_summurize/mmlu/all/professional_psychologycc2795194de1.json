Leiter-R\n\nThe Leiter-R (Revised Leiter International Performance Scale - Revised is an excellent choice for assessing nonverbal cognitive abilities in adolescents because it relies solely on visual and auditory stimuli. This makes it particularly suitable for individuals who may not have the language skills to perform well on tests that include verbal instructions or require verbal responses. The scale assesses aspects such as perceptual reasoning, processing speed, and fluid reasoning, which are foundational to overall cognitive function, without relying on verbal comprehension."
