Although the owner used due care in keeping the animal in a securely fenced area, he knew of one prior incident where the animal got loose and bit someone. Is the dog's owner liable for the injuries to the mailman?\n\nA. No, he is not liable because he used due care and was not negligent under the circumstances.\nB. No, he is not liable because the man was on someone else's property at the time of the incident.\nC. Yes, he is liable because a dog owner is always liable for any injuries caused to a third person.\nD. Yes, he is liable because an owner who knows of the dog's dangerous propensities is strictly liable for ensuing damages.\n"

Yes, he is liable because an owner who knows of the dog's dangerous propensities is strictly liable for ensuing damages.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, if a dog owner is aware that their dog has a history of aggression or has bitten someone before, they have a legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent further incidents. This includes keeping the dog restrained or under control when it is outside, so as to prevent it from harming others. In this case, since the owner knew of the dog's propensity to bite and failed to take adequate measures to prevent another bite, they would likely be held strictly liable for any injuries caused to a third party, such as the mail carrier."
