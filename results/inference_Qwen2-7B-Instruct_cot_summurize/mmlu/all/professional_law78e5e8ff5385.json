                    "text": "A state has recently released medical statistics showing that the number of new AIDS cases within the state has quadrupled from the preceding year. In 2008, the state reported that 2,250 people were diagnosed as being stricken with the AIDS virus. However, in 2009 the state confirmed that over 9,000 new persons contracted the deadly virus. In an effort to improve the health care of AIDS patients in the state, the Legislature has enacted a law providing public funds to assist privately owned hospitals. According to the law, every hospital in the state would receive $5,000 annually for each AIDS patient who was admitted to that hospital, and whose period of hospitalization exceeded one week. Although this bill was initially opposed by several churches and other organizations, the state's legislature re-drafted the bill in a compromise effort to appease the opposition. In its final re-draft, the bill provided that the $5,000 annual subsidy \"would not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. \"Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of the state's statute?\n\nA. The statute violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, by adopting the controversial views of particular churches on abortion.\nB. The statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment by conditioning the availability of public funds upon the recipient's agreement to act in a way that makes more difficult the exercise by others of their fundamental constitutional rights.\nC. The statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying nonAIDS patients the same subsidy benefits as those received by AIDS patients.\nD. The state will be unable to show it is advancing a legitimate governmental interest.\n"

The statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment by conditioning the availability of public funds upon the recipient's agreement to act in a way that makes more difficult the exercise by others of their fundamental constitutional rights.\n\nThis is because the statute creates a condition where hospitals receiving public funding for treating AIDS patients must agree not to perform abortions, which could be seen as interfering with the reproductive rights of others. This condition might be viewed as an impermissible restriction on the exercise of fundamental rights, particularly in light of the state's obligation to respect and protect such rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOption A also presents an issue related to the establishment clause, but it is not the strongest argument because the statute does not directly establish or endorse a religion or religious doctrine. Option C is not applicable since the statute does not discriminate against non-AIDS patients in terms of the benefits received. Option D is not necessarily a strong argument against constitutionality, as long as the state can demonstrate a legitimate interest in the statute, which it likely can do given the public health concern regarding the spread of AIDS."
