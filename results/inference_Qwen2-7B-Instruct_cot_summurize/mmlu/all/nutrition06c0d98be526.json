Adequate intake of protein can help maintain muscle mass and strength. However, consuming excessive amounts of protein may have some negative effects. \n\nOption A is incorrect because additional dietary protein does not increase the risk of hip fracture. In fact, adequate protein intake is important for maintaining bone health and reducing the risk of osteoporosis, which can lead to hip fractures.\n\nOption B is generally incorrect as well. While high protein diets can lead to increased nitrogen excretion in the urine, which might slightly increase calcium excretion, this effect is usually negligible and does not significantly impact overall calcium balance unless accompanied by other factors like low calcium intake or kidney disease.\n\nOption D is also incorrect. Consuming adequate protein is actually beneficial for maintaining and building muscle mass and strength. However, consuming too much protein (especially from animal sources and without sufficient exercise) can put stress on the kidneys and potentially contribute to weight gain or other health issues.\n\nInsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1 is produced by the liver in response to growth hormone and IGF-1 stimulates cell growth and division. Protein intake, particularly from high-quality sources such as lean meats, fish, dairy, and legumes, can stimulate the production of IGF-1, which has been linked to benefits such as improved muscle mass and strength, as well as potential cancer prevention. \n\nIt's important to note that the effects of protein intake on health depend on the total diet, overall health status, and individual needs, so it's always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice."
