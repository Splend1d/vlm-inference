Following their arrests, the man and the woman were placed in separate jail cells. The next day before arraignment, the man asked a police officer if he could see his friend, the woman. The man was taken to the woman's jail cell and allowed to talk to her. Neither defendant knew that the police had placed a listening device in the woman's jail cell. As a result, their conversation was being overheard and recorded by the police. The police planted the listening device without first securing a warrant. While they were together, the man told the woman not to admit to anything because they could beat the charges with the help of a good lawyer. At trial, the prosecution sought to introduce the man's incriminating statement into evidence. The man's attorney has filed a motion to exclude. The motion should be\n\nA. denied, because the defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nB. denied, because the statement did not violate the man's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nC. granted, because both defendants requested an attorney before engaging in their conversation.\nD. granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the listening device.\n"

The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures, which generally requires law enforcement to obtain a warrant based on probable cause. In this case, the police planted a listening device without first securing a warrant, which violates the constitutional rights of both defendants. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to exclude the man's incriminating statement from evidence, as it was obtained through an illegal search.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The defendants' lack of privacy does not justify the violation of their constitutional rights. Even though they were in separate jail cells, the installation of a listening device without a warrant still constitutes an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nB. The Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination, but the issue here is the violation of the Fourth Amendment due to the unlawful search and seizure, not the Fifth Amendment privilege.\n\nC. The request for an attorney prior to engaging in the conversation does not automatically grant the exclusion of evidence. The legality of the search and seizure must be determined independently of such requests."
