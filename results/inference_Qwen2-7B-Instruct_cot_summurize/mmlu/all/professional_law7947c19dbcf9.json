On cross- examination of the pedestrian's physician, the defendant's attorney asked him whether or not the pedestrian had told him that the leg that she claimed was injured had been permanently stiff as a result of a former field hockey injury the pedestrian suffered in high school. Upon objection by the pedestrian's attorney, the trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. sustain the objection, as violative of the physician-patient privilege.\nC. overrule the objection, as a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\nD. overrule the objection, as a statement against interest.\n"

Hearsay statements are generally not admissible in court unless they fit within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. The statement about the pedestrian's leg stiffness does not seem to fit into any recognized exception such as a statement for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment, a statement against interest, or other common exceptions like excited utterance, present sense impression, or business records. \n\nPhysician-patient privilege might also be relevant if the pedestrian had shared this information in confidence with the doctor during the course of treatment or diagnosis, but the question itself does not invoke this privilege directly. The privilege would protect the patient's confidentiality rather than allowing the doctor to share specific patient statements in court. Therefore, the trial judge should sustain the objection based on hearsay rules."
