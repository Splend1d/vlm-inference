However, it's known that the human oral cavity harbors a vast and diverse community of microorganisms, collectively known as the oral microbiome.\n\nEstimates for the number of different species range widely. Some studies suggest there could be hundreds or even thousands of different species present in the mouth at any given time. Therefore, none of the options provided ( A. 35, B. 100, C. 350, D. 500 accurately represents this complexity. The actual number is likely much higher and could potentially approach or exceed several hundred species. \n\nFor a more precise answer, one would need to consult the latest research in the field of oral microbiology."
