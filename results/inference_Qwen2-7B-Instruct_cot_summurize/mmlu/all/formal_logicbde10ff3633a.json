The other options can be derived through logical inference: \n\nA. ~L can be derived by Modus Tollens from premise 3 (I \u2283 ~L) and premise 1 (I \u2283 (J \u2261 K), since if I is true, then both J and K must be true, making L false.\n\nB. J \u2261 K can be derived directly from premise 1.\n\nC. I \u2283 (L \u2228 M) can be derived by Disjunctive Syllogism on premise 2 ( (J \u2261 K) \u2283 (L \u2228 M) and the derived proposition A.~L.\n\nD. ~L \u2283 (J \u2261 K) cannot be directly derived from the premises because premise 1 is I \u2283 (J \u2261 K, which only holds when I is true. Premise 3 is I \u2283 ~L, but this does not allow us to infer anything about J \u2261 K when I is false. Thus, D requires two steps or more to derive it logically."
