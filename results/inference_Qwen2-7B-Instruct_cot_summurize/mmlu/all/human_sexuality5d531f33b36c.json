Mike suffers from erectile dysfunction.\n\nThe description provided indicates that Mike is experiencing difficulty in achieving an erection when attempting to engage in sexual activity with his spouse, which is a common symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED). The fact that he can become aroused when seeing his secretary suggests that the issue might not be related to libido or desire but rather to the ability to achieve an erection during the act itself. It's important to note that erectile dysfunction can have various causes, including physical health issues, psychological factors, or a combination of both. Therefore, it would be advisable for Mike to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."
