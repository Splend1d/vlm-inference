This action leads to an immediate increase in the supply of good A at the current market price. \n\nSince the supply has increased while demand remains constant ( because consumers have not yet anticipated the price increase and adjusted their purchases accordingly), the new supply curve shifts to the right. This shift results in a lower equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The equilibrium price will fall and the equilibrium quantity will rise."
