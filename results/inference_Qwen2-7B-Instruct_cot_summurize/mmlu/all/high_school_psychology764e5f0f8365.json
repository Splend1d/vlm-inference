CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to depression. It has been shown in numerous studies to be an effective treatment for MDD, often leading to significant improvements in symptoms. \n\nWhile CBT can also be beneficial for other conditions listed, such as bipolar disorder and dissociative identity disorder, it is most commonly and highly recommended for major depressive disorder due to its efficacy and evidence base. For disorganized schizophrenia, while some forms of therapy including cognitive therapy may be used, antipsychotic medication typically remains the primary treatment approach."
