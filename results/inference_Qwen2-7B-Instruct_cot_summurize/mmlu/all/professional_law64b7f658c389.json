Such a sale is without reserve unless the goods are explicitly put up with reserve.\n\nIn auctions where a business like Cross & Black is selling off its assets, if there's no mention of a \"reserve\" price, it typically means the items will be sold to the highest bidder regardless of the bid amount. This type of auction is called an \"absolute auction.\" However, if the goods are explicitly put up with reserve, then there would be a minimum price set for the item(s), and the auctioneer has the right to not sell the item if it doesn't reach that reserve price."
