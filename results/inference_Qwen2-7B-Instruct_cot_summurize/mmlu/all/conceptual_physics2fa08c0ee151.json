Mathematically, this can be represented as F = kx, where k is the spring constant.\n\nIn the context of a tree branch, if we consider it as a very flexible spring, the bending of the branch due to your weight (W is analogous to the displacement in Hooke's Law. Therefore, the bending (let's call it 'bend') of the branch when you hang on it is directly proportional to your weight.\n\nIf you hang with twice the weight (2W, the bending of the branch would also double, assuming the branch can handle the load and does not break. This is because the force (in this case, your weight - is directly proportional to the bending according to the analogy of Hooke's Law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. twice the bend."
