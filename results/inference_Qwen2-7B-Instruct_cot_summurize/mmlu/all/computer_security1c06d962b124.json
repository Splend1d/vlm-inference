In fact, valid EV (or Extended Validation) certificates are generally considered to provide more confidence to a user about the identity of the website they're connecting to compared to Domain Validation (DV) certificates. EV certificates require a thorough verification process by a Certificate Authority (CA), which includes validating the legal ownership of the domain name by the organization. This process often involves contacting the organization directly and verifying their physical address, among other things. The additional scrutiny and documentation required for EV certificates make them more reliable indicators of the site's legitimacy. \n\nDV certificates, on the other hand, only verify the ownership of the domain without any further checks or public information about the entity behind the domain. They are less stringent and thus, typically considered less secure for establishing identity."
