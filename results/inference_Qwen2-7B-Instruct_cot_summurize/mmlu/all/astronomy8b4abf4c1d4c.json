The Moon split from the Earth due to tidal forces.\n\nWhile the process of tidal forces can affect the orbits and eventually lead to the splitting or ejection of celestial bodies, such as in the case of moons being pulled away from their planets, this specific mechanism (the Moon splitting from the Earth) was not among the main theories proposed for its formation. \n\nThe three main hypotheses for the origin of the Moon are:\n\nB. The Moon was captured into Earth orbit: This theory suggests that the Moon formed far from the Earth and was later gravitationally captured by Earth's gravity.\n\nC. The Earth and Moon co-accreted in the solar nebula: This theory proposes that both the Earth and the Moon formed simultaneously from the same material in the early solar system.\n\nD. Earth was rotating so rapidly that the Moon split from it: This is also known as the giant impact hypothesis, which suggests that a Mars-sized body collided with Earth early in its history, and the resulting debris coalesced to form the Moon."
