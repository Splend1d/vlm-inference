It is used in hypothesis testing to assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A small P-value ( typically \u2264 0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection.\n\nTo clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The probability of making a Type I error is not the P-value itself. A Type I error occurs when we incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis, and its probability is denoted by \u03b1, often set before conducting the test.\n\nB. The probability of making a Type II error is not the P-value either. A Type II error happens when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis, and its probability is denoted by \u03b2. The power of the test ( (1 - \u03b2) is related but distinct from the P-value.\n\nC. This option describes the concept of power rather than the P-value. The power of a statistical test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true."
