This can include changes in living standards, consumption patterns, education levels, and leisure activities.\n\nIt's important to note that the term \"bourgeois\" typically refers to members of the middle class or bourgeoisie in a historical context. The embourgeoisement thesis suggests that within societies where economic mobility is possible, even those in lower economic strata can aspire to and achieve middle-class status, thereby adopting its cultural norms and values. This does not necessarily imply that they have become capitalists ( option A) or that their occupations have been deskilled ( option C), nor does it suggest that the class structure has completely fragmented or disappeared ( option D)."
