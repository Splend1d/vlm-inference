Organizational size, industry type, and geographical location.\n\nOrganizational characteristics segmentation criteria typically refer to factors that help businesses divide or segment their market into distinct groups. The three broad groups mentioned in option C (organizational size, industry type, and geographical location, are commonly used for this purpose. \n\n1. **Organizational Size**: This refers to the number of employees, revenue, assets, or other measures that define the scale of an organization. Large organizations may have different needs and behaviors compared to small or medium-sized enterprises.\n\n2. **Industry Type**: This criterion involves categorizing organizations based on the sector they operate in, such as manufacturing, technology, healthcare, education, etc. Different industries often have unique challenges, opportunities, and regulatory environments that can influence consumer behavior and marketing strategies.\n\n3. **Geographical Location**: Organizations may differ significantly based on where they are operate. Geographic segmentation considers factors like climate, cultural norms, economic conditions, and legal requirements, which can impact how products or services are received and marketed.\n\nOptions A and B do not fit the traditional framework for organizational characteristics segmentation criteria. Option D is incorrect because there are indeed three common broad groups as described in option C."
