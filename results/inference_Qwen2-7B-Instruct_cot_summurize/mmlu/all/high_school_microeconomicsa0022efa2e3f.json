In the context of this question:\n\n- When one unit of labor is added, the output increases from 300 to 350, which might suggest increasing marginal productivity initially.\n- Adding another unit of labor increases the output from 350 to 375.\n\nHowever, the key to understanding this as short-run diminishing marginal productivity lies in the fact that only one factor (labor in this case) is variable while the other factor (capital) is fixed. As more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital, there comes a point where each additional worker contributes less and less to the total output because they have fewer resources (like machines or space) to work with. This decrease in the marginal product of labor signifies diminishing marginal productivity.\n\nLong run scenarios consider all inputs as variable, so increasing returns to scale (option A) would occur if adding more of all inputs leads to a proportionally larger increase in output. Decreasing returns to scale ( option B) would be the case if adding more of all inputs leads to a smaller than proportional increase in output. Constant returns to scale ( option C) happens when doubling all inputs doubles the output.\n\nGiven the information provided, the correct interpretation is that the short run scenario is exhibiting diminishing marginal productivity."
