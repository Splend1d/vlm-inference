It becomes thicker\n\nAs one grows older, the lens of the eye typically undergoes changes such as yellowing, becoming clouded (which is a condition known as cataracts, and may fill with fluid. However, it generally does not become significantly thicker. The lens primarily adjusts its thickness in response to muscle contractions to accommodate focusing on objects at different distances, a process that remains relatively stable throughout life."
