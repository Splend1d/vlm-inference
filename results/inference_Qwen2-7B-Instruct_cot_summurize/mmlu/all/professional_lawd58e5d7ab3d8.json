The following conveyances, each by a general warranty deed, take place in the order listed: An artist conveys to a bartender; the developer conveys to the artist; the artist conveys to a counselor; the bartender conveys to a dentist; the counselor conveys to an engineer. No deed was recorded until after the artist-to- counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor. The bartender-to-dentist deed and counselor-to- engineer deed were each recorded immediately after their respective executions.

The artist records the deed next, then transfers to the bartender, counselor, and dentist all before recording.\n4. The counselor records the deed before transferring to the engineer.\n\nThe owner of the parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction is the last person who records the deed, because in a notice jurisdiction, subsequent purchasers who record their deeds have priority over those who do not, regardless of when the transactions occurred.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the engineer."
