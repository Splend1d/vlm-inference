Increased demand   Appreciate\n\nAn increasing national debt can lead to higher interest rates as the government borrows more money, which attracts foreign investors looking for higher returns. This increased demand for U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market can lead to appreciation of the dollar. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is just one factor affecting the value of the dollar. Other factors include inflation, economic growth, political stability, and global financial conditions among others. \n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because:\n\nB. An increase in the supply of dollars ( would typically lead to depreciation, not appreciation.\nC. A decrease in the supply of dollars would also lead to appreciation, not depreciation.\nD. Decrease in demand for dollars would lead to depreciation, not appreciation."
