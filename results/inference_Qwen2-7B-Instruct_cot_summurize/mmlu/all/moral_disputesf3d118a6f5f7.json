However, I can provide an explanation for each option:\n\nA. The duty to keep promises - This is generally considered a prima facie duty in many ethical theories and philosophical discussions.\n\nB. The duty not to harm others - This is also commonly recognized as a prima facie duty, emphasizing the importance of non-maleficence or doing no harm.\n\nC. The duty to protect our natural environment - While this is increasingly recognized as an important ethical consideration, it might be argued that it's not as universally accepted as a prima facie duty as traditional duties like those to keep promises or not harm others. However, it's worth noting that environmental ethics has gained more attention in recent years, so its status as a prima facie duty could be debated.\n\nD. The duty of nonmaleficence - This is another prima facie duty that emphasizes avoiding harm. It's often associated with medical ethics but is also relevant in broader ethical discussions.\n\nGiven these explanations, the most likely answer based on the information provided would be option C: the duty to protect our natural environment, since it may not be as universally accepted as a prima facie duty compared to keeping promises or avoiding harm. However, without knowing Ross's specific views, this is a matter of interpretation."
