This aligns with the statement \"All planets are smaller than Jupiter.\" \n\nLet's look at the other options:\n\nA. (\u2203x)(Px \u2022 Sxj) - This states that there exists an x which is both a planet and smaller than Jupiter. It does not apply to all planets.\n\nB. (\u2200x)(Px \u2022 Sxj) - This states that for all x, x is a planet and smaller than Jupiter. This would imply every object is both a planet and smaller than Jupiter, which is not what the original statement says.\n\nD. (\u2200x)(Px \u2283 Sxj) - This states that for all x, if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter. The order of Sxj and j is reversed, which changes the meaning.\n\nSo, option C is the most accurate translation of the given statement in predicate logic."
