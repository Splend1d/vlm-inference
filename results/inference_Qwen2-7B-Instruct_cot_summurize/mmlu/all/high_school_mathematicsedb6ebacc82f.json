                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can model the water level as a sinusoidal function and then find its derivative to determine the rate of change at noon.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(y\\) as the water level ( (in feet),\n- \\(t\\) as time since midnight ( (in hours).\n\nGiven that at high tide (at 8 A.M.), the water level is 15 feet, and at low tide (6 hours later (at 2 P.M.), it's 3 feet, we have:\n\n1. High tide: \\(y = 15\\) when \\(t = 8\\)\n2. Low tide: \\(y = 3\\) when \\(t = 8 + 6 = 14\\)\n\nThe amplitude of the oscillation is \\(\\frac{15 - 3}{2} = 6\\) feet, and the midline (average value) is \\(\\frac{15 + 3}{2} = 9\\) feet. The period of the oscillation is \\(12\\) hours ( (from high tide to next high tide), so the angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) is \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{T} = \\frac{2\\pi}{12} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n\nTherefore, the sinusoidal function modeling the water level can be written as:\n\\[y(t) = 9 + 6\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t + \\phi\\right)\\]\n\nAt \\(t = 8\\) ( (high tide), \\(y = 15\\), which gives us:\n\\[15 = 9 + 6\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cdot 8 + \\phi\\right)\\]\n\\[6 = 6\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{6} + \\phi\\right)\\]\n\\[\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3} + \\phi\\right) = 1\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1\\), we find \\(\\phi\\) such that \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3} + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). This implies \\(\\phi = -\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\\[y(t) = 9 + 6\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\]\n\nTo find the rate of change at noon (\\(t = 12\\)), we need the derivative of \\(y(t)\\):\n\\[y'(t) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\]\n\nAt \\(t = 12\\), substituting into \\(y'(t)\\):\n\\[y'(12) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cdot 12 - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\]\n\\[= \\pi \\cos\\left(2\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\]\n\\[= \\pi \\cos\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\]\n\\[= \\pi \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\]\n\\[= \\pi \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]\n\nTherefore, the water level was dropping at a rate of \\(\\pi \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) feet per hour at noon today, making the correct answer B. \\(\\pi \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)."
