It can often be palpated both inside the mouth (in the floor of the mouth near the tongue) and outside the mouth, just below the chin, depending on its degree of enlargement. This is because the submandibular gland is relatively superficial and quite accessible for physical examination. Therefore, it might be palpable both intraorally and extraorally."
