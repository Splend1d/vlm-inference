                    "text": "The magnetic moment of an atom is primarily due to the presence of unpaired electrons in its outermost shell. The elements listed here\u2014carbon ( \\(^{12}\\text{C}\\), nitrogen \\((^{14}\\text{N})\\), neon \\((^{20}\\text{Ne})\\), and sulfur \\((^{32}\\text{S})\\), all have stable electron configurations with no unpaired electrons. However, when considering isotopes, we find that:\n\n- Carbon has isotopes with both even and odd neutron numbers. Among them, \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\) has one unpaired neutron, contributing to its magnetic moment.\n- Nitrogen similarly has isotopes with both even and odd neutron numbers. Its most common isotope, \\(^{14}\\text{N}\\), has one unpaired neutron.\n- Neon, being a noble gas, has a completely filled valence shell and thus does not have any unpaired electrons, making it non-magnetic.\n- Sulfur also has isotopes with both even and odd neutron numbers, but its most common isotope, \\(^{32}\\text{S}\\), has no unpaired neutrons.\n\nGiven this information, both \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\) and \\(^{14}\\text{N}\\) could potentially have stronger magnetic moments due to their single unpaired neutron. However, among the options provided, nitrogen (\\(^{14}\\text{N}\\)) would have the stronger magnetic moment because it has a higher atomic number and thus a higher magnetic moment per neutron compared to carbon. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Nitrogen**."
