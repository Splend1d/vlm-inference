He argues that liberal egalitarian principles, which advocate for equal treatment and opportunities for all, can sometimes be at odds with immediate practical considerations when it comes to immigration. In certain scenarios, Carens posits that there might be a need to accept some short-term negative impacts on current citizens to achieve greater long-term benefits for both migrants and the society as a whole.\n\nThis perspective acknowledges the complexities involved in balancing humanitarian concerns with the economic and social needs of a nation, suggesting that sometimes making decisions that may initially appear to cause harm is necessary to achieve a more equitable and just society in the future."
