The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step?\n\nA. Obtain CT scan of the chest\nB. Obtain a swallowing evaluation\nC. Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube\nD. Prescribe fludrocortisone\n"

Obtain a swallowing evaluation.\n\nGiven the patient's recent diagnosis of pneumonia, decreased ambulation, and increased lethargy, it's crucial to ensure that he is not experiencing any complications related to his neurological condition or his current medical status that could impact his ability to swallow safely. Parkinson's disease can affect motor functions, including swallowing, potentially leading to aspiration pneumonia or other complications if not properly evaluated.\n\nSwallowing evaluations can help identify any potential dysphagia ( difficulty swallowing), which might necessitate further interventions such as dietary modifications, use of thickened liquids, or in severe cases, placement of a feeding tube like a PEG tube. However, this decision should be made after consulting with the patient's healthcare team and considering the patient's overall clinical condition, including nutritional status and the risk-benefit analysis of each intervention.\n\nPrescribing fludrocortisone (D) could also be considered if there is evidence of orthostatic hypotension or other signs of autonomic dysfunction, which is common in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, without more information about the patient's specific symptoms and clinical context, it's difficult to definitively recommend this course of action without further evaluation and consultation with the patient's healthcare providers.\n\nCT scan of the chest (A) might be useful if there were concerns about the extent of the lung infection or if there were additional imaging findings that required further assessment. Placing a PEG tube C) would typically be reserved for cases where there is clear evidence of aspiration risk, significant weight loss, or inability to tolerate oral intake due to swallowing difficulties, and should only be recommended after careful consideration of the patient's overall health status and swallowing function."
