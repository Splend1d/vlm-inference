An increase in the amount of capital.\n\nWhen there is an increase in the amount of capital (such as machinery, buildings, or tools), it can lead to higher productivity and output, which is essential for economic growth. \n\nB. Lower wages might initially make production cheaper, but they could also lead to lower consumer purchasing power, reducing overall demand in the economy.\n\nC. Price controls that keep prices low can distort markets, discourage investment, and potentially lead to shortages, all of which are can hinder economic growth.\n\nD. Increased government spending can stimulate the economy in the short term, but if not matched by revenue increases or cuts in other spending, it can lead to inflation and higher debt levels, which can restrain long-term growth."
