This is because the change does not significantly affect the overall understanding of the financial position or performance of the company.\n\nIn such a scenario, the auditor would most likely:\n\nA. Not refer to the change in the auditor\u2019s report.\n\nThe auditor's standard report on the financial statements would focus on expressing an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements as a whole, rather than individually addressing every change made by the company. However, if the change is mentioned in the financial statements' notes, the auditor might choose to:\n\nB. Refer to the note in the financial statements that discusses the change.\n\nThis approach allows the auditor to maintain a clean audit opinion while still providing necessary information about the change for those reviewing the financial statements. The decision on whether to include additional language about the conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( (GAAP) would depend on the nature and extent of the change and its implications for the financial statements. If the change alignably follows GAAP, it may be implied within the standard audit opinion without explicit mention, unless the context requires more detail.\n\nTherefore, without specific guidance from the auditing standards relevant to the situation ( which can vary slightly depending on the jurisdiction and the International Standards on Auditing ( (ISA) or the Generally Accepted Auditing Standards ( (GAAS), the correct answer based on common practices is A. Not refer to the change in the auditor\u2019s report, acknowledging that in practice, the auditor may refer to the note in the financial statements discussing the change if it is material to the understanding of the financial statements as a whole, even if the change itself is not material to comparability."
