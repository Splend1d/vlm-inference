Becoming older causes one to begin or increase consumption of herbal teas\n\nThis correlation suggests that as people get older, they tend to consume more herbal teas. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. This means that while there is an association between age and herbal tea consumption, we cannot directly infer that aging causes an increase in herbal tea consumption without further evidence from experimental studies. The correlation could be due to various factors such as personal preference, health trends, or other unmeasured variables that influence both age and herbal tea consumption."
