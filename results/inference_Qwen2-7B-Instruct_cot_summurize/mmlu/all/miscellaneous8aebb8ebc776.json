It is a self-regulatory organization (SRO) that oversees brokerages and ensures compliance with industry and regulatory rules. The other options listed are not government regulators for securities firms:\n\nA. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) primarily focuses on consumer protection, antitrust enforcement, and preventing fraudulent or deceptive business practices across various industries, including financial services.\n\nB. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC insures deposits in banks and savings institutions, not securities firms.\n\nC. Federal Reserve Board (Fed) is responsible for monetary policy, supervising and regulating banks, maintaining financial stability, and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions.\n\nThus, for securities firms in the U.S., it's FINRA that serves as the primary regulator."
