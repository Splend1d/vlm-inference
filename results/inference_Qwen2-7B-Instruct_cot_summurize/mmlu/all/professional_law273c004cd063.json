An owner of a Detroit drug store takes his gross cash receipts each week into a city in Canada where he lives and does his banking. The office of the Deputy Atty. General learned that the owner was doing this, and indicted him on 10 counts of \"willingly and knowingly\" taking cash over $10,000 into a foreign country without reporting it. The owner's main defense is that he did not know of the law or that he was breaking it. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is no defense. He was convicted and appealed. Will the federal appellate court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.\nB. Yes, because treaties with Canada make all such reporting laws unenforceable.\nC. No, the practice is so dangerous to the public interest that knowledge and specific intent are not required.\nD. No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.\n\nIn criminal law, the concept of willfulness means that the defendant acted with a conscious objective or purpose to do something that the law forbids. The willfulness requirement for a violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5316 ( (which involves the \"Winnings from Gambling and Other of Money of Foreign Origin\") is met when the defendant intentionally transports money across a border in an amount exceeding $10,000 without making a report, regardless of whether they were aware of the reporting requirement. This is because the law assumes that someone who repeatedly engages in the act knows the law and intends to violate it.\n\nThe judge's instruction to the jury that mistake of law is no defense aligns with the legal principle that ignorance of the law does not excuse criminal conduct. Therefore, the fact that the owner claims he was unaware of the law does not serve as a defense against the charge of willfully violating the statute.\n\nThus, the federal appellate court would likely uphold the conviction based on the habitual practice of transporting large amounts of cash, which implies that the defendant knew the law and intended to violate it, even if the defendant argues they lacked actual knowledge of the law."
