No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.\n\nIn the context of preserving an issue for appeal, it is typically necessary for a party to object to the court's actions at the appropriate time during the proceedings. In this scenario, the judge informed the parties of the instructions she intended to give before giving them to the jury. At this point, the defendant had an opportunity to object and express their disagreement with the judge's plan not to include the contributory negligence instruction. By not objecting at this stage, the defendant failed to preserve the issue for appeal under most legal systems' rules of procedure.\n\nOption A ( \"No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge gave the instructions to the jury.\" is incorrect because the critical objection period was before the jury instructions were given, not after the verdict was reached.\n\nOption C \"Yes, because the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence.\" is incorrect because while submitting a proposed instruction shows intent, it does not necessarily preserve the issue if the party fails to object to the court's decision regarding the instructions when given the opportunity to do so.\n\nOption D \"Yes, because the judge's failure to give the defendant's contributory negligence instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction.\" is also incorrect because the issue of whether a specific instruction was required is not automatically preserved by the judge's action; it must be raised through a timely objection during the proceedings."
