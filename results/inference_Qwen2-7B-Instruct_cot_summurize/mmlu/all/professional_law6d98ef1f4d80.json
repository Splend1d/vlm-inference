The defendant was arrested after allegedly trying to purchase several kilos of heroin from an undercover government agent. At trial, the undercover agent testified about the defendant's efforts to arrange the drug transaction. The defendant's defense, on the other hand, consisted entirely in attacking the undercover agent's credibility. During his summation, the prosecuting attorney, over defendant's objections, stated that he had produced the only witness who was willing to take the stand and testify to what occurred at the meeting when the undercover agent arrested the defendant. Based on the undercover agent's uncontradicted testimony, the prosecuting attorney urged the jury to convict the defendant. The defendant was convicted and, on appeal, argued that the judge erred in permitting the prosecutor's statement. The defendant's conviction should be\n\nA. reversed, because the prosecutor's remarks constituted improper comment about the defendant's right to testify.\nB. reversed, because the prosecutor's remarks were not proper rebuttal to defense attacks on the undercover agent's credibility.\nC. affirmed, because it is immaterial; the probative value of the defendant's failure to testify is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nD. affirmed, because the prosecutor had the right to express the strength of the evidence he had pursued.\n"

This type of argument can be considered a misstatement of the law regarding the defendant's right to remain silent and is generally not permissible.\n\nHowever, since the defendant's conviction should be affirmed, the focus here is on the legal principle that the probative value of the defendant's failure to testify is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. This means that even though the prosecutor's statement may have been improper, the overall weight of the evidence against the defendant (which includes the uncontradicted testimony of the undercover agent\u2014likely still supported the jury's decision to convict. Therefore, if the court finds that the error was harmless or that the defendant's right to a fair trial was not substantially prejudiced, the conviction might be affirmed despite the prosecutor's remark."
