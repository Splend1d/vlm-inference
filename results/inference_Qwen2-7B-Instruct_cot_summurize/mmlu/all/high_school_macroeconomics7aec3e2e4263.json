The United States begins to import rice to make up for a domestic shortage.\n\nWhen the world price of rice is lower than the domestic price, it indicates that there is an opportunity for the United States to benefit from importing rice at a cheaper rate, rather than producing it domestically at a higher cost. This situation can lead to a domestic shortage if the demand for rice exceeds the supply produced domestically at the higher price.\n\nIn this scenario, the United States would likely import rice to meet the demand, thereby making up for the domestic shortage and taking advantage of the lower global prices. This is a typical response in a competitive market under conditions of free trade when the world price is below the domestic price, as it allows countries to specialize in production where they have a comparative advantage and exchange with others to optimize resource allocation."
