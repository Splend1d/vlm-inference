(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\ni) Maximum likelihood estimation indeed selects the parameter values that maximize the probability of observing the actual values of the series.\n\nii) While it's true that maximum likelihood estimation is often used for GARCH models due to their likelihood function, GARCH models can also theoretically be estimated using other methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS under certain circumstances, though this is generally not recommended as it does not take into account the conditional heteroskedasticity present in the data.\n\niii) In the case of a standard linear model without GARCH effects, the OLS and ML estimates for the slope and intercept parameters will indeed be identical because both methods will yield the same solution in this context. However, the estimator for the variance of the disturbances ( or error terms) would be different between OLS and ML if heteroskedasticity is present. Since GARCH models are specifically designed to handle time-varying volatility, this statement applies to GARCH models.\n\niv) Computer packages do typically use numerical procedures to estimate GARCH models since there are no simple closed-form solutions for estimating these models due to their complex nature. Analytical solutions exist for simpler models but not for GARCH models which involve non-linear dynamics and time-varying variances."
