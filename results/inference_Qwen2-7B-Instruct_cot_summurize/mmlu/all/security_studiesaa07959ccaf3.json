During the post Cold War period there has grown an increasingly disparity between the analytical framework of security studies and HM, sidelining the latter and excluding it from mainstream study.\nB. Following the popularity of HM during the Cold War it has enjoyed a gradual inclusion into security dialogue and is now considered one of the main paradigms within security studies.\nC. The negativity attached to HM during the Cold War restricted the prominence of HM at this time, excluding it from mainstream security studies. Following this, the broadening of the security studies agenda has lead to increasing inclusion of HM as an area for study.\nD. HM was developed as an approach to security studies following the Cold War and has flourished in the proceeding security environment. It has also enjoyed reputable success thanks to its affiliation with prominent actors during the Cold War.\n"

Following the popularity of HM (Hegemonic Multilateralism during the Cold War, it has enjoyed a gradual inclusion into security dialogue and is now considered one of the main paradigms within security studies.\n\nThe Cold War era saw the rise of Hegemonic Multilateralism as a significant paradigm in international relations, which emphasized the role of powerful states in maintaining global order through multilateral institutions and cooperation. This approach influenced security studies by highlighting the importance of international law, diplomacy, and collective action in managing conflicts and promoting stability.\n\nAfter the Cold War, security studies evolved to encompass a broader range of issues, including non-traditional threats like environmental degradation, cyber security, and transnational crime. This expansion of the security agenda created space for the integration of different theoretical perspectives, including those that had been overshadowed or excluded during the Cold War, such as Hegemonic Multilateralism.\n\nAs a result, the once-popular paradigm of Hegemonic Multilateralism, which was influential during the Cold War, began to experience a resurgence and was gradually included into security dialogue. Its emphasis on international cooperation and the role of powerful states in maintaining global order resonated with contemporary debates about the changing nature of security and the need for multilateral responses to complex global challenges.\n\nToday, security studies acknowledge the importance of Hegemonic Multilateralism as one of the main paradigms alongside others like realism, liberalism, constructivism, and critical security theory. This inclusion reflects a more nuanced understanding of security that recognizes the interplay between various factors, including state power, international institutions, and societal influences."
