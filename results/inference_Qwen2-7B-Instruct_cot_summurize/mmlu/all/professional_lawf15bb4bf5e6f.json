The authorities arrested the man for felonious larceny, a crime that is also called theft in some states. The man defended on the basis that he had no intent to steal and only wanted his rightful compensation. He filed a motion to dismiss, relying essentially on proof that he had no intent to steal because he believed in good faith that it was his own property. What will be the most likely decision of the court?\n\nA. The charges will not be dismissed because his intent becomes irrelevant when he uses force to obtain possession of property.\nB. The charges will be dismissed because the intent to steal is a required element of both theft and larceny and this man did not intend to steal because he thought that he had a right to the money.\nC. The charges will be dismissed because he can raise the defense of necessity and it is always lawful to take what a person needs to survive.\nD. The charges will not be dismissed because the man's right to the money was disputed and therefore his intent is irrelevant as compared to the employer's intent and belief.\n"

The charges will be dismissed because the intent to steal is a required element of both theft and larceny, and this man did not intend to steal because he thought that he had a right to the money.\n\nIn legal terms, the defenses of good faith belief in ownership or necessity are generally not sufficient to negate the mens rea (or \"guilty mind\" required for theft or larceny convictions. However, the court might consider the defendant's belief in good faith and the context of the case to determine if the prosecution has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with the requisite intent to commit theft or larceny. \n\nIf the evidence shows that the defendant genuinely believed the money was rightfully his, and there is no clear indication of deceit or fraudulent intent, the court may rule that the prosecution has failed to establish the intent necessary for a conviction. In such a case, the charges might be dismissed."
