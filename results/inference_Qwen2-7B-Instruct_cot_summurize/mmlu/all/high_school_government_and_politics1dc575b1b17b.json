The National Security Advisor does not require Senate confirmation. The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, but this position typically does not require a full Senate confirmation process like Cabinet-level positions do. Therefore, the correct answer includes positions I (Director of Homeland Security, II Secretary of the Treasury, and IV U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations."
