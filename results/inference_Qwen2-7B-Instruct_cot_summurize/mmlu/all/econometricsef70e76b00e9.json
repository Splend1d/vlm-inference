                    "text": "The Dickey-Fuller test is used to determine if a unit root is present in a time series sample. The null hypothesis of the test is that the time series has a unit root (i.e., it is non-stationary), while the alternative hypothesis is that the time series is stationary.\n\nIn the context of the given question:\n\nA. More negative than those in the left hand tail of a normal distribution: This statement is generally true because the test statistic under the null hypothesis of a unit root tends to be more extreme (i.e., more negative or less positive) compared to the distribution of test statistics under the alternative hypothesis (i.e., the distribution would resemble a normal distribution centered around zero if the null were false). The left tail of a normal distribution represents the region where we might reject the null hypothesis if our test statistic falls there.\n\nB. Less negative than those in the left hand tail of a normal distribution: This statement is incorrect because, as explained above, the test statistic under the null hypothesis is expected to be more extreme (i.e., more negative) than what would be observed under the alternative hypothesis.\n\nC. Obtained from an analytical formula for the density of the Dickey-Fuller distribution: This statement is correct. The test statistic in the Dickey-Fuller test is derived from an analytical formula based on the underlying distribution, which depends on the specific model being tested ( e.g., the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.\n\nD. More negative i.e. bigger in absolute value for a 10% size of test than a 5% test: This statement is also correct. When testing at a higher significance level (e.g., 10% instead of 5%), the critical values of the test statistic will be less extreme, allowing for rejection of the null hypothesis with a larger test statistic. Therefore, a test statistic obtained from a 10% test would be more negative (i.e., have a larger absolute value) than one from a 5% test if both tests are conducted on the same data."
