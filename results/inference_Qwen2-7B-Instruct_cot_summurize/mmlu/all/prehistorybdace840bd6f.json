The Iberomaurusian culture is associated with the early to middleolithic period, typically dated from around 50,000 to 20,000 years ago, and it is primarily found in the western Mediterranean region. \n\nOn the other hand, the Capsian culture emerged later, roughly between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago, and is known for its distinctive pottery, lithic technology, and presence across North Africa. This cultural shift represents a significant development in the prehistoric history of the region."
