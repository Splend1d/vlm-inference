Neandertals had wide, squat torsos and short extremities.\n\nNeandertals, also known as *Homo neanderthalensis*, did indeed have distinct physical differences from modern Homo sapiens. They were generally shorter in stature, with a more robust build characterized by wider and squat body proportions, and shorter limbs compared to those of Homo sapiens. This is often referred to as \"squat morphology.\" Additionally, their noses were proportionally larger than those of Homo sapiens, which is thought to be an adaptation for living in colder climates, helping to warm and humidify the air they breathed. However, Neandertals did not have more bones than modern Homo sapiens; in fact, their skeletons show fewer bones in certain areas due to their robust build. Therefore, option D (Both a and b is incorrect based on the information provided."
