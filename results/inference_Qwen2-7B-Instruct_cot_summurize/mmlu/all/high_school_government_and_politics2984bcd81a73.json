Having representation in Congress\n\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, each state had one vote in the Congress, regardless of its population. This meant that smaller states had as much influence as larger states, which led to some issues in decision-making and governance.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. Constitution established a bicameral legislature ( the House of Representatives and the Senate. In the House, representation is based on population, while both chambers provide equal representation for the states in the Senate. This system was designed to balance the interests of large and small states."
