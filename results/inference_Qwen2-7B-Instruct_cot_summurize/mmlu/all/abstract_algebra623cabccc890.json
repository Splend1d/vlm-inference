This is because both \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) are contained within it, and so their linear combinations are as well.\n\nNow, consider the degree of the extension step by step:\n\n1. **From \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\):** The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(x^2 - 2\\), which has degree 2. Thus, the degree of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}\\) is 2.\n\n2. **From \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\):** To extend this further, we need to include \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). However, \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is not in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), but we need to consider how \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) interacts with \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). Notice that \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) does not need to be adjoined separately since \\(\\sqrt{6} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}\\) is already in the field. Therefore, the inclusion of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) (does not increase the degree of the extension beyond what's needed for \\(\\sqrt{6}\\).\n\nThus, the total degree of the extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})/\\mathbb{Q}\\) is the product of the degrees of the individual extensions, which is \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. 2**."
