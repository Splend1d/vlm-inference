For example, shopping for groceries or comparing prices of electronic devices online.\n\n2. **Experience Properties**: These involve services that require personal interaction or subjective judgment to evaluate. The quality or outcome may not be easily quantifiable or comparable across different instances. Examples include dining at a restaurant, getting a haircut, or medical treatment.\n\n3. **Credence Properties**: These are services where the expertise of the service provider is crucial for determining the quality of the service. Consumers cannot easily verify the quality of the service themselves. Examples include legal advice, medical procedures, or financial planning.\n\nThis framework helps businesses understand how consumers might evaluate their offerings and tailor strategies accordingly."
