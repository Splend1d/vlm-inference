Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration.\n\nThis patient presents with symptoms suggesting endocarditis, which is an inflammation of the inner lining of the heart chambers (the endocardium. The physical examination finding of a systolic heart murmur over the precordium could indicate infective endocarditis. \n\nAmong the options provided:\n- A decreased intensity of S1 ( (the first heart sound) would not typically be associated with endocarditis.\n- An increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration is a characteristic finding in patients with infective endocarditis, as the pressure within the heart increases during inspiration, potentially making the murmur more audible.\n- An increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration is not typically seen in endocarditis; it might suggest another condition.\n- A positive Kussmaul sign refers to a rise in the jugular venous pulse with inspiration, which can occur in pericardial effusion or tamponade but is not a typical finding in endocarditis.\n\nTherefore, based on the clinical context and the options given, the most appropriate answer is that the intensity of the murmur increases with deep inspiration."
