When the speed of the model car triples, the new velocity becomes \\( 3v \\).\n\nPlugging this into the kinetic energy formula gives:\n\n\\[ K_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{2}m(3v)^2 \\]\n\\[ K_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{2}m \\cdot 9v^2 \\]\n\\[ K_{\\text{new}} = 9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\\[ K_{\\text{new}} = 9K \\]\n\nThis shows that when the speed triples, the kinetic energy increases by a factor of 9, which means it becomes three times greater than the original kinetic energy."
