This suggests that both varieties of rice were likely domesticated separately, rather than evolving from a common ancestor, in their respective regions's local wild ancestors. This supports the idea that the domestication of rice occurred independently in East Asia and South Asia, rather than being a single event in East Asia as some previous theories suggested."
