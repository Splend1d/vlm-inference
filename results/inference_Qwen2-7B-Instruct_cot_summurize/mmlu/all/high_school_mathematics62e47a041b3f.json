Then, they walk 10 miles to the North.\n3. After that, they turn West and walk 6 miles, which means they have moved 3 - 6 = 1 mile to the East of their starting point ( because they were 3 miles East initially and now moved 2 miles back towards the starting point.\n4. Finally, they turn South and walk 16 miles, which means they have moved 10 - 16 = 6 miles South of their current position.\n\nSo, the final position relative to the start point can be visualized as forming a right-angled triangle with legs of length 1 mile (East-West) and 6 miles South-North.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lengths of the legs, and \\(c\\) is the length of the hypotenuse, we can calculate the distance:\n\n\\[c = \\sqrt{1^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 36} = \\sqrt{37}\\]\n\nThe square root of 37 is approximately 6.1 miles. However, since the answer choices are given in a simplified form and none of them exactly matches this calculation, the closest option to 6.1 miles from the provided choices would be:\n\nB. 6.7 miles\n\nThis is likely due to rounding or slight adjustments in the options provided, but based on the calculation, the correct choice should reflect a value closer to the square root of 37, making B. 6.7 miles the best match among the given options."
