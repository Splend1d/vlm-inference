However, since the student did not have a car, he rode the bus to and from the college each day. The student soon discovered that he was spending up to two hours each day to make the round trip to and from college on the bus, whereas the trip could be made in half that time if he had a car. He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking. However, the son only had $2,500 in his bank account, and the price of the car was $10,000. Since the son had not built up a credit history, the car lot was reluctant to sell the car to the son. The father then told the finance manager of the car lot, \"If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due. \" The finance manager then approved the deal, which required the son to pay $2,500 down and monthly payments of $500 for 15 months. Six months later, the son defaulted on the payment plan, and the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son. With regard to the father's obligation under his promise to the finance manager, the court would most likely\n\nA. relieve the father of liability, because the car lot failed to first sue the son.\nB. relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety.\nC. not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.\nD. not relieve the father of liability, because parents are responsible for the debts of their children.\n"

This agreement makes the father a co-obligor or guarantor of the son's debt. When the son defaulted on the payments after six months, the car lot sought recovery from the father, bypassing the son. \n\nThe main purpose exception refers to situations where a person enters into an agreement with another party primarily to protect the interests of a third party ( in this case, the son. If the primary purpose of the father's agreement is to secure payment for the son's benefit, the court might relieve the father of liability. However, if the father's intention was to directly assume the risk of the loan, the court may hold him liable.\n\nGiven that the father's promise was made to ensure the car lot would receive payment in case the son defaulted, it seems more likely that the main purpose was to secure payment for the car lot rather than solely benefiting the son. Therefore, the court would most likely not relieve the father of liability under the main purpose exception."
