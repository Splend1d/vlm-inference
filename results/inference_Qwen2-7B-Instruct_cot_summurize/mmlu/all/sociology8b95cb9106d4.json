His findings supported all three options you've listed:\n\nA. Ethnic minorities often practiced their religions as a means to maintain cultural identity and achieve social acceptance within the larger American society. This was particularly relevant during the post-World War II era when many immigrants sought to integrate into American culture while preserving their religious traditions.\n\nB. Mainstream faiths, including Protestant denominations, Catholicism, and Judaism, were increasingly intertwined with American national identity. This integration manifested in various ways, such as the influence of religious values on public policy, the role of religious leaders in civic life, and the prevalence of religious symbols and practices in everyday American culture.\n\nC. Herberg observed that the moral teachings of the major religions in America had become more similar over time. He argued that there was a growing consensus on moral issues among different religious groups, which he termed \"the ethic of accommodation.\" This meant that despite doctrinal differences, there was a shared understanding of fundamental moral principles like honesty, charity, and respect for the rights of others.\n\nTherefore, Herberg's study suggested that religion in America was characterized by a blend of cultural adaptation, national integration, and moral convergence across diverse religious communities."
