The X-band typically ranges from 8.2 GHz to 12.4 GHz. However, since the question specifies \"X-band EPR cavity\" without further clarification on the exact frequency, it's safe to assume that the question is focusing on the concept rather than a specific frequency within the X-band range. The choice of frequency for calculating the Q-factor in this context is less critical due to the large value of Q expected, which suggests a very narrow bandwidth relative to the center frequency.\n\nGiven:\n- Resonator bandwidth (\\(\\Delta f\\)) = 1.58 MHz\n- Assuming a typical center frequency for EPR cavities around the middle of the X-band (10 GHz for this calculation\n\nLet's calculate the Q-factor:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{f}{\\Delta f} = \\frac{10 \\text{ GHz}}{1.58 \\text{ MHz}} \\]\n\nFirst, convert GHz to MHz for consistency:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ GHz} = 10,000 \\text{ MHz} \\]\n\nNow calculate Q:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{10,000 \\text{ MHz}}{1.58 \\text{ MHz}} \\approx 6341.46 \\]\n\nThe closest option to our calculated Q-factor of approximately 6341 is:\n\nD. Q = 6012\n\nSo, the correct answer is D."
