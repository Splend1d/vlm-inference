                    "text": "Based on the excerpt provided, which describes the reigns of Shapur, Hormizd, and Bahram as kings in Persia during the late third century CE, there is no direct information given about Persia's relationship with Arabia in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. However, we can infer some context that might help in choosing the correct answer.\n\nThe text mentions a religious context within Persia, particularly focusing on the activities related to the worship of Ahura Mazda, the chief deity in Zoroastrianism. It does not provide details about interactions or conflicts with Arabia, which had its own rich history and religious practices (notably Islam).\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about Persia's relationship with Arabia in the specified time frame, the most appropriate choice based on historical knowledge would be:\n\nB. Persia and Arabia interacted infrequently throughout the period.\n\nThis choice reflects the general observation that during this period, Arabia was undergoing significant changes due to the rise of Islam and the establishment of Islamic caliphates, which could have limited direct interactions with the Sassanian Empire in Persia. However, it's important to note that this is an inference based on broader historical trends rather than detailed information from the text provided."
