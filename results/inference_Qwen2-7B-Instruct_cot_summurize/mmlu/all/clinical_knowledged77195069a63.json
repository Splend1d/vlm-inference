Expiry dates to be checked - For any equipment or supplies that have expiration dates to ensure safety and efficacy.\n\nRing patient's next of kin is not typically a step taken immediately prior to performing a catheterization. This might be relevant in other situations, such as informing family members about a critical change in a patient's condition, but it is not a standard preparatory step for a urinary catheterization procedure."
