This period saw significant developments in philosophy, science, and the arts, often referred to as the Enlightenment. The statement suggests that in ancient Rome, religious beliefs were viewed with varying degrees of sincerity or utility, rather than absolute truth or falsehood. This could be interpreted as an indication of the spread of skepticism about religious dogma and orthodoxy, where beliefs were not taken at face value but were subject to questioning and analysis."
