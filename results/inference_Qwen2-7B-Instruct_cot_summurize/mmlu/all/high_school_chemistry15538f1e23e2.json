Therefore, the number of moles of O2 produced can be calculated using the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\n\\[ n_{O_2} = \\frac{n_{HgO}}{2} = \\frac{0.02028\\ mol}{2} = 0.01014\\ mol \\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures (since our original data has three significant figures, we get:\n\n\\[ n_{O_2} = 0.0100\\ mol \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 0.0100 mol**."
