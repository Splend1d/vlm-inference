It is unenforceable, because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration.\n\nExplanation: For a contract to be legally binding, there must be a mutual exchange of consideration between the parties. In this case, the employer's promise to pay the employee a bonus was oral and not supported by any new consideration from the employee (i.e., no additional obligation or benefit from the employee side. The original consideration was the employee's work in negotiating the contract, which is assumed to have already been provided when the promise was made. Therefore, without new consideration, the promise is not enforceable under most jurisdictions' laws of contract."
