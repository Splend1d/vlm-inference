The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, provided high-resolution images of Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, allowing astronomers to precisely determine the sizes of these celestial bodies. The Hubble observations, combined with other data collected by ground-based telescopes and spacecraft like New Horizons, have given us a detailed understanding of Pluto's physical characteristics."
