When he refuses to confess, Officer tells Mike that he has connections in the local prison that could make Mike's life there \"unpleasant\" if he does not confess. Mike confesses. At trial, the confession is not used in the prosecution's case-in-chief, but is admitted to impeach Mike's testimony. On appeal, Mike's conviction will likely be\n\nA. Upheld, because he confessed with full understanding of his right to remain silent, and that his statements could be used against him.\nB. Upheld, because his conviction would probably have been secured regardless of the admittance of his confession, and the decision was harmless error.\nC.
