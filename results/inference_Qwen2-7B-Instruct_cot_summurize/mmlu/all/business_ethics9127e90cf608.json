Violating Trust: Insider trading breaches the trust between the insider ( who has access to confidential information about a company's operations or future plans - and the shareholders or clients who rely on this information for making investment decisions. This trust is a cornerstone of the fiduciary relationship.\n\n2. Misuse of Confidential Information: Insiders who engage in insider trading use non-public information to make profits at the expense of uninformed investors. This misuse of confidential information is a direct violation of the duty of loyalty that is part of the fiduciary relationship.\n\n3. Erosion of Fairness: Insider trading creates an unfair advantage for those who have access to inside information. This can lead to a market where transactions are not based on equal and accurate information, thus eroding the fairness and integrity of the financial markets, which is central to the fiduciary relationship. \n\n4. Legal and Ethical Violations: Engaging in insider trading is illegal in most jurisdictions and goes against ethical standards. This not only damages the reputation of the individual involved but also undermines the integrity of the institutions they represent, further harming the fiduciary relationship."
