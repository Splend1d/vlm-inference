                    "text": "Based on the context provided by your question, de Marneffe's argument seems to challenge the notion that such prohibitions are inherently wrong. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"Fatty foods and tobacco products are not actually harmful\" - This statement contradicts much of the scientific consensus regarding the health impacts of these products. Fatty foods and tobacco products are known to have significant negative health effects when consumed or used excessively.\n\nB. \"There is nothing wrong with limiting people\u2019s access to products that are harmful to them.\" - This statement aligns with public health policies that often aim to limit access to harmful substances through regulations, taxation, or prohibition, with the goal of protecting public health and welfare.\n\nC. \"The benefits of prohibiting these products would not outweigh the costs.\" - This option suggests a concern about the potential negative consequences of such prohibitions, such as economic impacts, individual freedoms, or unintended social effects. It implies that while prohibitions might aim to address harm, they could also cause other issues.\n\nGiven the typical stance of public health advocates, it seems likely that de Marneffe would argue something akin to B: that there is nothing inherently wrong with limiting access to harmful products like fatty foods and tobacco. This perspective supports public health interventions aimed at reducing harm, even if they restrict access to certain goods.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the most appropriate answer choice might lean towards B, considering it directly addresses the ethical argument presented in the question. However, without more specific information about de Marneffe's exact position, the correct answer could be nuanced. If we were to choose one, option B is the most aligned with the typical rationale for public health policies in this context."
