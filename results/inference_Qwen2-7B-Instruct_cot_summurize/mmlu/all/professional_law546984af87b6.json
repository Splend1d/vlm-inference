In the context of filing a notice of appeal after the deadline, courts may consider several factors to determine whether there was sufficient \"good cause\" or \"excusable neglect\" to permit the late filing. \n\nHere's a breakdown of each option:\n\nA. **The district court judge assured the litigant that the late filing would be permitted.** This could potentially be considered as a form of excusable neglect if the judge's assurance was made in writing or clearly documented, especially if it was based on exceptional circumstances or an unforeseen legal issue. However, such an assurance does not automatically excuse the delay, as the court's discretion plays a role.\n\nB. **The litigant's original attorney neglected to file notice on time, and now the litigant has retained a new attorney to file the appeal and has also sued the former attorney for malpractice.** This situation might be viewed as excusable neglect if the delay was caused by the negligence of the original attorney, and the new attorney acted promptly upon taking over the case to address the oversight. The subsequent lawsuit against the former attorney could be seen as a reasonable step taken to mitigate the consequences of the initial oversight.\n\nC. **The litigant ran a red light causing a car crash just before the judgment was rendered, and was in the hospital for two months recovering.** This scenario could potentially be considered excusable neglect if the litigant's incapacitation directly resulted from circumstances beyond their control (i.e., the accident and hospitalization. The severity of the situation and its direct impact on the ability to timely file an appeal would be key factors in determining whether this constitutes excusable neglect.\n\nD. **Opposing counsel agreed not to object to the late notice of appeal.** While opposing counsel's agreement might seem like a factor in favor of excusable neglect, it does not necessarily excuse the delay itself. The court's primary concern is ensuring the integrity of the process and the rights of all parties involved. An agreement not to object does not override the need for timely compliance with procedural rules, unless there is clear evidence that the opposing party was aware of the delay and agreed to it without prejudice to their rights.\n\nIn general, courts tend to look at the specific facts and circumstances of each case when considering claims of excusable neglect. Each case must be evaluated on its own merits, and the burden is typically on the party seeking to excuse the late filing to demonstrate that they have a legitimate basis for the delay."
