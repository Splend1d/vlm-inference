May cause oesophageal obstruction\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is an inflammatory condition of the esophagus characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the lining of the esophagus. It is often associated with food allergies or allergic sensitivities.\n\nA. Leads to oesophageal diverticular - EE does not typically lead to the formation of oesophageal diverticula. Diverticula form when the muscle layers of the esophagus weaken and allow food particles to push through, creating a small pouch or bulge. \n\nC. Is not due to allergy - This statement is incorrect. Eosinophilic esophagitis is indeed related to allergy. The inflammation in the esophagus is usually triggered by foods that a person is allergic to or sensitive to, such as dairy products, eggs, soy, wheat, nuts, or meats.\n\nD. Benefits from antacid therapy - Antacids are primarily used to relieve symptoms of acid reflux, but they do not treat the underlying cause of eosinophilic esophagitis. Treatment for EE usually involves dietary restrictions to avoid triggering foods and sometimes medication like corticosteroids or immunosuppressants."
