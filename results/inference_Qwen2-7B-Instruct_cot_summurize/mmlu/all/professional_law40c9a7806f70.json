At the beginning of the lease term, the tenant installed numerous appliances in the building as well as a large air-conditioning system. The tenant alone paid for these items; they were installed with the landlord's permission and were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise. At the end of the lease term, the tenant failed to vacate the premises in a timely manner and continued to pay rent while remaining in possession for another four months. Before vacating the building at the end of the fourth month, the tenant removed the appliances and the air-conditioning system that he had installed, causing no damage to the building. Was the removal by the tenant proper?\n\nA. No, because he was a holdover tenant.\nB. No, because the lease was oral.\nC. Yes, because they were accessions.\nD. Yes, because they were trade fixtures.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Yes, because they were trade fixtures.\n\nUnder property law, when a tenant installs fixtures ( such as appliances or an air-conditioning system that become an integral part of the property during the course of the tenancy, those fixtures typically become the property of the landlord upon the termination of the lease, unless the parties have agreed otherwise. This is especially true if the fixtures serve a business purpose and enhance the value or utility of the property. In this case, since the tenant installed these items with the landlord's permission and they were used specifically for the tenant's commercial enterprise, it is reasonable to conclude that they qualify as \"trade fixtures.\"\n\nTrade fixtures are are personal property that has been attached to real property in such a way that their removal would cause damage to the real property. They are often removable without damaging the property but are considered the property of the tenant when removed under the terms of the lease. Therefore, if the tenant removed them without causing any damage to the building and the lease did not specify otherwise, the removal would be proper from the tenant's perspective.\n\nIt is worth noting that the fact that the lease was oral does not directly affect the determination of whether the items were trade fixtures. Oral leases can be enforceable, but they might be more difficult to prove in court compared to written agreements. Similarly, the tenant being a \"holdover\" after the lease expired could have implications for the landlord's rights to the property but does not directly address the status of the installed items.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided, the removal by the tenant would be proper if the items were indeed trade fixtures, regardless of the lease being oral or the tenant being a holdover."
