It was used to give Congress a say in executive actions without going through the full process of passing a new law.\n\nIn 1983, the Supreme Court ruled in INS v. Chadha that the legislative veto violated the principle of separation of powers as established by the U.S. Constitution. The Court held that Congress cannot exercise judicial and executive powers by unilaterally approving or rejecting executive actions; this power must be exercised through the traditional legislative process of proposing and enacting new laws.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Congress to nullify resolutions approved by the executive branch\n\nThe legislative veto was deemed unconstitutional because it allowed Congress to bypass the checks and balances system by approving or disapproving executive actions without having to propose and pass new legislation through both chambers of Congress and then have it signed into law by the President or have it overridden by a veto-proof majority."
