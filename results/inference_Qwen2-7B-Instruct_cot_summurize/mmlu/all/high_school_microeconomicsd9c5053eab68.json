The demand curve shifts to the left, and the supply curve shifts to the right.\n\nWhen the demand curve shifts to the left, it means that consumers want less of the good at every given price, which puts downward pressure on the price. When the supply curve shifts to the right, it means that producers are willing to supply more of the good at every given price, which also puts downward pressure on the price. Therefore, these two changes together would certainly lower the equilibrium price of the good."
