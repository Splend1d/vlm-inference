Which of the following is the primary reason for this phenomenon?\n\nA. The molecules of the person are, on average, moving faster than those of the surroundings.\nB. Thermal energy moves from high concentration areas (hot) to low concentration areas (cold).\nC. As heat flows out of the person and warms the fluid surrounding the person, the warmer fluid rises, allowing fresh cool fluid to come in contact with the person and increasing the rate of heat transfer.\nD. Water has more molecules per volume than air, increasing molecular contact with the person.\n"

This means that the rate of heat loss from the body is relatively slow, allowing the person to remain comfortable for a long time.\n\nHowever, when a person falls into a cold lake, the situation changes dramatically. The water, being it colder than the body, absorbs the heat from the body much more efficiently due to the greater thermal conductivity of water compared to air. Moreover, as the warmer body water comes into contact with the cooler surrounding water, it creates a convection current. Warmer water rises, leaving behind cooler water, which then sinks back down and comes into contact with the body again. This continuous exchange of water, each part of which is warmer than the surrounding water, accelerates the rate at which the body loses heat. The combination of the water's ability to absorb heat quickly and the convective action of the water increases the rate of heat loss from the body, making the cold water significantly more dangerous than a cold outdoor environment."
