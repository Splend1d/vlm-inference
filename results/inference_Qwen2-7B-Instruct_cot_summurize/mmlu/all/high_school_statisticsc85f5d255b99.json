If no estimate is available, it's common to use 0.5 for maximum sample size.\n- \\(E\\) is the margin of error, which is half the width of the confidence interval. In this case, \\(E = 0.08 / 2 = 0.04\\).\n\nFor a 90% confidence interval, \\(Z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.645\\) ( (since 90% leaves 5% in each tail of the standard normal distribution).\n\nPlugging in our values:\n\n\\[ n = \\left(\\frac{1.645^2 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot ( (1-0.5)}{0.04^2}\\right) \\]\n\\[ n = \\left(\\frac{2.706 \\cdot 0.25}{0.0016}\\right) \\]\n\\[ n = \\left(\\frac{0.6765}{0.0016}\\right) \\]\n\\[ n = 422.8125 \\]\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a person in your sample, you would round up to the nearest whole number, which is 423.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 423."
