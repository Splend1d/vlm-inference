Modernization must relies on science and technology, so science and technology are worthy of our attention. But literature and art are not science and technology.\nB. Non-university can also become an outstanding talent. Gorky, Edison, Faraday, Franklin, etc. have not attended college, but they have all become outstanding talents.\nC. The earth is a sphere, which can be proved from the fact that when we stand at a height and watch the sailing boat in the sea, we always see the mast first and then the hull. The reason for this is because the earth is a sphere.\nD. I saw them coming out of this chemical plant several times before I realized that this young man who was eager to help patients was originally a worker in this chemical plant.\n"

In other words, the argument assumes that if someone is a patriot ( (the conclusion), then their words must be good ( (a premise), and therefore anyone whose words are not good must be a patriot.\n\nThe argument can be represented logically as follows:\n\n1. If someone is a patriot, then their words are good.\n2. Someone's words are good.\n3. Therefore, the person is a patriot.\n\nThis argument is flawed because there could be other reasons why someone's words might be good, and it does not logically follow that just because someone's words are good, they must be a patriot.\n\nAmong the options provided, option A makes the same logical mistake as the argument presented:\n\nA. Literature and art are not worthy of attention. Modernization must rely on science and technology, so science and technology are worthy of our attention. But literature and art are not science and technology.\n\nThis argument assumes that since science and technology are worthy of attention ( (the conclusion), and literature and art are not science and technology  ((a premise), then literature and art must not be worthy of attention. This is a similar fallacy to the one in the original argument: it assumes a cause-and-effect relationship without providing sufficient evidence for such a link."
