Propane tanks were an essential component of the mobile homes produced by the builder. The representative told the owner that the company could supply propane tanks at $50 per tank, a substantial savings over what the owner currently paid for propane tanks. The owner asked if the company could supply 1,000 propane tanks by the end of the month, and the representative assured him that they could. The owner stated that he would think about it and decide what to do within a week. On June 3, the owner sent the following memo to the company headquarters at the address provided by the representative: \"I am happy to confirm my order of 1,000 propane tanks, to be delivered by June 30. I have always received a 10 percent discount for cash payment, so I will assume you will grant me the same discount. I will have $45,000 cash ready to give to your representative at the time of delivery. \"On June 30, the company delivered 1,000 propane tanks to the owner. The representative accompanied the delivery and presented the owner with a bill for $50,000. The owner refused to pay any more than$45,000. Which of the following accurately states the legal rights of the parties?\n\nA. The contract price was $45,000, because the June 3 memo was an effective integration of their agreement.\nB. The contract price was $45,000, because the company did not specifically object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo.\nC. The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\nD. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n"

The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\n\nUnder the principle of offer and acceptance in contract law, the terms of the offer must be clear and unambiguous. If the owner's memo materially alters the terms of the company's offer (by specifying a different price or discount, for example - and the company accepts those new terms without objection, then a binding contract exists on those new terms. \n\nIn this scenario, the company's original offer was for $50 per tank, for a total of $50,000 for 1,000 tanks. The owner's memo then specifies a different price ($45,000 for 1,000 tanks) and a discount of 10%. This materially alters the original offer, as it changes the price per tank and the total amount due. The fact that the company delivered the propane tanks and presented a bill for $50,000 suggests that they accepted the terms of the offer as originally made, despite the owner's counter-proposal. \n\nTherefore, under standard principles of contract law, the contract price would be $50,000, as that waswas the original agreed-upon price before any material alterations were proposed by the owner."
