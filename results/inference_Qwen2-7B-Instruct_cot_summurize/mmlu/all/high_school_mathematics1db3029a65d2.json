Given that the sum of its digits is already specified to be divisible by $3$, this condition is satisfied.\n\nThus, out of the numbers listed, **divisibility by 2**, **divisibility by 5**, and **divisibility by 3** are necessarily satisfied due to the given conditions. \n\nAdditionally, **divisibility by 10** is implied since the number ends in $0$, but $10$ is not in our list of numbers to consider for divisibility.\n\nTherefore, **3 numbers** ( from the set $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9$ necessarily divide the integer.\n\nThe correct answer is **C. 3**."
