Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \n\nScenario 1 involves going through someone else's personal belongings without permission, which is generally considered an invasion of privacy and can be seen as morally wrong. This action could also lead to potential legal consequences if it's done with malicious intent or to cause harm.\n\nScenario 2 involves using coupons, which is not only a common practice but also often encouraged by retailers as part of their marketing strategy. Using coupons does not harm anyone, nor does it take advantage of any vulnerable party. It is a reasonable way to save money and manage personal finances responsibly. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
