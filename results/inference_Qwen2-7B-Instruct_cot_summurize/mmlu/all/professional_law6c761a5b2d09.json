Thereafter, the property owner constructed a shopping center on the property and leased commercial buildings and parking facilities to various tenants. The shopping center, which was located near a public high school, attracted many teenagers who often loitered in the parking lot. The youths frequently harassed shoppers and damaged autos by breaking off windshield wipers and radio antennas. Customarily, the local police department patrolled the shopping center and drove by three or four times each day. This, however, did not prevent the teenagers from hanging out at the shopping center. One afternoon, a shopper was shopping at the center when an unidentified youth damaged her car by throwing a rock through the back window. The shopper brings an action against the property owner to recover for the damage to her auto. She will most likely\n\nA. prevail, unless the person who was responsible for damaging her car can be identified.\nB. prevail, if the damage to her car could have been prevented had the property owner taken reasonable security measures.\nC. not prevail, because the car was damaged by the malicious acts of an independent third person.\nD. not prevail, because the local police had the primary duty to provide security protection at the shopping area.\n"

In order to prevail in this case, the shopper would need to show that the property owner had knowledge of the problem (i.e., the frequent harassment and damage to autos by teenagers, and that they did not take adequate measures to address it. This could include not only providing security personnel but also implementing other measures such as lighting, surveillance cameras, or rules prohibiting loitering. If the court determines that the property owner had a duty to provide a safe environment and breached that duty, the shopper might succeed in her claim."
