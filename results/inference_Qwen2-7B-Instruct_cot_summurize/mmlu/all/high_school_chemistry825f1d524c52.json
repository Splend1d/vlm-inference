In both diamond and silicon carbide, each atom is bonded to four neighbors in a tetrahedral arrangement. This strong covalent bonding results in materials that are very hard, with high melting points, and are generally brittle. Unlike ionic crystals, which have a rigid lattice of positive and negative ions held together by strong electrostatic forces, and molecular crystals, which rely on weaker intermolecular forces, silicon carbide's structure is based on the robust covalent network bonding between its constituent atoms."
