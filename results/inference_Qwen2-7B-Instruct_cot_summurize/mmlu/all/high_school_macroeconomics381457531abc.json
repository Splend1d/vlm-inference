Add depreciation expenses: This is because national income already includes depreciation, which represents the decrease in value of capital goods over time. To get back to the value of production at current prices (i.e., GDP, depreciation needs to be added.\n\nB. Add indirect taxes: Indirect taxes, such as sales tax or VAT, are included in national income but are not part of the GDP calculation. The reason is that GDP aims to measure the market value of final goods and services produced within a country, whereas indirect taxes can apply to the same goods multiple times if they are not accounted for correctly.\n\nC. Subtract subsidies: Subsidies payments made by governments are included in national income but should not be included in GDP since they do not represent revenue earned or costs incurred in the production of goods and services.\n\nTherefore, all of these adjustments need to be made to accurately convert national income into GDP."
