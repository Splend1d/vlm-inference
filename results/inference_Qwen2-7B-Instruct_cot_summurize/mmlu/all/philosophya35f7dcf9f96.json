Bentham was a prominent advocate of utilitarianism, a form of consequentialist ethics that emphasizes the greatest happiness principle: actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong in proportion as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\n\nIn his work, Bentham did not engage in discussions about the existence of God or the role of theology in morality. He was more concerned with practical applications of moral reasoning based on the outcomes of actions rather than adherence to religious doctrines. Therefore, none of the provided options align with Bentham's philosophy."
