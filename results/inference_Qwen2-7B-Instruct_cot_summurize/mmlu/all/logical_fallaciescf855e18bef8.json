This typically happens when someone argues based on how commonly used a term is, rather than on the actual meaning or implications of the concept. \n\nNone of the options you've provided directly describe the fallacy of extension. However, let's clarify each option:\n\nA. Asking a question that includes an unproven assumption or more than one question can lead to ambiguity or confusion, but this does not specifically describe the fallacy of extension.\n\nB. Arguing something is flawed because it doesn't do what it was never intended to do is actually describing the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc ( or the appeal to unintended consequences, not the fallacy of extension.\n\nC. Arguing about something when you don't know what you're talking about could be seen as a form of ignorance fallacy, but it doesn't specifically capture the essence of the fallacy of extension.\n\nD. Including more than one claim in the proposition and treating proof for one claim as proof for all the claims describes the fallacy of composition or division, not the fallacy of extension.\n\nThe fallacy of extension itself might not be listed among your options because it's often described in terms of conflating the use of a term (its extension) with its meaning (its intension). For example, saying \"all tables are made of wood\" ignoring that some tables might be made of other materials like glass or metal would be committing the fallacy of extension."
