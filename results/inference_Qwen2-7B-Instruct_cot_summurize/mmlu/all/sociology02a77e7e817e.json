While income directly reflects a person's earning capacity, occupation often indicates their level of education, skills, and societal contribution. Age can influence social status in certain contexts, such as professional advancement or generational prestige, but it is not the primary determinant. Verbal fluency, while important for communication and persuasion, does not typically correlate with social status in the same way that income and occupation do."
