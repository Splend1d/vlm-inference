Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate.\n\nWhen an auditor assesses the tolerable rate of deviations, they consider how often the controls fail to operate as intended. This helps them understand if the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records might be higher due to ineffective controls. It's important to note that:\n\nA. Deviations from pertinent controls can indeed affect the risk of material misstatement. If controls frequently fail, there's a higher chance that errors or fraud could go undetected, potentially leading to a material misstatement.\n\nB. This statement is correct. Generally, if you find deviations at a certain rate in your tests of controls, it implies that the underlying transactions might also have a lower rate of misstatements. However, this doesn't guarantee that no misstatements exist; it just provides an estimate based on the sampling results.\n\nC. When the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high, the auditor should allow for a low level of sampling risk, not a high one. The goal is to minimize the risk of concluding that the controls are effective when they're not ( (Type I error) and to ensure that any misstatements found are not overlooked ( (Type II error).\n\nD. Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls does not necessarily increase the tolerable rate of deviations. In fact, a larger sample size typically reduces the sampling risk and increases the precision of the conclusions drawn about the population. The tolerable rate of deviations is determined based on the desired level of assurance and the risk assessment, not directly on the sample size."
