The relationship between the normal force and the angle can be described using trigonometry.\n\nThe normal force is equal to the component of the gravitational force that is perpendicular to the plane. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ N = mg \\cos(\\theta) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the object,\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and\n- \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of inclination.\n\nAs the angle of inclination increases, \\( \\cos(\\theta) \\) decreases from 1 to 0. Since \\( \\cos(\\theta) \\) is in the denominator when considering the force components (and the force itself is proportional to \\( \\cos(\\theta) \\), the normal force decreases. However, it does so nonlinearly because the cosine function decreases at a non-constant rate. Specifically, the decrease accelerates as the angle approaches 90 degrees, where the normal force would theoretically be zero if the plane were perfectly vertical.\n\nTherefore, the normal force decreases nonlinearly with an increase in the angle of the inclined plane."
