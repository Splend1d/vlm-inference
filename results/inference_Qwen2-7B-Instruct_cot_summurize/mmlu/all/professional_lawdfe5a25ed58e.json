A short while later at home, the shopper was preparing a sardine sandwich when she opened the can and, to her astonishment, she saw a decomposed mouse. The shopper became nauseated and vomited upon seeing the mouse. After consulting her attorney, the shopper initiated a strict liability action against the company. At trial, the shopper presented into evidence the sardine can with the company's label, along with other corroborating evidence. The attorney representing the company objected to the introduction of the label on the can. The trial court should\n\nA. overrule the objection, because the label is self-authenticating.\nB. overrule the objection, because the label is the best evidence showing that the can was produced by the company.\nC. sustain the objection, because there is no corroborating evidence that the company placed the label on the can.\nD. sustain the objection, because the shopper's proper cause of action is for infliction of emotional distress, not strict liability.\n"

This label is directly connected to the company's production and sale of the product and thus provides substantial evidence supporting the claim. The fact that it was presented alongside other corroborating evidence strengthens its admissibility and relevance to the case. The other options either misinterpret the role of the label or incorrectly suggest that additional evidence is required for its acceptance as valid proof."
