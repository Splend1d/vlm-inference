They absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps regulate the Earth's climate. This process is known as the ocean's \"carbon pump.\" Additionally, the oceans also host diverse ecosystems that contribute to carbon cycling through processes like photosynthesis and respiration."
