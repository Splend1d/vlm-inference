Jade, bronze, and ceramic artifacts**: These were common inclusions in the tombs, reflecting the importance of these materials in Shang culture and their use in divination, ritual, and status symbols.\n- **B. Chariots and horses**: These were also found in the tombs, indicating the king's ability to command resources in life continued into death, possibly for transportation or as part of his divine role.\n- **C. The headless bodies of humans who had been sacrificed**: This practice was part of the elaborate rituals surrounding burials during the Shang Dynasty. The sacrificial victims, often prisoners or slaves, were sometimes buried alongside the king with their heads cut off, which could be related to beliefs about the afterlife or the need for laborers in the underworld.\n\nThese practices provide insight into the complex religious and social beliefs of the Shang Dynasty."
