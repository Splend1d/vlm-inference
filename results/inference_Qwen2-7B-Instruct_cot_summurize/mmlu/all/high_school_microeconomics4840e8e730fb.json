This allows it to extract more consumer surplus and earn more revenue than a non-discriminating monopoly, which charges a single price to all consumers. However, this does not necessarily mean that the quantity produced will be less ( or more, it depends on the specific market conditions and demand elasticity in each segment. The key point here is that by charging different prices to different groups, the discriminating monopoly maximizes its profits."
