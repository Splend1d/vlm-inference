While there were various interpretations of this concept, one common depiction was that of the \"laddish\" stereotype. This term generally refers to a young, typically male, individual who is characterized by his aggressive behavior, machismo, and sometimes violent tendencies. This portrayal was somewhat in contrast to previous generations where men was often associated with strength, dependability, and a more reserved emotional expression.\n\nIt's important to note that these characterizations are broad generalizations and do not apply to every individual within the era or beyond. The 1980s also saw significant changes in societal attitudes towards gender roles, including a rise in interest in emotional expression and sensitivity among men, which could be seen as part of the broader movement towards more inclusive and diverse expressions of masculinity."
