These norms can include etiquette, manners, customs, and practices that help maintain order and predictability in social interactions. They can influence everything from personal dress codes to public behaviors and are often enforced through social pressure rather than formal legal systems.\n\nWhile the other options ( gardening, cookery, and craftwork ( (A), the symbolic representation of social groups in the mass media ( (B), and religious beliefs about how the world ought to be ( (C) are all aspects that might intersect with or be influenced by social norms, they do not fully capture what social norms are. Social norms are not just creative activities, media representations, or religious doctrines; they are the collective understanding and expectations that dictate how individuals should behave in various social situations."
