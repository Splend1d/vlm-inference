                    "text": "On Jacques Maritain's view (Metz's theological and philosophical mentor, the justification of punishment for wrongdoers is indeed multifaceted, reflecting a complex interplay between the nature of sin, human dignity, and the common good. While Metz's specific views might not be as extensively documented or as well-known as those of his mentors like Aquinas or Maritain, one can infer his stance based on the broader context of Catholic social teaching and the principles of justice and mercy that have influenced his work.\n\nGiven this context, it seems plausible to suggest that Metz would likely align with option D: All of the above. This alignment is based on the assumption that:\n\nA. Harmful punishment that is proportionate to the harm done by the wrongdoing: This reflects a principle of retributive justice, which seeks to balance the scales of justice by meting out punishment that corresponds to the severity of the offense. It respects the intrinsic value of the wrong committed and the need for a just response from society.\n\nB. Unfriendly action that is proportionate to the unfriendly wrongdoing, aimed at correcting the wrongdoing: This perspective emphasizes rehabilitation and the restoration of the wrongdoer to the community. It aims to correct behavior rather than simply to punish, focusing on the potential for personal transformation and societal reintegration.\n\nC. Degradation proportionate to the degrading impacts of the wrongdoing: This principle focuses on addressing the moral degradation caused by the act of wrongdoing. It recognizes the need to acknowledge and address the dishonorable aspects of the act and its effects on others, often through symbolic or practical means that reflect the gravity of the offense.\n\nIt's important to note that these interpretations are speculative, given the lack of direct statements from Metz regarding his views on punishment. However, they align with broader Catholic teachings on justice, mercy, and the complexities of human dignity and wrongdoing."
