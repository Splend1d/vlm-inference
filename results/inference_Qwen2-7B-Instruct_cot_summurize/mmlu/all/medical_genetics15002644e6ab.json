These mutations lead to a dominant-negative effect, where the mutated protein is still functional but inhibits the normal function of the wild-type protein. This results in a gain of biological activity that disrupts normal development, specifically affecting bone growth and leading to the characteristic short stature associated with achondroplasia."
