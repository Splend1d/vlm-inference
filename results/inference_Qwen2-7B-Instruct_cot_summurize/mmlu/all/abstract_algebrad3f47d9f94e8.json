Similarly, in \\(Z_8\\), the order of 2 is given by the smallest positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(2k \\equiv 0 \\mod 8\\).\n\nFor \\(Z_{12}\\):\n- The multiples of 4 are: \\(4, 8, 0\\).\n- So, the order of 4 in \\(Z_{12}\\) is 3.\n\nFor \\(Z_8\\):\n- The multiples of 2 are: \\(2, 4, 6, 0\\).\n- So, the order of 2 in \\(Z_8\\) is 4.\n\nThe order of an element in the direct product \\(Z_{12} \\times Z_8\\) is the least common multiple (LCM of the orders of its components. Therefore, the order of the element \\((4, 2)\\) is lcm(3, 4) = 12.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C. 12."
