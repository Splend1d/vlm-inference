According to Mead, the generalized other refers to the composite of societal norms, expectations, and values that individuals use to guide their behavior. This concept is not merely about the perceptions of specific individuals (though it does involve that aspect), but rather a broader, collective understanding of social roles and expectations that shapes personal identity and social interactions."
