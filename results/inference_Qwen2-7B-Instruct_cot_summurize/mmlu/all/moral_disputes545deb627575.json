Mike Pence has been known for his conservative Christian values and strong stance on moral issues. When discussing scientific topics such as SCNT ( (somatic cell nuclear transfer), which is a technique used in cloning, his views would likely align with ethical considerations and religious beliefs.\n\nGiven this context, a statement that might align with Mike Pence's views could be:\n\nC. SCNT should be allowed when it falls within the range of risks that is accepted by ordinary people in sexual reproduction.\n\nThis suggests that he might support SCNT if the risks involved are fall within what society generally accepts as part of natural human reproduction. However, it's important to note that Pence's actual position would depend on his detailed understanding of the science and ethics surrounding the topic, as well as any specific policy stances he has taken."
