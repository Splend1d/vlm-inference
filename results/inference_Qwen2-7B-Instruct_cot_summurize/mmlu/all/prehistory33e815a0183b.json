The C3 and C4 pathways refer to different metabolic processes used by plants to fix carbon dioxide into organic compounds. Most plants use the C3 pathway, while C4 plants, which include many grasses, have evolved an additional step in their photosynthesis process that allows them to be more efficient in hot, dry conditions.\n\nAs the environment changed, the prevalence of C4 plants like grasses increased, making them more dominant in certain ecosystems. This shift would have made foods derived from these grasseses, such as grains and other cereal crops, more available. As a result, early hominids may have adapted their diets to consume more of these resources, leading to changes in their nutrition and potentially influencing aspects of their biology and behavior, including brain size and tool use. \n\nTherefore, the transition in the diets of ancient hominids was likely from a focus on nuts and fruits to a greater reliance on grass-based resources, aligning with the increased dominance of C4 plants in their environments."
