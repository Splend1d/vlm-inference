This means that each successive generation affected by the condition tends to show more severe symptoms than the previous one. This phenomenon is due to the expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (the FMR1 gene, which increases with each maternally inherited transmission. \n\nThe other options listed do not typically show this pattern of anticipation:\n\nA. Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant disorder and does not show increased severity with each generation due to paternal transmission.\n\nB. Marfan syndrome is also an autosomal dominant disorder, and while it can be transmitted from either parent, it does not exhibit anticipation.\n\nC. Cystic fibrosis is a recessive disorder, so it is only expressed when an individual inherits two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent. It does not show anticipation."
