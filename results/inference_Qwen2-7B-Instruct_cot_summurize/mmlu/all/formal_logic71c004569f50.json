This occurs in one row (when O is False and P is False.\n- **O \u2228 P** is False only when `O` is False and `P` is False. This also occurs in one row.\n\nComparing these two, we can see that there is exactly one row where both expressions yield a False value (and all other rows yield at least one True value. This means:\n\n1. The two expressions cannot be logically equivalent because they do not have identical truth values in all rows ( they differ on the row where O is False and P is False.\n2. They are not contradictory either, as there is no row where one expression is True and the other is False (they both yield True or False simultaneously across all rows.\n\nThus, given the nature of their truth values, these two propositions are:\n\n**C. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.**\n\nThis means that it is possible for both propositions to be true at the same time (when `O` is False and `P` is True, or when `O` is True and `P` is True or False."
