They work to stabilize the economy by reducing the severity of economic fluctuations. For example, during a recession, automatic stabilizers might include increased unemployment benefits and reduced tax revenues, which help to stimulate demand and lessen the downturn's impact. Conversely, during economic expansions, automatic stabilizers might lead to decreased spending on welfare programs and increased tax revenues, helping to prevent overheating and inflation."
