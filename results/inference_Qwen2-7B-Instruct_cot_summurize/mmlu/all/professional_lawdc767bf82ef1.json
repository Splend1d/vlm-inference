While the boy walked through the store, the cashier watched him on a hidden camera located behind the cashier's counter. Thereupon, the cashier saw the boy pick up two packs of baseball cards and place them in his coat pocket. The boy then walked to the rear of the store, where he picked up a package of cupcakes. The boy took the cupcakes to the front counter and paid the cashier for the cupcakes only. The boy started to walk out of the store when the cashier said, \"Hey, kid, I'm not charging you for the baseball cards because you paid for the cupcakes. But next time I'm not going to let you get away with it. \" The baseball cards sold for $5 per pack. The boy has committed which, if any, crimes?\n\nA. Larceny.\nB. Larceny by trick.\nC. False pretenses.\nD. No crime.\n"

In this scenario, the boy took the baseball cards without paying for them, which is an act of larceny. The fact that he paid for the cupcakes and was caught in the act of stealing the baseball cards before attempting to leave the store indicates that he had the intent to take the items without paying for them. The cashier's statement suggesting that the boy would not be let off the hook in the future does not negate the fact that a theft occurred."
