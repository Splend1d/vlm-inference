The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed over successive generations.\n\nEvolution occurs through changes in the frequency of alleles (or genes) in a population's gene pool over time. This change can be due to various mechanisms such as mutation, genetic drift, natural selection, and gene flow. If the frequencies of some alleles change over successive generations, it indicates that the population is evolving. The other options do not necessarily lead to evolution:\n\nB. Changes in allele frequencies during an organism's lifetime do not contribute to evolutionary change on a population level because evolution is a long-term, population-level process.\n\nC. If the frequencies of each allele in a population's gene pool remain constant over successive generations, there is no evolutionary change happening.\n\nD. Changes in allele frequencies within an organism's lifetime do not affect the gene pool of the population, so they do not contribute to evolution at the population level."
