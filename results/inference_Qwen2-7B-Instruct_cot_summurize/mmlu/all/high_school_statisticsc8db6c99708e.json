In a properly conducted experiment, the control group receives a procedure that is identical to the experimental group in all aspects except for the variable being tested (the \"treatment under examination\". This allows researchers to compare the effects of this treatment by analyzing the differences in outcomes between the control and experimental groups. The purpose of the control group is to provide a baseline to measure the impact of the treatment against, ensuring that any observed effects can be attributed to the treatment rather than other variables or random chance."
