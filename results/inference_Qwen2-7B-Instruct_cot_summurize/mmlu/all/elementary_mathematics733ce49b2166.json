Here, we'll use feet. \n\nEach student gets a piece of rope that's 5 feet 8 inches long. There are are 12 inches in a foot.\n\nSo, 5 feet 8 inches can be converted to feet as follows:\n\n\\[5 \\text{ feet} + \\frac{8}{12} \\text{ feet} = 5 \\text{ feet} + \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ feet} = 5\\frac{2}{3} \\text{ feet}\\]\n\nNow, multiply this by the number of students:\n\n\\[32 \\times 5\\frac{2}{3} \\text{ feet} = 32 \\times \\left(5 + \\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\text{ feet} = 32 \\times 5 \\text{ feet} + 32 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ feet}\\]\n\n\\[= 160 \\text{ feet} + \\frac{64}{3} \\text{ feet}\\]\n\n\\[= 160 \\text{ feet} + 21\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ feet}\\]\n\n\\[= 160 \\text{ feet} + 21 \\text{ feet} + \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ feet}\\]\n\n\\[= 181 \\text{ feet} + \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ feet}\\]\n\nSince \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of a foot is equivalent to about \\(4\\) inches ( (because \\(12\\) inches make a foot, and \\(12/3 = 4\\)), \n\n\\[= 181 \\text{ feet} + 4 \\text{ inches}\\]\n\nTherefore, the total length of rope Ms. Gutierrez needs to order is \\(181\\) feet \\(4\\) inches.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 181 feet 4 inches."
