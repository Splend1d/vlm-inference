However, in reality, the stoichiometry of the reaction must also be considered. The balanced chemical equation tells us that one mole of each reactant produces one mole of RbBr.\n\nGiven:\n- Molar mass of Rb = 85.46g/mol\n- Molar mass of Br = 79.90g/mol\n\nTheoretical moles of each reactant:\n- Moles of Rb = 1.0g / 85.46g/mol \u2248 0.0116 mol\n- Moles of Br = 1.0g / 79.90g/mol \u2248 0.0125 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the limiting reactant determines the amount of product formed. In this case, Rb is the limiting reactant because you have fewer moles of it.\n\nThus, 0.0116 mol of Rb reacts completely to form 0.0116 mol of RbBr.\n\nThe theoretical yield of RbBr = 0.0116 mol * 153.39g/mol ( \u2248 1.74g.\n\nHowever, since the question asks about measurable amounts more than 0.10mg, all of the RbBr formed would be measurable under these conditions.\n\nRegarding any leftover substances:\n- Since Rb is the limiting reactant, all of it will be consumed in the reaction.\n- Bromine (Br, being present in excess, will not be fully consumed in the formation of RbBr and could remain in measurable amounts depending on how much of the reaction goes to completion. However, given the stoichiometry of the reaction and assuming complete conversion of Rb to RbBr, Br should also be nearly fully consumed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer considering the question's requirement for measurable amounts more than 0.10mg would be:\n\nA. RbBr only\n\nThis assumes that while some bromine may be left over due to the excess compared to the limiting reagent rubidium, the quantity mentioned in the question criteria for \"measurable amounts\" suggests that even a small amount of bromine would be counted as measurable. However, the primary focus of the question seems to be on the product formed, which would indeed be RbBr."
