Subsequent generations of a population should have greater proportions of individuals that possess traits better suited for success.\n\nExplanation: This statement reflects the core idea of natural selection, which is that organisms with traits that make them better suited to their environment will have a higher chance of survival and reproduction, passing those advantageous traits on to their offspring. Over time, this leads to the evolution of the population, with subsequent generations having a higher proportion of individuals with beneficial traits. \n\nB. An individual organism undergoes evolution over the course of its lifetime. - Evolution is a process that occurs over many generations, not within the lifetime of a single organism.\n\nC. Habitats do not generally have unlimited resources. - While this is true and can influence the distribution of species, it does not specifically infer natural selection. Natural selection is about how organisms adapt to environmental pressures through changes in their traits.\n\nD. Natural populations tend to reproduce to their full biological potential. - This statement refers to the reproductive behavior of populations but does not directly infer natural selection. Natural selection involves differential reproductive success based on trait fitness rather than simply reproducing at maximum capacity."
