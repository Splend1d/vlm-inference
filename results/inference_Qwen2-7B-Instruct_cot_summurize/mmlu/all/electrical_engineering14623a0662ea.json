Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. register unit and control unit on a single chip.\n\nIt's important to note that while the ALU is indeed part of a microprocessor, options A and D both correctly identify components that are typically found together in a microprocessor. Option B is incorrect because memory is not usually integrated onto the same chip as the microprocessor's core processing components; instead, it is often found on separate memory chips or in a memory controller on the same package."
