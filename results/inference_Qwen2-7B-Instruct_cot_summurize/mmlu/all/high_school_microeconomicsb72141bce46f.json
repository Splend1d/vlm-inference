However, we can discuss the implications of these terms in the context of the question.\n\n**Increasing-cost industry**: This refers to an industry where the average cost of production increases as the quantity produced increases. This could happen due to factors like diminishing returns, higher raw material costs, or increased labor costs as more resources are needed to produce additional units.\n\n**Constant-cost industry**: In this scenario, the average cost of production remains constant regardless of the quantity produced. This implies efficient use of resources and economies of scale, where the cost per unit does not increase with higher output.\n\n**Decreasing-cost industry**: This term describes an industry where the average cost of production decreases as the quantity produced increases. This is typically associated with the benefits of specialization, learning-by-doing, and efficient use of fixed assets.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems more relevant to discuss the economic nature of the industry rather than categorizing it strictly by its cost structure. The fact that the plastic army figures industry consumes a \"small fraction\" of the total plastic demand suggests that it might be a niche market, which doesn't necessarily correlate with the cost structures described above.\n\nHowever, if we were to interpret the options given in the context of economic efficiency and profitability:\n\n- **D. Profit-making industry** is the most relevant answer choice because it addresses the industry's potential to generate profits, which is a primary goal of any business. The ability to make a profit depends on various factors including market demand, production costs, pricing strategies, and efficiency in resource utilization, among others. Without further specifics, we cannot definitively state whether the industry is increasing, constant, or decreasing costs; however, the profit-making aspect is a key consideration for any industry, including one producing plastic army figures."
