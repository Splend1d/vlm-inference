Mass, velocity, and acceleration.\n\nTo calculate the tension in the cables pulling the elevator, we can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on an object equals the object's mass multiplied by its acceleration ( F = ma. In this scenario, the forces acting on the elevator include:\n\n1. The weight of the elevator ( (mg), which acts downwards.\n2. The upward tension force ( T, exerted by the cables.\n\nThe net force causing the elevator to accelerate upwards is the difference between these two forces:\n\nNet Force = T - mg\n\nAccording to Newton's second law:\n\nT - mg = ma\n\nWhere:\nm = mass of the elevator,\ng = acceleration due to gravity ( (approximately 9.8 m/s^2),\na = acceleration of the elevator.\n\nSolving for T gives us:\n\nT = m(g + a)\n\nSo, knowing the mass (m, acceleration a, and the gravitational acceleration g allows us to calculate the tension T in the cables. Velocity is not directly used in this calculation, although the velocity and acceleration must be consistent with each other for the problem to make sense. Thus, option B is the correct choice."
