An element being its own inverse means \\(a^2 = e\\). \n\nGiven that there is no other element (other than the identity) which is its own inverse, this implies that the only element satisfying \\(a^2 = e\\) is \\(e\\) itself.\n\nWe also know that \\(G\\) contains a subgroup of order 7. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup \\(H\\) of a finite group \\(G\\) must divide the order of \\(G\\). Therefore, the order of \\(G\\) must be divisible by 7.\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n\nA. 27 - This is not divisible by 7.\nB. 28 - This is divisible by 7.\nC. 35 - This is divisible by 7.\nD. 37 - This is not divisible by 7.\n\nSo, based on the conditions given, the possible orders for \\(G\\) are either B. 28 or C. 35. However, we have one more condition: there is no element other than the identity which is its own inverse. This rules out option C because if \\(G\\) had an order of 35, it would imply the existence of at least two elements (besides the identity \\(e\\), say \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), each having order 2 ( (since \\(a^2 = b^2 = e\\)), which contradicts the given condition.\n\nTherefore, the only possible order for \\(G\\) is **B. 28**."
