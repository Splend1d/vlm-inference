Behavioral variables refer to characteristics or actions that can be observed and measured in relation to consumer behavior, such as product usage, media usage, and purchase occasion. Personality, on the other hand, refers to the unique combination of traits and characteristics that define an individual's behavior and responses to different situations. While personality can influence consumer behavior, it is not considered a behavioral variable itself."
