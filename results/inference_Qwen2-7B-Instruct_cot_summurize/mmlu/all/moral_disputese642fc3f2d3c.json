This is because in emergencies, time can be of the essence, and the stakes are high. In such situations, it might be necessary to act promptly to protect lives or national security, even if this means making decisions without the usual layers of approval or consultation. This perspective underscores the complexity of decision-making in high-pressure, high-risk environments and the sometimes conflicting values between speed, authority, and democratic process."
