However, if we're considering the perspective of Peter Hare, an individual who might have discussed similar ideas in philosophy or ethics, and given the options provided, the most plausible answer would be:\n\nD. all might be successful, but at a price.\n\nThis option suggests that while various methods could potentially lead one to avoid engaging in moral arguments, each comes with its own set of costs or drawbacks. For example, adopting a moral relativist stance might allow one to sidestep specific moral disagreements, but it could also undermine the possibility of universally applicable ethical principles. Similarly, adopting a purely pragmatic approach to ethics might enable one to avoid moral disputes by focusing solely on outcomes, but this could come at the expense of deeper ethical considerations and the pursuit of justice or fairness."
