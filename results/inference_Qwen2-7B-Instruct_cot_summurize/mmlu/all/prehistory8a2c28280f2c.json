In fact, one of the key factors contributing to the development of Mesopotamia as a civilization was the availability of arable land near rivers. The Tigris-Euphrates river system provided a natural source of water for irrigation, which allowed for the cultivation of crops and supported the growth of settled communities. The concentration of population around these fertile lands facilitated the development of agriculture, trade, and complex societal structures. Thus, the need to concentrate population near rivers was an essential factor in the development of Mesopotamian civilization, not a deciding factor against it."
