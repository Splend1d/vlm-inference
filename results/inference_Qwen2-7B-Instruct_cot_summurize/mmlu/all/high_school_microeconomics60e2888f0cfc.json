The demand for labor by a competitive firm is determined by the marginal physical product of labor (MPL) and the output price. \n\nIn a competitive market, firms are price takers meaning they accept the market price for their product. Therefore, when deciding how much labor to hire, a competitive firm maximizes its profits by hiring labor up to the point where the marginal revenue product (MRP (which is the MPL multiplied by the price of output) equals the wage rate. This is because each additional unit of labor hired should add more value (in terms of output) than the cost of hiring that worker. \n\nSo, in essence, a competitive firm will continue to hire labor as long as the additional revenue generated from one more unit of labor (i.e., MPL times the price of output) exceeds the cost of hiring that worker (i.e., the wage rate). When this condition is no longer met, the firm stops hiring more labor, thus determining its demand for labor."
