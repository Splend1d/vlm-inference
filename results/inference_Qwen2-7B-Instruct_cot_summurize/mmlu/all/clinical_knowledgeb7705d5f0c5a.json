IV administration does not delay the action of a drug; in fact, it typically results in faster onset of action compared to oral or other routes because it bypasses the digestive system.\n- B. IV administration does carry a risk of bacteraemia, which is the introduction of bacteria into the bloodstream. This risk increases with the duration of catheter use and the patient's underlying health conditions.\n- C. Correct. IV administration allows for precise control and adjustment of the drug dosage to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. This is particularly important for drugs therapies that have a narrow therapeutic index or require rapid response to changes in the patient's condition.\n- D. While there are concerns about potential contamination when using the same cannula for both drug and fluid administration, it is not an absolute rule that an intravenous cannula should never be used for both. The main consideration is to ensure that the fluid or drug does not inadvertently contaminate the other. In practice, it may be acceptable under certain circumstances with appropriate precautions, but it is generally recommended to use separate cannulas for fluids and medications to minimize risk."
