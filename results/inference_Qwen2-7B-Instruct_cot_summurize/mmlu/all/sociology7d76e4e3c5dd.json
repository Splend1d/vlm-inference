It includes a core, at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more people, plus any adjacent territory that has a high degree of economic ties to the core. This definition does not necessarily include all cities within a given region but rather focuses on areas with significant economic and social interaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer among the options provided would be closest to:\n\nB. It is composed of at least one central city with a population of at least 50,000 and it surrounds densely urbanized counties.\n\nHowever, this option is not entirely accurate because an MSA can consist of more than one central city, not just \"at least one,\" and the surrounding counties do not need to be densely urbanized; they can include suburban and rural areas that are economically tied to the central city or cities. The precise definition requires that there be a continuous area where at least 25% of the population lives within 50 miles of the central city and that this area meets certain criteria for economic interdependence."
