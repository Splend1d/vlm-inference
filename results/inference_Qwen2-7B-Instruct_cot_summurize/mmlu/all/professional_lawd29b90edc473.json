One of the men told the other that he knew an alarm specialist who could help disarm the security system. One of the men then approached the alarm specialist and asked if he would assist them in disarming the home's alarm system. The alarm specialist said that he didn't want to participate in the crime but told the man how he could disarm the system himself. The two men thereafter went to the home to commit the burglary. When they arrived at the home, they saw a vicious guard dog patrolling the fenced-in area of the home. Deciding it would be too risky to confront the dog, the two men abandoned their planned burglary. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist?\n\nA. The two men are guilty of conspiracy.\nB. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of conspiracy.\nC. The two men are guilty of conspiracy and the two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary.\nD. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.\n"

                    "text": "The most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist is:\n\nA. The two men are guilty of conspiracy.\n\nExplanation:\n- The two men planned a burglary, which constitutes the crime of conspiracy ( even though they did not actually commit the burglary itself.\n- The alarm specialist provided information on how to disarm the alarm system, which was part of the plan for the burglary. However, since the alarm specialist did not actively participate in the actual burglary or the attempt, their role stops with aiding the conspiracy. Therefore, they are only guilty of conspiracy, not attempted burglary.\n- The two men, by deciding to abandon the burglary due to the presence of the guard dog, show that they were aware of the risks and decided against proceeding, which is consistent with an abandonment defense. This means they might still be held liable for conspiracy but may face lesser charges than attempted burglary, depending on local laws and specific circumstances.\n- The alarm specialist's involvement was strictly in providing assistance to the conspiracy, so they would not be guilty of attempted burglary.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. The two men are guilty of conspiracy."
