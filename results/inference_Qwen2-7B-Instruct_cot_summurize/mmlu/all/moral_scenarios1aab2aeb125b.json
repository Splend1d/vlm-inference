Wrong, Not wrong\n\nTossing a small child 10 feet into the air over your head is considered morally wrong because it involves a significant risk of harm or injury to a vulnerable individual, especially without any clear safety measures or intent for a playful and safe activity.\n\nSitting outside to spy on animals at night can be seen as intrusive, especially if the intent is to disturb their natural behaviors or habitats, but without causing physical harm, it might not necessarily be considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards in 2020. However, this answer could vary based on specific circumstances, such as local wildlife conservation laws or cultural norms regarding human-animal interactions."
