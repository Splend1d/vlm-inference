In such triangles, the sides opposite the \\(45^\\circ\\) angles are equal in length, and the hypotenuse ( which is opposite the \\(90^\\circ\\) angle, is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) times longer than either of these sides.\n\nLet's denote the length of each leg as \\(x\\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Hypotenuse} = x\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nGiven that the hypotenuse is 10 inches, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ x\\sqrt{2} = 10 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nSo, each leg of the triangle is \\(5\\sqrt{2}\\) inches long.\n\nTo find the area of the triangle, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nSubstituting the lengths of the legs into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5\\sqrt{2} \\times 5\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 25 \\times 2 = 25 \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 25 square inches, making the correct answer **D. 25**."
