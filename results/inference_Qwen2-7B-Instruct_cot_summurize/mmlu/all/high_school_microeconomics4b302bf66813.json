Demand for the good produced by this labor is stronger.\n\nIn a competitive labor market, the wage rate is determined by the intersection of supply and demand for labor. When the demand for the good or service produced by that labor increases, the demand for the labor needed to produce it also increases. This shift in the labor demand curve to the right leads to a higher equilibrium wage as employers compete more intensely for the same pool of workers.\n\nA. More students graduating with the necessary skills could increase the supply of labor, potentially decreasing the wage if the increase in supply is greater than the increase in demand.\n\nC. The price of a complementary resource increasing would not directly affect the labor market unless it significantly raises the cost of production, thereby affecting demand for the final product and indirectly the demand for labor.\n\nD. Removing the need for an exam might increase the supply of labor if more people feel they can enter the field without additional qualifications, but this would depend on whether those entering the field are actually qualified and how it affects productivity and demand for labor. It does not inherently increase the demand for labor."
