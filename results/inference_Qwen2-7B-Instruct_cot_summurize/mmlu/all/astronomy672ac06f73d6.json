As the cloud shrank its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy.\n\nDuring the formation of the solar system, the solar nebula, which was a rotating disk of gas and dust, began to collapse under its own gravity. As it did so, the particles within the nebula started to move faster due to the conservation of angular momentum. This increase in speed led to an increase in kinetic energy. According to the laws of thermodynamics, when energy is transformed from one form to another, there is no loss ( meaning all the initial gravitational potential energy, which was stored due to the configuration of masses, was converted into other forms of energy. A significant portion of this energy was converted into thermal energy, causing the temperature of the collapsing nebula to rise. This process is crucial for understanding how the early solar system heated up and eventually led to the formation of planets and other celestial bodies."
