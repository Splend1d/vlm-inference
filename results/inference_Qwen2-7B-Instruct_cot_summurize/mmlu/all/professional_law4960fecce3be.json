For example:\n\n- First-degree murder involves premeditation and malice aforethought.\n- Second-degree murder usually involves a killing that occurred during the commission of another felony (felony murder) or without premeditation but with malice aforethought.\n- Manslaughter involves a killing without malice aforethought, often due to negligence or heat of passion.\n\nThe specific details can vary by jurisdiction, but the defendant's mental state is generally a key factor in determining the degree of the homicide charge."
