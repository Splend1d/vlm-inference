When people are part of a group, they may feel less responsible for their actions, leading to behaviors that they might not exhibit in an individual context. In Milgram's study, the lack of visual contact between the experimenter and the participant, as well as the presence of an authority figure, contributed to this deindividuation effect, potentially making the participants more likely to follow instructions and administer shocks without question.\n\nZimbardo's work on deindividuation aligns with the Milgram study's findings, emphasizing how social context can influence individual behavior, particularly in situations where personal accountability is reduced."
