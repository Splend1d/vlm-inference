The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws.\n\nExplanation:\n- A: False, an employee who voluntarily quits (regardless of the reason) typically does not qualify for unemployment benefits.\n- B: False, under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), employers pay the entire tax. There is no employee contribution for FUTA.\n- C: Partially True but incomplete. While the goal is to assist workers who have lost their jobs, the eligibility criteria vary by state and consider factors like previous employment history and the reason for job loss.\n- D: Correct. Each U.S. state has its own unemployment insurance program, which is funded by contributions from employers and managed according to state laws and regulations. However, there is also a federal program (FUTA) that provides a partial financial backstop for these state programs."
