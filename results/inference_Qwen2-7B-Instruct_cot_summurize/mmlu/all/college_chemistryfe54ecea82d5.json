The maximum number of energy levels (n_max) can be estimated using the formula:\n\n\\[ n_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}(Z + A - 1) \\]\n\nFor 55Mn, Z = 25 ( (since manganese has 25 protons) and A = 55 ( (the total number of nucleons in the nucleus).\n\n\\[ n_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}(25 + 55 - 1) \\]\n\\[ n_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}(80 - 1) \\]\n\\[ n_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}(79) \\]\n\\[ n_{max} = 39.5 \\]\n\nSince the number of energy levels must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 39 energy levels. However, this is an approximation and not the exact number of energy levels for 55Mn. The exact number depends on the specific nuclear shell model calculations for this particular isotope. \n\nThe closest answer choice given the options provided would be C. 8, but it's important to note that this is likely a simplification or an error in the question's options, as the actual number would be higher based on the calculation above."
