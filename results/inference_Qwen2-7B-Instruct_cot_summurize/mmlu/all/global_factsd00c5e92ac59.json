Happiness can be influenced by a myriad of factors including culture, economic conditions, personal circumstances, and individual outlooks. While there might be some statistical anomalies where people perceive others as less happy, this is not a universal truth for all countries or cultures.\n\nThe second statement is true. According to various studies, including those conducted by the Gallup World Poll, women's happiness levels have indeed shown an increase over time both in absolute terms and compared to men's happiness levels in the United States. These findings suggest that gender disparities in happiness are not static and can evolve over time."
