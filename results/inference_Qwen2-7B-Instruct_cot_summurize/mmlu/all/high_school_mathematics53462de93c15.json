This notation represents the inverse function, meaning if we take the output 2 from the original function $f$ (and use it as the input for the inverse function $f^{-1}$, we should get back to our original input, which in this case is 4.\n\nThe question asks for the value of $f(f(2))$. Since we know $f(2) = 4$, we can substitute this into our expression:\n\n\\[f(f(2)) = f(4)\\]\n\nTo find out what $f(4)$ is, we need to consider the information given about $f^{-1}(2) = 4$. This tells us that $f(4)$ must be 2 because when we apply the inverse function to 2, we get back to 4. Therefore, the output of applying $f$ to 4 should be 2.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nB. 2"
