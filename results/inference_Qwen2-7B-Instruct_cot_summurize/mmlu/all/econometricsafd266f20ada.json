This is because negative events can often lead to increased financial distress and higher risk for companies, potentially leading to bankruptcy or restructuring costs.\n\nGiven this, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. It would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude\n\nThis means that when negative news occurs, the impact on stock prices would increase at a faster rate compared to a similar positive news event. The reason for this asymmetry is rooted in the fact that negative events can have more severe consequences for financial health, whereas positive events might not have the same proportional impact on risk."
