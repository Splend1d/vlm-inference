And I do not know whether the Creator will grant relief immediately so that I can come home, or whether matters will take time, for I cannot come home with nothing. Now the matter is in your hand. If you wish to end our marriage, accept this bill of repudiation, and you are free. May God inspire you with the right decision.\nLetter from a Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo, ca. 1200\nWhich of the following is the most probable cause of the marital strain evident in the passage above?\n\nA. The strain placed on merchant families by long periods of separation\nB. Religious disagreements arising from the merchant's exposure to Hinduism\nC. A decision on the part of the merchant to remain permanently in India\nD. Bankruptcy stranding the merchant far from home\n"

The strain placed on merchant families by long periods of separation\n\nThis option aligns with the context provided in the letter where the husband acknowledges the long duration of their separation and expresses uncertainty about when he might be able to return home due to unspecified obligations. This suggests that the primary source of strain is the prolonged absence from his wife and family, rather than religious differences, a permanent relocation, or financial insolvency."
