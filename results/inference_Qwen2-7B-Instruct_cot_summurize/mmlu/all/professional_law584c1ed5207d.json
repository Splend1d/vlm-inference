Late for a business appointment, a businesswoman was driving north on a highway when she decided to pass the car in front of her. As she swung across the center line into the southbound lane, her vehicle collided with a fire engine. As a result of the accident, the fire engine was delayed in reaching an owner's house, which was entirely destroyed by fire. The owner's home was located approximately one mile from the accident scene. If the owner asserts a claim against thebusinesswoman, he will most likely\n\nA. recover the fair market value of his house before the fire.\nB. recover that part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck.\nC. recover nothing, because the businesswoman was not responsible for causing the fire.\nD. recover nothing, because the traffic statute was not designed to protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is D. The traffic statute was designed to prevent accidents like the one that occurred, where vehicles cross center lines and collide with opposing traffic. Since the statute specifically prohibits crossing center lines, the businesswoman could be held liable under the principle of negligence per se, meaning her violation of the law directly contributed to the harm caused. \n\nAs for the owner's claim, whether he recovers damages depends on several factors including the legal jurisdiction, specific laws regarding negligence and proximate cause, and how those laws interpret the relationship between the traffic violation and the resulting damage to his property. However, in many jurisdictions, the owner may be able to argue that the businesswoman's violation of the traffic law was the direct cause of the delay in the fire engine's response, which in turn led to the destruction of his property. Therefore, he might be able to recover damages that relate to the increased risk of property damage due to the delayed response time of the fire department.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact outcome cannot be predicted without more specific information about the applicable laws and court rulings in this case, the businesswoman's violation of the traffic statute likely played a significant role in the chain of events leading to the owner's loss, suggesting that the owner may have grounds for recovery under certain legal theories."
