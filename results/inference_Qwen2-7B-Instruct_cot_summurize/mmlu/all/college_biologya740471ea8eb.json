                    "text": "The correct statement about the cohesion-tension theory for the ascent of water in the xylem is:\n\nA. The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column.\n\nThis theory explains how water is drawn up from the roots to the leaves in plants through capillary action and transpiration pull. As water evaporates from the leaves, it creates a negative pressure (or tension - because there's less water available at the top of the plant than at the bottom. This tension is what drives the water up the xylem against gravity.\n\nLet's clarify why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. Water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure. This description is more aligned with the concept of osmosis or passive transport rather than the specific mechanism of water movement in the xylem as described by the cohesion-tension theory.\n\nC. The cohesion of water molecules is responsible for the formation of embolisms (air bubbles) in the water column. While it's true that the cohesive properties of water play a role in the structure of the water column, they do not directly cause air bubbles or embolisms. Air bubbles form when water flow is disrupted, such as during drought stress or mechanical damage to plant tissue.\n\nD. Living cells of the xylem provide the main conduit for an ascent of water. This statement is not entirely accurate. While living cells can influence water movement through their metabolic activities and the production of turgor pressure, the primary conduits for water transport in the xylem are dead, lignified vessels and tracheids. These specialized plant tissues provide a continuous, non-living pathway for water transport."
