The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a U.S. government agency that provides economic assistance to developing countries with the aim of reducing poverty through economic growth. It does so by offering compact grants or threshold program grants based on performance metrics related to governance, economic policy, and investment in people.\n\nThe MCC's approach is to condition aid disbursement on meeting specific criteria, which encourages recipient countries to adopt reforms and policies changes that align with the goals of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable economic growth. This conditional nature of aid can incentivize targeted reforms and can lead to more efficient use of aid resources.\n\nOptions B and C are not as universally applicable or effective. While the use of intergovernmental organizations can sometimes facilitate the coordination and delivery of aid, their effectiveness depends on the specific context and the capacity of these organizations. Withdrawing aid for bad policies can be seen as a form of leverage, but it might also lead to unintended consequences, such as exacerbating political tensions or humanitarian crises.\n\nTherefore, option D, \"None of the above, international aid never works,\" is incorrect, as conditional programs like those offered by the MCC have demonstrated success in encouraging policy reforms and economic development when implemented appropriately."
