This can be categorized into two main types based on the nature of the standards:\n\n1. **Non-binding legal standards (** (Option C): These are guidelines, principles, or recommendations that do not have the force of law but serve as moral or ethical benchmarks for states to aspire to. They are often set by international organizations like the United Nations and influence domestic laws through normative pressure.\n\n2. **Binding legal standards**: While not directly mentioned in your options, it's worth noting that some human rights treaties establish binding legal obligations. These are legally enforceable standards that countries agree to implement through their national legislation and policies.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to encapsulate the essence of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy would be a combination of both non-binding standards ( (Option C) and the establishment of certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties that could potentially lead to binding obligations ( which is not explicitly listed in the options provided. However, if forced to choose, Option D most closely alignss with the concept of setting standards in human rights treaties, albeit it does not distinguish between binding and non-binding standards."
