This could potentially demonstrate that the defendant had no reason to commit the murder since they were elsewhere at the time. However, this depends on the specifics of the case and how the testimony is presented. It is important to note that the rules of evidence can vary by jurisdiction and may require additional context or legal argument to properly categorize the admissibility of such testimony."
