The pain extends from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and is sometimes felt in the right scapula; it lasts about 30 minutes and is not relieved by antacids. The last episode occurred after she ate a hamburger and french fries. She has not had vomiting. She is currently asymptomatic. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m2 . Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant\nB. Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through\nC. CT scan of the abdomen\nD. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n"

The patient's weight and BMI also indicate obesity, which can be a risk factor for gallstones.\n\nGiven the symptoms and the patient's history, the most appropriate next step in management would likely be:\n\nA. Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant\n\nThis imaging modality is often used initially to evaluate symptoms related to the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts, as it can effectively detect gallstones and other potential causes of right upper quadrant pain. If ultrasound findings are inconclusive or if further clarification is needed, subsequent tests such as CT scan or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP could be considered. \n\nAn upper gastrointestinal series might not be the first choice as it does not specifically target the right upper quadrant pain, and it is less specific for gallbladder disease compared to ultrasound or CT. A CT scan of the abdomen could provide more detailed images but might not be necessary unless ultrasound is inconclusive or if there are additional concerns like suspected malignancy. ERCP is typically reserved for cases where there is suspicion of biliary or pancreatic obstruction and is not usually the first-line test for evaluation of right upper quadrant pain without additional symptoms suggesting bile duct pathology."
