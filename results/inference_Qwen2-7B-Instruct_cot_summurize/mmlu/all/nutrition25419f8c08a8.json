                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Vitamin E, specifically alpha-tocopherol, functions as an antioxidant by forming a stable radical that can be reduced back to its active form through reactions with glutathione and glutathione peroxidase. This process helps in neutralizing harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) or free radicals, which can damage cells and contribute to various diseases. \n\nTo elaborate on the other options:\nA. While vitamin E can indeed form a stable radical, it is not reduced back to its active form by vitamin C; rather, it is reduced by glutathione and glutathione peroxidase.\nB. Vitamin E does not convert to a stable radical through a reaction with vitamin C; instead, it neutralizes free radicals directly.\nC. Vitamin E is indeed lipid-soluble, but its antioxidant action is primarily related to its ability to neutralize free radicals within lipid environments, not specifically due to nitric oxide formation by vascular epithelium."
