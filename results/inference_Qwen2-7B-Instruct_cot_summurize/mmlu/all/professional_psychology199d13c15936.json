This theory suggests that if an individual is frustrated, they might feel better after expressing their aggression, potentially making them less likely to become aggressive again.\n\nHowever, this theory contradicts what empirical research has found. Studies have shown that engaging in aggressive behavior often leads to increased aggression rather than decreased aggression. This phenomenon is known as \"aggressive reinforcement,\" where the immediate reward of expressing aggression reinforces the behavior, making the individual more likely to engage in it again in the future. \n\nThus, none of the options you've listed (A, B, C, or D accurately represents the Catharsis Theory as it was understood and as it contradicts current scientific understanding. It's important to note that the theory itself has been largely debunked due to these findings and the lack of empirical support for its claims."
