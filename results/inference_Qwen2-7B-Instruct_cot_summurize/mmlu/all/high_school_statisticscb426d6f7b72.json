She obtains a simple random sample of 30 adults as they leave a Wall Street office building one weekday afternoon. All but two of the adults agree to participate in the survey. Which of the following conclusions is correct?\n\nA. Proper use of chance as evidenced by the simple random sample makes this a well-designed survey.\nB. The high response rate makes this a well-designed survey.\nC. Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\nD. A voluntary response study like this gives too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions.\n"

While the use of a simple random sample is generally a good approach, it does not necessarily ensure that the sample will be representative of the entire adult population in the U.S. Economy perceptions can vary widely across different demographics, and the sample obtained might not adequately capture these variations due to the specific location (Wall Street.\n\nB. The high response rate, although seemingly positive, does not automatically make the survey well-designed. In this case, the high response rate could introduce selection bias because those who agreed to participate might differ systematically from those who did not, potentially skewing the results.\n\nC. Correct. The fact that all but two of the adults agreed to participate suggests that there might be some form of self-selection bias. People leaving a Wall Street office building might have a particular interest or opinion about the economy, which could lead to an unrepresentative sample. This introduces selection bias into the survey design.\n\nD. This option is not directly relevant to the scenario described. Voluntary response studies, where participants choose to respond, can indeed lead to bias towards stronger opinions, but this is not specifically addressed in the given context. The issue here is more about the potential for selection bias due to the sampling method used."
