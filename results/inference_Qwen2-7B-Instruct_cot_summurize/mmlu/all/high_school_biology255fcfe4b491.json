Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted.\n\nDuring a prolonged drought, the environment changes significantly, affecting the available food sources. Finches on the island of Daphne Major would likely experience selective pressures related to these changes. Birds with beaks that are better suited for cracking open tougher seeds or foraging in drier conditions would have a higher chance of survival and thus reproductive success. This process is an example of natural selection, where traits that are advantageous in a given environment become more common over generations. Therefore, option C accurately reflects how each bird's survival might be influenced by the characteristics of its beak during a drought."
