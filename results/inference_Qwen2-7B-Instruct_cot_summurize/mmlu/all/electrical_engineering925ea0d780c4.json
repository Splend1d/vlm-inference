They typically operate in the range of kilohertz (kHz) up to several tens of megahertz (MHz). Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. 1 KHz to 1 MHz\n\nHowever, depending on the complexity and design of the LC oscillator, it can theoretically extend its frequency range beyond this limit, potentially reaching into the tens or hundreds of MHz. But as a general rule, options A, B, and D exceed the typical operating frequency range of simple LC oscillators."
