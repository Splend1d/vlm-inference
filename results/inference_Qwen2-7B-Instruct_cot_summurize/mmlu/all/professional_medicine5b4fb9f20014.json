A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?\n\nA. Chance of a type I error\nB. Chance of a type II error\nC.

It is calculated as 1 - \u03b2, where \u03b2 is the probability of making a type II error ( (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false). \n\nIn your scenario, the alpha value ( the chance of a type I error ( is fixed at 0.05. However, if the sample size decreases from 1000 to 500, the power of the study will decrease because the power increases with larger sample sizes. As a result, the chance of a type II error (failing to detect a true effect) would increase. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Chance of a type II error."
