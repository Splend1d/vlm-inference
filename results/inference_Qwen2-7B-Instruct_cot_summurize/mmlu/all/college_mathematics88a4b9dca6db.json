                    "text": "To analyze these statements, let's consider each one individually:\n\n### Statement I: If A and C are connected, then B is connected.\n\n- **Explanation**: If A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of C, and both A and C are connected, then B must also be connected. This is because if B were not connected, it would have to be separated into two nonempty open sets in B. However, since A is a subset of B, this separation would imply that A could be separated, contradicting its connectedness. Therefore, if A and C are connected, B must also be connected.\n\n### Statement II: If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\n\n- **Explanation**: In general, if A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of C, and if A and C are compact, then B might or might not be compact depending on the topology of X. Compactness is not necessarily preserved under proper inclusion. For instance, if X is an infinite-dimensional vector space with the standard topology, A could be a compact set, B an infinite union of copies of A shifted by different points in X, and C the entire space. Here, A and C are compact, but B is not, as it is not bounded. However, this example does not directly apply since we are dealing with subsets within the same topological space X. The correct interpretation is that if A and C are compact in a Hausdorff space (which implies they are compact in any space, given their connectedness, but this does not directly address compactness in the context of proper subsets without additional conditions, so the statement needs clarification. The key here is understanding that compactness does not necessarily propagate through proper subsets without specific conditions like those for Hausdorff spaces. Without further constraints, this statement is not universally true based solely on the information provided.\n\n### Statement III: If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\n\n- **Explanation**: The Hausdorff property is preserved under proper inclusion. This means that if A and C are Hausdorff, then B must also be Hausdorff. The reason is that the Hausdorff property ensures that for any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods around them. Since A is a subset of B, which is a subset of C, and all are Hausdorff, the property will hold for any two points in B, making B Hausdorff as well.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the analysis above, the correct answer is **C. I and III only**. Statements I and III are true based on the properties of connectedness, compactness, and the Hausdorff property, respectively, under the given conditions. Statement II requires clarification and is not universally true based solely on the information provided about proper subsets without additional context regarding the specific topological properties of the subsets involved."
