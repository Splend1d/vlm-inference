There are several antibiotics that can effectively treat gonorrhea when used as directed, such as ceftriaxone or azithromycin.\n\nC. It is true that gonorrhea is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in a significant portion of those infected. Many people do not show any symptoms at all, which makes it possible for the infection to go undetected unless tested.\n\nD. While gonorrhea primarily affects the genital areas, it can also affect other parts of the body such as the throat and eyes if not properly treated. However, the primary focus is usually on genital infections.\n\nB. The risk of getting gonorrhea from a single exposure depends on the circumstances. If both partners are infected and have sexual contact without protection, the risk increases. However, the statement \"has a high risk of infection with a single exposure\" is not universally accurate, as the transmission rate varies based on various factors including the specific circumstances of exposure."
