An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants.\nB. Weak states seek to avoid alliances with powerful states because alliances and assistance frequently are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met.\nC. An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats.\nD. Weak states may sometimes militarily engage in action to bolster their regional position and to mobilize internal support against the construction of an imagined external threat. This frequently coincides with economic or social crises as a policy of distraction.\n"

Among the options you've provided, each represents a distinct approach that can be observed in the behavior of elites, especially those in weak states or facing significant internal and external pressures:\n\nA. **Expulsion of Foreign Workers and Non-Ethnic Nationals**: This strategy involves restricting immigration and expelling individuals who are not part of the dominant ethnic group. By doing so, elites aim to consolidate power by reducing potential sources of social unrest and ensuring that resources are more tightly controlled within the domestic population. This move can also serve as a form of nationalistic rhetoric to strengthen the regime's appeal to its base.\n\nB. **Avoidance of Alliances with Powerful States**: In situations where elite interests might conflict with those of more powerful allies, weak states might choose to forgo formal alliances. This decision is often driven by a desire to maintain independence, avoid being used as a pawn in larger geopolitical games, and potentially to pursue their own unique paths of development without external interference. However, this strategy also carries risks, including isolation and vulnerability to external pressures.\n\nC. **Employment of Private Military or Security Companies ( (PMSCs) and Foreign Mercenaries**: This strategy leverages external forces to augment the state's military capabilities. PMcs and mercenaries can provide specialized skills, technology, and manpower at a lower cost than traditional state-owned military forces. This approach allows elites to enhance their security apparatus without the high costs and bureaucratic complexities associated with building and maintaining a conventional military. However, it also introduces the risk of external influence over the state's security policies and operations, potentially compromising national sovereignty.\n\nD. **Military Engagement for Regional Positioning and Distraction**: Weak states might use military actions to assert dominance in their region or to divert attention from internal issues. Such actions can be aimed at strengthening alliances, securing trade routes, or demonstrating resolve against perceived threats. Military engagement as a distraction tactic is common during times of economic or social crisis, as it can temporarily rally public support and divert attention away from pressing domestic problems. However, these actions can also escalate tensions, lead to international condemnation, and have long-term negative impacts on the state's reputation and stability.\n\nEach of these strategies reflects a complex interplay between domestic politics, international relations, and the broader geopolitical context. Elites must carefully consider the potential benefits and costs of such actions, given the multifaceted nature of power dynamics in contemporary global politics."
