However, this has changed over time and is expected to increase in the future. The full retirement age (FRA) for those born in 1955 and later starts at 67. \n\nSocial Security's full retirement age gradually increased from 65 to 67 as part of the 1983 Amendments to the Social Security Act, with the intention of extending the program's solvency by aligning benefits with life expectancy improvements. The exact age at which you can claim full benefits will depend on your birth year. \n\nSo, none of the options provided (A, B, or D are entirely accurate given that the full retirement age is not fixed at a single point in time but rather changes based on your birth year. Option C, \"Has been increasing,\" is the closest to being true based on historical changes to the Social Security system. \n\nPlease note that these details are subject to change as Congress may make adjustments to the Social Security program. It's always a good idea to check the most current information provided by the Social Security Administration."
