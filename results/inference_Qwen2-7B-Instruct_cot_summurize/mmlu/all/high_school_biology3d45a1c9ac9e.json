Batesian mimicry. \n\nBatesian mimicry involves a harmless species (the mimic) adopting the warning signals (such as coloration, patterns, or behaviors) of a harmful model species (the model) to deter predators. The predator learns to avoid the model due to its harmful attributes, and subsequently avoids the mimic as well. In this case, the harmless lizard benefits from the defensive mechanisms of the more dangerous lizard, which it mimics, thus avoiding predation itself."
