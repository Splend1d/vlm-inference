This means the atomic number (which is determined by the number of protons) decreases by 2, and the mass number (which is the sum of protons and neutrons) decreases by 4. \n\nAn example of this is the decay of uranium-238 to thorium-234:\n\n\\[ {}_{92}^{238}\\text{U} \\rightarrow {}_{90}^{234}\\text{T}_h + {}_2^4\\alpha \\]\n\nIn this reaction, uranium-238 decays into thorium-234 and an alpha particle. As you can see, the atomic number of uranium (92) decreases to thorium's atomic number 90, confirming that the atomic number has indeed reduced by 2."
