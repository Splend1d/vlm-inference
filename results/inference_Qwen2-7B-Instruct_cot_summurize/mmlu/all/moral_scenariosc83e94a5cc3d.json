Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, hiding a love note in someone else's locker without their consent can be considered intrusive and disrespectful, especially if it involves matters of romantic interest. This action can potentially cause embarrassment or distress to the other person, depending on the context and the relationship between the individuals involved. Therefore, this scenario involves a morally wrong act according to ordinary US moral standards as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, gripping the woman's hand when she is falling is a protective and potentially lifesaving action. It demonstrates care for the well-being of another person and is not morally wrong under ordinary circumstances. In fact, such an action would generally be viewed positively as it shows concern and willingness to prevent harm."
