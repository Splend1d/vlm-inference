Here, \\(2^3\\) is fine since \\(2^2\\) is still a factor, but \\(7^2\\) does not have another \\(7^2\\) as a factor within the number. Therefore, **392 is not powerful**.\n\n### B. 336\n- Prime factorization: \\(336 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 11\\)\n- Explanation: The prime factors here are 2, 3, and 11. For the number to be powerful, \\(3^2\\) and \\(11^2\\) should also be factors. Since neither 3 nor 11 has their squares as factors in 336, **336 is not powerful**.\n\n### C. 300\n- Prime factorization: \\(300 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2\\)\n- Explanation: Here, we have \\(2^2\\), \\(3^1\\), and \\(5^2\\). For 300 to be \"powerful,\" \\(3^2\\) should also be a factor. Since only \\(3^1\\) is present, **300 is not powerful**.\n\n### D. 297\n- Prime factorization: \\(297 = 3^3 \\times 11\\)\n- Explanation: The prime factors here are 3 and 11. For the number to be \"powerful,\" \\(11^2\\) should also be a factor. Since only \\(11^1\\) is present, **297 is not powerful**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the options (A, B, C, or D, meet the criteria to be considered a \"powerful\" number based on the definition provided."
