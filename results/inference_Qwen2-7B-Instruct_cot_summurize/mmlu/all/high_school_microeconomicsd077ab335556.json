Demand for automobiles.\n\nDemand elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in its price or other factors such as income, prices of related goods, etc. The more elastic a demand curve, the more responsive the quantity demanded is to these changes.\n\nAmong the options given:\n\nA. Demand for white Ford minivans: This is a very specific type of vehicle and might have somewhat elastic demand because buyers could potentially switch to different colors or brands if prices change significantly.\n\nB. Demand for automobiles: This is much broader than the previous option, encompassing all types and models of cars. Because there are are so many substitutes available (ranging from different brands to different types of vehicles like SUVs, trucks, etc.), the demand for automobiles as a whole tends to be more elastic.\n\nC. Demand for Ford automobiles: This is a specific brand within the broader category of automobiles, which would still have some elasticity due to the presence of substitutes.\n\nD. Demand for American-made automobiles: This narrows down the market even further, but it's still broad enough to include various brands and models. Demand here could be influenced by factors like brand loyalty, quality perceptions, and economic conditions, making it relatively elastic.\n\nOverall, the demand for automobiles ( as represented by option B - is likely to be the most elastic because of the high availability of substitutes across different brands and types of vehicles."
