This type of society relies heavily on deforestation for land expansion, which can lead to overpopulation if the rate of population growth exceeds the rate at which new land can be cleared. Over time, this can result in resource depletion, soil degradation, and habitat loss, leading to increased competition for resources and potential environmental degradation.\n\nIn contrast:\n\nA. An industrial society with abundant natural resources and large imports of food is less likely to experience population pressure because it has access to technology and resources that allow for efficient resource utilization and population support.\n\nB. A society with a highly mechanized agricultural sector may have higher food production capacity but still faces population pressure if the population grows faster than the productivity gains from technology.\n\nC. A non-ecumene ( (a term not commonly used or defined in standard geographical or demographic contexts) would typically refer to an area not classified within ecumenes ( (areas divided by human geography). Without a specific definition, it's hard to determine how this would impact population pressure, but generally, areas with more developed infrastructure and resources are have lower population pressures."
