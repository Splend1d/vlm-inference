The correlation coefficient \\(r = 0.9\\) indicates a strong positive relationship between the number of hours students study per day and their GPA. However, it does not imply causation. \n\nA. This statement is not accurate because the correlation coefficient does not specify the percentage of students who receive high grades based on their study hours. It only quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship.\n\nB. Similarly, B is incorrect for the same reason as A. While studying more is associated with higher GPAs, this does not mean that 90% of students who receive high grades do so solely due to studying a lot.\n\nC. This statement is also not correct. The correlation coefficient does not directly relate to the percentage of variance explained in one variable by another. Instead, to find how much of the variation in GPA is explained by the variation in study hours, we would square the correlation coefficient (\\(r^2\\), which gives us the coefficient of determination. For \\(r = 0.9\\), \\(r^2 = 0.81\\) or 81%.\n\nD. This statement correctly interprets the meaning of the correlation coefficient squared (\\(r^2 = 0.81\\)). It means that 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by the variation in the number of study hours per day. This is a reasonable conclusion based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
