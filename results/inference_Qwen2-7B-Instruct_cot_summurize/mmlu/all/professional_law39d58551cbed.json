Murder.\n\nThis is because the defendant intentionally fired a gun, which resulted in the death of another person. Even though the intent was to harm the opposing team's player rather than the defendant's own team member, the action led to an unintended fatal outcome. Intentional acts leading to death generally fall under the category of murder or manslaughter, depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction. Since the death was caused by the defendant's intentional act (firing a gun, it would typically be considered murder, especially considering the fatal outcome."
