Electrons in higher energy levels (subshells further from the nucleus generally have more kinetic energy and thus can be ejected with greater velocity upon interaction with a high-energy photon. Among the options given:\n\n- A. 1s electrons are closest to the nucleus and have the least kinetic energy when ejected.\n- B. 2p electrons are closer to the nucleus than 3p or 3d electrons but still further away than 1s electrons.\n- C. 3p electrons are closer to the nucleus than 3d electrons but still have more energy than 1s or 2p electrons.\n- D. 3d electrons are the farthest from the nucleus among the options, thus they have the most energy and can be ejected with the greatest velocity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 3d."
