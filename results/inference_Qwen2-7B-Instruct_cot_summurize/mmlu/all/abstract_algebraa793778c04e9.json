If the subring is taken to include the multiplicative identity (i.e., the unity of the ring, then the unity of the subring would indeed be the same as the unity of the ring. However, if the subring does not contain the unity of the ring, then it will have its own unity which might be different from that of the larger ring. Therefore, this statement is not universally true.\n\nStatement 2: Every field is an integral domain.\nThis statement is true. An integral domain is defined as a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is always non-zero. A field, by definition, is a commutative ring with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. This means that for any two non-zero elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in a field, \\(ab \\neq 0\\), satisfying the condition for being an integral domain.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
