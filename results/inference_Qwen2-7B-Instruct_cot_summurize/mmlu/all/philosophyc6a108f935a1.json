When considering the options provided, Parfit's views align closely with option C: \"both a and b.\"\n\nParfit argues that:\n\nA. It is possible for an outcome to be worse for a particular person than some alternative. This perspective emphasizes the importance of individual welfare and how outcomes can be evaluated based on their impact on specific individuals. \n\nB. It is possible for an outcome to be worse than some alternative. This statement encompasses a broader consideration of welfare, suggesting that outcomes can be compared not only within the context of a single individual but also across different scenarios or outcomes.\n\nParfit\u2019s ethical theory often focuses on the idea of \"repugnant conclusions,\" where increasing population size could lead to a situation where the additional happiness is so small that it is outweighed by the suffering of the existing population. This theory challenges traditional utilitarian approaches and highlights the complexity of evaluating welfare across different scenarios and individuals."
