He argues that when companies engage in business deals with corrupt regimes, they often benefit from the exploitation of the local population or the environment. By doing so, they contribute to the perpetuation of injustices and harm caused by these regimes. Thus, they can be seen as knowingly participating in transactions that involve the use of stolen resources or the exploitation of vulnerable populations, much like someone who buys stolen goods."
