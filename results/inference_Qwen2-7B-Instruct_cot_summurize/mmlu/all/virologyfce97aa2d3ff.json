The virion RNA is translated into a single large polyprotein\n\nPicornaviruses, being positive-strand RNA viruses, replicate their genome in the cytoplasm of host cells. Their replication process begins with the entry of the viral particles into the host cell, where the virion RNA is directly translated into a single large polyprotein ( without the need for an intermediate RNA transcript. This polyprotein is then processed by viral and cellular proteases into the mature structural proteins ( capsid proteins that form the viral particle and non-structural proteins that are involved in viral replication and other functions. Therefore, option B accurately describes the replication mechanism of picornaviruses."
