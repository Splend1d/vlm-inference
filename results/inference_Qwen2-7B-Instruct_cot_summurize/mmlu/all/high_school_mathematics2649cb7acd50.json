                    "text": "Given that \\(f(x)\\) is a polynomial of degree 6, we can express it as:\n\n\\[f(x) = ax^6 + bx^5 + cx^4 + dx^3 + ex^2 + fx + g\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\(g(x)\\) being a polynomial of degree 3 can be expressed as:\n\n\\[g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s\\]\n\nNow, let's consider \\(h(x)\\), which we need to determine its degree.\n\nThe expression given is \\(f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))\\) with a degree of 36.\n\n### Degree Analysis\n\n**Degree of \\(f(g(x))\\):**\n\n- Since \\(f(x)\\) is a polynomial of degree 6, and \\(g(x)\\) is of degree 3, when you substitute \\(g(x)\\) into \\(f(x)\\), you get a polynomial whose degree is the product of the degrees of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\). Thus, \\(f(g(x))\\) has a degree of \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\).\n\n**Degree of \\(g(h(x))\\):**\n\n- Similarly, since \\(g(x)\\) is of degree 3, substituting \\(h(x)\\) into \\(g(x)\\) will yield a polynomial of degree \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\), where 1 is the degree of \\(h(x)\\) that we're trying to find.\n\n**Degree of \\(h(f(x))\\):**\n\n- For \\(h(f(x))\\), if \\(f(x)\\) is of degree 6, and we substitute \\(f(x)\\) into \\(h(x)\\), the resulting polynomial's degree will depend on the degree of \\(h(x)\\). The maximum degree in this case would be \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\), assuming \\(h(x)\\) does not reduce the degree ( which is not possible here due to the structure of the problem.\n\n### Total Degree of the Expression\n\nGiven the total degree of the expression \\(f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))\\) is 36, and knowing the individual contributions of each part:\n\n- \\(f(g(x))\\) contributes \\(18\\).\n- \\(g(h(x))\\) contributes \\(3\\).\n- \\(h(f(x))\\) contributes up to \\(6\\), but given the requirement for the total degree to be 36, and considering the nature of the operation and the degrees involved, the actual contribution from \\(h(f(x))\\) must align with the total degree.\n\nSince \\(f(g(x))\\) already contributes \\(18\\), and \\(g(h(x))\\) contributes \\(3\\), the sum \\(18 + 3 = 21\\) leaves room for \\(h(f(x))\\) to contribute the remaining \\(36 - 21 = 15\\). However, this calculation seems to misalign with the direct product of degrees due to the misunderstanding of how the total degree of the composed functions works.\n\nThe correct approach should focus on understanding how the composition of polynomials affects their degrees and ensuring the total degree matches the given condition.\n\n### Correct Degree Calculation\n\nGiven the initial misunderstanding in directly calculating the contribution of \\(h(f(x))\\) based on the degrees alone, let's correct the approach by focusing on the total degree condition and the structure of polynomial compositions:\n\nThe key insight is recognizing that the total degree of \\(f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))\\) being 36 involves understanding how these compositions interact. Given the constraints and the options provided, the correct approach involves realizing that the composition of polynomials does not simply multiply their degrees but rather, the highest degree term in the final expression is determined by the outermost function's degree, influenced by the inner functions' degrees.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(f(x)\\) has degree 6,\n- \\(g(x)\\) has degree 3,\n- \\(h(x)\\) is unknown,\n\nThe degree of the overall expression being 36 implies a complex interaction between these degrees, especially considering \\(h(x)\\) must be strategically positioned within the expression to influence the final degree without exceeding it significantly, given the degree of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\).\n\nGiven the direct calculation misstep and aiming for clarity and correctness:\n\nThe correct approach should focus on understanding that for the expression \\(f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))\\) to have a total degree of 36, considering the degrees of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\), the degree of \\(h(x)\\) must be such that it complements the structure of the overall expression while respecting the given total degree constraint.\n\nThe direct calculation provided was misleading in terms of how degrees contribute in polynomial compositions. The essence lies in recognizing that the degree of \\(h(x)\\) is influenced by its position and interaction within the expression,"
