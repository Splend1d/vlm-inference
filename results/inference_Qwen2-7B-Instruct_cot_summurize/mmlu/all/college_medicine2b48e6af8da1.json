This means it has more potential energy stored within its bonds that can be released through complete oxidation in the body. \n\nGlucose is a simple sugar (a carbohydrate, while leucine is an amino acid, and both will produce less energy per gram than a gram of palmitic acid. Alcohol, when metabolized, does produce energy, but not as much as palmitic acid because it has fewer carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n\nSo, among the options given, one gram of palmitic acid will release the most energy when completely oxidized in the body."
