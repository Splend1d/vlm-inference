When one psychologist refers a patient to another and then provides a consultation as part of that referral process, this can be considered ethical under certain conditions:\n\n1. **Consent**: The patient should ideally be informed about the referral and the potential for consultation between the two psychologists, although the specific details might depend on the jurisdiction's laws and professional guidelines.\n2. **Confidentiality**: All parties involved must maintain confidentiality regarding the patient's information unless there is a legal obligation to disclose.\n3. **Competence**: Both psychologists should be competent in their respective areas of practice to ensure the best care for the patient.\n4. **Documentation**: Proper documentation of the referral, consultation, and any decisions made should be kept.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the action described would generally be considered ethical. However, the specifics can vary based on local laws, professional codes of ethics, and institutional policies. It's always advisable for psychologists to consult relevant guidelines and potentially seek specific advice from their professional organizations or legal counsel."
