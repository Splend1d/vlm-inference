Tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia\n\nParkinson's disease is characterized by these three main symptoms:\n1. **Tremor**: Usually begins as a trembling or shaking movement in the hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head.\n2. **Rigidity**: This is a stiffness or tightness in the muscles that can affect any part of the body, making movement more difficult.\n3. ** Bradykinesia**: This refers to slowness of movement, including difficulty starting movements ( (akinesia) and decreased velocity and amplitude of movement.\n\nExecutive dysfunction is not typically considered one of the core symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It may occur as a secondary symptom, affecting areas such as memory, planning, and decision-making, but it's not part of the classic triad. Gait imbalance can be a symptom, but it is often associated with bradykinesia and rigidity rather than being listed separately as a defining characteristic alongside tremor. Paresis is a term used to describe muscle weakness, which is not a primary symptom of Parkinson's disease."
