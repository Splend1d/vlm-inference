Research indicates that factors related to the client, including their level of motivation, engagement, and readiness for change, play a significant role in determining the effectiveness of therapy. While therapist skills, client-therapist interactions, and other variables can influence outcomes, they generally do not account for as large a proportion of the variance compared to client-related factors."
