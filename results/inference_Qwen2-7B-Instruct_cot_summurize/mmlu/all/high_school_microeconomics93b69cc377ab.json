                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL (Marginal Revenue Product of Labor) will increase.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Cost of Labor**: The firm pays $15 per worker.\n2. **Revenue from Labor**: Each unit produced by the labor contributes $3 to revenue since each product is sold for $3.\n   \n   - For the first worker: $3 (  \n  - For the second worker: $3 + $3 = $6 (  \n  - For the third worker: $3 + $3 + $3 = $9  \n\n3. **Marginal Revenue Product (MRPL** is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker. For the third worker, the MRPL is $9 ( (since it adds $9 to total revenue).\n\n4. **Profit Maximization**: A firm maximizes profit when the Marginal Revenue Product (MRPL exceeds the Marginal Cost (MC. Here, MC = $15 (cost of hiring the next worker).\n\nGiven:\n- The cost of hiring the third worker is $15.\n- The revenue generated by the third worker is $9.\n\nSince the MRPL ($9) is less than the MC ($15), hiring an additional worker does not maximize profit. Therefore, to maximize profit, the firm should hire fewer workers until the point where MRPL equals MC.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best reflects this situation is:\n\nC. The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will increase. \n\nTo clarify the other options:\n- A. Hiring more labor will not increase MRPL since it is already at its lowest point (the third worker, and adding more workers will only decrease MRPL as the marginal contribution decreases with each additional worker due to diminishing marginal returns.\n- B. Decreasing MRPL is not the goal; maximizing profit requires balancing MRPL and MC.\n- D. Hiring less labor could potentially increase MRPL, but the goal is to reach the point where MRPL equals MC, not just decrease MRPL."
