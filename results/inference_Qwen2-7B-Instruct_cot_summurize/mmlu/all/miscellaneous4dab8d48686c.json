A surge in soft-money campaign contributions\n\nSoft-money campaign contributions refer to donations made to political parties or party-affiliated organizations that are are not regulated by the Federal Election Commission ( and can be used for a wide range of activities, including general party-building efforts, which may indirectly support candidates. The influx of soft money can potentially increase the financial power of political parties, thereby reducing their dependence on traditional fundraising methods. However, it's worth noting that the impact of soft money on political party power is subject to changes in laws and regulations, as well as shifts in political ideologies and public opinion."
