(2) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the ranch. (3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the borrower delivered to his daughter, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter by a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. (4) In 2008, the borrower delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. If the borrower thereafter defaulted on the mortgage and the mortgage company brought an in personam action against the daughter to recover the amount due on the mortgage debt, the mortgagee will probably\n\nA. succeed, because the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter.\nB. succeed, because there was an implied delegation of duties to the daughter.\nC. not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\nD. not succeed, because the law does not permit the mortgagor to delegate duties under this type of a property transfer.\n"

                    "text": "C. not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe grantor-grantee indexing system refers to a method used in real estate transactions where the document number of the deed or other legal instrument is indexed to the grantor's name, and the grantee's name is also indexed. This allows for easier searching and tracking of ownership changes. However, this system does not directly affect the legal analysis of the question at hand.\n\nRegarding the events described:\n\n- The borrower originally mortgaged the ranch to the mortgage company in 1993.\n- The mortgage company recorded the mortgage in 1996.\n- In 2007, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to his daughter through a quitclaim deed and to pay the mortgage debt upon its maturity.\n- In 2008, the borrower delivered a quitclaim deed to the daughter without any mention of the mortgage.\n\nWhen the borrower defaults on the mortgage and the mortgage company sues the daughter to recover the amount due on the mortgage debt, the court would likely rule as follows based on the facts provided:\n\n- The mortgage company's action is an in personam lawsuit against the daughter. This means the company is seeking personal liability from the daughter, rather than attempting to enforce the mortgage lien on the property itself.\n- The agreement between the borrower and the daughter in 2007 does not obligate the daughter to pay the mortgage debt. It only involves a promise to convey the property to her and to pay the debt upon its maturity.\n- The quitclaim deed delivered by the borrower in 2008 also does not include any reference to the mortgage, further indicating that the borrower was not transferring any responsibility for the mortgage to his daughter.\n  \nTherefore, since the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt and the transaction involving the quitclaim deed did not involve any form of assumption or delegation of the mortgage obligations, the mortgage company is unlikely to succeed in recovering the amount due on the mortgage debt from the daughter through an in personam lawsuit."
