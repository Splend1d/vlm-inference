Therefore, there's an 85% chance he will be on time (\\(100\\% - 15\\%\\)).\n   - So, the probability of being on time when cooking a big breakfast is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.85 \\).\n\n3. **Probability of having a lighter breakfast:**\n   - The probability of rolling a 3 or larger on a six-sided die is \\( \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n4. **Probability of being on time when having a lighter breakfast:**\n   - There's a 6% chance he will be late if he has a lighter breakfast. Therefore, there's a 94% chance he will be on time (\\(100\\% - 6\\%\\)).\n   - So, the probability of being on time when having a lighter breakfast is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 0.94 \\).\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of being on time from both scenarios:\n\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.85\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 0.94\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.85\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 0.94\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{0.85}{3} + \\frac{2 \\times 0.94}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{0.85}{3} + \\frac{1.88}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{2.73}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ = 0.91 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Semir will be on time for school any given day is \\(0.91\\), which corresponds to option D."
