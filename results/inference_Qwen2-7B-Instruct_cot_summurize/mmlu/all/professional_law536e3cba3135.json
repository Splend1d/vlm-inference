They bought a house together but the deed went in the man's name alone due to better credit and ability to obtain a mortgage in his name. He worked as a school vice-principal. She gave up her night law school classes to stay home and be a homemaker. She worked as a waitress and paid for all household expenses, food, laundry and other items. He paid for the mortgage, taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and other expenses. After several years, they became estranged and the man ordered the woman out of the house. She moved out and brought an action to obtain one-half of the home's equity value and a share of the other property and accounts built up in the man's name during the marriage. Which of the following is the best and strongest argument that the woman may assert to obtain a fair share of the property?\n\nA. There is an express contract between them to share the property equally.\nB. He has been unjustly enriched and he owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.\nC. She is entitled to damages based on a legal theory of fraudulent conversion.\nD. She is may be remunerated under the federal civil rights laws prohibiting gender discrimination.\n"

He has been unjustly enriched and he owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.\n\nIn this situation, the woman might argue that the man has been unjustly enriched at her expense because she contributed significantly to the home's value through her labor and financial support, even though her name was not on the deed. Under a quasi-contract legal theory, courts can order restitution when one party has benefited at the expense of another without a formal agreement. In this case, the woman could argue that by paying for household expenses and contributing to the home's upkeep, she is entitled to a portion of the home's equity and other shared assets as a form of restitution for her contributions. This argument would likely be the strongest because it does not require an explicit contract or proof of fraud, and it focuses on the principle of fairness and compensation for services rendered."
