These technological advancements reflect increased cognitive abilities and creativity among early humans.\n\nA. Parietal and mobiliary art refers to cave paintings and portable art, which also show a high level of creativity and symbolic thinking, but they do not necessarily indicate advanced intellectual processes related to tool-making or planning.\n\nC. The acquisition of non-local raw materials suggests long-distance trade and possibly the development of complex social networks, but it does not directly demonstrate intellectual advancement in the context of tool-making or technology.\n\nD. Changes in settlement patterns could indicate better planning or adaptation to environmental conditions, but these changes might not necessarily be tied to specific intellectual advancements unless they involved complex decision-making processes that required foresight and strategic thought."
