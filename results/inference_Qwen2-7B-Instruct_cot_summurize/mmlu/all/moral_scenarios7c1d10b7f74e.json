Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In the first scenario, the main character deceiving their parents by pretending to be them and going to the doctor, which is clearly morally wrong. In the second scenario, making jewelry out of trash and selling it is not inherently morally wrong; it's a creative way to recycle and potentially make a living. However, it could be considered unethical if the process harms the environment or exploits workers. Without more specific details on how the jewelry is made, we can't definitively say it's morally wrong, but it could be open to ethical critique depending on the context."
