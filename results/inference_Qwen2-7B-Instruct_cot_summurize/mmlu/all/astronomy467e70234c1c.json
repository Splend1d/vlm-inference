The composition of its surface is dominated by these volatile ices, which include nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. These substances exist as solid ices on Pluto due to the low temperatures but can sublimate ( transition directly from a solid to a gas state when conditions change, such as during Pluto's closest approach to the Sun (perihelion. Options A, C, and D do not accurately reflect the known composition and behavior of Pluto's surface."
