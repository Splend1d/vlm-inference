It can be seen as stalking or an invasion of privacy, both of which are are not ethically acceptable under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2 involves putting a 42-cent stamp on a bill to ensure its delivery. This action, while perhaps unnecessary and potentially wasteful, is not inherently morally wrong. The intent might have been to ensure the bill's timely arrival, which is generally considered a reasonable action, especially if there was concern about the postal service's reliability. Thus, it would not typically be viewed as a morally wrong act."
