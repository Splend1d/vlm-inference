Its ultimate goal is to offer practical guidance for making morally sound decisions in real-world situations. Moral theories often involve normative ethics, which deals with what actions are right or wrong, and how individuals and societies should behave.\n\nExplanatory power ( (A) refers to the ability of a theory to explain phenomena, while parsimony (B), also known as Occam's Razor, is a philosophical principle that prefers simpler explanations over more complex ones when both explanations adequately account for the available evidence. Neither of these principles directly addresses the primary objective of providing practical guidance in moral decision-making."
