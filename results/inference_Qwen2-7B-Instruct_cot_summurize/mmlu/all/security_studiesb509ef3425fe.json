Human security is threatened by global inequality, because 3s of the world population do not share the benefits of globalisation. However, this inequality does not translate into political instability or involve military action.\nB. Global inequality creates disenfranchised populations who, although discontent with their situation, lack the agency to rebel or protest.\nC.

Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.\n\nGlobal inequality can indeed pose a significant threat to global security in several ways. When large segments of the population feel marginalized and excluded from the benefits of globalization, they may become increasingly discontented and even radicalized. This discontent can lead to social unrest, protests, and in extreme cases, revolutionary uprisings. Such events can disrupt societal stability, create humanitarian crises, and potentially spill over international borders, affecting regional and global security dynamics.\n\nMoreover, the frustration and anger stemming from perceived injustices can also fuel anti-establishment sentiments, which might manifest in the form of terrorism or other forms of violent extremism, targeting both domestic and international interests. This not only undermines local governance but also poses a direct threat to global security, as such actions can destabilize entire regions or even the world order.\n\nFurthermore, the gap between the rich and the poor can exacerbate existing geopolitical tensions, leading to conflicts over resources, influence, and power. This can escalate into armed conflicts or proxy wars, which can have far-reaching consequences on global security and stability.\n\nIn summary, global inequality can indeed be a significant threat to global security by fostering social unrest, radicalization, and conflict, which can have far-reaching implications for regional and international peace and stability."
