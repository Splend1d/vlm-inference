Faraday's law\n\nMetal detectors at airports operate on the principle of Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that a changing magnetic field will induce an electric current in a conductor. When someone walks through the metal detector, any metal objects on their person disturb the magnetic field. This change in the magnetic field induces an electrical current, which is detected by the machine and triggers an alarm."
