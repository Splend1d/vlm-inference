Not wrong, Wrong. \n\nIn Scenario 1, feeling glad about one's full refrigerator while thinking of people who are starving in the third world might be insensitive or lack empathy, but it is not necessarily morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It could be viewed as a lack of awareness or compassion for global suffering, but it doesn't involve any direct actions that cause harm or violate rights.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the act of not boarding a submarine when one knows they could potentially infect the crew is morally wrong. This action directly harms others by putting their health and lives at risk, which violates ethical principles of care, responsibility, and respect for autonomy.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is not morally wrong, while the second scenario is."
