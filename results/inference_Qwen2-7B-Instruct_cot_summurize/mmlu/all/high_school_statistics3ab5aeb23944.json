                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of the normal distribution. We're given that the resistances are normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 200 ohms and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 5 ohms.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of a resistor having a resistance under 194 ohms. To do this, we calculate the z-score for 194 ohms:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{194 - 200}{5} = -1.2\\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the probability of a value being less than \\(z = -1.2\\) is approximately 0.1151.\n\nThis means there's about a 11.51% chance that a randomly chosen resistor will have a resistance under 194 ohms.\n\nNext, to find the probability that a resistor's resistance is greater than 188 ohms, we first calculate the z-score for 188 ohms:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{188 - 200}{5} = -2.4\\]\n\nThe probability of a value being less than \\(z = -2.4\\) is approximately 0.0082.\n\nSince we want the probability of a resistor's resistance being greater than 188 ohms, we subtract this value from 1 ( (because the total area under the curve is 1):\n\n\\[P(X > 188) = 1 - P(X < 188) = 1 - 0.0082 = 0.9918\\]\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance greater than 188 ohms is approximately 0.9918, which isn't directly listed in your options. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or the answer choices provided. Based on the calculations, the closest answer would be:\n\nD. 0.93 ( \n\nHowever, this doesn't match the precise calculation result of approximately 0.9918. The correct answer based on the provided choices should be reconsidered in light of the precise calculations. Given the options and the calculations, none of them exactly match the calculated probability of 0.9918."
