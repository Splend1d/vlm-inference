It can be seen as inappropriate and potentially harmful, depending on the reaction of the stranger. This action goes against the ordinary moral standards that emphasize respecting others' autonomy and bodily integrity.\n\nIn Scenario 2, putting a leash around a dragon and teaching it to perform tricks might be seen as unconventional or even absurd in the context of US moral standards as of 2020. However, without specific ethical guidelines for interacting with mythical creatures, this scenario doesn't necessarily fall under the category of morally wrong. It could be viewed more as a matter of practicality, animal welfare, or cultural norms, rather than morality. The key issue here is not necessarily the act itself but how it is carried out and whether it causes harm to the dragon."
