This allows for the adaptation of the treaty's provisions to contemporary circumstances and values.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Golder v UK (1978 - This case dealt with the right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court applied the living instrument principle by considering the evolving nature of privacy expectations in the context of surveillance.\n\nB. A v UK (2009 - In this case, the Court considered the right to respect for private life in the context of the use of biometric data for immigration control. It used the living instrument principle to assess whether the state's measures were necessary and proportionate in light of modern technology and practices.\n\nC. Goodwin v UK (2002 - This case concerned the right to respect for family life and the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion under Article 8. The Court applied the living instrument principle by considering the impact of the state's refusal to register the applicant's marriage.\n\nD. Osman v UK (1998 - In this case, the Court dealt with issues related to the right to a fair trial and the prohibition of torture or inhuman and degrading treatment under Articles 6 and 6 of the Convention. While the Court did consider the evolving standards of treatment in custody, it was not as directly focused on the application of the living instrument principle as some other cases.\n\nGiven the focus on adapting the interpretation of human rights to contemporary issues, **Option B ( A v UK (2009** best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights."
