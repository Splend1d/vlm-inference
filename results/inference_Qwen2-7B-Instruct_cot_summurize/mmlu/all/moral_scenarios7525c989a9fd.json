Sticking a knife in someone's back is universally recognized as a violent and harmful act that violates personal safety and trust.\n2. Bringing a file tool into a courtroom when not authorized to do so would be seen as disruptive and potentially disrespectful to the judicial process, undermining the fairness and integrity of the legal proceedings. This could also lead to consequences such as being removed from the trial or facing additional charges for contempt of court."
