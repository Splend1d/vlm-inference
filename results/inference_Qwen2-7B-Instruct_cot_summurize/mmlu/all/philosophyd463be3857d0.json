However, his view is nuanced. He suggests that actions that promote overall happiness ( utility - are should be preferred, but he also emphasizes that moral virtues themselves have intrinsic value.\n\nSo, none of the options A, B, or C fully capture Mill's view. Instead, Mill might be aligning more closely with a conception where virtue is desirable because it contributes to a better society and maximizes overall happiness, but this is not solely for one's own happiness or strictly for the happiness of others. \n\nThus, if we were to interpret Mill's views through the given options, option D could be seen as closest to his actual stance, acknowledging that virtue can contribute to one's own happiness as well as the greater good, but it isn't reduced to either of those ends alone."
