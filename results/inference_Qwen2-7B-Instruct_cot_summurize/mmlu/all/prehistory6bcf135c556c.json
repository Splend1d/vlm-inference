These features could be used for various purposes, including religious ceremonies, storage, or as a display of wealth and power, depending on their context. They do not necessarily prove the existence of slavery ( (option A), nor do they directly relate to the Mesolithic tradition ( (option C), or the shift from Paleolithic to Neolithic periods ( (option D). Instead, they suggest that the society in question had the capacity for large-scale communal projects, which is indicative of more complex social structures."
