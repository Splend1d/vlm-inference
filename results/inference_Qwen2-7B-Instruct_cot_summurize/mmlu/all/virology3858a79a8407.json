The emphasis is on making testing accessible and encouraging individuals to get tested if they have symptoms, have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, or are part of high-risk groups.\n\nRegarding \"high-risk groups,\" both the CDC and WHO do indeed recommend prioritizing testing for certain populations such as healthcare workers, residents and staff of long-term care facilities, and those in communities with higher transmission rates. \n\nMandatory testing of prisoners is a separate issue and has been addressed by various international human rights bodies and organizations advocating for prisoner welfare, rather than being a standard recommendation from the CDC or WHO.\n\nIt's important to note that public health guidelines and recommendations can evolve rapidly during a pandemic, so it's always best to consult the most recent guidance from these organizations for the latest information."
