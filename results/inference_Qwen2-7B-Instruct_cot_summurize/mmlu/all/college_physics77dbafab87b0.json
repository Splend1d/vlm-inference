They work by using a dye dissolved in a transparent solvent as the active medium, and they can be adjusted to emit light at various wavelengths within the visible range by changing the dye or the solvent. \n\nThe other options have more limited wavelength ranges:\n- B. Helium-neon lasers typically emit around 632.8 nm ( which is in the red part of the visible spectrum.\n- C. Excimer lasers usually operate in the ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet regions, not the visible.\n- D. Ruby lasers emit around 694.3 nm, also in the red part of the visible spectrum.\n\nTherefore, for spectroscopy covering the full visible spectrum, a dye laser would be the most appropriate choice."
