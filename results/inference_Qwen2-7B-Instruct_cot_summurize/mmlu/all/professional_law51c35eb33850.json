At the time that the crime occurred, this jurisdiction required a unanimous verdict of all 12 jury members for a conviction on a capital offense. On November 1, the state legislature enacted a new law requiring a majority vote of seven of 12 jurors to convict on a capital offense. The defendant's trial began on December 1. He was subsequently convicted of murder by an eight- to-four vote. Following the trial, the defendant's attorney filed a motion to set aside the verdict. Which of the following would provide the strongest constitutional grounds to overturn the verdict?\n\nA. The ex post facto clause.\nB. The contracts clause.\nC. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.\n"

                    "text": "The strongest constitutional ground to overturn the verdict in this scenario would be:\n\nC. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe due process clause ensures that legal procedures and actions taken by the government must be fair and just. In this case, the defendant was tried under one standard (requiring a unanimous verdict of all 12 jurors) but was convicted under a new, less stringent standard (requiring only seven jurors to vote guilty. This change in the legal standard after the act was committed could potentially be seen as unfair treatment, violating the principle of predictability and fairness in the application of laws. Therefore, it might argue that the defendant was not given notice of the legal standard he would be judged under, and thus his right to a fair trial was violated.\n\nAdditionally, the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial (D) is also relevant here, particularly the portion concerning the right to a jury trial. It provides that \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\" The change in jury requirement could be seen as affecting the defendant's right to an impartial jury if the jury members were no longer bound by the same standard they agreed upon when they were selected.\n\nThe ex post facto clause (A) deals with retroactive laws that make an act done before the passage of the law illegal or increase punishment for an act that was not illegal when it was committed. While the change in jury requirement may impact the defendant's outcome, it does not directly relate to the ex post facto issue unless it can be argued that the new law made the defendant's actions illegal or increased the penalty after the fact.\n\nThe contracts clause (B) pertains to the federal constitution and applies to state governments through the supremacy clause. It concerns state laws that impair agreements between private parties. This clause is not directly applicable in this context because it deals with the validity of contracts rather than laws and their impact on criminal proceedings."
