The SCNT individual has genetic material primarily from one person instead of two. \n\nIn SCNT ( or Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer, a cell nucleus from a somatic (body) cell is transferred into an enucleated (nucleus-free) egg cell. This results in an embryo that contains three sets of chromosomes: two sets from the egg donor and one set from the body cell donor. However, since one of the egg's nuclei is removed before the transfer, the resulting individual inherits its genetic information predominantly from the body cell donor, making it essentially genetically identical to that single individual. In contrast, individuals produced through normal sexual reproduction inherit genetic material from both parents."
