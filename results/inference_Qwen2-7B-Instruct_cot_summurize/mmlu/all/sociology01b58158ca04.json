It focuses on the functions that social structures and cultural patterns serve for the overall health and continuity of the whole society. According to this perspective, each component of society, such as family, religion, education, economy, and politics, has a specific function that contributes to maintaining social stability and balance. Therefore, structural-functionalists see society as a \"web of interrelated parts\" where each part plays a crucial role in maintaining the equilibrium of the entire system."
