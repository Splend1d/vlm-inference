Therefore, the most accurate statement based on the options provided would be:\n\nB. his argument does not require that marital and political freedom of association be equally important.\n\nThis choice indicates that Wellman's position does not mandate an equal value between marital and political freedoms of association but does not outright deny their equal importance either. It leaves room for the possibility that he might argue for different levels of importance depending on the specific context or criteria he uses in his reasoning."
