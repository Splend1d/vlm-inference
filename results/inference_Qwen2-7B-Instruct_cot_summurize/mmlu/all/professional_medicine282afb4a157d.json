Polymerase chain reaction ( (PCR) on this patient's blood.\n\nPCR is a laboratory technique used to amplify and make copies of specific DNA sequences. It involves heating and cooling repetitive cycles where DNA is denatured, then primers are used to synthesize new DNA strands. In this scenario, the presence of CMV DNA would be detected after the PCR process through gel electrophoresis, which separates DNA fragments based on size. This method allows for the detection and quantification of even small amounts of specific DNA sequences. \n\nOptions A, C, and D describe different techniques:\n\nA. Northern blotting - This technique is used to detect and quantify RNA molecules rather than DNA.\nC. Reverse transcription - This refers to the process of converting RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), which can then be amplified using PCR or subjected to other analyses.\nD. Southern blotting - Similar to Northern blotting, it is used for detecting specific DNA sequences but involves transferring DNA from an agarose gel to a nitrocellulose membrane."
