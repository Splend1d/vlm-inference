Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, telling someone they have something in their teeth with the intention of causing embarrassment can be considered morally wrong. This action is intrusive and disrespectful, not only because it highlights an imperfection but also because the primary motive seems to be causing embarrassment rather than helping the person out of genuine concern.\n\nIn Scenario 2, running a comb through someone's hair (Martha's hair, in this case) is generally not seen as morally wrong, assuming that it was done without causing any harm or distress. It could be part of a normal grooming activity or simply playing with hair, which most people would consider benign and acceptable behavior."
