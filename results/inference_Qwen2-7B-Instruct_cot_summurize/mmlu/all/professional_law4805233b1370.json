One week before the start of the fall term, at a party to celebrate the law student's acceptance to the school, his father announced to the law student, in the presence of the partygoers, \"Son, it's your obligation to uphold the family tradition for excellence at the school. In this regard, if you promise to study a minimum of five hours a day, I shall pay you $1,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your first year; $2,500 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your second year; and $5,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your third year. \"The most accurate statement concerning the father's promise to reward the law student for achieving \"A's\" would be that\n\nA. the promise constituted an unenforceable, conditional gift.\nB. the promise would not be legally binding, since it was non-detrimental.\nC. the promise would be enforceable if a bargained-for exchange was so intended.\nD. the promise constituted a voidable proposal.\n"

The key elements required for a contract to be formed include:\n\n1. Offer: The father's promise to pay money in exchange for the son achieving high grades.\n2. Acceptance: The son's agreement to the terms of the offer.\n3. Consideration: The son's promise to study a minimum number of hours per day and achieve high grades.\n4. Intention to form a contract: Both parties must intend for the agreement to be legally binding.\n\nAssuming all these elements were present, the promise would likely be considered a valid contract, and the father would be legally obligated to pay the agreed-upon sums upon the son achieving the desired grades. However, it is important to note that the enforceability of such agreements may depend on specific legal nuances, such as whether the terms are reasonable, fair, and not against public policy, and whether there are are any additional factors that could affect the validity of the contract."
