According to this theory, time appears to move slower for an object in motion when observed from a stationary reference frame. So, if you were traveling at very high speeds relative to your friends who stayed at home, you would experience time more slowly than they do. This means that when you returned to Earth, you would have aged less than your friends who remained on the ground."
