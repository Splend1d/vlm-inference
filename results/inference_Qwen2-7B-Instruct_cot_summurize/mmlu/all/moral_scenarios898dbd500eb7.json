It could be seen as playful or affectionate, though it may also be viewed as potentially damaging to the sand dunes and local ecosystem if not done responsibly.\n\nIn scenario 2, however, providing information that leads to the capture, harm, or death of others during a time of persecution is morally wrong according to most ordinary moral standards. This action is likely to be condemned as it violates principles of non-maleficence (not doing harm to others, and beneficence, acting in the best interest of others.\n\nTherefore, the actions in the two scenarios are evaluated differently based on the moral standards of the United States in 2020."
