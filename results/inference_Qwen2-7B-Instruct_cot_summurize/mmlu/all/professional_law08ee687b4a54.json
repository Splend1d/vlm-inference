The contract stipulated that no money would be due until the owner's caretaker approved the work done by the painter. The painter completed the painting of all six cottages. Two days after the painter had finished the painting, a wildfire destroyed the six cottages. Although the caretaker had inspected four of the cottages to his approval, he had not inspected the other two cottages prior to their destruction. Which of the following is the LEAST accurate statement with respect to the caretaker's approval of the painting of the cottages?\n\nA. The owner would only be obligated to pay for the painting of the four cottages that the caretaker approved.\nB. The caretaker's approval of the painting of the two cottages destroyed by the wild fire would be excused.\nC. The owner would be obligated to pay for the painting of all of the cottages.\nD. The impossibility of securing the caretaker's approval would render the owner absolutely liable for all of the painting.\n"

The impossibility of securing the caretaker's approval would render the owner absolutely liable for all of the painting.\n\nExplanation:\n- A. This statement could be accurate if the contract explicitly states that payment is conditional upon the caretaker's approval, and only for the cottages approved.\n- B. This statement could also be accurate under certain legal interpretations; the caretaker's failure to approve the work on two cottages does not automatically excuse approval for those specific cottages, especially if the painting was completed as per the contract.\n- C. This statement aligning with the typical interpretation of a contract where payment is usually due upon completion of services, unless there is a clause specifying otherwise.\n- D. This statement is not accurate because the impossibility of securing the caretaker's approval (which is due to the destruction of the cottages by a wildfire beyond the control of either party) would not typically result in absolute liability for all of the painting. Legal principles like force m majeure or frustration of purpose might apply, potentially relieving the owner from the obligation to pay for the destroyed properties' painting, depending on how the contract is structured and interpreted by the courts."
