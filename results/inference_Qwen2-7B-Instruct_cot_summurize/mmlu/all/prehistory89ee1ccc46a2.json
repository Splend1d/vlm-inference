Mohanjo-daro was one of the largest cities of its time, with an estimated population of around 35,000 to 60,000 people. In contrast, some of the larger Mayan city-states, like Tikal or Calakmul, could have populations ranging from several thousand to tens of thousands, but they were typically smaller than Mohanjo-daro. However, it's important to note that the size of Mayan city-states varied greatly depending on the specific city and period."
