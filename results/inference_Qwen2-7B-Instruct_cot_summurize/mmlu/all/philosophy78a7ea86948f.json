According to Bentham, individuals make decisions based on the anticipation of future consequences, which can be understood as a prediction of the amount of pleasure or pain that will result from those actions. Therefore, not only should we do what maximizes overall happiness ( \"what we ought to do\"), but our actual behavior also tends to align with this principle, meaning that we often will do what maximizes happiness ( \"what we will do\"). This perspective underlines the importance of considering the long-term impact of our actions on the well-being of all affected parties."
