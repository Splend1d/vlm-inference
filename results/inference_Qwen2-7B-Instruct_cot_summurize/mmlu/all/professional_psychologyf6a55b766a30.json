This threat occurs when the characteristics of the sample being studied differ significantly from those of the target population, which makes it difficult to generalize the findings of the study to the broader population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The effects of a given treatment would not generalize to other members of the target population\n\nThis happens because if the selection process (i.e., how participants are chosen for the study) biases the sample towards certain characteristics or traits, these characteristics may not be representative of the larger target population. Consequently, any conclusions drawn from the study may not accurately reflect the outcomes for the entire population."
