Both teams were staying at the same hotel. The assistant coach of one of the teams learned that the team captain of the other team was staying in the next room. In order to obtain information about the other team's strategy for the championship game, the assistant coach used electronic devices placed against the wall to listen to and record conversations between the team captain and his teammates. The assistant coach later bragged to others about having eavesdropped on the team captain, and the team captain eventually heard about what the assistant coach had done. If the team captain asserts a claim against the assistant coach for invasion of privacy, will the team captain prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the assistant coach was recording the conversation for the use and advantage of his team.\nB. Yes, because the team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room.\nC. No, because the assistant coach's electronic devices did not physically intrude into the team captain's room.\nD. No, because there was publication of the recorded conversations.\n"

Yes, because the team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room.\n\nInvasion of privacy typically involves unauthorized intrusion into someone's personal space or activities, revealing private information without consent, or using private information in a way that causes harm. The key elements to consider in this scenario would be:\n\n1. **Reasonable Expectation of Privacy**: The team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room, as it is generally understood that guests have a right to privacy in their accommodations.\n\n2. **Unlawful Intrusion**: The assistant coach used electronic devices to listen to conversations through the wall without the team captain's consent, which constitutes an unlawful intrusion into the team captain's private space.\n\n3. **Publication**: Although the assistant coach later braggeded about the eavesdropping to others, this does not necessarily negate the initial act of invasion of privacy. The act of listening in and recording the conversation without permission is sufficient to establish a claim for invasion of privacy.\n\n4. **Intent**: The assistant coach's intent was to gain strategic information for his team, which could be seen as an additional factor in determining liability for invasion of privacy.\n\nTherefore, the team captain would likely prevail in asserting a claim for invasion of privacy based on the facts presented, especially considering the team captain's reasonable expectation of privacy and the unlawful intrusion by the assistant coach."
