Output must have increased.\n\nThe standard of living is typically measured by factors such as income levels, access to goods and services, education, health care, and housing. When the standard of living increases, it usually indicates an improvement in these areas, which is most directly associated with an increase in output (or gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. An increase in population could contribute to changes in the standard of living, but it's not a necessary condition for an increase in the standard of living itself. Similarly, while an increase in both output and population could lead to an increase in the standard of living, it's not a guaranteed outcome; other factors like how resources are are distributed or how productivity changes also play significant roles. Therefore, the most direct conclusion from an increase in the standard of living is that output must have increased."
