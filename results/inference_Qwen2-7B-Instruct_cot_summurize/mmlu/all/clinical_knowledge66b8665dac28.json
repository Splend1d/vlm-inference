None of the above.\n\nGlycogen breakdown in exercising muscle is primarily activated by hormones such as epinephrine (adrenaline) and glucagon, which increase glucose release from the liver and muscle glycogen stores to provide energy for the muscles during exercise. Insulin typically promotes glycogen synthesis and storage, while cortisol increases protein breakdown and fat metabolism, rather than glycogen breakdown directly. Increased pH ( or alkalosis can also inhibit glycogen breakdown."
