These are forests where the trees have leaves that fall off during the winter months, usually in response to colder temperatures and shorter days. The other options don't fit this description:\n\nA. Desert - This biome is characterized by extremely low precipitation, not seasonal leaf loss.\n\nB. Tundra - This is a cold, treeless biome found at high latitudes, where the ground is permanently frozen and vegetation is sparse.\n\nC. Taiga - Also known as boreal forests, these are dominated by evergreen coniferous trees (like pines, spruces, and firs) which keep their needles all year round."
