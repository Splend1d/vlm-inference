The time it takes for one complete high tide and low tide cycle (known as a tidal day or a tidal period, is approximately 12 hours and 25 minutes. This is because the Earth rotates once every 24 hours, and the time it takes for the Moon to move from one high tide to the next relative to the Earth's surface is about 12 hours and 25 minutes due to the Earth's rotation and the Moon's orbit around the Earth.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately represents the average time that passes between high tides events."
