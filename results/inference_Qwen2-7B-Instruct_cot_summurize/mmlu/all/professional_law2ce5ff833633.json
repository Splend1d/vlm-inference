Partners share in proportion to their voting percentage.\n\nThis is because the partnership agreement defines how decisions are are made (based on voting shares), but it does not specify the profit-sharing ratio unless explicitly stated. Without additional agreement on profit sharing, profits are typically shared according to the terms agreed upon, which in this case seems to be based on the voting percentages. \n\nHowever, please note that in the absence of an agreement, state laws usually provide default rules for profit sharing among partners, which might differ from what is described here. Always consult legal advice for specific scenarios."
