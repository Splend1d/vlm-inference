O(N^2)\n\nIn the case of k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, when we want to classify a new data point, we need to compute the distance between this new point and every single point in the training set. Hence, the computational complexity for classifying one instance is O(N), where N is the number of instances in the training dataset.\n\nHowever, since we perform this operation once for each prediction we make, if our model makes 'm' predictions, the total computational complexity becomes O(mN). \n\nTherefore, the overall time complexity of the k-NN algorithm can be considered as O(N^2) when the number of predictions (m' is equal to the number of instances N in the training set ( i.e., when we are predicting labels for all instances in the training set. \n\nPlease note that the actual complexity can vary depending on implementation details and optimizations like using data structures like KD-trees or Ball trees to speed up the search for nearest neighbors."
