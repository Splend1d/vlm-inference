The complete resynthesis of PCr from phosphomyzoin (PMI (the byproduct of ATP breakdown) and creatine phosphate typically occurs within about 30 seconds under normal physiological conditions. This process is crucial for maintaining high-intensity activities that last up to about 10 seconds or less."
