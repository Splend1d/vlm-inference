The detectives then submitted an affidavit to a neutral magistrate setting forth sufficient underlying circumstances for the issuance of a search warrant. Making a determination of probable cause, the magistrate issued a warrant for the x-brand stereo at the homeowner's address. The police arrived at the homeowner's dwelling, showed him the warrant, and came inside. In the living room, they noticed a y-brand stereo, which had the serial number removed. Upon further inspection, the police determined that the stereo had been stolen from a local electronics store during a recent burglary. Thereupon, the police placed the homeowner under arrest and instructed him to remain seated in the living room while they searched the rest of the home. One of the officers proceeded to the basement where she found the stolen x-brand stereo. She then decided to search the upstairs and came upon a stolen z-brand stereo in the homeowner's second-floor bedroom. The homeowner was subsequently prosecuted for receiving stolen property. At trial, the homeowner moves to prevent introduction of the stereos into evidence. His motion should be granted with respect to\n\nA. the y-brand stereo.\nB. the z-brand stereo.\nC. the y-brand and the z-brand stereos.\nD. none of the stereos.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. the y-brand stereo.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures, and this protection extends to the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence. For evidence to be admissible in court, it must be obtained through lawful means. If the police exceed the scope of the search warrant, any evidence seized as a result of that overreach may be excluded from evidence under the doctrine of \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the search warrant was specifically for the x-brand stereo. When the police entered the house and found the y-brand stereo with its serial number removed, they did not have probable cause to seize this item based on the warrant. Therefore, any evidence obtained regarding the y-brand stereo (such as the fact that its serial number was removed or that it was later determined to be stolen\u2014would likely be considered the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" and thus potentially subject to exclusion under the exclusionary rule.\n\nThe search of the basement leading to the discovery of the x-brand stereo and the search of the upstairs resulting in the discovery of the z-brand stereo occurred after the y-brand stereo was found. The legality of these subsequent searches would depend on whether the police had additional probable cause to search those areas beyond the original warrant. If there was no additional probable cause, then the evidence obtained from those searches might also be subject to exclusion.\n\nHowever, without more specific details about the circumstances and actions of the police between finding the y-brand stereo and searching the rest of the house, we cannot definitively conclude that the searches for the x-brand and z-brand stereos were unlawful. Typically, if the police have a valid reason to continue searching the premises based on their observations or new information gained lawfully, such as the discovery of stolen items, they may have probable cause to search further. \n\nGiven the information provided, the only part of the evidence whose admissibility is clearly questionable is the y-brand stereo, since it was found outside the scope of the original warrant. Therefore, the motion to exclude the y-brand stereo should be granted, but without more context, the motion for the z-brand stereo cannot be assessed with certainty. Thus, the most appropriate choice is A. the y-brand stereo."
