A female with color blindness must have inherited the defective gene from both her mother and father (since she has two X chromosomes, each could carry the gene for color blindness. Her sons, however, only receive one X chromosome from their mothers, so if they inherit the defective gene, they will express color blindness.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman herself displays normal color vision because she likely has a dominant gene on one of her X chromosomes that masks the effect of the recessive color blindness gene on the other X chromosome. Therefore, the defect that is transmitted to her son represents a characteristic of her genotype, which is the complete set of genes in an organism."
