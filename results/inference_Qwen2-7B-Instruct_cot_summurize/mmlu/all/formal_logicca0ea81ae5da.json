The sentence \"The restaurant serves pie or cheesecake or ice cream for dessert\" can be broken down into three separate propositions: \n\n- P: The restaurant serves pie\n- C: The restaurant serves cheesecake\n- I: The restaurant serves ice cream\n\nSince the sentence states that any one of these three propositions could be true (i.e., the restaurant serves either pie, cheesecake, or ice cream as dessert, we would use the logical operator \u2228 to connect these propositions. \n\nOption C, P \u2228 C \u2228 I, correctly represents this meaning by including each proposition individually and using the \u2228 operator to show that any one of them could be true. \n\nOption A, P \u2228 (C \u2228 I, incorrectly includes an unnecessary space before \"C,\" which would not be valid syntax in propositional logic. \n\nOption B, (P \u2228 C) \u2228 I, incorrectly groups the first two propositions together with parentheses, which changes the intended meaning from \"any one of the three\" to \"either (the restaurant serves pie or cheesecake, or the restaurant serves ice cream.\"\n\nTherefore, option C is the best symbolization of the given sentence in propositional logic."
