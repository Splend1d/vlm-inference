It's a common practice, especially if the teacher is staying hydrated to maintain their energy and focus during the lesson.\n\nScenario 2: Including secret ingredients like cinnamon and ginger in cakes is also not morally wrong. This is a creative culinary choice that could potentially enhance the flavor of the cakes without causing any harm or being being dishonest about the ingredients used."
