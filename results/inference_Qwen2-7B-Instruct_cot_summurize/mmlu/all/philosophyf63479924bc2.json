A person who is by nature envious and ungenerous: This person's disposition towards envy and generosity might be seen as a result of their upbringing, genetics, or other factors beyond their control. If they act on these dispositions in a way that causes harm to others, it might seem unfair to hold them fully morally responsible for actions that stem from their inherent character traits.\n\nB. A person who lived in Nazi Germany in 1940: The historical context of living during the Nazi regime significantly impacts an individual's moral agency. Many people were coerced into participating in immoral acts due to societal pressure and fear of repercussions. Their moral responsibility for these actions could be questioned, given the systemic moral corruption and coercion they faced.\n\nC. A person who drives drunk and hits a child: This scenario involves a clear violation of moral norms and laws. While driving under the influence is a choice, the unpredictable consequences (such as hitting a child, can be seen as constitutive moral luck because the severity of the outcome is not solely within the driver's control. The randomness of such an accident does not diminish the moral wrongness of driving while intoxicated but complicates attributing full blame to the individual.\n\nIn each case, the individuals face circumstances where their moral responsibility is complicated by factors beyond their direct control, which is a hallmark of constitutive moral luck."
