On the one hand, naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope and on the other hand, positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires\nB. While naturalism serves only the theory human rights law, positivism has a wider and more general scope\nC. Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such\nD. Naturalism is a school of thought advocated outside of Europe, while positivism is Euro-centric theory\n"

Naturalism concerns the underlying values of the international society, while positivism is concerned with the international rules as such.\n\nNaturalism in international law refers to the idea that the rules of international law are grounded in the moral or ethical values that are widely accepted within the international community. It focuses on what is considered right or just according to the prevailing moral standards of the global community.\n\nPositivism, on the other hand, is an approach to international law that emphasizes the legal rules and norms that are formally recognized and applied by states. According to positivism, the validity of international law does not depend on its moral content but rather on whether it is part of a legal system that states have agreed upon. This approach tends to focus on the formal existence of rules, their sources ( like treaties or custom, and their application through state practice and international adjudication.\n\nTherefore, while both approaches recognize the importance of international law, they differ fundamentally in their understanding of what constitutes the basis for international legal rules: values and ethics for naturalism versus formal legal rules for positivism."
