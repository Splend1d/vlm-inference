                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The water potential of the pure water is positive.\n\nWater potential ((\\( \\Phi_w \\)) is a measure that combines the pressure potential, concentration potential, and gravitational potential in a fluid. In pure water at standard conditions, there is no solute to create a concentration gradient, and there is no net change in elevation, so the pressure potential (\\( \\Phi_p \\)) is zero. Thus, the water potential is primarily determined by the osmotic potential (\\( \\Phi_m \\)), which for pure water is positive because it can absorb water from its surroundings without any solutes to balance out the potential.\n\nWhen the potato, which has a higher solute concentration inside than the surrounding water, is dropped into the beaker, it will initially cause water to move out of the potato cells due to osmosis, increasing the water potential inside the potato until equilibrium is reached. However, this scenario is not directly asked in the question about the initial condition of the water.\n\nThe options given are focus on describing the water potential at the point of contact between the potato and the water. Since the potato does not have an osmotic potential ((\\( \\Phi_m \\)) in the context of pure water, and considering that water potential is generally discussed in terms of bulk solutions, the relevant statement would be that the water potential of the pure water is positive, assuming standard conditions."
