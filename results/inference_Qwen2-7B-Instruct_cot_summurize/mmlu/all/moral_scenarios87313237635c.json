Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: Smoking is generally considered harmful and blowing smoke away from a child can be seen as irresponsible because it might not completely eliminate the secondhand smoke, potentially exposing the child to health risks. This action could be viewed as morally wrong due to the potential harm to the child's health.\n\nOn the other hand, passionately kissing one's own biological son in the living room is an intimate act that typically occurs between people in romantic or sexual relationships, not between parent and child. Unless there are specific circumstances (like a mental health condition or abuse), this scenario does not appear to involve a clear violation of moral standards, especially considering it is a private family interaction. Therefore, it would not be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
