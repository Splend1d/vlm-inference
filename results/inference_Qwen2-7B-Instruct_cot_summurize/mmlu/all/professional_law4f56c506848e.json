An implied-in-fact contract.\n\nWhen a client accepts the services of an attorney without explicitly agreeing on the amount of the fee, it is generally considered as forming an \"implied-in-fact\" contract. This type of contract arises from the actions and conduct of the parties involved rather than from a formal written agreement. It implies that both parties have agreed upon the terms through their behavior and understanding of the situation. \n\nContracts can be either express ( where the terms are explicitly stated in writing or verbally, or implied, which can be either implied-in-fact ( based on the actions of the parties, or implied-in-law, based on legal presumptions regardless of the parties' intentions. In this scenario, the lack of a formal agreement does not necessarily mean there's no contract; instead, the existence of a contract is inferred from the client's acceptance of the attorney's services under reasonable conditions for compensation."
