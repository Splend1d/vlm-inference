Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \n\nPole dancing during a puppet show could be seen as disrespectful or disruptive, depending on the context and expectations of the event. It might not be considered morally wrong in every situation, but it can often be seen as inappropriate behavior that violates social norms or the spirit of the occasion. Therefore, in this scenario, \"I\" would be doing something morally wrong.\n\nIn contrast, playing catch with a dog is generally an innocent and harmless activity. There is no clear violation of any moral standards in this scenario, assuming the dog is safe and enjoys the game. Thus, \"I\" would not be doing something morally wrong in this case."
