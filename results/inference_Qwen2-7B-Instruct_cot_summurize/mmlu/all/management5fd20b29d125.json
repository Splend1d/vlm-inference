A theoretical model\n\nA paradigm is a set of theories, research principles, or practice guidelines that scientists or scholars use to organize and interpret their work. It often includes assumptions about how the world works and what methods are most appropriate for studying it. The term was famously used by philosopher Thomas Kuhn in his 1962 book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\" where he explained how scientific communities adopt and adhere to certain paradigms until they are challenged by new evidence or theories, leading to a paradigm shift."
