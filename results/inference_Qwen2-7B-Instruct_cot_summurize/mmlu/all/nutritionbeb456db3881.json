It is the only way to ensure results are applicable to people\n\nThe reason for using higher doses in animal toxicity studies compared to what humans might experience is to ensure that any adverse effects detected in the animals will also likely occur in humans at lower, more realistic exposure levels. This approach helps in identifying potential safety issues before a substance or drug reaches human use. However, it's important to note that while animal models can provide valuable insights, they may not always perfectly predict human responses due to differences between species. This is why there's ongoing effort to refine and improve these studies."
