It also allows for timely adjustments in dosing or medication choice if needed, based on the patient's individual response to treatment.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific details of this strategy should be tailored to each patient's condition, medical history, and the type of surgery they have undergone. This may involve working closely with an anesthesiologist or pain management specialist who can provide guidance on the most appropriate medications, dosages, and schedules. Additionally, patient education on how to recognize and report pain effectively is crucial to ensure optimal pain control and prevent under-treatment."
