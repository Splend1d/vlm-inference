In the United States as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Bringing a 13-year-old son to a show featuring exotic dancers could be considered morally questionable. While the legality of such shows can vary by location, and parental discretion plays a role, the concern often revolves around the potential exposure to adult content that might not be suitable for a minor or could influence their development in inappropriate ways.\n\nScenario 2: Going fishing for dolphins is generally considered morally wrong, especially if it involves hunting dolphins for sport or commercial purposes. This activity is often criticized due to the ethical treatment of marine life and conservation concerns. Hunting dolphins can lead to significant ecological damage and is often illegal in many jurisdictions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nB. Wrong, Wrong"
