Screaming and yelling while riding a roller coaster is generally not considered morally wrong unless it directly harms others (for example, by causing distress to those around you or disrupting the safety protocols of the ride. However, this could depend on specific circumstances, such as if it causes a commotion that leads to a safety issue."
