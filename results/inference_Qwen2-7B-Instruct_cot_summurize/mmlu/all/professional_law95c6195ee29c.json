                    "text": "A state highway runs through the center of a city's business district. As the highway passes through this business district, there is a stretch where the highway is too narrow to satisfS' the safety standards for state roadways. Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking. As a consequence, the owner of the lounge brought suit for declarative relief against the city alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional. In all likelihood, will the plaintiff be successful in this cause of action?\n\nA. No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment.\nB. No, because the city's action was reasonable.\nC. Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. Yes, because responsible government officials cannot conduct or formulate their decisionmaking processes by means of coin flips.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is **C. Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment**.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states (and, by extension, local municipalities like cities, from denying any person within its jurisdiction \"the equal protection of the laws.\" In this case, the city's decision to prohibit parking on one side of the street but not the other appears to be arbitrary and lacks a rational basis, which is required for such distinctions to be constitutional.\n\nThe fact that the city council used a coin flip to decide which side to ban parking does not automatically make the decision unconstitutional, but it does suggest that the decision lacked thoughtful consideration and was not based on a legitimate policy rationale. The arbitrary nature of the decision, combined with the discriminatory impact on the lounge owner, raises serious questions about whether the city's action was motivated by irrationality or discrimination, both of which would violate the equal protection clause.\n\nThe Eleventh Amendment generally protects states from being sued in federal court by private individuals, but this does not apply here since the city is not being sued by another state. Moreover, the claim is not against the state as a sovereign entity but rather against a municipal government, which may have different legal protections.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff has a strong argument that the city's action violated the equal protection clause, making option C the most likely correct answer."
