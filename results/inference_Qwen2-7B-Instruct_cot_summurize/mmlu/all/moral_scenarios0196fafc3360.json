While it might be seen as cheating in some contexts, especially if it gives unfair advantage or is considered unsportsmanlike, it is not illegal or inherently unethical unless there are specific rules against such actions in the particular game or setting being played. The act of having an ace up one's sleeve does not harm others and does not violate any moral principles."
