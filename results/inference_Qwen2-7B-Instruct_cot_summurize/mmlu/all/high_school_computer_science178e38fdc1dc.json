Every time the computer-controlled player has a turn, the game runs slowly because the computer evaluates all potential moves and selects the best one. Which of the following best describes the possibility of improving the running speed of the game?\n\nA. The game's running speed can only be improved if the game is played between two human players instead of with the computer-controlled player.\nB. The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn.\nC. The game's running speed cannot be improved because computers can only be programmed to find the best possible solution.\nD. The game's running speed cannot be improved because the game is an example of an algorithm that does not run in a reasonable time.\n"

The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn.\n\nExplanation: In many games, especially those involving AI opponents, the AI may use algorithms like minimax or alpha-beta pruning to evaluate potential moves. These algorithms are designed to find the best move by exploring the game tree, but they can be computationally expensive, especially as the depth of the tree increases. One way to improve the running speed of such games is by using heuristic evaluations or approximations to reduce the number of nodes explored without significantly compromising the quality of the move. This approach trades off optimality for computational efficiency. Therefore, option B suggests a feasible method to enhance the game's performance by finding good-enough solutions rather than the absolute best one, which can be much faster."
