These principles often imply certain obligations on states during negotiations. Among the options provided, option B comes closest to reflecting a principle that is generally recognized:\n\nB. States are under an obligation so to conduct themselves that the negotiations are meaningful.\n\nThis implies that states have an obligation to engage in negotiations in good faith, which means they must be sincere in their efforts to reach an agreement. This principle is derived from the general duty of states to respect international treaties and agreements once they enter into them. The concept of good faith also extends to the negotiation process itself, where states are expected to act in a manner conducive to achieving a successful outcome.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there isn't a specific, widely accepted \"obligation\" that all states must adhere to when conducting negotiations as described in the other options. The United Nations Charter does not explicitly mandate that states inform the Secretary-General about the progress of their negotiations. Moreover, while states do have an obligation to resolve disputes peacefully (as per Article 33 of the United Nations Charter, this does not necessarily translate into an obligation to find a solution through direct negotiations alone. \n\nIn practice, states may agree to additional obligations in bilateral or multilateral agreements, but these would be negotiated and agreed upon specifically within those contexts."
