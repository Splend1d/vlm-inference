                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n### Statement I: If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then U = M(V).\n\n**Explanation:** If T has a basis consisting entirely of eigenvectors, it means that T is a diagonalizable matrix. For any matrix X in M(V), if T commutes with X (i.e., TX = XT), this implies that X must also be a matrix that respects the same eigenspace structure as T, since T's action on any vector in its eigenspace is simply scaling by an eigenvalue. However, not all matrices in M(V) commute with T; for instance, a permutation matrix (which does not preserve the eigenspace structure unless it is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix) would not commute with a non-diagonalizable or non-scalar T. Therefore, U being equal to M(V) is not necessarily true.\n\n### Statement II: dim(U) + dim(W) = n^2\n\n**Explanation:** The dimension of M(V) is n^2 since it consists of all n x n matrices. The subspace U consists of matrices that commute with T. By the Schur decomposition theorem, every square matrix T can be put into an upper triangular form via similarity transformations. This implies that U contains at least the set of all diagonal matrices, which has dimension n ( (since there are n independent diagonal entries). The subspace W consists of matrices that are the difference between a matrix and its transpose (TX - XT). It turns out that U and W are orthogonal complements under the trace inner product, meaning every element of M(V) can be uniquely decomposed into an element of U plus an element of W. Therefore, the dimensions of U and W add up to the dimension of M(V), which is n^2.\n\n### Statement III: dim(U) < n\n\n**Explanation:** As explained in the analysis of Statement I, not all matrices in M(V) commute with T, especially if T is not a diagonal matrix. Thus, the dimension of U cannot exceed the dimension of M(V), which is n^2. However, it can be less than n if T is not diagonalizable over the real numbers. For example, if T is not diagonalizable, the dimension of U will be less than n because U includes only those matrices that commute with T, and not all matrices do.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the above analysis, **Statement II** is always true based on the properties of U and W being complementary subspaces of M(V), and **Statement III** might not be universally true depending on the specific properties of T. **Statement I** is not necessarily true based on the condition provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. II only**."
