Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated.

The examination findings of no obstructed labor, the fetal head being engaged, intact membranes, normal fetal heart tones, and complete effacement and dilation of the cervix to 7 cm all indicate that augmentation of labor might be necessary.\n\nOxytocin is commonly used to augment labor by stimulating stronger, more frequent contractions when natural labor progression is slow or delayed. This can help to progress the labor and potentially reduce the risk of complications associated with prolonged labor, such as uterine fatigue, infection, and fetal distress.\n\nOptions A ( administering an epidural anesthetic, B to administer tocolytic therapy, and C applying cervical topical corticosteroids do not directly address the issue of labor progression and are typically used for different indications: pain relief during labor, treatment of preterm labor, and reducing lung inflammation in premature infants, respectively."
