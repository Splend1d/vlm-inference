                    "text": "Grand Strategy of Offshore Balancing is a policy that advocates for the United States to avoid overcommitment in foreign affairs by maintaining a strong military presence in its immediate neighborhood while relying on local powers to manage regional conflicts. This approach was notably advocated by Graham Allison and Stephen M. Walt in their book \"GREAT POWER TRANSITIONS: HISTORICAL LESSONS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY\".\n\nHere's how each option fits into this concept:\n\nA. Maintaining a balance between the United States and other countries and not entering into alliances alignss with the Offshore Balancing philosophy. It suggests a strategic focus on key regions rather than global engagement, and it might involve forming selective alliances or partnerships that serve American interests without the need for extensive overseas commitments.\n\nB. Investing equally in domestic and international security and balancing threats domestically and internationally doesn't necessarily fit the Offshore Balancing strategy. This approach would likely require more global engagement, as it implies a similar level of commitment both domestically and abroad, which is counter to the idea of reducing overseas involvement.\n\nC. Embrace multi-polarity, show greater restraint internationally, and require other states to meet their own security burdens is very much in line with Offshore Balancing. It encourages the U.S. to maintain a strong position in its region but to rely on local powers to handle regional issues. It promotes a more restrained foreign policy and emphasizes the importance of balancing power through local actors rather than through direct American intervention.\n\nD. Isolating the US from the international system and not seeking global power is contrary to the principles of Offshore Balancing. This option suggests withdrawal from global affairs, which goes against the strategy's aim to engage strategically in key regions while minimizing broader international commitments.\n\nIn summary, among these options, C (Embrace multi-polarity, show greater restraint internationally, and require other states to meet their own security burdens, best represents the core principles of a grand strategy of Offshore Balancing."
