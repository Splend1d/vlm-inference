After missing two practices, the football player was dropped from the team by the head football coach. Following his dismissal, the football player met with the coach and asked if he could rejoin the team. The coach said that the football player was despised by the other players and under no circumstances could he return to the team. As the football player was leaving the coach's office, feeling very dejected, the coach then said to him, \"Hope you decide to transfer, because everybody hates your guts around here. \"Later that same evening, the football player wrote a suicide note in which he stated, \"The coach is responsible for my despondency. If I can't play football, I don't want to live. \" After swallowing a bottle of Quaalude barbiturates, the football player fell unconscious in his dormitory room. Moments later, the football player's roommate entered the room and saw his limp body on the floor. The roommate read the suicide note and then attempted to administer aid. Failing to revive him, the roommate picked up the football player and carried him to the college's first aid center. The football player received prompt medical attention and soon recovered from his drug overdose. If the football player asserts a claim against the coach based on intentional infliction of emotional distress, the football player will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the coach intended to cause him to suffer emotional distress.\nB. prevail, because the coach's remark did, in fact, cause the football player to suffer emotional distress.\nC. not prevail, because the football player's drug overdose resulted from his own voluntary act.\nD. not prevail, because the coach acted reasonably under the circumstances, since everyone on the team hated the football player.\n"

The fact that the coach's remark may have contributed to the football player's emotional state does not necessarily mean that the coach acted intentionally and outrageously enough to meet the legal standard for this tort. \n\nIn this case, the key factor that would likely prevent the football player from prevailing is the voluntary act of taking the drugs ( - the suicide attempt. Even if the coach's words were part of the sequence of events leading to the football player's decision to take the drugs, the act itself was self-induced. This means the football player voluntarily chose to take the drug, which directly led to the injury ( (the overdose). Therefore, the football player would need to argue that the coach's actions were so extreme as to be considered a substantial factor in causing the suicide attempt, which might be a difficult argument to make given that the football player took the initiative to attempt suicide.\n\nMoreover, the coach's statement might not rise to the level of outrageousness required for an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Coaches's comments during tense situations are not uncommon in sports, and they might not necessarily be considered \"outrageous\" under the law unless they are exceptionally cruel, persistent, or involve a serious threat of physical harm. Without more evidence suggesting the coach's conduct was exceptionally egregious, it is unlikely that the football player could successfully argue that the coach's words were the sole or primary cause of the emotional distress leading to the suicide attempt."
