Although the co-defendants had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, neither did so. Instead, they climbed into the truck and fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames.

In this case, the co-defendants entered the warehouse with the intent to steal appliances (which is larceny. However, they also committed arson by starting a fire after throwing their cigarette butt into the refuse pile. Therefore, they would be guilty of both burglary and arson.\n\nLarceny refers to the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property, which occurred when they loaded the appliances onto their truck. However, since there was an additional act of arson, it does not fall under the category of larceny alone.\n\nOption B ( larceny and arson, is incorrect because although they intended to commit larceny, the act of arson was also committed.\n\nOption C, larceny only, is incorrect because the arson charge applies as well.\n\nOption D, burglary, larceny, and arson, is incorrect because while they committed all three offenses, the burglary and larceny charges are combined under the broader charge of burglary, making it redundant to list burglary twice."
