Sales journal to the shipping documents.\n\nWhen an auditor aims to detect overstatement of sales, they would start by tracing transactions from the Sales journal to the shipping documents. This process helps ensure that all sales recorded in the Sales journal have actually occurred and that the goods or services were delivered to customers as documented in the shipping records. By comparing the sales entries with the corresponding shipping documents, the auditor can verify the completeness and accuracy of the sales transactions, thereby detecting any potential overstatement of sales revenue."
