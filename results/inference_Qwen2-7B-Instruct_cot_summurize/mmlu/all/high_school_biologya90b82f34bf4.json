Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population. \n\nWhile mutations do contribute to genetic variation, they are not considered the main source of variation in a population. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection primarily attributes variation to genetic differences that can arise from various sources including mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and sexual reproduction. The main drivers of evolutionary change according to Darwin are natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow."
