This is because the primary concern in such scenarios is the immediate and dire suffering of individuals, which needs to be alleviateded without delay. Thus, his stance would most closely align with option A: \"this has empirically been shown to be false.\" He would argue that addressing famine does not necessarily lead to overpopulation, and that saving lives takes precedence over potential future demographic consequences.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Singer's views on population ethics can be complex. In his book \"Writings on an Unjust World,\" he discusses the concept of population ethics and suggests that population size might be relevant when considering environmental sustainability and resource allocation, especially in contexts where resources are scarce and the quality of life for all individuals cannot be guaranteed. However, in the context of famine relief, his focus would likely remain on the immediate humanitarian need rather than long-term population dynamics.\n\nTherefore, while option A directly addresses the counterargument that famine relief leads to overpopulation, options B, C, and D do not fully capture Singer's approach to these issues. Singer would advocate for action based on ethical principles of fairness and minimizing suffering, rather than being swayed by speculative concerns about future population growth or its implications."
