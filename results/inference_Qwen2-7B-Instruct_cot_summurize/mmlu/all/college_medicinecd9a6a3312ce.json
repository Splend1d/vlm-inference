This gradient powers the enzyme ATP synthase to produce ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi).\n\nThe amount of ATP produced by one molecule of FADH2 or NADH is not directly proportional to the number given in the options but depends on the efficiency of the electron transport chain and the coupling between the electron transport and the proton pump. Typically, one molecule of NADH produces approximately 2-3 ATP, while one molecule of FADH2 produces about 1.5 ATP under optimal conditions. Therefore, considering the combined contribution of FADH2 and NADH, the total ATP production would be around 3-4 ATP. \n\nHowever, based strictly on the options provided, the closest accurate answer is D. 3 ATP, acknowledging that the actual range might be slightly higher."
