The short-run Phillips curve is downward sloping, indicating that there is an inverse relationship between the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation: as unemployment decreases below a natural rate, inflation tends to increase. This is because lower unemployment can lead to increased wage demands and higher costs for businesses, which can then pass on these costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nIn contrast, the long-run Phillips curve is vertical, representing the natural rate of unemployment. This curve indicates that in the long run, any attempt to reduce unemployment below its natural level will not decrease inflation but will instead lead to persistent inflation. This is because, in the long run, the economy adjusts, and expectations about future inflation adjust accordingly, so that reducing unemployment does not lead to higher inflationary pressures."
