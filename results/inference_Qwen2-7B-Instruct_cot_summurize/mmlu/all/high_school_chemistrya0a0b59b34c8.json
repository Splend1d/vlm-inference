Protons and neutrons are both subatomic particles found in the nucleus of an atom, and they are much heavier than electrons. \n\n- Protons have a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu).\n- Neutrons also have a mass of approximately 1 amu.\n- Electrons have a mass of about 1/1836 of a proton or neutron, which is roughly 0.000549 atomic mass units.\n\nGiven these facts:\n\n- The mass contributed by the protons and neutrons together is significantly more than the mass contributed by the electrons.\n- The total mass of the atom is largely determined by the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\n- Since electrons contribute a negligible amount to the overall mass of an atom, less than 1/1000 of the mass of any atom is indeed contributed by the electrons."
