Exposure to various environmental factors such as war, natural disasters, and hunger during a parent's lifetime can lead to changes in their health, which may then affect their offspring in different ways. For example, studies have shown that stress experienced by parents during critical periods of development can have lasting effects on their children's health and development. These effects can be biological, psychological, or behavioral, and they might not be immediately apparent but could manifest over time or across generations."
