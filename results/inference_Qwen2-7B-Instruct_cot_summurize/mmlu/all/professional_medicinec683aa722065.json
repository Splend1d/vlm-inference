She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\nA. Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\nB. Complication of the IVC filter placement\nC. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\nD. Hematoma of the left thigh\n"

Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n\nThe patient's history of a pulmonary embolism, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and anticoagulant therapy discontinuation, along with the subsequent hematoma and IVC filter placement, suggests that she may have been at risk for various complications. Given her symptoms of tingling and numbness in her left thigh, which improved slightly over time, it is plausible that compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve could be the cause.\n\nThe lateral femoral cutaneous nerve originates from the lumbar plexus and runs down the lateral side of the thigh before innervating the skin over the lateral aspect of the thigh. Compression or irritation of this nerve can result in sensory loss in the distribution of the nerve, manifesting as numbness or tingling sensations in that area. The fact that the symptoms have improved somewhat over the past week also supports the possibility of a transient compression or irritation of the nerve rather than a more serious underlying condition like a cerebral infarction or complication of IVC filter placement."
