In Pavlov's experiment, after being conditioned to salivate at the sound of a specific bell, the dogs started to salivate at other sounds that were similar to the bell, like a doorbell or a water glass clinking. This shows that the dogs generalized their learned response to a new, but similar, stimulus."
