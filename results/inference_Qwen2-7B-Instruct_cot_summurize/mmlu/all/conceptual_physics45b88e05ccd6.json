The total resistance in the circuit increases as more lamps are added because each additional lamp adds its own resistance to the circuit. According to Ohm's Law (V=IR (where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance), if the voltage remains constant and the resistance increases, the current must decrease to maintain the equation."
