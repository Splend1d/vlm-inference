Demonstrating appropriate behavior by example.\n\nAccording to the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), leadership's role in setting the tone at the top is crucial for fostering an ethical culture within an organization. By demonstrating ethical behavior themselves, leaders can effectively communicate the importance of integrity and ethical conduct, influencing employees to follow suit. This approach alignes with COSO's framework on internal control, which emphasizes the importance of ethical values and leadership commitment in creating an environment that supports ethical behavior and responsible management practices."
