Correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line.**\n\nExplanation:\n- **A** is incorrect because while the correlation coefficient can range from -1 to 1, indicating the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, the slope of the regression line depends on the actual values of the variables and not just their direction (positive or negative. A positive correlation coefficient does not necessarily imply a positive slope, but rather that both variables increase together.\n- **B** is incorrect because a correlation of 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship, but it does not imply causation. Correlation measures only association, not causality.\n- **C** is correct. Both +0.87 and -0.87 indicate strong linear relationships. The sign (+ or -) indicates the direction of the relationship, not its strength. Thus, both correlations indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line.\n- **D** is incorrect because correlation is specifically designed for quantitative data, where the values are measured on a numerical scale. It is not applicable to categorical data, which involves classification into categories or groups."
