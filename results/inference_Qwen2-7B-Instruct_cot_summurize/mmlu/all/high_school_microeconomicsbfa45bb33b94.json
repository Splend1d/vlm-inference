For instance, education can lead to a more informed and skilled workforce, which benefits society as a whole.\n\nIn a free market, the decision to produce or consume a good is based on the marginal private benefit (to the individual) versus the marginal private cost. However, this does not account for the marginal social benefit (the total benefit to society) or the marginal social cost (the total cost to society). Since the marginal social benefit is greater than the marginal social cost in cases of positive externalities, the market quantity produced will be less than the socially optimal quantity. This results in an underproduction of the good, leading to a market failure where the efficient allocation of resources is not achieved."
