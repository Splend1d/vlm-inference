The value of \u0394S\u00b0 being greater than zero indicates that the entropy (a measure of disorder or randomness in a system) of the system is increasing, which is often associated with spontaneous reactions. \n\nTo clarify why the other options are not correct:\n- A. At equilibrium, the number of products and reactants is equal, not necessarily that there are more products than reactants.\n- B. The value of \u0394G\u00b0 being greater than zero indicates the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions.\n- D. The value of Keq being less than one suggests that the reaction favors reactants, but this does not necessarily indicate spontaneity; it depends on whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic."
