In his work, he often argues against pro-censorship positions based on expressive harm. Expressive harm occurs when someone's ability to express themselves is restricted or harmed by others' actions. Altman believes that defending censorship solely based on claims of expressive harm faces significant difficulties because it can be difficult to prove that the harm being claimed is actual, substantial, and not just hypothetical or speculative. Moreover, such an argument might not adequately address other forms of harm, such as physical harm or causal harm, which are may be more concrete and directly justifiable grounds for limiting certain expressions."
