While it's correct that for a neutral atom, the number of protons (which determines the atomic number and hence the element, must be equal to the number of electrons to ensure electrical neutrality, the number of neutrons can vary significantly. This variation in the number of neutrons among atoms of the same element gives rise to different isotopes of that element. Isotopes have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons."
