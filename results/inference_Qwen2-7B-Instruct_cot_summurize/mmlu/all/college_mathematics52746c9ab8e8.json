Since the cone has a constant slope, the ratio of the radius to the height will be the same for both the full cone and the water-filled cone:\n\nr/h = 1/2 => r = h/2\n\nNow, substitute r = h/2 into the volume formula:\n\nV = (\u03c0/3)*(h/2)\u00b2*h = \u03c0/3*(h\u00b3/4)\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/3*3*h\u00b2*(dh/dt) = \u03c0*h\u00b2*(dh/dt)\n\nWe're given dV/dt = -3 cm\u00b3/min, so plug this value into the equation:\n\n-3 = \u03c0*h\u00b2*(dh/dt)\n\nWe want to find dh/dt when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone, meaning the height of the water is:\n\nh_water = 2 cm - 0.5 cm = 1.5 cm\n\nPlug this value into the equation:\n\n-3 = \u03c0*(1.5)\u00b2*(dh/dt)\n\nSolve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = -3 / (\u03c0*(1.5)\u00b2 = -3 / (\u03c0*2.25 = -4 / (3\u03c0 cm/min\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. \u22124/(3\u03c0) cm/min."
