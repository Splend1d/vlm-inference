Both.\n\nIn the Expectation (Step, we compute the expected value of the log-likelihood function with respect to the posterior distribution of the latent variables given the observed data and the current estimate of the parameters. In the Maximization Step, we update the parameters to maximize this expected log-likelihood.\n\nTo switch from finding Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimates to Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimates, we need to modify both steps:\n\n1. **Expectation Step**: Instead of computing the expectation with respect to the posterior distribution of the latent variables, we would compute the expectation with respect to the posterior distribution multiplied by a prior distribution on the parameters. This means that each term in the expectation involves not just the probability of the latent variables given the data and parameters, but also the probability of the parameters given some prior knowledge.\n\n2. **Maximization Step**: The objective function to be maximized now includes a term for the prior distribution on the parameters. So, when updating the parameters, we would take into account both the likelihood of the data and the prior probabilities of the parameters.\n\nTherefore, modifying both the Expectation and Maximization steps is necessary to change the EM algorithm from finding ML estimates to finding MAP estimates."
