This approach stresses the importance of recognizing and incorporating each client's unique cultural background, experiences, and meanings into the therapeutic process. It encourages counselors to learn from and with their clients about their specific cultural contexts, rather than imposing an external or etic ( \"from without\") perspective. This can help in providing more culturally responsive and effective counseling services."
