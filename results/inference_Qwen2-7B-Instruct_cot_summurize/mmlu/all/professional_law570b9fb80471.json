Lot 1 consisted of a single- family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. On May 1, 1999, the boss moved into the house on lot 1. One year later, the co-worker and the boss executed and delivered the following deed instrument to a neighbor \". . . hereby grant to (the neighbor) the northerly 30 feet of lot 1, consisting of the paved driveway now existing, to be used for the ingress and egress of motor vehicles, but should (the neighbor) or his heirs and assigns use said property for any other purpose, all the rights, privileges, and immunities herein granted shall cease and determine. \" In consideration for the said deed, the neighbor paid the co-worker and the boss $2,000 (which they divided equally). The deed was never recorded by the neighbor. Because the boss didn't own a car, she never used the driveway. Similarly, the neighbor never used the driveway because he unexpectedly had his driver's license suspended shortly after executing the above instrument. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. Following her mother's death, the daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. On June 1, 2001 the neighbor sold lot 2 to a professor by a deed that contained no mention of the driveway located on lot 1. The neighbor and the professor assumed that the latter had the right to use the driveway, so they didn't insert any recitations in their deed instrument regarding the driveway. Immediately upon her taking possession of the premises, the daughter began to use the driveway on lot 1. Consequently, she objected to the professor's use of the driveway. After the daughter refused to permit the professor to use the driveway, he brought suit to determine his right to continue use of the driveway. The professor should\n\nA. win, because he acquired an implied easement to use the driveway as owner of the dominant tenement.\nB. win, because the neighbor's easement to use the driveway was conveyed to the professor.\nC. lose, because the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied.\nD. lose, because the neighbor's non-use of the driveway effectuated an abandonment of the easement.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The professor should win, because he acquired an implied easement to use the driveway as owner of the dominant tenement.\n\nAn implied easement arises when there is a necessary and reasonable use of land by one person that benefits another piece of land. In this scenario, the professor, being the owner of the lot 2, has a necessary and reasonable need for access to the driveway on lot 1 since he doesn't have direct access to his property. \n\nThe neighbor's deed to the daughter only transferred ownership of the driveway to her, but did not restrict the professor's use of the driveway, which is part of the neighboring lot 1. Since the professor and the neighbor assumed that the professor would have access to the driveway when the neighbor sold lot 2 to the professor, the professor can argue that he has an implied easement over the driveway.\n\nMoreover, the neighbor's failure to record the deed did not affect the professor's rights under the doctrine of notice. The professor would have been on constructive notice of the neighbor's claim through the deed, even if it was not recorded, since he was aware of the neighbor's interest in the driveway when purchasing lot 2.\n\nTherefore, the professor has a valid case for an implied easement and should win the lawsuit against the daughter who refuses to allow him to use the driveway."
