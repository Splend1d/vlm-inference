An abuse of this power in order to wage state-interested wars.\n\nCritics of humanitarian intervention often express concern that the right to intervene could be misused by powerful nations to further their own geopolitical interests rather than genuine humanitarian concerns. This fear is based on historical instances where large countries have been accused of intervening under the guise of protecting human rights but with ulterior motives, such as securing resources or weakening rivals. The potential for selective enforcement based on national interest, rather than a universal commitment to human rights, is a significant worry for many critics."
