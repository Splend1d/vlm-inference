Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following intellectual hallmarks of the Renaissance seem most in conflict with the questioning of the ancient philosophers, such as Aristotle, through experimentation in natural philosophy?\n\nA.

Ar\u00eate\n\nAr\u00eate ( or \"excellence\" in Greek philosophy, particularly associated with Aristotle, emphasized living a virtuous life and achieving moral excellence. It was focused on ethics, virtue, and the human condition rather than empirical investigation or scientific inquiry. The questioning of ancient authorities through experimentation in natural philosophy represents a shift towards a more empirical, observational, and scientific approach to understanding the world, which contrasts with the Aristotelian emphasis on ethical and philosophical virtues.\n\nHumanism, secularism, and individualism are all aspects of the Renaissance that promoted a more human-centered, worldly, and personal approach to knowledge and life, but they do not necessarily conflict with the questioning of ancient philosophers through experimentation. These ideas supported a more open-minded and empirical exploration of the world, which was in line with the scientific revolution that sought to apply systematic methods to the study of nature."
