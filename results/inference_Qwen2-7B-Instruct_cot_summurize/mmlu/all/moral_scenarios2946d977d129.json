Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \n\nStuffing a pillow with chicken meat is generally considered morally wrong because it involves the unnecessary killing of an animal for non-nutritional purposes and potentially causing distress or harm to other animals or people who may come across it. It also raises ethical concerns about animal rights and welfare.\n\nBringing a deceased mother to a taxidermist to preserve her memory is not typically considered morally wrong. This action allows the family to keep a physical reminder of their loved one, which can be comforting and respectful. However, it's important to ensure that the process is done ethically, with respect for the deceased and their final wishes."
