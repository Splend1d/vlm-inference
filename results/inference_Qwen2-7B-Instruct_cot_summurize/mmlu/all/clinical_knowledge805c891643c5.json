It is best to test vibration sense with a 256 Hz tuning fork.\n\nVibration sense is best tested using a tuning fork at around 128-256 Hz, and 256 Hz is considered ideal for this purpose. This is because at this frequency, the vibration can be detected by the hair cells in the cochlea without causing them to move significantly, which allows for an accurate assessment of the vibratory sensation.\n\nA. It is not acceptable to test pain with a venepuncture needle during a sensory assessment. The aim is to assess the patient's sensory perception, not to cause pain.\nB. Proprioception, or the sense of body position and movement, is not appreciated via the same tracts as light touch. Proprioception is processed through the spinothalamic tract, while light touch is processed through the gracile and cuneate fasciculi.\nD. Impulses for pain actually travel primarily down the spinothalamic tract, not the dorsal columns. The dorsal columns are involved in transmitting touch, proprioception, and light touch information."
