Different natures of the adversaries complicate the use of Western coercion. Their tendency to rely on irregular or asymmetric military strategies makes it hard to threaten or even defeat their opponent's military strategy. Those actors deny forces the ability to win quickly with little cost.\nB. Increased verification capabilities brought in with the technological and communication revolution have resulted in a practical difficulty for practitioners, enabling the verification of tactical/temporary and strategic/lasting - only the latter of which constituting a compliance success. The capacity to verify processes have highlighted instances of non-compliance following inconclusive coercive diplomacy exchanges.\nC. Coalitional coercive diplomacy is the only credible means for Western democracies to gain the sincerity required to make a threat of force real in the mind of the adversary. However, past efforts of coalitional building have proved to be extremely limited. Disagreements over the means and coordination of the policy often result in splits and consequently states are reluctant to employ it. Where it has been employed it collapses under the weight of its own inadequacy.\nD. All of these options.\n"

All of these options.\n\nLet's delve into each of these issues:\n\nA. **Adversaries' Asymmetric Strategies**: The West often faces adversaries that employ unconventional tactics, such as cyber warfare, irregular warfare, or terrorism. These strategies can be difficult to counter effectively because they operate outside traditional military frameworks. For instance, a cyber attack can be highly disruptive without leaving physical evidence, making it challenging to attribute blame accurately and respond appropriately. Moreover, adversaries might not be deterred by conventional military threats since their primary goal might not involve direct confrontation but rather to achieve their objectives through indirect means.\n\nB. **Verification Challenges**: With advancements in technology and communications, adversaries can now more easily conceal their actions and maintain plausible deniability. This makes it difficult for Western powers to verify compliance with demands, especially when dealing with non-state actors or those operating in hostile environments. Without clear, verifiable outcomes, the effectiveness of coercive diplomacy diminishes. For example, if a state claims to have dismantled a weapons program, it might be hard for external observers to confirm this without intrusive inspections, which might be rejected by the state in question due to sovereignty concerns.\n\nC. **Coalitional Coercive Diplomacy**: Building a coalition for coercive diplomacy can be politically complex and fraught with challenges. Different countries within a coalition might have varying interests, capabilities, and levels of commitment, which can lead to disagreements over strategy, resources, and the timing of action. Past experiences, such as the difficulties encountered in forming effective coalitions for interventions like the Iraq War, illustrate the complexity. These divisions can weaken the coalition's stance and reduce its credibility in the eyes of the adversary. Additionally, maintaining unity among coalition members over extended periods can be difficult, leading to potential collapse of the effort.\n\nIn summary, these issues collectively present significant challenges to the successful application of coercive diplomacy in Western contexts, requiring careful consideration of strategy, adaptation to adversaries' tactics, overcoming verification hurdles, and navigating the complexities of international cooperation."
