It indicates that for every 1 mL of the solution, there is 1 mg of adrenaline. \n\nLet's convert this to other units to compare with the options provided:\n\n- **A. 1 mg/mL** This is already the same as \"Adrenaline 1 in 1000,\" so it matches perfectly.\n- **B. 1 mg/L** There are are 1000 mL in 1 L, so if you have 1 mg/mL, it would be equivalent to 1 mg * 1000 mL/1 L = 1000 mg/L. This doesn't match \"Adrenaline 1 in 1000.\"\n- **C. 1 g/mL** There are are 1000 mg in 1 g, so this would be equivalent to 1000 mg/mL, which is not the same as \"Adrenaline 1 in 1000.\"\n- **D. 100 micrograms/mL** Since 1 mg = 1000 micrograms, 1 mg/mL equals 1000 micrograms/mL. This also does not match \"Adrenaline 1 in 1000.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. 1 mg/mL."
