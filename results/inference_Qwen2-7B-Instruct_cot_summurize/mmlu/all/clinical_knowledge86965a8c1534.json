                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.\n\nWhen you engage in intense activities like multiple sprints, your muscles use up their energy stores very quickly. They primarily use ATP ( Adenosine Triphosphate for energy, and when it's depleted, they break down ADP ( Adenosine Diphosphate to regenerate ATP. This process generates metabolic byproducts such as ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid. \n\nDuring high-intensity exercise, the production of these substances increases significantly, which can lead to an accumulation in the blood if not properly managed. Uric acid, for instance, is a byproduct of purine metabolism and its levels can rise due to increased activity. Hypoxanthine is another product involved in the breakdown of purines and can also accumulate. Ammonia, while typically removed by the liver and excreted through the kidneys, can also build up in the blood under high-intensity exercise conditions. \n\nIt's important to note that while this can occur, the body has mechanisms to manage these byproducts and prevent them from causing harm. For example, the liver can convert ammonia into urea, which is less harmful and easier to excrete, particularly during rest periods between sprints. \n\nTherefore, options B, C, and D do not accurately reflect the byproducts of ADP degradation during multiple sprints, whereas option A does correctly include ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid."
