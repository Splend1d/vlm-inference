This is often referred to as the \"bystander effect.\" When individuals know who else is around and recognize specific people, they are more likely to take action when someone needs help. Therefore, decreasing anonymity can encourage more helping behavior by increasing the sense of personal responsibility and connection to the community.\n\nB. Initiating programs to raise the self-esteem of community members can also contribute to an increase in helping behavior, but it is not as directly effective as reducing anonymity.\n\nC. Diffusing responsibility among all members might initially seem like it could encourage more helping behavior, but it can actually have the opposite effect. If everyone believes that someone else will take care of the situation, then no one takes action, resulting in decreased helping behavior.\n\nD. Increasing the number of individuals in the community does not necessarily lead to an increase in helping behavior. In fact, it can sometimes decrease the likelihood of helping because the presence of more people can make individuals feel less personally responsible for taking action."
