The external view and the internal view.\n\nThe external view refers to the idea that the meaning of life is determined by factors outside of oneself, such as societal norms, cultural values, or cosmic order. This perspective often looks to institutions like religion, politics, or science for guidance on what gives life purpose.\n\nThe internal view, on the other hand, suggests that the meaning of life comes from within, derived from personal experiences, emotions, and desires. This viewpoint emphasizes individual agency and subjective experiences in finding meaning in life, often through personal growth, relationships, or self-fulfillment."
