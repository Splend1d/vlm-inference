By crossing the placenta early in pregnancy and infecting the foetus\n\nRubella, also known as German measles, is a viral infection that can cause severe birth defects if a pregnant woman contracts it during the first trimester ( particularly between 1-5 weeks after conception when the fetus is forming its major organs. The virus can cross the placenta and infect the developing embryo or fetus, leading to a range of abnormalities collectively known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS. This includes hearing loss, vision problems, heart defects, and developmental delays. \n\nThe other options listed do not accurately describe how rubella causes fetal abnormalities:\n\nB. Rubella does not \"only infect the placenta\"; rather, it can infect the fetus directly through the placenta.\n\nC. Inducing cytokines and chemokines in the mother is a part of the body's response to the infection, but this is not how rubella directly causes fetal abnormalities.\n\nD. While fever and other symptoms may occur in a pregnant woman with rubella, these do not necessarily lead to specific fetal abnormalities on their own. It is the direct infection of the fetus by the virus that leads to CRS."
