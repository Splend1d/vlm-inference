                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The atmosphere on Mars is indeed too thin to trap a significant amount of heat. Mars has an atmosphere, but it is much thinner and less dense than Earth's. This means that it contains fewer greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are necessary to absorb and re-emit infrared radiation and thus trap heat in the planet's atmosphere. Without sufficient greenhouse gases or a thick enough atmosphere to retain them, Mars cannot maintain a substantial greenhouse effect, leading to extremely cold temperatures on its surface."
