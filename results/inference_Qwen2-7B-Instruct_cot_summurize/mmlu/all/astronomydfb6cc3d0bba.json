It does not have a metallic core.\n\nThe presence of a metallic core is crucial for generating a planet's magnetic field through the dynamo effect, which involves the motion of conductive liquid metal in the outer core. Venus lacks this feature due to its solid iron-nickel core, which prevents the necessary fluid motion required to generate a strong magnetic field. This is one of the reasons why Venus does not possess a strong magnetic field comparable to Earth's."
