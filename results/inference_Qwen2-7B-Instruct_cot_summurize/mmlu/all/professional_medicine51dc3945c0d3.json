Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?\n\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting\nB. Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy\nC. Do endotracheal intubation\nD. Do upper endoscopy\n"

Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy.\n\nThe patient presents with symptoms of severe gastrointestinal bleeding (bright red blood vomitus) and hypotension (blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg), which indicates a significant loss of blood volume and potential shock. Immediate management should focus on stabilizing the patient's hemodynamic status.\n\nVasopressin therapy can help by constricting blood vessels and increasing blood pressure, which can slow down the bleeding and improve perfusion to vital organs. It is often used in cases of upper GI bleeding where there is a high risk of continued or recurrent bleeding.\n\nWhile the other options may be considered as part of the long-term management plan:\n- A. Transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunt ( (TIPS) is typically reserved for patients who have failed medical management of bleeding esophageal varices.\n- C. Endotracheal intubation might be necessary if the patient becomes severely compromised and requires mechanical ventilation, but it is not the first line of treatment for hemorrhagic shock.\n- D. Upper endoscopy could be useful for direct visualization of the source of bleeding and potentially stopping it, but it is not indicated immediately upon presentation when the patient is in shock.\n\nTherefore, given the clinical context, initiating intravenous vasopressin therapy is the most appropriate immediate management step."
