The altitude of the NCP is the same as your latitude.\n\nThe north celestial pole appears to move slowly across the northern sky due to Earth's axial precession, but its position relative to the observer on Earth varies with latitude. At the equator, the NCP is very low in the sky and near the horizon, while at the North Pole, it is directly overhead. Therefore, by measuring the angle between the NCP and the horizon (the altitude, or zenith distance, of the NCP, you can determine your latitude. Specifically, this angle will be equal to your latitude."
