The cultivation of rice is considered to be a significant factor in the development of the Third Agricultural Revolution, which occurred during the Neolithic period. This revolution was characterized by the domestication of plants and animals, leading to the establishment of permanent settlements and the rise of early civilizations. The cultivation of rice in Asia, particularly in China and India, played a crucial role in supporting these developments due to its high yield and adaptability to various climates."
