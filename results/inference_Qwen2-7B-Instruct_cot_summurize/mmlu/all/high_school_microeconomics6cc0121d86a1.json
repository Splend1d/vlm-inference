The key factor here is the elasticity of demand within each market segment.\n\nA. This statement is incorrect. Market segments with relatively elastic demand (not relatively inelastic demand - pay lower prices under price discrimination strategies. This is because if a firm raises prices significantly above what an elastic demand segment would consider fair, it risks losing a substantial portion of that segment's sales to competitors or to substitutes.\n\nB. This statement is correct. Market segments with relatively inelastic demand pay higher prices under price discrimination strategies. Since these consumers are less sensitive to price changes, they will continue purchasing even if prices rise, allowing the firm to charge more without losing many sales.\n\nC. This statement is not necessarily true. Consumer surplus can either increase or decrease depending on how effectively the firm practices price discrimination. If done well, consumer surplus could increase for some segments and decrease for others, but overall it depends on the specifics of the market structure and the pricing strategy.\n\nD. Demand being horizontal has nothing to do with price discrimination. Horizontal demand simply means that the quantity demanded does not change with price ( which is characteristic of perfectly inelastic demand. Price discrimination exploits differences in demand elasticity across different segments, not uniformity.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. market segments with relatively inelastic demand pay lower prices"
