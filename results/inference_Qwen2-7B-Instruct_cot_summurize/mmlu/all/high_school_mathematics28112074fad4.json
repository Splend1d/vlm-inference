                    "text": "To determine the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves, we need to consider both the total number of available computers that function and the constraints of the problem.\n\nGiven:\n- There are 20 computers in total, but 2 do not work, leaving us with \\(20 - 2 = 18\\) working computers.\n- Each computer can have at most 2 students using it simultaneously.\n- Mr. Cleary's class has 14 students.\n- Ms. Ntuala's class has 12 students.\n\nWe aim to maximize the number of students who get a computer to themselves under these constraints.\n\n**Step 1: Distribute Computers Based on Maximum Usage**\nSince each computer can hold up to 2 students, the maximum number of students that can be accommodated at once is \\(18 \\times 2 = 36\\). However, we have a total of \\(14 + 12 = 26\\) students across both classes.\n\n**Step 2: Optimal Allocation for Maximum Solo Usage**\nTo maximize the number of students with a computer to themselves, we should first try to pair as many students as possible with others while ensuring some students can use computers alone. \n\nIf we allocate all computers to pairs, we would initially think of having \\(18 / 2 = 9\\) pairs, accommodating 18 students. This leaves us with \\(26 - 18 = 8\\) students without a computer if we strictly follow this approach.\n\nHowever, our goal is to maximize solo usage, not just pairing. To achieve this, we should consider how to efficiently distribute the students across the computers to allow for the most to have their own computers.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- **Maximize Solo Usage:** First, let's see how many students can be allocated solo. Since each computer can have 2 students, and we have 18 computers, the best way to maximize solo usage is to alternate between solo and paired usage.\n\n**Implementation:**\n- **First Round ( (Solo & Paired):** We can start by allocating as many computers to solo usage as possible. With 18 computers, we can allocate 9 computers to solo usage ( (allowing 9 students to have a computer to themselves) and the remaining 9 computers for paired usage.\n- **Second Round:** After allocating 9 solo and 9 paired, we have 15 students accounted for ( (9 solo + 6 pairs). The remaining 11 students cannot all be paired without exceeding the computer limit, so we need to adjust our strategy to ensure the maximum number of students have a computer to themselves.\n\n**Optimized Approach:**\n- **Allocate Solo Usage:** Start by allocating as many computers as possible to solo usage. With 18 computers, allocating them to solo usage allows for 9 students to have a computer to themselves.\n- **Allocate Remaining Students:** After allocating 9 computers to solo usage, we have 9 computers left for paired usage. These 9 computers can accommodate 9 pairs, or 18 students when considering the constraint that each computer can only have 2 students. However, since we've already allocated 9 students solo, we're looking at maximizing the number of students who can have a computer to themselves.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the constraints and aiming to maximize the number of students who have a computer to themselves, the optimal strategy involves starting with solo usage. Allocating 9 computers to solo usage ensures that 9 students have a computer to themselves. Any further allocation towards solo usage would require taking away from the potential for paired usage, which doesn't increase the total number of students with a computer beyond what we can achieve through pairing alone within the given constraints.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves, given the constraints and aiming for optimization, is **9**.\n\nThe correct answer based on the provided options and the detailed reasoning is not directly listed, indicating a misalignment between the question's options and the calculated outcome. However, interpreting the spirit of the question, aiming to maximize individual usage:\n\n**Correct Answer (Based on Calculation and Options Provided:**\n- **A. 2** does not match the calculated outcome.\n- **B. 6** also does not directly match, suggesting a misunderstanding in the question's options or an error in aligning the options with the solution path.\n- **C. 1** 10** exceeds the calculated maximum based on the problem's constraints.\n- **D. 1** 14** does not match the calculated maximum either.\n\nGiven the options and the detailed explanation, there seems to be a discrepancy in aligning the provided choices with the calculated outcome. The correct interpretation based on the detailed reasoning process would suggest aiming for maximizing individual usage, which, under the strict conditions provided, leads to a scenario where 9 students can have a computer to themselves. However, none of the options exactly match this conclusion. The closest option to the calculated"
