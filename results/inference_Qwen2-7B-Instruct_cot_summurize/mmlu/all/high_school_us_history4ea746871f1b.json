Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.

Board of Education, 1954, was a landmark ruling by the United States Supreme Court that declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. This decision overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. As a result of this ruling, efforts to desegregate public schools began, which faced significant resistance from many Southern states and communities. This resistance often manifested in violent protests, boycotts, and legal challenges, leading to social conflicts and tensions across the region."
