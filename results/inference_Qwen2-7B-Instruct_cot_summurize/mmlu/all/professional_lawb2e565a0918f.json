Under the Secretary's interpretation, the new brochures contained obscene photographs and sexually suggestive language. The Secretary was acting under authority given to him by Section 1123(b) of state statute, which provided:\"Whenever the Secretary of Commerce shall determine that a commercial mailing to residents of the state is inappropriate for minors, the Secretary shall have the authority to prohibit such mailing. \"The case reached the highest court in the state, which held that the statute was unconstitutional, being in violation of both the commerce clause and the supremacy clause. If this case is reviewed by the U. S. Supreme Court, it will reach that court\n\nA. by appeal.\nB. by certiorari.\nC. if five justices vote to review it.\nD. despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds.\n"

The Court does not automatically hear every case that comes before it; instead, it selectively chooses cases that it deems important or significant for various reasons, including potential conflicts with existing law, issues of national importance, or precedential value. \n\nIn the scenario described, if the state supreme court ruled the statute unconstitutional based on the commerce clause and the supremacy clause, and if the issue is considered significant enough by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court might grant \"certiorari\" to review the case. This would allow the U.S. Supreme Court to consider whether the state supreme court's decision align with federal constitutional principles, potentially overturning or affirming the state court's ruling."
